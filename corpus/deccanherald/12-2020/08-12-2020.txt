Proprietors of many business establishments on the main roads in the city downed the shutters voluntarily in support of the bandh in the morning. Due to the rasta roko staged by All India Trade Union Congress, you Centre of Indian Trade Union, Aam Aadmi Party, Janasakthi Raitha Sangha &  Hasiru Sene near KSRTC bus terminal, the movement of buses was disrupted. The agitators stopped the bus heading towards Chitradurga and asked passengers to get off. People who had to go to far off places were the worst affected as they did not get buses in time. Farmers burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Hadadi Road in the City to express their ire against the Centre. Zilla Panchayat member and farmer leader Tejaswi Patel distributed food packets to people and said, those who eat food must support the bandh. Pro-Kannada organisations staged a protest at Jayadeva Circle in the City and raised slogans against the Centre. Members of District Congress Committee also staged a protest holding empty cups and plates at Jayadeva Circle in the City. Members of farmers association, pro-Kannada organisations staged a rasta roko from 7:00 am disrupting the movement of vehicles in general and KSRTC buses in particular. So, motorists had a tough time. Speaking on the occasion, KPCC Spokesperson D Basavaraj said, the Modi-led government in the Centre has implemented three farm laws against the interests of the farming community. It is unfortunate that the Centre is not keen on holding discussions with the agitating farmers. Water cannons were fired on the agitating farmers in Delhi. Congress strongly condemns it and demands the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/davangere/davangere-gets-good-response-for-bharat-bandh-924997.html
08-12-2020||First Edit||Government needs to keep prices in check||It was no surprise that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would maintain the status quo on interest rates at its December meeting. Retail inflation has been rising for the past few months and stood at 7.6% in October, well above the RBI’s comfort zone. The MPC’s inflation-targeting mandate prompts it to act when the rate goes above 6%. It has persisted with an accommodative stance now as boosting growth is to be given the priority, and the decision was unanimous. There is some concern over the outlook on inflation. The RBI thinks it will remain at 6.8% in the third quarter and will stay in the 4.6-5.2% range in the first half of next year. This is higher than its earlier predictions, but still it has refrained from taking recourse to liquidity management to contain inflation.     The RBI is aware of the risks of higher inflation but has given a rationale for adopting a  dovish stance. Apart from food prices, core inflation is also inching up. But the RBI has thought that much of the present inflationary situation is caused by supply side issues, high margins of retailers and indirect taxes. It hopes that the arrival of the khalif crop in the market would ease the pressure. Retail margins are likely to reduce when supply links are restored. Consumer spending may increase in due course. There are conflicting interests and signals in the present situation but the message from the commentary of Governor Shaktikanta Das is that support for growth will continue to get priority. Since the present environment is special, the implication is that the RBI has to creatively adjust its policy to suit the requirements of the situation which is evolving.    Most central banks in the world have adopted similar policies. There is, in fact, a signal also that there may not be any more rate cuts in the coming few quarters, and the likelihood that the rates are at the bottom may give some assurance to the market. This will also ensure that the government’s borrowing programme will not be affected in the coming months. The economy is still in a bad shape in spite of the slight uptick being seen now. The RBI now has a slightly more optimistic view of growth and has put the contraction in GDP for the full year at 7.5%, up from its October policy forecast of 9.5%. It also expects the growth to turn mildly positive in the second half of the year. The RBI is helping the government in its efforts to spur growth. In its turn, the government should do its best to keep the prices in check.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/government-needs-to-keep-prices-in-check-924682.html
08-12-2020||In Perspective||We are all narcissists now||Recently, a Facebook friend of mine posted a picture of her mother who passed away after a prolonged illness. The tsunami of response in the form of ‘likes’ (here, it means sympathy and condolence) and ‘comments’ was simply overwhelming. It made me wonder whether most of those who responded to this post really knew him, and for that matter, his mother, personally.  Though the news saddened me, I was still not quite comfortable with the idea of responding, like others, to this post. Would another pavlovian response in the form of ‘RIP’ from me have made any difference to my friend whom I have never met or talked over the phone? It looked as if grief these days, which should remain strictly private, is up for grabs. Facebook and, for that matter, social media, are increasingly becoming a platform where people are developing an insatiable appetite for visibility by any means. We are drawn to it like a moth to the flame; like a psychotropic magnet. Facebook and Whatsapp have brought people closer, albeit in a superficial way.  It has revealed the hidden warts of our behavioural make-up. What is perhaps missing is the spontaneous warmth. The social media has brought out our narcissistic proclivities as never before, and try as we might, we find it extremely difficult to slough them off. We dread anonymity. We want to be noticed, talked about, not to mention a willingness to get our Warholian 15 minutes of fame by posting news/information of our modest achievements.  The need for ‘likes’ has the potential to metastasize into a craving for attention. There is a desperate desire to leverage our identity by posting photographs of honeymoon, family functions, marriage anniversaries, foreign trips, all with the sole objective of garnering ‘likes’, and be flooded with mushy comments. In other words, people long for a “little tumult” or any “agreeable quickener of sensation’’ and social media provides this in abundance.  At the expense of going out on a limb which might offend many of my social media friends, it won’t be wrong to say that Facebook is tempting us to be self-publicists and attention-seekers. Like serotonin, Facebook is turning into a happiness chemical, however fleeting or superficial it may be.  A young lady posts her smiling picture with a rose tucked behind her right ear. It garners more than 90 likes.   A man in his late 40s posts a photograph where his eyes are glued to computer screen with a stack of files on his desk. The text in the post says, “Still busy at work at 8 pm…’’ Overjoyed and overwhelmed by his projected Stakhanovite energy and purported devotion to his work, his Facebook friends click on the ‘like’ button, turning him into an instantly likeable figure.  Then, there is no dearth of Facebook friends posting family selfies in the backdrop of, say, Eiffel Tower or Burj Khalifa which obviously guarantees ‘likes’ you could have never imagined. In the time of pandemic, Facebook is making people more face-conscious like never before. They are sharing pictures of their funny stay-at-home haircut or overgrown beard with sickening regularity, which, predictably, garner innumerable ‘likes’. In short, there is no stopping people from making the private public on social media platforms. Perhaps this vainglory has become a sort of lubricant to keep the machinery of visibility and acceptability running. The very heady feeling of being ‘liked’ acts like a dopamine making one euphoric. Oscar Wilde rightly said, “there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that’s not being talked about.”  Profile pictures However, such narcissistic propensities are not merely limited to Facebook. If one clicks on the ‘status’ of any WhatsApp group, people post their profile pictures at regular intervals to impress their friends and well-wishers. Looking beautiful and attractive is the sine qua non of their online persona.   The social media ecosystem is also characterised by some people’s inveterate tendency to view the world with a jaundiced eye. These opinion-peddlers cultivate an image of Olympian detachment by living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. For them, it’s my way or the highway. Despite having many Facebook friends, yours truly no longer finds this platform stimulating and worth wasting one’s time on. I have stopped sending and accepting ‘friend request’ long ago. My idea of Facebook is not about sharing family photographs and my profile pictures every week, but watching videos and write ups on animals and music. I have a couple of journalists and writers as Facebook friends whose writings are often like gold dust and I read them with considerable interest. This comes as a source of great relief on a social media platform which otherwise mostly celebrates inanity and frivolity over the profound and the meaningful.  I have friends who are happier not being on Facebook and on any other social media. But does that diminish their professional worth and their importance as human beings? Not by any stretch of the imagination.

The election to 106 gram panchayats in Mangaluru, Moodbidri, and Bantwal taluks will be held on December 22, the DC said. Of the 106 gram panchayats, 37 are in Mangaluru, 12 in Moodbidri and 57 in Bantwal taluks.

The ballot boxes have been readied for the election, Dr Rajendra said and added that a total of 2,626 ballot boxes will be used in seven taluks.  The ballot papers will be printed locally as no EVMs were used in the election. Initially, there were 1,400 polling booths in the district. But the number of polling booths was increased to 1,527 as a polling booth should not have more than 1.000 voters in a bid to maintain social distance as under Covid-19 guidelines. A total of 10,39,217 voters are eligible to cast their vote. Among them, women voters outnumber men voters (5,26,288 voters are women voters). There are 21 transgender voters. Of the total polling booths, 397 are sensitive, 199 are hypersensitive and 931 are general polling booths. The voters can enrol their names for the second phase of the gram panchayat elections until December 8, he added. The election will be conducted as per the guidelines issued by the State Election Commission. Exemption for deposit of arms Those who seek exemption for the deposit of arms should apply to the taluk-level committee by December 10. The committee will scrutinise the applications. The exemption will be provided for those farmers who need arms to save their standing crops and those without criminal antecedents, the DC clarified.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/220-gram-panchayats-to-go-for-polling-in-two-phases-924851.html

08-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Normal life not affected in Mandya, Chamarajanagar||Normal life was not affected in Mandya and Chamarajanagar during the ‘Bharat Bandh’, called by the farmers’ organisations on Tuesday. The bandh was limited just for protests. It was expected that intensified protests would be held from the morning in Mandya. But, there was no bandh-like situation even after 11 am. Hotels, shops were open and the roadside vendors were into business as usual. Super markets and showrooms were open. The KSRTC buses and autorickshaws plied normally. However, there was no bus service to rural areas. Though it was expected that the protesters would not allow the buses to leave from the bus stand, no one turned up.  Dalit, farmers’, labour and other organisations gathered near the Silver Jubilee park and took out a protest march till Jayachamaraja Circle. They blocked the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway for a while and staged protest. However, the police ensured that the traffic was not affected on the highway. The protesters submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner’s office. The protest evoked mixed response in Chamarajanagar. The bandh was observed only in the city, while the taluk centres were normal. A few farmers staged protest at Kollegal, Hanur and M M Hills. While a few shops had downed the shutters voluntarily, others were open. But, the protesters asked them to close them and extend support. The BJP supporters did not oblige and continued with their business. KSRTC buses stayed away from roads as the protesters stopped the buses, inconveniencing passengers. A person, who was on his way to Jayadeva Hospital in Mysuru, collapsed at the bus stand. The police, rushed and shifted him to the district hospital for first aid. He was later shifted to Mysuru in an ambulance. Around 30 passengers, who were on their way to Mandya from Coimbatore, were seen stuck at Chamarajanagar bus stand. However, the protesters distributed food packets to them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/normal-life-not-affected-in-mandya-chamarajanagar-925090.html

The mela was limited to a few students and employees of the farm. The Krishi Mela, held every year, was organised in a grand manner. However, this year, amidst the Covid crisis, the officials failed to attract the farming community. Only a handful of farmers and locals participated in the event. The mela is held to introduce new variety of plant species and latest farming techniques. This year too, researches were conducted and new varieties of paddy and ragi were to be introduced to farmers.  Nagaraj, a farmer, claimed that the authorities neglected the farmers this year, citing Covid. "The mela could have been organised following Covid norms like social distancing. If it was not possible, the mela could have been postponed or cancelled," he said. The farmers alleged that there was no proper publicity for the mela this year, and the officials conducted the press meet just a day before the mela. "Besides, the organisers used to arrange bus services to the venue, during the previous years. This year, even that was not done," they complained. A booklet was released and the programme was presided over by Bengaluru Agriculture University Vice-Chancellor S Rajendra Prasad. Former MP G Madegowda inaugurated the Ragi Brahma C H Lakshmanaiah Agriculture Advisory Centre. Deputy Commissioner Dr M V Venkatesh was present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/krishi-mela-in-mandya-fails-to-attract-farmers-925091.html

KSRTC bus services, autorickshaws and other vehicular movement was normal. Hotels, shops, banks and government offices were open. Business was as usual in markets. Weekly shandies too were not affected. Police security was beefed up at temples, churches and mosques, as a precautionary measure. All shops remained closed at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Santhepet. Thus, movement of goods vehicles was affected to an extent. The activists, led by Raitha Sangha district president Babu took out a protest march by dragging the plough on the roads. A few protesters also performed ‘urulu seve’ on the roads. Members belonging to Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, Labour and Kannada organisations, CITU, Dalit Sangharsha Samiti, Hasiru Sene, Raitha Sangha, DYFI, Congress, JD(S), gathered near the Hemavathi statue. They took out a protest march and blocked the road at NR Circle. They also vent their ire, by torching the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Adani.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bharat-bandh-lukewarm-response-in-hassan-district-925093.html
08-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||'Bharat Bandh' receives tepid response in Mysuru||The call for ‘Bharat Bandh’, against amendments to the farm-related Acts, evoked lukewarm response in Mysuru with life remaining largely normal. However, farmers, members of various political parties, pro-Kannada and Leftist organisations staged protests, including a semi-naked demonstration, at multiple locations, while a section of the shops remained closed on Ashoka Road, D Devaraja Urs Road and Sayyaji Rao Road. Some shops resumed business after 11.30 am, while some more shops opened by evening. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, Swaraj India, Dalit Sangharsha Samith and other orgainsations staged a protest from 6.30 am to 9 pm at the exit point of the KSRTC sub-urban bus stand. Thus, bus services were affected for some time. A section of the protesters took out a march from the Gun House Circle up to the Deputy Commissioner’s office, after staging a semi-naked demonstration. A woman fell unconscious, when Congress members were staging a protest in the rural section of the city bus stand. She was shifted to the KR Hospital, by the staff of KSRTC. The cloudy climate and a couple of drizzles encouraged a lazy day, however, people were on the streets as usual. When a long lockdown could not keep the people indoors, will an one-day bandh hinder their movement? asked the policeman. Writer Devanuru Mahadeva, who spoke to media persons, near the DC’s office, said that the Central government has no regard for the Constitution and it is pushing the nation towards destruction. “Agriculture is a state subject, but the Centre neither consulted the states nor debated the Amendments in the Parliament. Since the implementation of GST, the states have become dependent on the Centre and they fear the Federal government. Thus, the BJP has destroyed the entire national fabric,” he said. “To check the farmers from entering the National Capital, the government itself has dug up the roads. Just imagine what would have happened, if the farmers had dug up the roads. The police are caning the farmers, who are feeding them. At least some humane persons in the RSS should tell the government, to mend its ways,” he said. Mysuru district (rural) president Mangala Somasekhar said that the real farmers are not participating in the protests. “Those who are holding protests are striving for the interest of the middlemen and for the political survival of some parties. The amendments, effected by the Centre, are helpful for farmers, protecting them from middlemen. Thus, middlemen and politicians are instigating some farmers and Leftist organisations to stage protests,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bharat-bandh-receives-tepid-response-in-mysuru-925098.html

08-12-2020||Main Article||A bitter battle ahead for Andhra Pradesh, Telangana||After the State of Hyderabad was forced to merge with India on September 17, 1948, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also restructured the dominions of the Nizam. In a couple of years, Hyderabad was merged with the Telugu speaking area of Andhra that had been earlier a part of the Madras Presidency under the British, to create Andhra Pradesh.  It was the first linguistic state in India. The Marathi and Kannada speaking dominions of the Nizam’s state were hived off and merged with Maharashtra and Karnataka (which were then called the Bombay State and Mysore State). This left the Muslims. The well-to-do and the enterprising migrated to Canada, UK and Pakistan leaving their poorer brethren back home. They stayed back – mostly in Hyderabad city where their population at that time was no less than 50% of today.  Nehru had made a mistake: he had merged two Telugu speaking areas but had not accounted for the fact that language did not make up for cultural homogeneity. Sometimes people speaking the same language are very different from each other. This was the case in AP where people from the Andhra areas very openly looked down upon by folks from the erstwhile Hyderabad state (or Telangana region).  This had to do with the fact that English (those days taken as an indicator of education) was widely spoken by those hailing from the Andhra region while most of the people from Telangana spoke Urdu and knew no English. This is not surprising because Urdu was the language of administration under the Nizam and even the Hyderabad-based Osmania University taught in Urdu.  Things became so bad that a movement for a separate Telangana state began in 1969 and became very intense. Then PM Indira Gandhi managed the situation with great difficulty and defused the movement and made a Telangana leader P V Narasimha Rao (later to be PM) chief minister in what was a compromise. Things remained under control for many decades as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) under cine star N T Rama Rao and later his son-in-law Chandrababu Naidu occupied centre stage. Under them the Telugufication of AP  intensified and in a real sense Hyderabad became a Telugu city. In 1999, prompted by his own woes, K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), then part of the Naidu raj, resigned from TDP and formed the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS). The party had a single point agenda: demand for a separate State of Telangana. It tied up with the Congress in 2004 and after the death of then chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy (who besides being a strong leader was also greatly opposed to the creation of a Telangana state), the separate Telangana movement intensified.  As KCR seemed much stronger and scared by a fast he undertook, then Union Minister P Chidambaram announced on December 9, 2009 (Sonia Gandhi’s birthday) that a separate Telangana State would be created.  But soon it was clear to the Congress high command that KCR had taken them for a ride; moreover, there was great opposition from the Andhra region leaders. Thus, within a fortnight, the Centre reneged on its plans. This was a signal to KCR and his associates to return to the path of agitation. In fact, the agitation intensified and assumed gargantuan proportions. Before the 2014 general elections, UPA chief Sonia Gandhi announced that she was granting Telangana. This step was a reversal of the decision taken by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. In the 2014 elections, KCR swept the field, winning most of the seats in Telangana. The Congress which had been very strong in the Andhra region got wiped out as people took the move to dismantle an integrated AP as an act of betrayal. KCR won the elections. Once in power, K Chandrasekhar Rao became like a neo-Nizam, rebuilt the CM’s residence like a palace and has now demolished the secretariat to make way for a grand building overlooking the waters of the Hussainsagar lake. He seldom goes to the office and lives in his farmhouse. Not many have access to him and this includes many ministers and senior officers of the government. The government is now running on remote, one that is operated by his young son KT Taraka Rama Rao (who is however seen as a smart leader). The KCR government has made many promises to the poor - these include two bed-roomed houses - that have not been implemented. Seeing that KCR has been growing weaker, the BJP decided to re-enter Telangana and challenge the TRS. This would be their major foray into South India. Also, on target is the All India Majlis- Ittehadul- Muslimeen (AIMIM) which represents the Muslims in Hyderabad. Targeting the AIMIM also was born out of the desire to neutralise its boss Asaduddin Owaisi, the energetic barrister who studied in London but now wants to contest elections in West Bengal. His foray in the recently held election in Bihar where he won a few seats, and earlier in Maharashtra, are seen as his strength in garnering votes. The next assembly polls in Telangana will be fought in 2023. But fresh after its good performance in the municipal polls in Hyderabad – where it won 48 seats - up from the previous four - the BJP is buoyant. TRS won 55 seats, down from 99 seats the last time. Though Hyderabad is just one city in a state and this is only a civic election, the BJP sees this as an indicator of things to come.  The BJP leaders say they will change the name of Hyderabad to Bhagyanagar. This is scaring the Muslim population, although Ahmedabad – where the BJP has been in power since 1995 – has not been renamed Karnavati. Name changes have been a recurring demand and very much on the BJP agenda. Here in this southern state, it is a new beginning. And from now onwards to 2023 it will be bitter battle on a new warfront called Telangana.  (The writer is a senior journalist and author based in Hyderabad) (Syndicate: The Billion Press)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/a-bitter-battle-ahead-for-andhra-pradesh-telangana-924683.html

Organised by the Consulate General of India in Dubai in association with the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and Invest India, the two-day event brings several key stakeholders from both the countries on one platform to share their experiences, deliberate on solutions and explore ways to further increase the collaboration in the food security sector. Navin K Choudhary, Principal Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Jammu and Kashmir, is leading the 20-member delegation to the event, which will be attended by around 200 prominent businessmen, investors and representatives of public sector organisations, business enterprises and institutions from both India and the UAE. Addressing the curtain raiser event on Monday, India's Ambassador to the UAE, Pavan Kapoor, said the relevance of food security for both India and the UAE is there to see and it has been further accentuated during the coronavirus pandemic. Majid Aslam Wafai, President of the Jammu & Kashmir Apple Cold Store Association (JKPICCA), said they are in Dubai to explore and understand the Gulf markets as the government of India is keen to see the Kashmiri apple in the Gulf food basket. “We had a very fruitful meeting with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, which was headed on our side by Principal Secretary Navin K Chaudhary. We have received a positive feedback during this meeting and we hope to leverage this to ensure supply to this part of the world,” Wafai told PTI. Punjab’s sports minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi was also present during the curtain raiser event. The summit will see discussions and presentations on food processing, equipment and technology, dairy product development and infrastructure including development of logistics and integrated cold chains, regulatory requirements for imports, investments into food parks, agro-processing clusters, infrastructure development for fishing harbours and showcase milestones by Indian companies in aquaculture, hydroponics, saline irrigation and agritech-vertical farming. India’s Consul General in Dubai, Dr Aman Puri, said food security is a priority area for both India and the UAE and over 200 participants will deliberate on different dimensions of cooperation during the summit, virtually and otherwise. “In the post-Covid world, we should not be thinking of getting back to business as usual. This is the time to reflect, reset and refresh our approach to doing business. We need to collaborate more, leverage technology and maximise productivity and efficiency," he said. Puri said India-UAE partnership in the food sector has immense untapped potential and can further strengthen food security not only in the UAE, but the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, besides increasing food exports from India. "UAE’s investments into food parks and the entire supply chain will improve certainty of supplies and improve productivity and efficiency in the Indian food sector landscape. With this summit, we hope to take this partnership to the next level,” he said. Dr Ahmed Al Banna, Ambassador of UAE to India; Mekapati Goutham Reddy, Andhra Pradesh's Industries and Commerce minister; Juma Alkait, Assistant Undersecretary for International Trade Affairs Sector, UAE; UAE-India Business Council Chairman and Sharaf Group Vice Chairman Maj Gen (Retd) Sharafuddin Sharaf; Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) Chairman Dr M Angamuthu; Invest India MD & CEO Deepak Bagla; and CII Executive Director-FACE Meetu Kapur are among the dignitaries scheduled to attend the event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jammu-kashmir-eyes-gulf-food-sector-924727.html
08-12-2020||National||Farmers' Protest: CM Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest, claims AAP; Delhi Police deny allegation||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday claimed that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was put under house arrest to prevent him from going to the capital's border to express solidarity with Bharat Bandh called by protesting farmers, with Delhi Police denying the allegations as "totally baseless and unfounded". AAP said the police move came a day after Kejriwal visited Singhu border to express solidarity with protesting farmers and his refusal to allow converting stadiums into jails while police insisted that the Chief Minister was free to move in and out of his official residence in north Delhi's Civil Lines. Late in the evening, Kejriwal addressed AAP supporters from his residence and said, "I had planned that today I would go to the border not as Chief Minister but as a common man to express my solidarity with the farmers. I think they came to know about my plan and they did not let me go. If I wasn't stopped, I would have gone & supported farmers in their Bharat Bandh call." The confrontation started on Tuesday morning with AAP fielding its chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj to accuse the police of not allowing MLAs and others to enter Kejriwal's residence. "On the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Delhi Police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest ever since he visited farmers at Singhu border. No one has been permitted to leave or enter his residence and he has not been allowed to meet anyone. When our MLAs went to meet the chief minister, they were beaten and thrown on the streets. The party volunteers were also not allowed to meet," he alleged. Later in the afternoon, Sisodia sat in protest against police claiming that he was prevented from entering Kejriwal's residence. However, Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Satish Golcha said it is claimed in social media and elsewhere that there have been restrictions on the movement of Kejriwal. "I would like to clarify in this regard that these claims are totally baseless and unfounded. There are absolutely no restrictions. The chief minister is doing his normal engagements and there is normal movement. Further he is going out of his residence for his engagements," he told reporters. Earlier in the day, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse tweeted a photograph of the entrance of Kejriwal's residence and said, "this claim of CM Delhi being put on house arrest is incorrect. He exercises his right to free movement within the law of the land. A picture of the house entrance says it all." In the afternoon, Sisodia spoke to the media outside Kejriwal's residence, claiming that he and several party MLAs were not allowed to meet the CM. "Still the police are falsely saying that there is no house arrest. They are doing this because Kejriwal denied permission to convert Delhi's stadiums into temporary prisons to lodge the protesting farmers. They are afraid of Kejriwal and fear that he will come out to support the bandh," he said. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann claimed he was stopped by the police from entering the residence. "We had heard of the emergency, but today we experienced it. I am not being allowed to go in and meet the CM. I am the elected representative and I am not being allowed. The BJP government is rattled and is trying to stop the Delhi CM from showing his support to the protesting farmers," he alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar said, "AAP is constantly doing politics of lies and betrayal. Yesterday, Kejriwal went to Singhu border and he also went to a party in the evening. They are calling resting at home as house arrest," he tweeted with a video. Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said it was a "gimmick". "How can he go out in support of Bharat Bandh when his own government has notified the new farm law? He must be waiting for Amit Shah's permission before leaving his residence," he said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmers' organisations. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws failed to cut ice with farmer groups during the fifth round of talks on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-cm-arvind-kejriwal-under-house-arrest-claims-aap-delhi-police-deny-allegation-924750.html

Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna members stopped the Chennai-Ahmedabad Navjeevan Express at Malkapur station in Buldhana district while protesting against the farm laws. Police detained Sanghatana leader Ravikant Tupkar and his supporters over the incident, after removing them from the rail tracks, an official said. Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Dhule, Pune and Solapur are closed during the bandh. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses are plying as scheduled during the Bharat Bandh, a senior official of the state-run undertaking said. The buses will continue to ply unless there are law and order problems due to the shutdown, he added. The All India Motor Transport Congress, an apex body of trucker outfits, has joined the bandh and has suspended operations on Tuesday. Transportation of essential commodities like milk, vegetables and fruits have been excluded from the bandh, said Daya Natkar, secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Truck Tempo Tankers Vahatuk Sangh. Taxi union leader A L Quadros said taxis are plying in Mumbai as the coronavirus outbreak and lockdown had already hit the sector severely. In Maharashtra, the ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are supporting the bandh. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said people should participate in the "non-political" bandh to support farmers. "People should willingly take part in the bandh. This will show true support to the farmers. This is not a political bandh though several parties have decided to take part in it," Raut said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-farmers-stop-train-in-maharashtra-924756.html

The 'Bharat Bandh', called by agitating farmers' unions against the Centre's farm laws, partially affected the state with private vehicles remaining off the roads, while public transport, including buses and taxis, operating fewer than the usual. In Kolkata, CPI(M) activists along with SFI and DYFI members blocked roads in Lake Town, College Street, Jadavpur and Shyambazar Five-Point Crossing. Roads were also blocked by Left and Congress supporters at Madhyamgram Chowmatha in North 24 Parganas district, Panskura in Paschim Medinipur, Bali in Howrah district, Baharampur in Murshidabad, and Kharagpur as police tried to persuade them to allow vehicular movement. They blocked railway tracks at Jadavpur and Madhyamgram in Eastern Railway's Sealdah section, and Rishra and Bardhaman in the Howrah section. The Left and Congress supporters shouted slogans, denouncing the farm laws enacted by the Centre. In Jadavpur, senior CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty led a rally from 8B Bus Stand along the SC Mallick Road. The ruling Trinamool Congress has supported the shutdown though it has stayed away from enforcing it. Certain parts of north Bengal, where the BJP has called a 12-hour shutdown over the death of its supporter during a rally on Monday, wore a deserted look. BJP supporters picketed before the Coochbehar Bus Terminus and blocked roads at Jalpaiguri, Malda and Mathabhanga, among other places.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-congress-left-supporters-block-roads-railway-tracks-across-bengal-924777.html

All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary Hannan Mollah said the 'Bharat Bandh' is a show of strength by the farmers, and their legitimate demands have found support from people across the country. Agitating farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during their 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm as part of their stir. Emergency services will be exempted during the bandh. "We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes. The nature of these laws are such that amendments will not make any difference. "Today we have called a bandh, and if our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level," Hannan Mollah said. In view of the nationwide strike, the Delhi Police beefed up security at all border points and made arrangements to maintain law and order across the city, including market places. Joining the 'Bharat Bandh' call, some auto-rickshaw and taxi unions took off their vehicles from the roads in the national capital. Kamaljeet Gill, president of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi, which comprises mainly drivers working with cab aggregators, claimed most of its members were on the strike.

Counsellor in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Pratik Mathur said on Monday the international community needed to capitalise on existing programmes such as the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACTA), and COVAX facility to ensure affordable and equitable global access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, while strengthening health systems. "We need to come up with long term strategies and roadmaps to put in place a system to deal with the future pandemics," he said at the UN General Assembly session on 'Global Health and Foreign Policy'. "The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted systemic weaknesses in health systems and vulnerabilities in the capacity to prevent and respond to pandemic threats. We need to address the major weaknesses and gaps to strengthen global coordination to ensure that the world is better prepared to curb the impacts of future health-related crisis," he said. Mathur stressed that nations must address all barriers against access to medicines and new technologies, including through use of flexibilities provided in WTO TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration. There is also a need to strengthen capacity of community health workers, who play a crucial role in covering the last mile in delivery of services, he said. COVAX is one of three pillars of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which was launched in April by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission and France in response to the pandemic. COVAX is the sole global effort to ensure that people across the world get access to Covid-19 vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth and circumstances. The 193-member General Assembly decided by consensus to proclaim December 27 as the 'International Day of Epidemic Preparedness' - a day to highlight the importance of the prevention of, preparedness for and partnerships against epidemics such as Covid-19. President of the General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said the Covid-19 pandemic had cost around one and a half million lives and shown the dire socio-economic consequences of a pandemic. "This is a wake-up call, for greater political commitment and action, multilateral cooperation, and health care solidarity, which are essential, to support global economic recovery and to build back better," he said. So far, more than 67 million people across the world have been infected and over 1.5 million people have died from the coronavirus, he said. India welcomed the resolutions on International Day of Epidemic Preparedness and United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021-2030 tabled in the General Assembly. Mathur told the General Assembly that India had extended medical and other assistance to more than 150 countries to fight against the Covid-19. He said the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, managed by the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, was working rapidly to support projects responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. "India has taken proactive measures from the early stage of the virus spread which ensured that we stayed ahead of the curve," he said. Emphasising that health does not alone mean freedom from diseases but rather encompasses all-inclusive wellness, Mathur outlined the four main pillars of India’s holistic approach towards healthcare. The first pillar is Preventive Healthcare that lays special emphasis on Yoga, Ayurveda and fitness to control lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure, hypertension and depression. Affordable Healthcare makes up the second pillar of India’s holistic approach towards healthcare, he said. In this context, India launched the National Health Protection Scheme two years ago aimed at expanding access to primary healthcare service through Health and Wellness Centers and providing insurance coverage for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to poor and vulnerable families. Currently more than 150,000 Health and Wellness Centers are operational and a total of 126 million health cards have been issued and 14 million people have availed treatments under the scheme. The third pillar is improvements on the supply side and the government has taken several major steps for quality medical education, and for medical infrastructure development, he said. The last pillar is mission mode intervention under which India started the National Nutrition Policy to improve the nutritional status of the people, especially disadvantaged groups, including mothers, adolescent girls and children. India also plans to achieve the target of ending Tuberculosis by 2025, five years ahead of the Sustainable Development Goals deadline of 2030. In order to reach this ambitious goal, India has started implementing the National Strategic Plan and has substantially increased fund allocation for TB control, he said. "The motto of the Government of India, 'Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust' resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind,” Mathur said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nations-must-address-barriers-against-access-to-affordable-medicines-new-technologies-india-at-un-924803.html

"My elder daughter, Babita, has a cold and cough. The other, Sakshi, is very weak. My neighbour suggested that I come here," the 34-year-old resident of Kondli village said. Over the last few days, many from her village have come to the protest site seeking free medical advice. "The doctor has given us a cough syrup and some medicines. They also conducted a test on my younger daughter and gave iron and calcium tablets," Babli said. Bhim Singh from Alipur accompanied his elderly father, Mangat Singh, who suffers from severe knee pain.   "My father's knees hurt a lot and his legs swell up in winters. We heard of free medical camps from someone and came here. We cannot afford costly treatment," Bhim Singh, 41, said. According to Dr Anshuman Mitra from Kolkata-based non-profit, Medical Service Centre, there are around 12 such medical camps operational 24X7 at the Singhu border. Doctors, nurses and paramedics at his camp, Dr Mitra said, examine around 200 people a day. Around 30 per cent of them are from poor families in neighboring villages, he said. "Most of the cases are related to cold, cough, stomachache, skin and eye infection, allergies and general weakness," Dr Mridul Sarkar said. The medical staff has been working round-the-clock. A large number of patients pack the camps in the afternoon. The crowd thins at night, but no one is sent back even if it is 2 am, Dr Mitra said. There have been a few "chronic" cases, too. Dr Davinder Kaur from Social Upliftment Movement India said her team has examined a few patients suffering from heart diseases, hypertension and hyperglycemia. "We generally ask them to bring their prescription along, if they are already taking medicines. If not, we advise them accordingly," she said. Almost all of the medical camps have nebulizers, automated external defibrillators, BP machines, blood sugar testing kits etc. Most patients are aged above 50. They come with complaints of muscle pain, indigestion, acidity, cold and cough, she said. Kaur, who came to the medical camp at 10 am, had already examined 107 patients by 3 pm. "Around 40 per cent of these patients are from the neighbouring villages of Kondli, Singhola and Alipur," she said. A few medical camps, including the one being run by India Youth Congress, have got an ambulance, too, in case someone needs emergency hospitalization. Gaurav Kaushik, a volunteer at the IYC health camp, said a lot of people have been coming to camp from nearby villages for free consultation. "We are happy to help them. Everyone is welcome," he said.    Farmers have been observing 'Bharat Bandh' on Tuesday, the 13th day of their protest against the new farm laws. Farmer leaders had on Monday appealed to their affiliates to not force anyone to observe the shut down against the three recently enacted agriculture-related laws. Appealing to everyone to join the "symbolic" bandh, farmer leaders had said they will block key roads during their ''chakka jam'' from 11 am to 3 pm as part of their stir, which has drawn people from northern states especially Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/singhu-border-protest-free-medical-treatment-pulls-needy-from-nearby-villages-924812.html

Former MP from Kolhapur district and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna (SSS) leader Raju Shetti said the Centre will have to withdraw these laws given the mounting pressure. Earlier in the day, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna members stopped the Chennai-Ahmedabad Navjeevan Express at Malkapur station in Buldhana district while protesting against the farm laws. "Farmers in the country have come together to oppose the new acts cleared by Parliament. The pressure is mounting and the Centre will have to withdraw these acts. The Centre is helping corporates through such acts," Shetti told reporters. Various farmer organisations took out protest rallies in Buldhana, Jalna and Aurangabad. Farmer leader Raghunath Patil criticised NCP chief and former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on his stand on agricultural issues."Sharad Pawar always had double standards on agricultural reforms and farmers' issues. He never backed farmers' interests completely. He had tried to protect the corporates' interests as well," Patil alleged. CPI (M)'s Ajit Navale said that farmers were left without any support system given the passage of the three new laws. "Farmers are highly vulnerable to market forces as well as environmental challenges that affect agricultural production. In such a situation, the creation of laws would benefit corporates more than helping farmers. These laws are unwarranted and should be repealed," he said. The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-centre-helping-corporates-allege-farmer-leaders-924828.html

Protesting farmers have threatened to block key roads and occupy toll plazas as part of their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' to press for repeal of the new farm laws. A senior police office said patrolling was being carried out in the city's market areas, including Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar, to maintain law and order. Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders, claimed transport services and markets functioned normally in the national capital and other parts of the country, and that the 'Bharat Bandh' had no impact on such activities. The waiting time for app-based cabs was found around 4-5 minutes for multiple locations in Delhi and to neighbouring Gurgaon between 10 am and 12.30 pm. Shops near the Tikri border, where hundreds of farmers have been staying for the last 13 days, remained open amid heavy police deployment. Chants of "Jai Kisan", "Humara bhai chara zindabad, Kisan ekta zindabad", "Tanashahi nahi chalegi" could be heard. Calling on his farmer brothers, a BKU leader said, "This is the last leg of our 'andolan', and it is important that we remain disciplined to make our protest successful." More farmers from Punjab and Haryana trickled in at the Singhu border with tractor-trolleys packed with supplies, while those already protesting stayed put at the site, relishing langars and firming up their resolve. "We start each day with renewed enthusiasm and vigour. More farmers are arriving every day. This fight is ours to win," said Rajinder Singh Kohli, a farmer from Mohali. Adil Khan, chairman of APMC Azadpur Mandi, said the mandi is almost closed. "Many wholesale trader associations have joined the 'Bharat Bandh'. Some trucks loaded with vegetables and fruits arrived, but no work is being done there," Khan said. S P Gupta, APMC chairman of Ghazipur Mandi, said the market was open but many traders have closed their shops to support the strike. Trading is negligible because there are no customers, he added. Shopkeepers at Delhi's Sarojini Nagar market tied black ribbons around their arms to express solidarity with the farmers' demand for repeal the new agri marketing laws. All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary Hannan Mollah called the 'Bharat Bandh' is a show of strength by the farmers, and said their legitimate demands have found support from people across the country. Agitating farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during their 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm as part of their stir. Emergency services will be exempted during the bandh. "We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes. The nature of these laws are such that amendments will not make any difference. "Today we have called a bandh, and if our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level," Hannan Mollah said. In view of the nationwide strike, the Delhi Police beefed up security at all border points and made arrangements to maintain law and order across the city, including market places. "The security across the national capital, especially on bordering areas, has been beefed up," a senior police officer said. He said there is maximum deployment of Delhi Police personnel in the city to ensure normal movement of people on the roads so that no one faces any kind of inconvenience. Taking to Twitter, DCP (traffic western range) said, "Tikri, Jharoda Borders, Dhansa are closed for any Traffic Movement. Badusarai Border is open only for light motor vehicle like Cars and two wheelers. Jhatikara Border is open only for two wheeler traffic @dtptraffic." In another tweet, the police said available open borders to Haryana are Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Palam Vihar and Dundahera. On Monday, Bhartiya Kisan Ekta Sangathan president Jagjit Singh Dallewala appealed to farmers to maintain peace and not to enter into any scuffle to enforce the bandh. "The Modi government will have to accept our demands. We want nothing less than withdrawal of the new farm laws," farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-delhi-markets-mostly-open-more-farmers-arrive-amid-tight-security-at-borders-924829.html

Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar also said that aspects like India-specific 5G use cases, and ensuring digital connectivity for those at the bottom of pyramid, or those without access to broadband or smartphones offered a distinct scope for telcos. VIL, with its "long term" commitment and strong track record of investments, is prepared to address the opportunities, he noted. "There are some challenges too, related to tariffs, taxes, levies, spectrum availability and pricing. The government understands these and has come out with progressive National Digital Communications Policy and are driving implementation of this policy. I remain optimistic that with government support, the industry and our company will script India's success story over next 25 years too," Takkar said at the India Mobile Congress 2020. Mentioning about low rural teledensity, he said that it was just 59 per cent against 134 per cent urban teledensity. "Rural teledensity is just 59 per cent versus 134 per cent urban teledensity and 450 million existing mobile subscribers are still not connected to broadband or don't own a smartphone," he said, underlining a strong case for ensuring digital access and opportunities for those at the bottom of pyramid. The other opportunity, he said, pertained to catalysing India-specific 5G use cases, developing innovative platforms and partnership models that will "positively impact" industry verticals such as healthcare, education and smart cities, amongst others. "We are prepared to address both these opportunities, building on our strong network, IT, people capabilities and customer connect," he said. The company will collaborate with existing ecosystem players and vibrant start-ups to drive "this exciting future". "On our part, we have invested USD 30 billion over the years and remain long-term committed to be a partner for Digital India," Takkar said. India is the second largest telecom market in terms of subscribers and has the largest mobile data consumption globally. "This has become possible due to massive private investments in telecom sector over last 25 years. Industry has the right structure with four operators providing adequate competition and innovative services to Indians across the country," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/challenges-on-tariffs-levies-spectrum-price-govt-support-policy-to-drive-success-story-vil-ceo-924834.html

Addressing a virtual event organised by Swarajya magazine, Kant said for the first time, the Centre has carried out hard reforms across sectors, including mining, coal, labour, agriculture, and the next wave of reforms must be pushed by the states. "Tough reforms are very difficult in the Indian context, as unlike China we are a democratic nation. We should not spread our resources too thin, but focus on creating global champions. You needed political will to carry out these reforms (mining, coal, labour, agriculture) and many more reforms still need to be done," he said. It is not easy to compete against China without hard reforms, Kant said. "This government has demonstrated political will to carry out hard reforms," he added. The Niti Aayog CEO stressed that the next wave of reforms must come from states. "If 10-12 states will grow at higher rates, then there is no reason why India won't grow at higher rates. We have asked union territories to privatise discoms. Discoms must become far more competitive and provide cheap power," he said. Replying to a question on protests by farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, against the Centre's new farm laws, Kant said the agriculture sector needs reforms. "It is very important to understand this that MSPs (minimum support price) will be there, mandis will remain...farmers must have a choice to sell their products as they benefit out of this," he noted. On sourcing of raw material for manufacturing electric batteries in India, Kant pointed out that lithium (which is used for manufacturing batteries) is available in large quantities across the world, including Australia. "We don't anticipate any shortage of lithium," he said. On Modi government's 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, he said it is not about looking inwards, but unleashing the potential of Indian companies. The government has identified 10 champion sectors for production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme and these sectors will play a major role in making India a manufacturing hub, and give the country economies of scale, Kant said. "The PLI scheme is going to provide a huge opportunity to these sectors for 4-5 years to export," he added. Noting that India must technologically leapfrog, Kant said it is also important for the country to get into sunrise industries. Kant also noted that there is a need to bring down logistics costs. The country must also embark on sustained and well-planned urbanisation which is the next big driver of growth, he said. Kant pointed out that the government support so far was across 90 per cent of product lines and to 86 per cent of exporters, and yet India's exports were not growing. "We need to create an ecosystem to enable private enterprises to thrive at the global platform," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kant-feels-tough-reforms-hard-as-india-a-democratic-nation-924875.html

Protests and demonstrations were held in Ranchi, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Jamshedpur, Palamu, Dumka, Bokaro, Sahibganj and Pakur but no untoward incident was reported from anywhere, officials said. Director-General of Police MV Rao said that the situation in all the districts was peaceful. All the central government and state government offices were functioning normally in Ranchi, but the 'Bharat Bandh' had an impact on private offices and business establishments. Some private establishments were shut, while more than half were open. Left supporters along with workers of the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal held demonstrations and protests in several cities and towns across the state. There was no significant impact of the shutdown on local traffic in all districts, while inter-state bus services and movement of long-distance vehicles came to a standstill. In Pattabari in Dumka, JMM supporters blocked the road, stopping vehicular movement for some time. In Palamu's Medininagar, Kisan Sabha state executive president KD Singh led a demonstration along with dozens of activists, protesting against the farm laws. Protesting farmers blocked the Kolkata-Delhi national highway at Kishan Chowk in Dhanbad in the morning for an hour, disrupting traffic. Besides, supporters of the Congress, JMM and CPI(M) blocked the National Highway-32 at Randhir Verma Chowk. They burnt tyres to block the traffic but police removed them swiftly. However, operations were normal in the coalfields in the state. Though the trade unions supported the shutdown, Bharat Coming Coal Limited (BCCL) officials said coal mining and dispatch remained unaffected.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-coalfield-ops-normal-inter-state-traffic-affected-in-jharkhand-924881.html

Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana have gathered at various border points of Delhi since November 26 as part of their protest against the Centre's farm laws. Dosanjh, who was last week involved in a Twitter spat with actor Kangana Ranaut, shared a black-and-white picture of farmers sitting on roads protesting, ‘Bharat Bandh’ written atop in bold. "Today is Bharat Bandh #FarmersProtest" he wrote in the caption. Sharing the same photo on his Twitter account, singer-actor Ammy Virk wrote, “#Today Bharat Bandh #ModiYesOrNo." The picture of “Bharat Bandh” was also shared by actor Neeru Bajwa and Gippy Grewal on their respective Twitter handle. Maan said that he will always stand with the farmers. "I have a lot to express but will only say this - I'm always with you and will always stand with you. Long live the farmers," he wrote alongside a photo in which he is hugging a farmer. Singer-actor Harbhajan Mann shared a picture of a farmland with ‘Jai Kisaan’ written over it and a map of India with a lock. "Today WE make history!! Today Bharat Bandh," Mann tweeted. South star Prakash Raj, who has acted in several Hindi and South movies, said the government must address the concerns of the farmers. "Farmers need to be heard... need to be assured… I support #BharatBandh #Istandwithfarmers... will you too #justasking," Raj said. Singer Mika asked the agitating farmers to remain peaceful in their protest. "I request all the #farmer brothers please keep calm and protest, I don’t want some one else do the mistake and then we face the repercussions as a class of farmers ... I’m sure #government will give us the solution.. but please sare shanti hi bana ke rakho (please all of you maintain peace)... sat sri Akal.." he tweeted. Singer-composer Vishal Dadlani said that he stands in solidarity with the protesting farmers. "My solidarity with our farmers, against the stupid, malformed Modi+Corporate "farmer-killer-bills" is absolute. "If a political party says "bandh" I say "screw you". When our farmers say it, I happily stand by them AGAINST politicians who are trying to steal their rights. Clear?" he wrote. Bollywood stars including Priyanka Chopra, Sonam Kapoor, Preity Zinta, Sonu Sood, Riteish Deshmukh, Hansal Mehta and others have extended their support to farmers. The protesting farmers are worried the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjabi-artistes-diljit-dosanjh-ammy-virk-and-others-support-bharat-bandh-924887.html
08-12-2020||National||Researchers find way to harvest water from humid air||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati have developed novel materials that can efficiently harvest water from humid air. The research has also been published in the reputed international journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry. "With increasing water scarcity throughout the world, there have been attempts to collect and conserve water through non-traditional means. Scientists have turned to nature to design ways of water harvesting. "For example, in regions of the world with naturally scanty rainfall, plants and insects have devised ingenious strategies to pull and collect water right out of the air. Mimicking this, scientists worldwide are trying to build technologies that can pull out water from thin air, both literally and figuratively," Uttam Manna, Associate Professor at IIT Guwahati's Centre of Nanotechnology. He said such water-harvesting techniques use the concept of hydrophobicity or water-repelling nature of some materials. "The concept of hydrophobicity can be understood by looking at the lotus leaf. The lotus leaf is water repellent because there is a layer of trapped air between the leaf surface and the water droplet, which causes the droplet to slide off the leaf," Manna added. According to the team, the researchers have used the concept of chemically patterned SLIPS for the first time, to effectively harvest water from moist air. "We have produced a highly efficient water harvesting interface where the fog collecting rate is really high. The researchers have also compared the performance of their pitcher-plant inspired materials to other bio-inspired ideas and have found theirs to be superior in terms of efficiency of water harvesting," Manna said. "Given that more than 50 per cent of India's population has no access to safe drinking water and about 200,000 people die every year due to lack of access to safe water, the inexpensive method for harvesting water from water vapour or fog droplets in air can potentially alleviate the water scarcity issues in the country," Manna added. The team included research scholars Kousik Maji, Avijit Das and Manideepa Dhar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/researchers-find-way-to-harvest-water-from-humid-air-924888.html

The visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel's relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran's top nuclear weapons scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. It is for the first time that an Indian Army chief is visiting the two Gulf nations, officials said The Army chief's first destination will be the United Arab Emirates where he will meet senior military officials and discuss avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation. "General MM Naravane, the Chief of Army Staff has proceeded on a visit to the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from December 9 to 14," the Army said in a statement. According to the official schedule, the Army Chief will visit Saudi Arabia from December 13 to 14. "He will take forward the excellent defence cooperation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and India through multiple meetings with senior functionaries of the security establishment and exchange views on various defence related issues," the Army said. It said Gen Maravane will visit the headquarters of Royal Saudi land force, the Joint force command headquarters and King Abdul Aziz Military Academy. The Army chief is also scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia's National Defence University and address the students and faculty at the institution. In the last few years, India's ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE have witnessed a major upswing. It is learnt that Saudi Arabia is keen to collaborate with India on joint production of defence equipment. Saudi Arabia is India's fourth largest trade partner after China, the US and Japan, and a major source of energy. India imports around 18 per cent of its crude oil requirement from the country. Saudi Arabia is also a major source of LPG for India. Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone. In October, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-gen-naravane-leaves-for-uae-saudi-arabia-924896.html

Taking a swipe at the Centre over farmers' protests, Raut suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union Home Minister Amit Shah can hold talks with cultivators who are observing the Bharat Bandh against farm laws. Speaking to reporters here, Raut said the "non-political" shutdown is receiving support from the people across the country. The ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have extended their support to the Bharat bandh called by famrer unions for repeal of the three agri laws. Raut rubbished BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis' reported comments that the Sena had supported the farm laws in Lok Sabha, saying the Uddhav Thackeray-led party never did so. "There is no politics involved in it (Bandh). There should be none. Forget about the brain, if the government has heart, then the government, be it the prime minister or home minister, will approach and speak to the farmers," Raut said. Asked about Fadnavis' remarks, Raut said, "This is an old issue. We did not support it (laws), never". Raut further said that instead of talking about what happened 10 years ago, the BJP should talk about what is happening now. "The farmers who are on the streets do not have any political backing. The Leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra (Fadnavis) should understand this. The farmers do not have any political flag in their hands. Hence, he should think ten times before speaking as the leader of the opposition," Raut said. He further said Fadnavis will understand the pains of farmers if he keeps aside political considerations and thinks "why farmers are at present ready to face even bullets on their chests". To a question, Raut said NCP chief Sharad Pawar will definitely meet President Ram Nath Kovind along with other opposition leaders on Wednesday to raise farmers' issues. "The President will solve the problem if he has rights. The issue will be resolved if the President can order the (Union) cabinet or the prime minister," Raut said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shiv-sena-never-supported-farm-laws-sanjay-raut-924899.html

Drinking water samples examined from the affected area also showed pesticide presence. The sudden malady, since Saturday evening, has claimed one life and hospitalised over 560 people with symptoms like 3-5 minute-long epilepsy bouts, fainting, nausea, anxiety, and headache. Meanwhile, in a comforting news for the town of over two lakh people, unquiet for three days now, the number of new cases has fallen drastically to 73 on Tuesday. About 250 cases were reported on Sunday alone, alarming the health machinery and the Jaganmohan Reddy government. On Tuesday, officials informed chief minister Reddy about the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tests detecting lead and nickel particulate matter in the blood samples of the patients. Wanting to know as how the Eluru locals were contaminated with lead and nickel particles, Reddy ordered for a detailed study and a comprehensive report on the illness, various tests conducted including on milk, water and treatment offered to the patients for further deliberations and action. “Conduct all the possible tests to establish the actual cause,” Reddy instructed officials, while asking them to be highly vigilant. With high presence of the heavy metals found in the 10 blood samples, 40 new samples of blood and urine were dispatched to AIIMS, New Delhi for further investigation, officials said. Several other premium research bodies like the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) were also roped in by the state government to ascertain the cause of the mysterious illness. NIN researchers collected various food materials like vegetables, fruits, pulses etc from the affected area households. IICT is doing the blood serum chemical analysis. A central team comprising experts from AIIMS, National Institute of Virology, and National Center for Disease Control is also in Eluru scrutinizing the illness. While inspecting water supply channels like overhead tanks, municipal authorities initiated a special drive to ensure proper drinking water supply and sanitation in Eluru. “Our public health and other departments too should probe the matter in depth and find out the reasons,” Reddy said while reviewing the medical care being provided to the victims. Till Tuesday evening, total cases admitted in various hospitals was 561. 450 among them were discharged. A two-member World Health Organization team has also arrived in Eluru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lead-nickel-detected-in-blood-samples-of-mystery-illness-patients-in-eluru-924906.html

The petition by advocate and mental health activist Gaurav Kumar Bansal states that a similar plea filed by him earlier was disposed of by the high court by directing the Centre to treat it as a representation and take a decision on it as expeditiously as possible and practicable. However, till date the central government has not notified the minimum standards, he said in the petition. It further states that under the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 the minimum standards were to be notified within 18 months of commencement of the statute. The high court on October 12 had directed the Centre to treat Bansal's earlier similar plea as a representation and to decide it in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case as expeditiously as possible and practicable. The direction had come after the central government said the draft minimum standards are ready and would be published/notified as soon as they are finalised. In his latest plea, Bansal states there are many establishments in the country which claim they can cure or treat mentally ill people through Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy. "However, these establishments never register themselves with the Central Mental Health Authority or State Mental Health Authority as required under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017.  "Since till date respondent 2 (Delhi government) has neither issued any notification prescribing minimum standards for such establishments nor has clarified whether such establishments shall be treated as mental health establishments, persons with mental illness are finding it difficult to approach such entities," the petition claimed. He also said in his petition that under the Act, every person has the right to make an 'advance directive' which specifies how he/she, suffering from any mental illness, wishes to be cared for and treated or not treated. However, the regulations for specifying the manner of making the 'advance directive' have also not been notified, the plea claims.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-regulations-yet-on-minimum-standards-to-be-maintained-by-mental-health-establishments-pil-in-hc-924908.html

In a letter written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, unions said the government is expecting at least two vaccines against Covid-19, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Oxford's Covishield, to be available possibly in January 2021; and there is a plan to inoculate the frontline Covid warriors including those working in healthcare, police, sanitary workers, etc. All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA), Indian National Bank Officers' Congress (INBOC) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO) have jointly written the letter to the finance minister. Bankers have been providing yeoman service ever since the announcement of lockdown and have continued to provide required banking services, it said, adding bankers have been instrumental in keeping the wheels of the economy moving despite hazards and constraints. Although thousands of bankers having contracted the disease and a huge number of fatalities in the sector caused by the contagion, uninterrupted banking services are being provided by the workforce, it said. "The role of bankers in facilitating sustained and robust growth by implementing government policies and schemes have been appreciated by the Prime Minister and your good office too, on many occasions for which we express our gratitude," it said. "In the above backdrop, we request you to use your good offices to get bankers included in the list of frontline workers so that they can be administered the vaccine in a priority manner and workforce can feel appreciated for the services rendered by them during these most difficult and challenging times," it said. Three leading coronavirus vaccine developers -- Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc and Bharat Biotech -- have applied for emergency use authorisation in India. While Pfizer India has applied to the drug regulator for permission to import its experimental mRNA vaccine for sale and distribution without the requirement for local clinical trials, Serum Institute of India Ltd, AstraZeneca's India vaccine partner, has applied for emergency use authorisation using data from Phase-III trials that were conducted locally, as well as in Brazil and the UK. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has sought nod for Covaxin which is being indigenously developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The applications mean that a mass vaccine effort could be shortly underway in a nation that has the world's second-largest coronavirus caseload.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unions-demand-to-include-bankers-as-frontline-covid-19-warriors-for-vaccination-924912.html
08-12-2020||National||Bharat Bandh: Mixed response in Delhi as businesses, transport services remain largely unaffected||A nationwide strike called by farmer unions against the Centre's agri laws received a mixed response in Delhi on Tuesday with most businesses and transport services operating, even as more protesters converged at the national capital's borders to join the farmers' stir while authorities maintained tight security. Chants of "Jai Kisan", "Humara bhaichara zindabad, Kisan ekta zindabad", "Tanashahi nahi chalegi" rent the air as farmer leaders gave rousing speeches at the protest sites, vowing to continue their agitation. The Aam Aadmi Party, which has supported the Bharat Bandh along with many other opposition parties, alleged that the Delhi Police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Monday, a claim denied by the city police. Amid high drama, scores of AAP workers converged outside Kejriwal's residence while police stopped them and asked them to follow Covid norms. The BJP slammed Kejriwal, accusing him of indulging in "cheap and petty politics of deceit". Police said that there were no major fresh protests in the city except in some Delhi border points, but traffic diversions were made on some routes as a precautionary measure. Protesting farmers had threatened to block key roads and occupy toll plazas 11 am and 3 pm on Tuesday as part of their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' to press for repeal of the new farm laws.   Most of the markets, including Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar, in the city remained open amid group patrolling by police personnel to maintain law and order. However, there were not many customers. Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders, claimed transport services and markets functioned normally in the national capital and other parts of the country, and that the 'Bharat Bandh' had no impact on such activities. "Trading activities were normal in Delhi markets that were open despite the Bharat Bandh. It was business as usual in all the wholesale and retail markets. Transport of goods is also taking place normally," Khandelwal and CAIT Delhi president Vipin Ahuja said in a statement. The CAIT and All India Transport Welfare Association(AITWA) have not been part of the 'Bharat Bandh' strike, Khandelwal said. Also, public transport services in the national capital remained largely unaffected during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ even though some auto and taxi unions kept their vehicles off the roads in support of the shutdown. Kamaljeet Gill, the President of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi which represents drivers working with app-based cab aggregators, claimed most of its members were on strike. "There are around four lakh app-based cabs in Delhi-NCR. Most of our members are on strike," he said. Many users of app-based cab services though said they did not face much difficulty in booking rides. "The waiting time for Ola and Uber was like any other day. I did not have to wait long or face any issues today," said Pradip Dubey, a commuter. Autorickshaws were also easily available on the roads, said some other commuters. Sanjay Samrat, the President of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association, said drivers associated with several unions including those affiliated to Delhi State Taxi Cooperative Society and Kaumi Ekta Welfare Association were on strike. "Our strike in support of Bharat Bandh has been successful," claimed Samrat. The members of striking auto and taxi unions held an 'Akhand Paath' at Bangla Sahib gurudwara praying for the wellbeing of farmers and drivers, he said. However, other auto and taxi unions claimed the strike did not have any impact on transport facilities in Delhi. "All our autos and taxis are running normally and the strike has no impact at all. We support the farmers and their demands, but strike causes problems only to ordinary people," said Rajender Soni, the general secretary of the Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union. Shops near the Tikri border, where hundreds of farmers have been staying for the last 13 days, remained open amid heavy police deployment. Addressing the protesters, a BKU leader said, "This is the last leg of our 'andolan', and it is important that we remain disciplined to make our protest successful." All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary Hannan Mollah called the 'Bharat Bandh' a show of strength by the farmers and said their legitimate demands have found support from people across the country. More farmers from Punjab and Haryana trickled in at the Singhu border with tractor-trolleys packed with supplies, while those already protesting stayed put at the site. "We start each day with renewed enthusiasm and vigour. More farmers are arriving every day. This fight is ours to win," said Rajinder Singh Kohli, a farmer from Mohali. Adil Khan, chairman of APMC Azadpur Mandi, said the market is almost closed. "Many wholesale trader associations have joined the 'Bharat Bandh'. Some trucks loaded with vegetables and fruits arrived, but no work is being done there," Khan said. S P Gupta, APMC chairman of Ghazipur Mandi, said the market was open but many traders have closed their shops to support the strike. Trading is negligible because there are no customers, he added. Shopkeepers at Delhi's Sarojini Nagar market tied black ribbons around their arms to express solidarity with the farmers' demand. Taking to Twitter, Delhi Traffic Police said, "Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari & Mangesh borders are closed. NH-44 is closed. Please take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad, Saboli & Singhu school toll tax borders." In another tweet, it said, "Traffic movement at Ghazipur border in the carriageway from Delhi to Ghaziabad is open and Ghaziabad to Delhi is closed." The AAP targeted the Delhi Police with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia saying that he was not allowed to enter inside Kejriwal's residence. The AAP leader later addressed a press conference outside the CM’s residence. "On the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Delhi Police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest ever since he visited farmers at Singhu border. No one has been permitted to leave or enter his residence and he has not been allowed to meet anyone," AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said. Refuting the charge, Satish Golcha, Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) North Zone said the situation in the national capital is peaceful. "It is claimed in certain sections on social media that there have been restrictions on the movement of the Chief Minister of Delhi. I would like to clarify in this regard that these claims are totally baseless. "There are absolutely no restrictions. The Chief Minister is doing his normal engagements and there is normal movement. Further, he is going out of his residence for his engagements," he told reporters. Anto Alphonse, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) also tweeted a photograph of the entrance of Kejriwal's residence and denied the allegations. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia accused CM Kejriwal of indulging in "politics of lies". "Stop this politics of lies and step out of your house. There are cameras outside your house. Let the entire country and Delhi see whether you're under house arrest or not," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-mixed-response-in-delhi-as-businesses-transport-services-remain-largely-unaffected-924919.html
08-12-2020||National||Covid-19: Advocates, litigants not to be asked to appear physically without consent, says HC||The Delhi High Court has said a litigant or an advocate cannot be asked to appear physically before the trial court amid the COVID-19 pandemic unless all the parties consent to it. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva made it clear that in view of the high court advisories, the parties cannot be asked to appear physically unless it is modified. However, recently the high court has issued a fresh advisory that in case parties do not appear even through virtual mode even after being intimated, the trial court is free to proceed in accordance with law, the judge said. “In view of the above, the trial court is directed to take up the proceedings through video conferencing and not to list the proceedings for a physical hearing unless all the parties consent to the same,” the high court said in a recent order. The order came on a plea where the petitioner was aggrieved by a trial court’s November 23 order directing listing of an over 40-year-old civil suit, relating to a property comprises of a graveyard, masjid and dargah of the revered Sufi Saint Hazrat Khwaja Baqi Billah (R.A.), for a longer date. Advocate M Sufian Siddiqui, representing petitioner Muhammad Ajmal, submitted that the suit was filed as far back as on February 16, 1980 and has been pending since then. He claimed that the respondent after getting interim protection in July 1982, has been delaying the progress of the suit. The submission was disputed by the counsel for the respondent, who was the original plaintiff in the suit before the trial court, and said the progress was delayed as the proceedings had been adjourned sine-die in view of the pendency of another case. The high court, however, said without getting into the controversy and since the suit has been pending for over 40 years, the trial court is directed to expedite the proceedings and endeavour to conclude the same preferably within six months. Siddiqui told the high court that the suit has been listed before the trial court on December 19 for a physical hearing and in view of the present pandemic, it would not be possible to physically appear in the proceedings. He urged that the trial court be directed to take up the suit through video conferencing. The high court allowed the plea and asked the trial court to take up the proceedings through video conferencing and added, “Accordingly, list the suit for directions before the trial court on December 15 to set up a schedule for expeditious disposal as directed.” The plea, in the high court, said the trial court committed an error by not putting the suit which is more than 40 years old on fast track for expeditious disposal and adjourned it to a long date instead of giving a short date, whilst completely overlooking the directions of the State Court Management Systems Committee (SCMSC) of the high court. It referred to minutes of the meeting of the committee where it has been laid down that cases more than 10 years old have to be put on fast track for expeditious disposal and besides short dates other steps would also be undertaken for expeditious disposal. It claimed that the suit property in Paharganj is not a private property and it is a duly Gazette nWaqf property open to general public, which comprises of a graveyard, masjid and dargah of the revered Sufi Saint Hazrat Khwaja Baqi Billah (R.A.). The plea claimed that “the plaintiff society Anjuman Qabristan Dargah Hazrat Khwaja Baki Billah and its purported members are rank encroachers on the same against whom the Delhi Waqf Board has already initiated eviction proceedings” under the Waqf Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-advocates-litigants-not-to-be-asked-to-appear-physically-without-consent-says-hc-924926.html

The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), representing about 95 lakh truckers and other entities, had announced to suspend operations in the country to support the Bharat Bandh called by agitating farmers. "The support by the transport fraternity to the Bharat Bandh call by farmers is successful, peaceful and voluntary," AIMTC Secretary General Naveen Gupta told PTI. AIMTC in a statement yesterday said the transporters in the entire country will halt operations in support of the farmers' Bharat Bandh call. AIMTC's former President and Chairman of its Core Committee Bal Malkit Singh had said that the fraternity will organise peaceful demonstrations and protest rallies at truck terminals in districts. Terming the farm sector as the backbone and lifeline of the nation, the body had said the leaders of transport associations and unions from almost all 739 districts and talukas in the country also came forward and decided to organise peaceful demonstrations under the banner of AIMTC. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for 12 consecutive days at the borders of the national capital against the Centre's new farm laws. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will provide farmers with better opportunities. It has also accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/transporters-body-aimtc-says-support-to-farmers-bharat-bandh-successful-peaceful-924927.html

BJP national general secretary C T Ravi said that the Centre was also ready to amend the laws if specific shortcomings of the legislation are highlighted. "Farmers who know the facts of the law are with BJP," he said, adding that it was wrong to oppose the “honest concern of the central government which is trying to spread the benefits of economic and technological reforms”. Ravi said that the government will not withdraw the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme and claimed that the new legislation has empowered farmers to sell their produce to traders of their choice. Ravi said the introduction of contract farming will add value to agricultural produce and help double farm income. Taking a dig at the protesters, Ravi charged that the stir was politically-motivated. "It is a conspiracy of middlemen. Those opposed to the BJP ideology and separatist forces have joined hands for the protest," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-plans-awareness-yatras-to-mobilise-support-for-farm-laws-924935.html

Here are the top news of December 8, 2020: A nationwide strike called by farmer unions against the Centre's agri laws was underway on Tuesday with rousing speeches and sloganeering at Delhi's border points amid tight security arrangements, even as most of the city's markets remained open. Protesting farmers have threatened to block key roads and occupy toll plazas as part of their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' to press for repeal of the new farm laws. A senior police office said patrolling was being carried out in the city's market areas, including Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar, to maintain law and order. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The government may allow emergency use of Covid-19 vaccine in two weeks, paving way for a much-awaited nationwide immunisation programme, according to report by Mint, quoting sources in the Health Ministry. The officials of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) said that a subject expert panel of Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation is scheduled to meet this week to decide the most suitable vaccine candidate for rollout.     On Tuesday, the UK became the first western country to rollout mass vaccination against the novel coronavirus. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, has become the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine outside of a trial following its rapid clinical approval.

A group of farmer leaders will meet Shah on Tuesday evening, a day before their sixth round of talks with Union ministers slated for Wednesday. "There is no midway. We will demand just 'yes' or 'no' from Home Minister Amit Shah at today's meeting," farmer leader Rudru Singh Mansa said at a press conference at the Singhu border. Mansa claimed the Central government has bowed down before the 'Bharat Bandh'.   Another leader Gurnam Singh Chadhuni said the 'Bharat Bandh' is successful and the Central government now knows it doesn't have a way out. The nationwide shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, added Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav. Farmer leaders said the protestors will not go to Burari ground as it is an "open jail" and demanded that Ramlila Ground be given to them. They added that they don't want to trouble the people of Delhi and Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-demand-yes-or-no-from-amit-shah-when-we-meet-him-farmer-leaders-924952.html

Maersk Edinburgh with 366.5 metre LOA (overall length) and 48.2 metre Beam (width) became the largest ship ever to enter the inner Harbour of Cochin Port. It was reported to be diverted to Cochin Port owing to congestion in Colombo Port. The 2M Alliance vessel was under the US East Coast Service. Cochin Port Trust authorities said the capabilities of the port in handling large ships were once again highlighted with the operation. The DP World run International Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam in Kochi had earlier also witnessed the arrival of many large vessels. Proximity to the international sea routes is one of the highlights of the terminal. Shipping industry sources said there was congestion in the Colombo port and hence there were high chances for more large vessels to come to Kochi. Over the last couple of months, around eight to 10 vessels to Colombo were diverted to Kochi. Cochin Customs House Agents Association president Alan Jose said there was a huge potential for the Cochin Port to attract large ships regularly. Ad hoc operations won't benefit the cargo handling industries here. Proactive measures of all agencies involved were required to tap the opportunity. Cochin Container Carrier Owners' Welfare Association secretary Tomy Thomas said the terminal handling charges of Cochin Port was very high and there was a lackadaisical attitude of certain agencies associated with container handling. Those issues need to be addressed for the port to attract more vessels, he said. A new international transhipment terminal coming up at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram, which is being set up by the Adani Ports in association with the Kerala government, may also pose competition to Colombo Port. Earlier there were reports that as soon as the Vizhinjam Port project work began in 2016, the Sri Lankan government announced discount in handling charges for Myanmar transhipment operations citing that Vizhinjam has high potential to obtain a significant portion from the transhipment handling market of Western India, Pakistan and Gulf region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/colombo-ports-congestion-kindles-hopes-of-cochin-port-as-large-container-arrives-924960.html

While granting the relief to Furkan, Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said that section 436 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was applicable in a case of mischief in respect of destruction of a building, which was ordinarily used as a place of worship, human dwelling or as a place for the custody of property, but the vehicle which was allegedly burnt by the riotous mob was parked at a road. The court further said that besides section 436, rest of the sections under which Furkan has been booked were bailable. Furkan was arrested under Sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 436 of IPC. “From the reading of the complaint itself and the FIR, the vehicle in question, which was burnt by fire, was parked at a road. The same is also depicted in the site plan, where the place of incident is marked as A, which appears to be on the road, though adjacent to a house. Consequently, the applicability of section 436 IPC to the present case is debatable,” the court said in its order. It granted bail to Furkan on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 15,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to burning of a car by the riotous mob in Jafrabad area. The court further said that the prosecution's interpretation, stating that section 436 IPC would be attracted since the burning of the vehicle was adjacent to a residential house which could have caught fire, did not appear to be convincing. “Special Public Prosecutor had argued that section 436 IPC would be attracted since the burning of the vehicle, which was parked, which is adjacent/outside of the residential house, had the propensity to lead to catching of the fire of the nearby adjacent residential house. “This interpretation, at this stage, does not appear to be convincing. However, this issue is not being dealt with in detail as this is only a stage of bail and not charge,” it said. The court, while granting the bail, directed Furkan however not to tamper with evidence or leave Delhi without its permission. During the hearing, advocate Rizwan, appearing for Furkan, said the accused has been falsely implicated in the case and there was no cogent evidence against him. Rizwan further argued that there was no CCTV footage showing Furkan rioting or lighting the car and his mere presence at the spot of the incident was not sufficient to hold that he shared the common intention to commit the offence. He said the prosecution, while mentioning that the accused was involved in four other cases, ignored the fact that most of the offences under which he has been allegedly framed were petty and bailable. Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Furkan and his brother were arrested in the case on October 8 and two more accused were still being traced. Handa said Furkan and his brother could be seen at various times near the vehicle. He further said that the accused can be seen in a CCTV footage which recorded the sequence of events in the service lane behind the scene of the crime. He alleged that Furkan can be seen as being part of the unlawful assembly and picking up stones from an empty plot for the purpose of pelting stones and thereafter walking towards the scene of crime. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-man-says-penal-section-invoked-debatable-924968.html

As the day wound to a mostly peaceful close, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in to call farmer leaders for talks, ahead of the sixth round of talks between Central ministers and farmer representatives on Wednesday. "We will demand just a 'yes' or a 'no' from Home Minister Amit Shah," farmer leader Rudru Singh Mansa told reporters at the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the last 12 days. As analysts, politicians and others assessed how effective the 'bandh' had been, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav claimed it was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states. Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and trade unions, rolled out noisily but peacefully with its impact felt in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests, as well as in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra and Bihar. In several parts of the country, including in BJP-ruled Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded. In other places, the pandemic appeared to recede into the background. Security was stepped up, restive crowds demonstrated in some places and the numbers swelled at Delhi’s border points. Protesters also blocked railway tracks in places in West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. As slogans such as “Kisan Ekta Zindabad” were heard in protest centrepoints such as Tikri and the agitation picked up pace, the hashtag #Aaj_Bharat_Bandh_Hai was trending worldwide on Twitter till late afternoon. From the Rajasthan capital Jaipur, where ‘mandis’ were closed but shops open, there were reports of clashes between workers of the state’s ruling Congress and the BJP. In Delhi, where most main markets were open, tension spiralled with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleging that Delhi Police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest. City police denied the claim but the party stuck to its guns and said the move was a response to Kejriwal meeting protesting farmers at the Singhu border. "If I was not stopped, I would have gone and supported the protesting farmers in their 'Bharat Bandh' movement. I am glad that 'Bharat Bandh' was a success," Kejriwal said. Farmer unions had threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during a 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm. All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah described the shutdown as a show of strength by the farmers. "We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes… If our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level," Mollah said. The protesting farmers fear the new laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety of the Minimum Support Price cushion and do away with 'mandis', leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government maintains the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three farm laws. "Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind," NCP chief Sharad Pawar told reporters. The political faultlines deepened. The BJP, in turn, slammed the opposition parties for its support to the shutdown, saying they are resorting to spreading confusion over issues to "stoke the fire" after being unable to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity. Union minister Prakash Javadekar noted that many states ruled by them had introduced contract farming and criticised their stand against the farm laws and their backing for the 'bandh'. Farmers from Punjab and also Haryana have been the drivers of the movement against the laws. In both states, shops and commercial establishments were closed as were thousands of fuel pumps. Farmers assembled at highways and other key roads in both states since morning. All major parties in Punjab — the ruling Congress, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal -- extended their support. Over 50,000 government employees took mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira. In neighbouring BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, the opposition Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal backed the call. In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed. Railway tracks were blocked in several places and there were sit-ins on major roads. Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters as opposition parties extended their support. Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers' organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore. Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads. Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh were deserted with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away. In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities. Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were closed in many parts of the state. The state government had appealed to protesters to not disrupt public transport services and buses and local trains were unaffected. There was a mixed response in other states as well. In Assam, for instance, shops pulled down shutters, protesters blocked traffic and demonstrations were staged but most offices were functioning. Dozens of protesters were detained, officials said. And in Uttar Pradesh, shops and offices were mostly open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even stopped a train in Allahabad. The ruling TRS and opposition parties, including the Congress and various unions, held protests across Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, the opposition DMK and its allies, including the Congress, held protests across the state but life was mostly unaffected. In the union territory of Puducherry, ruled by the Congress, however, the ‘bandh’ call evoked a near total response. Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. The three contentious laws at the centre of the protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-ends-peacefully-life-hit-in-some-states-as-farmers-take-national-centre-stage-924972.html
08-12-2020||National||Had suggested minor changes in APMC Act; it should continue: Sharad Pawar||NCP president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said the new farm laws brought by the Centre have no reference about agricultural produce market committees but as Union Minister, he had maintained that the APMC Act should stay, though with minor changes. He also hit out at the BJP, saying that by highlighting an old letter, which he had written, it was trying to divert attention. "I have only said there are some provisions of the APMC which require changes. The APMC Act should continue with minor changes and there are no two ways that I had not written that letter. "But there is no reference of APMC in these three (new) laws. This is an attempt to divert attention and this should not be given much importance," he told reporters here. Pawar's NCP is among the parties that have backed Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmers' unions.   Government sources on Sunday pointed out that as the agriculture minister in the UPA dispensation he had asked chief ministers to amend the APMC Act in their states to allow the private sector to play an important role in the field. Sharing the content of some letters he had written to various chief ministers, the sources claimed that the BJP-led NDA government has made the same set of changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act as pushed by Pawar when he was the union minister. The government sources said Pawar in a 2010 letter to the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit stated that the agriculture sector needs well-functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural areas of the country. "This requires huge investments in marketing infrastructure including cold-chain. And for this, private sector participation is essential, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment needs to be in place," his letter said, calling for amending the state APMC Act. In a letter on similar lines to the then Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Pawar had underlined the need for investments in post-harvest and marketing infrastructure from the farm gate to the consumer and said: "private sector needs to play an important role in this regard".  Pawar was the union agriculture, consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister in the then Manmohan Singh-led government. Attacking the opposition, the BJP on Monday said, "Now they are opposing what they had been working to do when in power. This exposes their shameful double standards. This is opposition for the sake of opposition." Pawar said leaders from different political parties will discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind. Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three farm laws. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said a five-member delegation comprising him, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, a representative of the DMK, CPI general secretary D Raja, will meet the president on behalf of the opposition parties. "The five of us will probably meet before we meet the president and finalise our strategy. We have spoken to all opposition leaders and decided our next course of action. "The delegation has been limited to five because of the Covid-19 situation, although we are trying to see if they allow more leaders to join. In that case we have to rush leaders to Delhi as they are mostly in their respective states," said Yechury. On Tuesday, Pawar met Defence Rajnath Singh and discussions were believed to be held pertaining to land acquisition for the Purandar airport in Pune district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/had-suggested-minor-changes-in-apmc-act-it-should-continue-sharad-pawar-924973.html

This is more than 25 per cent higher as compared to the same period of the previous year when the prime minister had 78 domestic engagements, they noted. In these three months of 2020, Modi has extensively used technology to interact with all sections of society, from rural India to investors and from youth to CEOs. He has inaugurated and launched various schemes in rural India, while also participating in virtual summits with international leaders, the sources added. The prime minister participated in 26 programmes of launch or inauguration of some project or initiative between September and November this year. With the government focussing on helping the deprived sections of the society, the poor's welfare was the main theme in his interactions, sources said, noting that Modi interacted with street vendors and also beneficiaries the 'PM Awas Yojana', a housing scheme for the poor. The education sector was another of his priorities as he participated in eight events related to it where he spoke, among other issues, on the National Education Policy, recently approved by the government.  He also participated in four events related to international investors, and there were two virtual meetings with chief ministers of all states on the Covid-19 pandemic. There were 10 international events he attended via video conferencing, which include G20, ASEAN-India summit, BRICS and virtual summits with Italy, Luxemburg, Sri Lanka and Denmark. Noting that Modi attended distinct and diverse events on some days, sources said that on the day he addressed the Mysore University students, he also took part in the 'Annual Grand Challenges' programme of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Similarly, on the day he spoke at the 'SVANidhi' program, which catered to street vendors, in Uttar Pradesh, he also took part in the 'National Conference on Vigilance and Anti-Corruption' organised by the CBI. Again, the day he spoke at the ASEAN-India summit, he also addressed the students of JNU at the inauguration of the Vivekananda statue. The day he launched the drinking water scheme 'Har Ghar Jal Yojna' in Uttar Pradesh, he also spoke at the G20 global summit, sources said. "PM Modi is known to work to a packed schedule even normally and exceeding it during the times of the pandemic is significant," an official said. Officials said that apart from public events, the prime minister's internal meetings have also increased tremendously, as he amped up the frequency of sectoral review meetings to accelerate various projects and reforms. An official said that since most meetings are held via video-conferencing, it saves time for everyone and this has led to more productivity. Modi's internal meetings have also gone up significantly, probably by over 50 per cent, he said. During this period, he also extensively interacted with governors, NDMA officials and reviewed relief operations for various cyclones among other issues. He also held various meetings with senior officials and scientists on India's vaccine strategy, sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modis-public-engagements-up-25-in-sep-nov-in-2020-than-same-period-last-year-924977.html

Addressing a lecture, he said the district collectors who have stood at the frontend in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic have shown maturity and commitment well beyond their seniority, in ensuring that rural societies adopt to the new normal. "The district collectors of India have thrived in taking forward technology for redressal of public grievances. The disposal of public grievances has reached an overwhelming 90 per cent in most states," said Srinivas, additional secretary in the Ministry of Personnel, Public grievances and Pensions and also the director general of National Centre for Good Governance. He said the technology platforms in districts have developed significantly to ensure real time monitoring and high quality redressal of public grievances. "In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has redefined India's governance models. Getting to live with the coronavirus has meant less contact governance, officials having to work in masks and gloves and adoption of work from home policies for nearly 60-75 percent workforce," Srinivas said, delivering 6th M L Mehta memorial oration online on "Good Governance Practices - The M L Mehta Legacy" on Monday. Mehta superannuated as the chief secretary of Rajasthan on December 31, 1997. Srinivas served closely with Mehta in the years 1994-97. Srinivas, a 1989 batch IAS officer of Rajasthan cadre, said there has been a lot of focus on digital decision making in the central secretariat with the virtual offices being enabled through e-office implementation, web-room meetings, file disposal on virtual private networks and work from home policies becoming more streamlined. He said, ethics, morality and efficiency are the foundation on which the ethical superstructure is built, moral courage is needed to go beyond the charter of public duty. "It is important that public service should be built on ethical behaviour and ethical benchmarks should be brought mainstream," the officer said. Srinivas said, the 21st century governance of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) is marked by competitive recruitment, stringent training norms, timely performance appraisal and constant evaluations. "There is emphasis on performance management practices, open, transparent and accountable systems of service delivery. There is increased regulatory oversight by the Central Vigilance Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Central Bureau of Investigation. India's first Lokpal has been appointed and fully operationalised. The accountability levels in government today are far higher than they were ever in the past," he said. Srinivas said, in 2020, Mission Karmayogi represents the government's landmark decision for appropriate training for augmentation of knowledge skills and efficiency. "Built on the 6 pillars of policy framework, institutional framework, competency framework, digitallearning framework, electronic human resource management system and monitoring and evaluation framework, Mission Karmayogi seeks to transform the civil service HR management from rule based to role based and one of continuous learning," he said. The training of civil servants at the various academies will be restructured to include the optimum use of the digital learning platform of iGOT (Integrated online training), he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-pandemic-has-redefined-indias-governance-models-bureaucrat-v-srinivas-924979.html

After Delhi Police denied that the AAP leader was put under house arrest, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia dared the Delhi chief minister to step outside his residence to show if cops try to prevent him from leaving. Had there been even an iota of truth in the Aam Aadmi Party's claim, its members would have put out hundreds of photographs and videos to back their allegations and filed complaints in courts and even United Nations, Bhatia said sarcastically. "The politics of lies, deceit and propaganda being done by Arvind Kejriwal is most unfortunate... I wish to challenge Arvind Kejriwal. Stop this politics of lies and step out of your house. There are cameras outside your house. Let the entire country and Delhi see whether you're under house arrest or not. "You have been doing this kind of cheap and petty politics blaming (Union) Home Minister without an iota of evidence and this wont be tolerated," he said. Delhi Police reports to the Union home ministry. To a question about the opposition backing the 'Bharat Bandh' on Tuesday to support the farmers' stir against three farm laws, he said the Modi government is a well-wisher of farmers and said BJP's rivals have been reduced to "rent-a-cause" politics. Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party alleged that the Delhi Police has put Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kejriwal-doing-politics-of-lies-deceit-propaganda-bjp-on-aaps-claim-of-his-house-arrest-924982.html

Senior Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said agriculture reforms should be discussed afresh in Parliament and new laws enacted after consulting all stakeholders. His assertions came even as farmers observe a ‘Bharat Bandh' on Tuesday to press for their demand of repealing the three laws. Hooda also said the Minimum Support Price mechanism needs to be incorporated in the law because it is a must to protect the interest of farmers. He alleged the farm laws brought in by the Centre were passed without any consultation with farmers, and that the government pushed them through as the coronavirus pandemic raged across the country. "The government must immediately scrap the three farm laws and convene a Parliament session to discuss reforms in the agri sector," he told a press conference. "We are not against reforms but the current laws must be repealed and a fresh reform process initiated after discussion and consultations with all stakeholders," he said. Hooda also asked as to why the government did not agree to the opposition demand of bringing another law to punish those buying farm produce below the MSP. Hooda also alleged the BJP-led Haryana government has lost the trust of the people and of the assembly as it "mishandled" the farmers' agitation and, therefore, it should face a vote of no confidence. "I have written to the Governor demanding the immediate convening of the Haryana Assembly as the present BJP government in the state has insulted farmers," he said. The former chief minister also stressed that the Congress manifesto in 2019 promising abolition of the APMC Act was being "misrepresented" by the BJP. "We had promised to create procurement centres and mandis nearby farmers’ areas. We created such mandis and centres, some even in my own village in Haryana which has a small population of 10,000," he said. On Haryana, he said the Congress would move a no-confidence motion against the Manohar Lal Khattar government which has "lost the confidence of people as also the MLAs" as a large number of them were supporting the farmers' protest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-must-bring-in-fresh-reform-process-initiated-after-discussion-with-all-stakeholders-congress-leader-bhupinder-singh-hooda-924983.html

"We need to work together to ensure a timely roll-out of 5G to leapfrog into the future and empower millions of Indians," he said while speaking at India Mobile Congress. Stating that India is emerging as one of the most preferred destinations for mobile manufacturing, the Prime Minister said the government has come up with a production-linked incentive scheme to promote telecom equipment manufacturing in the country. "Let us work together to make India a global hub for telecom equipment, design, development and manufacturing," he said addressing the event through video conference. On the Centre's ambitious broadband connectivity, he said the government will ensure high-speed fiber-optic connectivity in three years for all villages. The PM suggested that industry form a task-force for better handling of electronic waste as technological upgradation has brought in a culture of replacing handsets and gadgets frequently. In a nation of 1.3 billion, a billion-plus are phone users and the same number also has a unique digital identity. Also, there are over 750 million internet users. "The scale and speed of internet penetration can be seen by the following facts: Half of the total internet users in India were added in the last 4 years. Half of the total internet users are in our rural areas," he said. Modi said the country has the world's lowest telecom tariffs and is one of the fastest-growing mobile app markets globally.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-narendra-modi-calls-for-industry-govt-synergy-for-speedy-rollout-of-5g-technology-924994.html

The report issued on the eve of International Anti-Corruption Day analyses the working of Lokayukta (state-level ombudsman) in the country, seven years after the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013 came into being after a massive push from the India Against Corruption movement of 2011. "It has been around 50 years since Maharashtra appointed Lokayukta in 1971; 10 year of the famous Anna movement and seven years of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013. But in actuality, there is little progress in anti-corruption landscape of country," a statement from Transparency International India, a civil society organisation, said. The Act mandates the appointment of Lokpal at the Central level to inquire into allegations of corruption against important public functionaries, while Lokayukta is the state-level ombudsman. The report on the state of affairs at anti-graft panels across the country said that out of the 28 states and three union territories (UTs), the post of Lokayukta is vacant in eight states and UTs namely Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Puducherry (In J and K institution dissolved). "Interestingly, the apex court and many High Courts while dealing with the issue of appointment of Lokayuktas or the anti-graft ombudsmen in several states failed to achieve any success," it said. The posts of two judicial members of Lokpal (Central Ombudsman) are vacant, while 22 states and UTs have not appointed Up-Lokayukta (Member), it said. "There are only four states namely Bihar, Manipur, Odisha and Tamil Nadu which have judicial and non-judicial members of Lokayukta appointed," it said. The report said out of the 28 states and three UTs, nine -- Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh -- have not amended their Lokayukta Acts to bring them in line with the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act of 2013. "Karnataka and Kerala Lokayukta Acts can be considered model state-level laws, which can be followed by other states/UTs," it said. As many as 10 states have no official websites or their websites cannot be accessed, the report said. "Lokpal (Email mode) and three states namely Odisha, Maharashtra and Mizoram have online complaint facility," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/only-4-states-have-appointed-judicial-non-judicial-members-of-lokayukta-report-924998.html
08-12-2020||National||Centre not required to take prior environmental clearance for NH projects: SC||The central government is not required to obtain “prior environmental or forest clearance” under the laws before declaring a stretch as national highway (NH) and expressing its intention to acquire the land for building, maintenance or operating such roads, the Supreme Court held on Tuesday. This significant observation was made by the top court in its judgement upholding the notification for acquisition of land for the Rs 10,000-crore Chennai-Salem eight-lane green corridor project. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari dealt with relevant provisions of the National Highways Act, 1956, the National Highways Rules, 1957 and the National Highway Authority of India Act, 1988 while examining the Madras High Court's decision that a prior environmental clearance was needed for the project. The High Court verdict on April 8, 2019 had held as “illegal and bad in law” the notifications issued under Section 3A(1) of the National Highways Act for acquisition of specified lands for construction of the new highway which was part of the larger 'Bharatmala Pariyojna– Phase I5' project. Justice Khanwilkar, in the 140-judgement, said: “There is nothing in the 1956 Act, which impels the Central Government to obtain prior environment clearance before exercise of that power and in issuing notification under Section 2(2), much less Section 3A expressing its intention to acquire the designated land. “None of these enactments/rules specify any express condition requiring Central Government to obtain prior environmental/forest clearance before issuing notification under Section 2(2) declaring the stretch/ section to be a national highway or Section 3A of the 1956 Act to express intention to acquire land for the purpose of building, maintenance, management or operation of a national highway, as the case may be." The Centre has framed rules under the 1956 Act and even they do not “remotely suggest” that the government is obliged to obtain prior permission under environmental or forest laws. “Reverting to the notification issued by the MoEF dated September 14, 2006, even this notification does not constrict the power of Central Government to issue notification under Section... There is nothing to suggest that before expressing intention to acquire any land for the purpose of the 1956 Act, prior environmental/forest clearance is required,” it said. The environmental or forest clearance, however, is, required to be obtained by the executing agency in terms of this notification 'before commencing the actual work or executing the proposed project, it said. The top court, however, said that it has not expressed any opinion either way on the correctness and validity of the permissions or clearances accorded by the competent authorities under the environment and forest laws. It said that the orders granting permissions under the environment and forest laws were not the subject matter or the issues before the High Court and hence, it would be open to the affected persons to question the validity before the appropriate forum.   “We have not examined the efficacy of the permissions/clearances granted by the competent authority under the environment or forest laws, as the case may be. If those permissions/clearances are assailed, only then the decisions (previous judgements) ...may be looked at,” it said. Referring to judgements referred on legality of grant of environmental clearance to projects, the top court said that in those cases it was called upon to “examine the challenge in the context of permissions given by the competent authority under the environment laws.” The ambitious 277.3-km-long eight-lane green field project connecting Salem and Chennai under the Centre's 'Bharatmala Pariyojana' scheme aims to cut travel time between the two cities by half to about two hours and 15 minutes. However, it has been facing opposition from a section of locals, including farmers, over fears of losing their land, besides environmentalists who are against felling trees for it. The project runs through reserve forest and water bodies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-not-required-to-take-prior-environmental-clearance-for-nh-projects-sc-925013.html

He reiterated that the farm legislations were “anti-farmer” and introduced without any discussion with the stakeholders. On farmers’ call, the 'Bharat Bandh', in protest against the Centre's three farm laws, was observed in Punjab, Haryana and other states on Tuesday. Singh asked why the Centre could not heed the demands of the farmers, agitating across the country, to scrap these laws and hold fresh talks with all stakeholders. “Had I been in their place I would not have taken a minute to accept my mistake and revoke the laws,” he said in a statement issued here. Asserting that the "whole country was with the farmers in their pain and in their fight for survival", Singh said the Centre should allow the existing system to continue instead of scrapping the 'arthiya' (commission agent) and mandi system, as the farm laws were designed to do. “Why are they doing away with it? They should let the farmers decide what they want,” he said. Nobody was stopping private players from purchasing produce of farmers but it could not be allowed at the cost of the well-established system which had stood the farmers in good stead all these decades, the Punjab chief minister said. He demanded to know why the central government was not willing to give legitimacy to minimum support price, if its assertion of not abolishing it was sincere. “MSP is our right,” he asserted. Singh pointed out that the foodgrains bought at MSP were pushed into the public distribution system to feed the country's poor and all that would end if MSP goes. There was no reason why the Centre could not listen to the farmers, who were braving the cold, and send them home happily after resolving their concerns, he said. This was what I had told Union Home Minister Amit Shah too, I had urged him to do everything possible to resolve the concerns of the poor farmers in their interest, and also in the interest of India's security, Singh said. Making it clear that nobody was against private players, the chief minister said he was even now in talks with the UAE for supply of wheat and rice and the country wanted to create storage facilities in India, including Punjab. In fact, even in the last tenure as the chief minister, Singh said he tried to launch the farm-to-fork programme to promote private investment in agriculture-related fields like storage, cold chain, food processing etc within the existing system but the Akalis later shelved it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-has-underscored-need-for-repeal-of-farm-laws-amarinder-singh-925014.html

Addressing a press meet on Tuesday, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the platform, Co-WIN, will help monitor the entire vaccination process. "Co-WIN digital platform includes a free downloadable mobile application which can help record vaccine data. One can register themselves on it if they want the vaccine. There are five modules in Co-WIN app -- administrator module, registration module, vaccination module, beneficiary acknowledgement module and report module," he said. Bhushan said the administrator module is for the administrators who will be conducting these vaccination sessions. "Through these modules, they can create sessions and the respective vaccinators and managers will be notified,” he said. The registration module is for people to get registered for vaccination. It will upload bulk data on co-morbidity provided by local authorities or by surveyors. The vaccination module will verify beneficiary details and update vaccination status while the beneficiary acknowledgement module will send SMS to beneficiaries and also generate QR-based certificates after one gets vaccinated. "The report module will prepare reports of how many vaccine sessions have been conducted, how many people have attended those, how many people have dropped out etc,” Bhushan said while elaborating on the digital platform. The mobile application will also send real-time data of temperature of the cold-storage facilities to the main server, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/health-ministry-develops-mobile-app-co-win-for-real-time-monitoring-of-covid-19-vaccination-925017.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said voters could express dissatisfaction with regard to the candidates fielded by the parties by opting for the NOTA option. The bench said choosing a particular candidate is also an expression of dissatisfaction with regard to the other candidates and there was no need for "reflection of the mental perspective" of a voter while casting their vote. The observations came during hearing of the plea by Dr Akshay Yadavrao Bajad, an ayurvedic doctor presently working as a medical officer in an insurance company, who had contended that providing the option of "least undeserving candidate" in EVMs would compel political parties to nominate candidates with good moral character and integrity. Advocate Rohan Thawani, appearing for the doctor, said that his client had made a representation in December last year to the Centre on this particular aspect and it was forwarded to the EC, but more than a year later nothing has been done. The petition, filed through advocate Iqram Govind Singh and Gunjan Ahuja, also stated that another representation was moved by him in January this year before the Ministry of Law,  but it too was forwarded to the EC.

Besides Pawar, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI General Secretary D Raja and a representative of the DMK, will also be present at the meeting. Pawar, who met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday, was dismissive about the BJP's allegations of pursuing private sector participation in the agriculture sector as Agriculture Minister and opposing the same when out of power. Pawar said indeed as Agriculture Minister he had written the letter to chief ministers seeking reforms in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in 2010, but the new farm laws passed by the Modi government make no mention of it. “These three Acts do not even mention APMC,” Pawar said. BJP leaders had targeted Pawar and other opposition parties of “duplicity”, accusing them of batting for farm sector reforms when in power and opposing them when introduced by the Modi government. “They are just trying to divert attention. There is no need to give any importance to their allegations,” the veteran leader said. Pawar said leaders of five-six political parties will meet on Wednesday and decide on a joint strategy on the farm laws. Pawar also made it clear that his meeting with the Defence Minister had nothing to do with the ongoing farmers agitation but in connection with building a new airport near Pune. Pawar, Congress President Sonia Gandhi, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and seven other opposition leaders had issued a joint statement supporting the farmers' call for nationwide shutdown on Tuesday. At least 25 opposition parties have declared their support to the Bharat Bandh call given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella group of farmers organisations from across the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/5-member-opposition-delegation-to-meet-president-ram-nath-kovind-on-farm-laws-on-wednesday-925027.html
08-12-2020||National||Delhi BJP calls Arvind Kejriwal’s house arrest ‘drama’ to avoid meeting protesting mayors||The Delhi BJP on Tuesday hit out at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, accusing him of doing "drama" over his alleged house arrest to avoid meeting mayors and members of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations staging an indefinite dharna outside his residence. The mayors of North, South and East Delhi municipal corporations--Jai Prakash, Anamika Mithilesh and Nirmal Jain-- accompanied by Delhi BJP vice president Harsh Malhotra and many women councillors have been protesting outside Kejriwal's Flagstaff Road residence since Monday. They are demanding payment of "unpaid" dues of Rs 13,000 crore from the Delhi government. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, and party MPs Parvesh Verma and Meenakshi Lekhi joined the protesting mayors Tuesday morning. Gupta also tweeted a video purportedly showing the chief minister’s car exiting the latter’s residence. "AAP leaders are spreading white lies that CM Arvind Kejriwal is under house arrest since yesterday morning, how is he leaving his residence easily if it is true?” he said. "CM Delhi is not in house arrest but is resting at home as he partied at a wedding last night. We are used 2nautanki it's time others get 2know," Lekhi tweeted. "Brilliant performance! Oscar level acting by @ArvindKejriwal and team,” BJP MP Parvesh Verma said on Twitter. After hours of drama outside Kejriwal's residence over him allegedly being put under house arrest by Delhi Police, the chief minister came outside Tuesday evening and addressed AAP members. He said he would have gone to support the protesting farmers in their Bharat Bandh movement if he was not stopped. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) earlier in the day alleged that the Delhi Police has put Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border, a claim denied by the city police The Delhi BJP president, in a press conference, alleged that the "failure" of Bharat Bandh in Delhi has exposed the CM. "The Chief Minister is not under house arrest. He is resting at home to avoid meeting the mayors and municipal leaders demanding unpaid dues of Rs 13,000 crore from his government," Gupta said. Delhi BJP MPs Manoj Tiwari and Gautam Gambhir also trained guns at Kejriwal and the AAP over the issue. "Farmers are the excuse to achieve power in Punjab. Only Arvind Kejriwal can do such a thing by shutting himself in and screaming house arrest,” Gambhir said in a tweet in Hindi. North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said Kejriwal should meet the municipal corporation leaders and redress their grievances. "I fail to understand why he is avoiding us and instead doing house arrest drama. We will continue our dharna indefinitely till he gives the unpaid dues," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-bjp-calls-arvind-kejriwal-s-house-arrest-drama-to-avoid-meeting-protesting-mayors-925028.html

Addressing a press conference at a protest site on the Singhu border, they said the "super bandh" made the government open its “eyes and ears”. The farmer leaders said the protestors did not go to Burari ground as it is an "open jail" and demanded that Ramlila Ground be given to them. They stressed that they don't want to trouble the people of Delhi and Haryana. Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa said a 13-member delegation of farmers' representatives will seek a "yes or no" to their demands when they meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday evening. “The 'Bharat Bandh' against the new farm laws was successful and had an impact in 25 states. It was 'super bandh' from Kashmir to Kanyakumari,” Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said. The meeting between Shah and the 13-member farmer leaders' comes a day before their sixth round of talks with Union ministers slated for Wednesday. "There is no midway. We will demand just 'yes' or 'no' from Home Minister Amit Shah at today's meeting," Mansa said. "The Central government now knows it doesn't have a way out. They will have to withdraw the three new farm laws and guarantee minimum support prices for crops," he said. He claimed the central government has bowed down before the 'Bharat Bandh'. “When the first four meetings did not lead to any breakthrough, we went silent in the fifth one and demanded that the government answer in 'yes or no',” Mansa said. “We will rest only when we make the government accept all our demands,” he said. BKU leader Bhog Singh Mansa said the farmers will hold discussions after the meeting with Shah and announce their future course of action on Wednesday. The nationwide shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, added Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav. “It was a historic day. Nobody thought the bandh will be successful on such short notice... It has made the government open its eyes and ears,” he said. Fishermen, sand mine and stone quarry workers, industrial federation, students, railway personnel federation, intellectuals and writers all supported the bandh, he claimed, adding "it became successful because every citizen of India made it his own protest". Besides Punjab and Haryana, the 'bandh' was "successful" in states like Telangana, Tripura, Assam, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, he claimed, adding social activist Anna Hazare also observed a 'symbolic fast' in support of the protesting farmers. Yadav alleged that around 200 farmer leaders were detained in Gujarat, and there were reports that many were arrested in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmer-leaders-claim-success-of-bharat-bandh-want-to-shift-protest-to-ramlila-ground-925039.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah would deliver the judgement on a PIL filed by advocate Kush Kalra. The Centre had earlier maintained before the court that it never prescribed such a practice and states can pass suitable orders stopping it. The court had also then said such posters end up making the patients untouchables. The Centre, for its part, said it was not in favour of pasting Covid posters outside affected person's house if it leads to maligning anyone. However, the intention was to check any stranger inadvertently entering the house. Though the PIL, advocate Kalra asked the court to quash the decision taken by various states and UTs and its authorities set up under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to affix posters outside residences of persons who are Covid-19 positive and are required to stay in home isolation. He also sought a direction that the names of Covid-19 patients were not circulated in WhatsApp group of Residents Welfare Associations.

"One crore healthcare workers including doctors and two crore front line staff such as police and disaster response team members would get the shots in the first round followed by 27 crore age-prioritised individuals having comorbid conditions," Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in Delhi on Tuesday. Currently, 85,634 cold chain equipment are available for storage and transport of Covid-19 vaccines at 28,947 cold chain points spread all over the country. The existing cold chain network can house the Covid-19 shots for the first three crore vaccinations in addition to 11 vaccines needed in the universal immunisation programme (UIP). "An additional supply of cold chain equipment comprising walk-in coolers, walk-in freezers, deep freezers and ice-lined refrigerators would be made available to the states from December 10 onward," Bhushan said, sharing the first official details of the government’s roll-out plan. To administer the vaccine, the Centre would pick up 1.54 lakh auxiliary nurse-cum-midwives from the existing pool of 2.39 lakh such workers. The rest would continue to serve the UIP to ensure that there is no breach in the routine immunisation programme. Efforts are on to find out more staff for the vaccination process as the Centre and state governments prepare for a never-done-before exercise to give the jabs to crores of adult Indians. Each vaccination booths will have a separate room where a person receiving the vaccine would have to wait for 30 minutes to check if he/she develops any adverse reaction. In anticipation of some adverse reactions, the government plans to launch a communication campaign in order to convey to the masses to accept some adverse effects besides countering the disinformation and rumours. "Have faith in the regulator once it approves a vaccine. Don’t succumb to contrary news and fake news,” said Vinod Paul, member, NITI Ayog and a former professor at AIIMS. Detailed implementation plans and training materials are being finalised whereas additional procurements of syringes and needles are on track. Three companies – Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech and Pfizer – have applied for Emergency Authorisation Use to the Drugs Controller General India. While the first two are carrying out clinical trials in India, Pfizer requested waiving off the clinical trial need and consider its vaccine on the basis of trials carried abroad. As many as nine vaccines are various stages of clinical evaluation in India at the moment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/30-crore-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-first-round-in-india-govt-plans-to-create-vaccine-booth-925058.html

Farmer leaders sought to project the meeting with Shah as a sign of the Modi government softening towards the demand of farmers to roll back the three farm laws that have led to the siege of Delhi for the 13th day on Tuesday. The Modi government has ruled out repeal of the three farm laws, the main demand of the farmers, who had called for a nationwide shutdown on Tuesday that received a mixed response. The meeting of the farmer leaders with Shah was to begin at Shah’s residence but was shifted to the international guest house of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research at the National Agricultural Science Complex. The meeting which was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. began only after 8:30 p.m. amid expectations that the Shah would provide the broad contours of the government proposal to the concerns raised by the farmers on the three farm laws. “These are informal talks. We expect the government to share its concrete proposal which was promised to us during the December 3 meeting,” Jagjit Singh Dalewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union-Sidhupur, told DH before going for the meeting. Interestingly, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, with whom Shah was in contact with the farmers began their Delhi agitation on November 26, was not among the invitees for the Tuesday night meeting. Ugrahan, who heads his own faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, is an influential farmer leader with the largest following in Punjab. The meeting with Shah came a day before the farmers are scheduled to hold their sixth round of talks with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Prakash over their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-meets-farmer-leaders-ahead-of-crucial-talks-925059.html

Kant while addressing a virtual event organised by the Niti Aayog in association with Patna High Court also shared his appreciation for Chief Justice of Patna High Court Sanjay Karol for his progressive and visionary outlook. "One of the most encouraging developments recently is how progressive and in fact innovative the courts have been in adopting technology," an official statement said quoting Kant. The Niti Aayog CEO further said the meeting is the start of a collaborative exercise that sets into motion the use of technology towards efficient and affordable access to justice in our post-pandemic response. The meeting was held on December 7, 2020, with a focus on Online Dispute Resolution (ODR). According to the statement, justice Karol in his address affirmed that all officers of Patna High Court have taken a vow since March of this year to transform justice delivery. "We are dealing with a huge pendency of very old cases and new cases are arising. It requires a huge transformation in mindsets to deal with this challenge," the statement said, quoting justice Karol. Over 1,000 attendees participated in the online meeting, with participation from the entire Bihar Judiciary. At the meeting, the participants deliberated on the way forward for ensuring equitable and effective justice delivery for one and all, the statement said.

Mathur presented India’s national statement at the conclave at the General Assembly.  “We need to capitalize on existing programs such as the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator or ACTA, and COVAX facility to ensure affordable and equitable global access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines while strengthening health systems. Also, we need to come up with long term strategies and roadmaps to put in place a system to deal with the future pandemics,” he said.

The women on the 17th annual Forbes Power List hail from 30 countries and were born across four generations. "There are 10 heads of state, 38 CEOs and five entertainers among them. But where they differ in age, nationality and job description, they are united in the ways they have been using their platforms to address the unique challenges of 2020,” Forbes said. Sitharaman is ranked 41st on the list, Nadar Malhotra comes in at the 55th spot, Mazumdar-Shaw -- described as “India's richest self-made woman” -- is ranked 68th and chairwoman of Landmark Group Renuka Jagtiani is ranked 98th. Merkel ranks No. 1 for the tenth year in a row. “Merkel remains the de facto leader of Europe, leading the region's largest economy after steering Germany through financial crisis and back to growth. Her leadership is marked by her steely reserve, from standing up to Donald Trump to allowing more than a million Syrian refugees into Germany,” Forbes said, adding: “the big question that the public is now asking is who and what will come after Merkel's time in office comes to an end.” Harris, who became the first woman, first Black American and first Asian American to be elected vice president -- "an unprecedented trifecta of firsts for California Senator Harris", is ranked third on the list. Harris's "rapid ascension in US politics has also catapulted" her onto the Forbes list of the World’s 100 Most Powerful Women for the first time. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde is ranked second for the second straight year. “From fighting the pandemic to re-engineering American politics, these influential women, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, are making history,” Forbes said. Several of this year's Power Women received "global plaudits" for their effective responses to Covid-19. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (No. 32) vanquished a first and second wave of the virus in her country by implementing strict lockdown and quarantine procedures. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen (No. 37) implemented a rigorous contact-tracing program in January, as a result, to date, the island of 23 million people has lost only seven lives to the virus, Forbes said. There are 17 newcomers on this year's list, illustrating that women are “leading all aspects of a society transformed by a global pandemic”. New CEO of American multinational company United Parcel Service Carol Tomé (No. 11) and head of California-based Clorox Linda Rendle (No. 87) are responsible for helping provide essential services that have kept Americans connected and clean. CVS Health executive vice-president and incoming CEO Karen Lynch (No. 38) leads the pharmacy giant’s vast Covid-19 testing programme and, in 2021 will be responsible for its critical handling of coronavirus vaccines. The list also includes Co-Chair of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates (5), US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (7), Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg (22), Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (39), UK's Queen Elizabeth II (46), celebrated artistes Rihana (69) and Beyonce (72).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nirmala-sitharaman-kiran-mazumdar-shaw-in-forbes-2020-list-of-100-most-powerful-women-925071.html

Addressing a press conference here, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Health Ministry, in consultation with states and union territories, has assessed the additional requirement for cold chain storage and additional supplies will be available to them beginning December 10. He said the government wants to ensure that routine immunisation exercise and health services are not hampered when the coronavirus vaccination drive is launched. Out of the 2.39 lakh vaccinators or auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), who provide vaccination under the existing Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) across the country, only 1.54 lakh will be used for Covid-19 vaccination drive. "Additional vaccinators are being arranged in collaboration with states and UTs," the secretary said. Bhushan said the current cold chain system consists of over 85,000 functional equipment for storage of vaccines at nearly 29,000 cold chain points across the country. "We all know that vaccines are temperature sensitive and need to be stored in specific temperatures. Presently, the cold chain system consists of 85,634 functional equipment which include deep freezers, walk-in coolers, walk-in refrigerators, passive devices which do not require electricity like ice boxes etc, for storage of vaccines at about 28,947 cold chain points across the country. They are used in the health ministry's universal immunisation process (UIP). "The current cold chain system is capable of storing additional quantity of Covid-19 vaccine required for first 3 crore i.e. Health Care Workers and Front Line Workers," he said. Presently, India provides immunisation for 13 vaccine-preventable diseases, he said, adding that Covid-19 vaccination drive will not have any impact on that. "We do immunisation in India for 11 vaccine-preventable diseases and for two vaccine-preventable diseases in some states. Today, 13 types of vaccines are already being provided to crores of pregnant women and children in the country. This Covid-19 vaccination drive will not have any impact on that. So additional vaccinators are being arranged in collaboration with States/UTs," Bhushan said. Talking about the preparedness for rolling out the vaccination drive, the secretary said the requirement of additional syringes, needles etc. have been estimated and their procurement is on track. "The implementation standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been sent to states and UTs and are in final stages. Training materials, which include digital training content, are also being finalised," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/present-cold-chain-system-can-hold-additional-covid-19-vaccines-required-for-3-crore-key-workers-govt-925076.html

Metropolitan Magistrate Chhavi Bansal allowed custodial interrogation of Rajender Prasad Aggarwal, shareholder and Director of the companies M/s Tara Alloys Limited  and M/s Gurudev Financial Services and shareholder of Sridham Distributors Pvt Limited and Annies Apparel Pvt Limited. The police had sought his custody for four days, saying Aggarwal was allegedly the director and promoter of shell entities through which money was routed for misappropriation of public money and his remand was required for further investigation in the matter. According to the police, the companies were allegedly shell companies through which funds amounting to Rs 676 crores were diverted in 2016-17. Police had alleged that Aggarwal was allegedly a part of the larger conspiracy in the case, along with former Fortis Healthcare promoters Malvinder Singh and his brother Shivinder. Police further alleged that Aggarwal in conspiracy with co-accused Narender Kumar Ghoushal further routed and re-routed the amount received in his companies to sham entities resulting in pecuniary benefit to the promoters of Religare Group Malvinder and Shivinder. Malvinder, Shivinder, former CMD of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) Sunil Godhwani, Kavi Arora and Anil Saxena were arrested in the case by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police last year, for allegedly diverting RFL's money and investing in other companies. The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL's Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.

Addressing a virtual road safety event organised by the World Bank, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari also said 3.14 per cent of the country's GDP is lost due to road accidents. India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents per annum in which 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh are crippled. "Eleven per cent of global road accident deaths occur in India. Actually 3.14 per cent of national GDP is lost due to road accidents," Gadkari said. He added that the government has taken a lot of preventive measures. "Our road accidents and death percentage have already reduced up to 20 per cent...We are working very hard for this." Exuding confidence for checking accidents, the minister said he is hopeful that accident and death rates will reduce further due to a large number of initatives taken by the government. He also cited the example of Tamil Nadu which has seen significant reduction in road accidents and resultant deaths. The minister said the amended Motor Vehicle Act has also contributed significantly in lowering the accidents. The legislation has stiff penalties for violation of traffic laws. "The Motor Vehicle Amendment Act mandates establishment of independent bodies, including the National Road Safety Board, to provide advice to the central government in respect of road safety and traffic management," the minister said. Road safety audit is also on, he added. Those behind faulty road designs will be penalised, he said adding that speed control and other measures have also resulted in improvement.

Delhi’s minimum temperature dropped to 9.5 degrees Celsius as a blanket of fog covered the national capital, affecting visibility Tuesday morning The Safdarjung and Palam weather stations recorded a visibility of 300 metres due to “moderate” fog at 8:30 am, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The mercury is likely to dip further with the wind direction changing to westerly-northwesterly. These icy cold winds blow from snow-laden western Himalayas towards the plains. The minimum temperatures in Haryana and Punjab hovered above normal limits with Chandigarh, the joint capital of the two states, recording a low of 11.5 degrees Celsius, the meteorological department said. Very dense fog covered parts of Uttar Pradesh, where Churk was the coldest at 8.3 degrees Celsius. Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 12.4 degrees Celsius. Weather is most likely to remain dry and shallow, and moderate fog at isolated places is very likely from Wednesday to Friday, the weatherman said. The meteorological department has issued a yellow weather warning for heavy rain and snowfall in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday. The MeT centre Shimla has forecast rains in plains and low hills on Friday and Saturday, while rain and snowfall in the middle and high hills from Wednesday to Sunday. The MeT issues colour-coded warnings to alert the public ahead of severe or hazardous weather which has the potential to cause "damage, widespread disruption and/or danger to life". Yellow is the least dangerous among the weather warnings. Meanwhile, weather remained dry in the state in the last 24 hours. The tribal Lahaul and Spiti's administrative centre Keylong continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 1.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, Shimla MeT centre director Manmohan Singh said. The famous ski-resort of Gulmarg and other higher reaches of Kashmir received snowfall for the second day, while the plains were lashed by rains. The MeT said there would be a decrease in precipitation in the Union territory from Wednesday. Snowfall continued in many areas in the higher reaches of the valley on Tuesday with Gulmarg, in north Kashmir, recording about seven inches of fresh snowfall, officials said. They said other areas like Gurez, Mughal Road and Zojilla axis on Srinagar-Leh road also received fresh snowfall which was going on when the last reports came in. The officials said most places in the plains of the Valley received heavy rains which continued this morning. Gulmarg was the only place in the Kashmir Valley to record sub-zero temperatures last night as the mercury there settled at a low of minus 2.4 degrees Celsius, they said. All the remaining weather stations in the Valley, including Pahalgam, recorded the minimum temperature above zero degrees Celsius, with the night temperature in Srinagar settling at a low of 2.4 degrees Celsius, they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cold-weather-in-north-india-yellow-weather-warning-issued-for-himachal-pradesh-925105.html

Naidu, who was addressing the TiE Global Summit-2020 through video conferencing from Visakhapatnam, called upon universities to set up incubation centres to tap and nurture entrepreneurial talent among the youth. "To tap and nurture entrepreneurial talent among youngsters, our universities must set up incubation centres. I call upon all the universities in the country, please set up incubation centres. Attract the talent and encourage and promote the talent," he said. The corporate sector too must come forward to fund and promote entrepreneurial ecosystem on university campuses, he added. Observing that youth comprise about 65 per cent of the country's population, he said the vast energies of the talented youth must be tapped fully and their mindset should be changed from being job-seekers to job creators. He suggested that a special drive could be launched for promoting entrepreneurship among women. There is a huge potential for promoting women entrepreneurs in the country, he said. The country is home to the world's third largest start-up ecosystem and there is huge scope for growth in the area as vast talent is available in the country, he said. Noting that an ecosystem that promotes entrepreneurship can enable many innovative ideas to be translated into promising start-ups, he said the government, on its part, is creating an enabling environment through start-up India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/foster-student-entrepreneurship-through-innovation-programmes-vice-president-m-venkaiah-naidu-925113.html

Modi, in his message on the occasion of the 36th charter day of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), also called for a commitment to defeat the forces that "support and nurture terrorism". "The full potential of SAARC can only be realised in an atmosphere free of terror and violence. On this 36th SAARC Charter Day, let us recommit ourselves to defeating the forces that support and nurture terrorism, and to work collectively towards a secure and prosperous South Asia," the Prime Minister said. Modi also said India remains committed to an "integrated, connected, secure and prosperous" South Asia, and will continue to support the economic, technological, cultural and social development of the region. In his message, Oli said, "Time has come to move forward with concrete action in the ground with needed political will and commitment. Giving fresh impetus to the stalled SAARC process including through the early convening of the Summit can rekindle hope among our people and provide ground to move forward." The SAARC leaders, under India's initiative, held a virtual meeting in March to work on a common strategy to effectively deal with the coronavirus pandemic. In the message, Modi conveyed "warm greetings" to the citizens of member states of the grouping. SAARC is a regional bloc comprising India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. SAARC has not been very effective since 2016 as its biennial summits have not taken place since the last one in Kathmandu in 2014. The 2016 SAARC Summit was to be held in Islamabad. But after the terrorist attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit, saying "increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region... have created an environment that is not conducive" for the meet. The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate in the Islamabad meet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/full-potential-of-saarc-can-only-be-realised-in-atmosphere-free-of-terror-pm-modi-925124.html
08-12-2020||National||Farmers protest: Centre's sixth round of talks with farmer leaders scheduled for Dec 9||The government's sixth round of talks with farmer unions scheduled for Wednesday hangs in balance after a meeting between Home Minister Amit Shah and a select group of peasant leaders failed to end the deadlock on Tuesday night, with the farmer representatives saying the government has refused to meet their demand for repeal of three new agri laws. While there was no official words from the government on the status of Wednesday's scheduled meeting, many union leaders said there is no question of attending it and that they will take a call on their next course of action after studying the government's written proposal. "Shah-ji said the government will give tomorrow in writing the amendments which the government is keen to (make). We will decide about attending the meeting after discussing the written amendments with all 40 farmer unions," All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah said after the meeting with the home minister. Farmer leader Darshan Pal of AIKSCC, who also attended the meeting with Shah, said, "The central government will send us a note on our demands tomorrow.... There won't be any meeting between the Union government and farmer leaders tomorrow." Three union ministers -- Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce and Industries Som Parkash -- are representing the government in the talks with the 40 farmer unions' leaders. The sixth round of meeting was scheduled a day after a 'Bharat Bandh' was observed by the protesting farmer unions, which received support from trade unions, various other organisations as well as 24 opposition parties, including the Congress and the NCP. No breakthrough has been possible in the five rounds of talks so far as the protesting farmers have stuck to their demand for the repeal of the laws despite the government's assurance to look into specific issues without abolishing the legislations. In the previous meeting on December 5, Tomar had assured 40 farmer union leaders that the government is open to considering ways to strengthen APMC mandis, create a level-playing field with proposed private markets, and provide a provision for approaching higher courts for dispute resolution while asserting that procurement at minimum support price (MSP) will continue. But the protesting farmer unions' leaders are insisting that the laws must be scrapped. Meanwhile, on December 7, a group of 20 progressive farmers from Haryana submitted to the government a memorandum demanding that the government consider amendments as suggested by the protesting farmers' unions but not repeal them. Tomar had told these progressive farmers backing these legislations that these measures will benefit the peasantry and the agriculture sector and that the government will handle such agitations. The three farm laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained the MSP and mandi systems would continue and would be rather further improved and strengthened. The first round of talks had taken place in October, but the farmer leaders had walked out from that meeting as no minister was present. This was followed by the second round on November 13. The last three rounds have taken place after thousands of farmers, first from Punjab and Haryana and later from other states as well, laid siege to various borders of the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-centres-sixth-round-of-talks-with-farmer-leaders-scheduled-for-dec-9-925128.html

The IMA said doctors from both private and government sectors demonstrated on roads in all districts of the country against the notification, issued by the Central Council of Indian Medicine under the Ministry of AYUSH. Medical students staged protests in their colleges. The IMA has demanded the withdrawal of the notification which it earlier said, "will ring the death knell of modern medicine system as a whole". IMA National President Rajan Sharma, along with other office-bearers of the organisation, led the agitation from its headquarters in New Delhi. The IMA Medical Students Network protested in front of National Medical Commission, Dwarka.

Khattar made the remark on his Twitter handle after meeting Tomar in the national capital and asserted that all BJP governments in various states as well as the Centre accord highest priority to the farmers’ interests. He also expressed hope for an amicable resolution to the tillers’ issue at the earliest. Khattar met Tomar in New Delhi amid thousands of farmers holding sit-ins at various borders of the national capital seeking repeal of the three new farm laws of the Centre. “On the issue of farmers, I had a meeting with Narendra Singh Tomar Ji. He has assured that the MSP will be protected,” Khattar tweeted after the meeting. “For our government, interests of farmers have been and will be above all,” he further said. Earlier interacting with reporters in Delhi after the meeting, Khattar said he was hopeful of an “amicable resolution” when the representatives of protesting farmers and the Centre meet for another round of talks on Wednesday. In another tweet, Khattar alleged that the opposition is doing cheap politics in the name of farmers and said those doing so need to be condemned. “Our aim is to make farmers self-reliant. Once again, I promise my farmer brethren that the MSP will continue and I will not allow peasants to face any difficulty,” he said. Referring to the upcoming meeting between farmers' representatives and the Centre on Wednesday, Khattar told reporters that the Union government will do whatever is in the best interest of farmers. Asked about the many of the JJP MLAs, the BJP's coalition partner in Haryana, expressing support to the agitating farmers, Khattar said, “Farmers are our own. After all, who will not want their income should rise? Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has said their income should double.” Khattar accused the opposition parties of having resorted to double standards on farm laws, saying they have come out against the new laws enacted by the Modi government despite their demands for similar provisions during the UPA regime. He also said the “issue to amend the APMC Act had cropped up when Sharad Pawar was the Union agriculture minister” and added many of the UPA allies at that time had supported it. “Now, they are doing cheap politics in the name of farmers and using them to grind their axe,” he said. Khattar met Tomar a day before the slated meeting of the farmers’ representatives with the Central government in Delhi for their sixth round of talks. No breakthrough has been possible in the five rounds of talks so far, as the protesting farmers have stuck to their demand for the repeal of the laws despite the government's assurance to look into specific issues without abolishing the legislations. The three farm laws have been presented by the government as major agriculture sector reforms aimed at removing the middlemen and allowing farmers to sell their crops anywhere in the country The protesting farmers, however, have been fearing that the new laws would lead to the scrapping of the MSP mechanism, leaving them at the mercy of corporates. The Centre has been seeking to allay their fears, maintaining that the MSP and mandi systems would continue as earlier and would rather be further improved and strengthened.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/union-agri-minister-has-promised-msps-continuation-haryana-cm-925149.html

In a four-page letter, Badal called upon the Prime Minister to "show magnanimity” and withdraw these laws "as a first step towards the resolution of the serious crisis confronting the country today”. This letter follows his December 3 announcement about returning Padma Vibhushan in protest against the farm laws. Punjab’s five-time Chief Minister Badal stressed upon the need for making India "a truly federal country", adding “the roots of the ongoing crisis lie in the abdication of our commitment to the federal approach”. “The three Acts in question that have pushed the country into a deep turmoil must be withdrawn without making farmers and their families endure any more suffering in this biting cold,” Badal said in his letter. Asserting that he was writing the letter at a time when the problems facing the country are “fast assuming the proportions of a grave crisis”, he said, “Our approach towards these needs an immediate course correction.” “I am deeply worried about the ongoing farmers' crisis,” he said. He said the government would have done well to enact legislation “affecting the destiny of millions and millions of farmers” only after taking their representatives and farmer-friendly political parties like the Shiromani Akali Dal in confidence. He said when it became clear that the three Ordinances were “not finding acceptance” even among the government's alliance partners like the SAD, the “obvious” course open to the government was to convene an all-party meeting. “There is a democratic convention in our country to follow this course whenever there is a national stalemate,” he asserted. “The government would not have been bound to accept the Opposition's views but it would have gained from their wisdom. I was surprised that this option was not taken," he said. The “failure” to consult states on an issue that concerns nearly 70 per cent of the country's population shows the government's “indifference to or rejection of the federal principle”, he said. “This was unbelievable because you have yourself been among the biggest champions of federal structure,” he told the PM, adding as Gujarat CM, Modi had always advocated more powers to and a greater role of states. “I say this because I sincerely believe that the roots of the ongoing crisis lie in the abdication of our commitment to the federal approach,” said Badal. The nonagenarian leader said the message from the “current crisis” is about the need to avoid confrontation as a way to address social and political issues. He said he had often confronted situations involving people with conflicting backgrounds and persuasions making diverse and conflicting demands. “I have battled against the dictatorship during the Emergency days. My experience tells me that respect for peaceful democratic values offers us the best solutions to even the most complex and intractable problems,” he asserted. “The country has seen how statesmen like Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee understood and respected the beauty of the diversity of our nation and turned it into an asset,” he noted. He told Prime Minister Modi that the ongoing “farmers' crisis” needs his “immediate and undivided attention”. “In the circumstances, I strongly urge you to show magnanimity in approach and to personally intervene to get the stalemate broken,” said Badal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/badal-urges-pm-modi-to-show-magnanimity-on-farm-laws-924674.html

The day-long shutdown received support from non-BJP parties whose workers took to streets to express solidarity with the agitating cultivators. However, normal life remained by and large unaffected and peaceful in the state where a three-party alliance, led by the Shiv Sena, is in power. Trains, public and private buses, taxis and auto- rickshaws operated as usual though the state-owned MSRTC curtailed some services due to the agitation and lack of passengers response. Suburban services as well as outstation trains from Mumbai remained unaffected, said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer (CPRO), Central Railway. Leaders of taxi and auto rickshaw unions told PTI that their services in Mumbai remained normal. A spokesperson of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), which operates buses in Mumbai and its adjoining cities, said almost 85 per cent of its services were on roads. "Out of 3,435 scheduled buses, 2,913 buses plied on roads," he said. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) PRO Abhijit Bhosale said they curtailed some operations either due to poor passenger response or as a precautionary measure. Bhosale said MSRTC operated only 7,634 buses out of 11,799 scheduled services till Tuesday noon. He said 3,717 buses were cancelled due to the bandh and 448 for other reasons. "No report of any untoward incident was reported in the state" Bhosale said. Truck operators said the movement of goods was affected to an extent as several truckers chose not to operate in view of the shutdown. "Many truckers have kept their vehicles off roads in support of the strike, but we haven't stopped movement of essential commodities," said Kailash Pingle, leader of the Maharashtra Rajya Motor Malak Sangh. Transportation of essential commodities like milk, vegetables and fruits were excluded from the purview of the bandh, said Daya Natkar, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Truck Tempo Tankers Vahatuk Sangh. Taxi union leader A L Quadros said taxis are plying in Mumbai as the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown had already hit the sector severely. The ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress extended support to the shutdown, but appealed to protesters not to disrupt public transport services. In Pune also, public transport remained unaffected. "All our operations in the city are unaffected and no incident of buses being stopped anywhere has been reported yet," said an official from PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal). Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) remained closed in many parts of Maharashtra in response of the bandh. Wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad remained shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities. APMCs at Kalyan and Vashi in Navi Mumbai, which supplies bulk of vegetables and fruits to Mumbai, remained closed, with wholesalers and traders supporting the shutdown. On a normal day, thousands of trucks transport vegetables, fruits, foodgrains and spices to APMCs every day across the state. Police officials said public services were partially affected in Thane and Palghar cities, which fall under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). In Pune district, APMCs remained shut and no transactions took place on their premises. A senior APMC official said only 20 per cent of the normal volume of the agriculture produce was received on Monday night. "A total of 188 vehicles, including 25 trucks, from other states reached the APMC in Pune last night. All shops in the APMCs remained closed today and no transactions took place," he said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik, who is also a state minister, led a protest of party workers in suburban Chembur in Mumbai. Workers of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress held a demonstration in support of farmers at Alka Chowk in Pune. In Kolhapur in western Maharashtra, activists of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana (SSS) staged a demonstration and burnt copies of the contentious agri laws. A protest was held at Puntamaba village in Ahmednagar district which was the epicentre of a farmer agitation in 2017, with shops and commercial establishments remaining shut. At least 60 to 70 members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its affiliated outfits were detained during a protest in Solapur city, police said. CPM leader Narasayya Adam led the agitation in support of the bandh called by farmers demanding repealing of the Centre's agri laws. Workers of the AICCTU, CPI and student organisations blocked a highway in Aurangabad district to extend their support to the agitating farmers. The police detained volunteers from the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Communist Party of India, Satyashodhak Vidyarthi Sangatana, Students Federation of India and other associations, an official said. The bandh was called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the Modi government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted these mechanisms will remain in place.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bharat-bandh-apmcs-remain-shut-in-many-parts-of-maharashtra-public-transport-unaffected-924805.html

08-12-2020||National Politics||Bharat Bandh: Life hit in some states as farmers take national centerstage||Shops and commercial establishments were closed, transport affected and traffic disrupted as protesters squatted on roads and train tracks in several parts of the country on Tuesday in response to ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.  Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and many trade unions, came into effect with the maximum impact expected in states such as Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests. Security was stepped up across the country, noisy demonstrations were held in many places and the numbers swelled at Delhi’s border points where thousands of farmers have been camping for the last 11 days.  Protesters blocked railway tracks at several places in West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. From the Rajasthan capital Jaipur, where ‘mandis’ were closed but shops open, there were reports of clashes between workers of the state’s ruling Congress and the BJP. However, the protest was mostly peaceful in other parts of the country. In the national capital Delhi, where most main markets were open but app-based cabs off the roads, tension spiralled with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleging that Delhi Police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest. City police denied the claim but the party stuck to its guns and said the move was a response to Kejriwal meeting protesting farmers at the Singhu border, the main access point for those coming to the city from Punjab. "No one has been permitted to leave or enter his residence... When our MLAs went to meet the chief minister they were beaten and thrown on the streets,” said party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj. Joining the 'Bharat Bandh' call, some auto-rickshaw and taxi unions also took their vehicles off the roads in the city. Farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during a 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm, part of the ‘bandh’ that comes a day before the Centre meets representatives of the farmers for another round of talks on Wednesday in a bid to resolve the impasse. All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah described the shutdown as a show of strength by the farmers. "We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes… If our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level," Mollah said.  The protesting farmers fear the new laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety of the Minimum Support Price cushion and do away with 'mandis', leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government maintains the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. Farmers from Punjab and also Haryana have been the drivers of the movement. In Punjab, shops and commercial establishments were closed as were 3,400 fuel pumps. From morning, farmer leaders appealed to shopkeepers and traders to keep their shutters down.  All major parties in Punjab — the ruling Congress, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal -- have also extended their support. Over 50,000 government employees have taken mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira. In neighbouring BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, opposition parties Congress and Indian National Lok Dal extended their support. Farmers assembled on highways and other key roads in both states since morning. "Everyone should hold a peaceful protest," Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said in a video message. The Haryana Police traffic advisory warned that main national highways would be closed and the peak time of impact is expected to be between 12 noon to 3 pm. In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress has joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but has stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed.  Life was disrupted with the railway tracks being blocked in several places and sit-ins on major roads and private vehicles off the roads in many parts of the state. However, public transport, including buses and taxis, operated though in fewer numbers. Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters as opposition parties extended their support. RJD supporters, and workers of Pappu Yadav's Jan Adhikar Party fanned out to various parts of Patna, forcing shopkeepers to down their shutters and deflating tyres of vehicles plying on the roads. In Jehanabad, the movement of Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police.  Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers' organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore. Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads. Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh, including its capital Raipur, wore a deserted look too with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away.  "At least 36 farmers, labourers and social organisations led by the Chhattisgarh Kisan Majdoor Mahasangh (CKMM) have been staging protests at various locations in the state in support of the shutdown," said CKMM's Sanket Thakur. Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh saw sporadic demonstrations, particularly in Seoni-Malwa in Hoshangabad district where protesters under the banner of the Krantikari Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan (KKMS) raised slogans and demanded a rollback of the laws. In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine has extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities. Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) also remained closed in many parts of the state. The state government appealed to protesters to not disrupt public transport services and buses and local trains were unaffected till afternoon.  “…The situation needs to be created to put pressure on the government, and to achieve this, farmers need to hit the streets. But no one should resort to violence," said social activist Anna Hazare who went on daylong fast in his village Ralegan Siddhi village in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district. In several parts of the country, including in Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded. In BJP-ruled Go as well, markets remained open and public transport was also normal. The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bharat-bandh-life-hit-in-some-states-as-farmers-take-national-centerstage-924830.html

Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three farm laws. Pawar's NCP is among the parties that have backed Tuesday 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmers' unions.   "Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind," Pawar told reporters. On Monday, the BJP said Pawar, who was agriculture minister in the UPA government, had asked states to amend the APMC Act and had even warned them that the Centre will not provide financial assistance in absence of the three reforms. It also cited letters written by Pawar during his tenure as agriculture minister to buttress the point. The NCP said after taking over as Union agriculture minister, Pawar had tried to form a broader consensus amongst state agriculture marketing boards by inviting suggestions for the implementation of the act. "The benefit of farmers as per the model APMC Act was explained (by Pawar) to various state governments and many state governments came forward to implement it. Farmers across the country are gaining from the implementation of the act which was fine-tuned by Pawar to protect farmers' interests," the party had said. On Tuesday, Pawar met Defence Rajnath Singh and the discussions were believed to be held pertaining to land acquisition for the Purandar airport in Pune district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-parties-to-meet-president-to-raise-concerns-over-farm-bills-sharad-pawar-924831.html
08-12-2020||National Politics||Lukewarm response for Bharat Bandh in BJP-ruled Gujarat||Several rural pockets of Gujarat remained shut on Tuesday, while urban and semi-urban localities were largely unaffected by the 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmer unions over the Centre's new agri laws and supported by the opposition Congress. Markets, shops, banks, government and private offices and other commercial establishments functioned normally in most parts of the BJP-ruled state. Though a majority of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) remained open, no auction of products took place at several mandis as traders and commission agents extended their support to the nationwide shutdown against the three farm laws brought by the Modi government. Normal life in major cities remained unaffected as transport services were operational. The BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System) functioned as per schedule in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Surat. About 5,000 petrol pumps remained open in the state as their associations stayed away from the strike. "The shutdown call left no major impact in the state. There are no reports of any violence or any other unwarranted incidents. "Routine life was not affected by the bandh," said an official of the state police control room. A large number of police personnel was deployed across the state to prevent any untoward incident. Authorities imposed section 144 of the CrPC, which bans assembly of more than four persons, at several places in view of the Bharat Bandh. Markets in Kalyanpur town in Devbhumi-Dwarka district, Ranpur in Botad, Jam-Jodhpur of Jamnagar, Nani Devti village near Ahmedabad, Kwant village of Chhotaudepur, Chhani village in Vadodara and some parts of Morbi town remained shut as shopkeepers backed the strike. A mixed response to the bandh call was seen in Dhrol and Lalpur talukas of Jamnagar district along with Bhanwad taluka of Devbhumi-Dwarka district. While most of the APMCs remained open in the state, the Congress-controlled market yards in Amreli, Bhatia town of Devbhumi-Dwarka and Wankaner in Morbi were closed. Over 200 workers of the Congress, including Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani, were detained across the state for either trying to stage demonstrations on roads or forcing shops to down their shutters. They were detained from cities like Amreli, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Surat, Morbi, Dehgam, Bhavnagar and Modasa, said police. Congress MLA Vikram Madam, president of the Gujarat Kisan Congress Pal Ambalia along with 10 other party workers were detained while trying to stage demonstrations in Khambhalia town of Devbhumi-Dwarka district. In Rajkot, some local Congress leaders were taken into custody for attempting to shut shops forcibly, officials said. Despite heavy police deployment on major roads and highways, protesters blocked four highways in rural Gujarat for a brief period by placing burning tyres on them. A highway connecting Ahmedabad to Viramgam was blocked near Sanand by workers from the Congress who placed burning tyres on its stretch, causing a traffic jam. Another group of protesters blocked the Ahmedabad- Vadodara national highway near Chhani village. Later during the day, police detained some Congress workers for burning tyres on the Ahmedabad-Palanpur highway. In a similar incident, a highway connecting Bharuch and Dahej in Bharuch district was blocked near Nandelav by protesters. In Ahmedabad, two motorbikers stopped a city bus near Vijay Crossroads and fled with its keys after threatening the driver, said an official of the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service. While the Gujarat Congress termed the bandh a "success", Chief Minister Vijay Rupani thanked farmers for "not joining" the shutdown. "I had said yesterday itself (that bandh will not be successful). The Congress is showing its double standards. "People have lost faith in the Congress. Neither people nor farmers are with them," Rupani told reporters in Mehsana. "The farm laws Congress leaders are opposing were part of the party's manifesto in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. "What is the Congress' problem if farmers are getting freedom to sell their produce anywhere? People are not with Congress because the party is anti-farmer. "I thank people as well as farmers for not believing in false propaganda of the Congress," said the chief minister. The bandh was called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the Modi government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain in place.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/lukewarm-response-for-bharat-bandh-in-bjp-ruled-gujarat-924889.html
08-12-2020||National Politics||Oppn leaders have consciously decided to stay away from protest sites: Left leaders||Opposition party leaders have taken a conscious decision to stay away from protest sites, Left leaders said on Tuesday as they extended their support to farmer groups who have called a nationwide bandh against the farm laws. The government has accused the opposition parties of supporting the farmers protest for political gains, an allegation denied by the parties, which said that the demands of the farmers were legitimate. "It is a conscious decision on our part to stay away from the protest sites. The farmer groups themselves also told us that they would want it this way. So, we have no party banners at the protest sites. "However, our MPs are there, as parliamentarians, to show solidarity. We do not want to politicise the issue. It's not just the Left parties, but all opposition has taken this call that except MPs no leader will join the farmers," said CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury. Yechury said that party workers are at the spot, but without party posters or banners. However, at the protest sites, banners of politically-aligned farmer groups and other trade unions could be seen on display. CPI general secretary D Raja also said that the farmers' agitation was completely non-political and the absence of political leaders at the sites was a decision taken to highlight that. "We are not sitting at any of the borders because we have decided not to make this struggle political. We are there with them every step of the way. Our workers are there and all our party units are holding rallies and demonstrations. We don't want to politicise it," said Raja. A nationwide strike called by farmer unions against the Centre's agri laws was underway on Tuesday with rousing speeches and sloganeering at Delhi's border points amid tight security arrangements, even as most of the city's markets remained open. Protesting farmers have threatened to block key roads and occupy toll plazas as part of their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' to press for repeal of the new farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/oppn-leaders-have-consciously-decided-to-stay-away-from-protest-sites-left-leaders-924934.html

The BJP observed a 12-hour shutdown in certain parts of north Bengal on Tuesday over the death of its supporter during the rally. Senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee told a press meet that the police was far away from the location of the rally and the wounds on the BJP worker's body was caused by firing from close distance. To buttress his point, Mukherjee quoted from the post mortem report of the dead BJP activist Ulen Roy, who had taken part in the BJYM march in Siliguri. The wounds, he claimed, were caused by pellets fired from a shot gun which is not used by police. Used for shooting birds, it was probably carried by people in the rally to hurt the police. "The post mortem exposes BJP's gameplan of causing large scale disturbances and provoke the police to open fire," Mukherjee, also senior minister in Mamata Banerjee cabinet said. Claiming that the police "kept it's cool despite great provocation by the rallyists", he said "The police used the baton and tear gas as last resort. Police had fired teargas shells and used water cannons on Monday to quell a violent protest called by the Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) against the Mamata Banerjee government during which a BJP worker died. Several protesters and police personnel were injured in the clashes. The BJP had alleged that a party worker identified as Ullen Ray was "beaten to death" by the police during a baton charge and demanded imposition of President's Rule in West Bengal in view of the "breakdown of law and order". However, police claimed there was no lathicharge. Mukherjee said "BJP has turned mad in the pursuit of power. They are resorting to falsehood just for the sake of power. But the people of Bengal will vote to power the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress for the third term." "BJP is trying to foment trouble in Siliguri and other places in north Bengal today in the name of strike," he said. On the issue of Bharat Bandh called by farmers bodies and supported by almost all opposition parties, Mukherjee said "Though TMC is against any strike we support it this time due to the cause and factors which necessitated this shutdown call." "TMC believes not only a movement of farmers, the strike is all about bread and butter issue of ordinary farmers and the common man. We are also protesting by coming out in the street by holding sit-ins," he said. "We are holding protests in 344 blocks for three days from today and near Gandhi statue in the city. Our MPs had protested in both houses of Parliament as the three farm bill's were passed by the Centre. Our MP (Derek O'Brien) had also expressed solidarity by visiting the agitating farmers near the Delhi border," he said. To a question, Mukherjee without naming BJP said, "We had all along known politics is done by the son of the soil. Now we witness people from outside the state are being brought for political activities."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-resorting-to-politics-of-bandh-says-tmcs-subrata-mukherjee-924980.html

08-12-2020||National Politics||Centre tried its best to ensure I don’t step out to support protesting farmers: Kejriwal||After hours of protests by the AAP for allegedly putting Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest, the Delhi chief minister on Tuesday addressed party members and claimed the Centre tried its best to ensure that he does not step out as his plan was to sit in solidarity with the protesting farmers. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) earlier in the day alleged that Delhi Police has put Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border, a claim denied by the city police. After hours of drama outside his residence, the AAP supremo came outside and addressed the party members. "If I was not stopped, I would have gone and supported the protesting farmers in their Bharat Bandh movement. I am glad that Bharat Bandh was a success. I prayed for the protesting farmers while sitting inside,” he said. Kejriwal said the Centre tried its best to ensure that he does not step out. "They tried their best to ensure that I do not step out. If they would not have stopped me, I would have gone to support the protesting farmers... I hope the Centre agrees to the farmers’ demand and make a law on MSP so that our farmers do not suffer any more," he said. "We received a lot of pressure to allow the use of stadiums as temporary prisons, but we did not give permission and I feel this helped the movement. But since then the Centre has been very angry," Kejriwal said. He asked all party members to serve the farmers selflessly. "I want to congratulate you all for serving the farmers as ‘sewadaars’. We had clearly told that no one should wear the party's caps and take AAP's name. We will go there as Indians and as patriots. The farmers serve us. It is the first time that we got a chance to serve them. I also went there as a sewadaar yesterday. This further angered the Centre,” the chief minister asserted. Kejriwal said he was happy that the entire nation collectively came in support of the farmers movement. "The call for Bharat Bandh by the farmers was highly successful. People from across the nation supported the bandh in their own way. The AAP volunteers and the people of Delhi also supported the movement, and I want to congratulate the farmers and the people of the country for this. “I am happy the entire nation collectively came in support of the movement of the farmers, it represented unity. I wanted to spend some time on the border with the farmers today, not as a CM, but as a sewadar,” he said. “I wanted to show my support to them by sitting with them for half-an-hour or so. I think they (Centre) got to know about my plan, and so they did not let me go. But even though I could not go, I was praying from my home for the movement of the nation to be successful,” the CM added. The AAP leader also hit out at the Union government for stopping the farmers when they were moving towards the national capital. “A few days back, we had received a proposal of the central government. First of all, they tried to stop the farmers in every city of Haryana when the farmers were moving towards Delhi. They used water cannons and tear gas shells on the farmers and set up barricades to stop them, but our farmers defied all the hurdles and reached Delhi. “The Centre then decided to let the farmers enter Delhi, and they asked the Delhi government for permission to convert nine stadiums in the city into jails,” he said. Kejriwal also mentioned the Anna movement and how its supporters were “put in these big stadiums which were converted into jails”. “I suddenly could not help, but recall the Anna Andolan, and how we were put in these big stadiums which were converted into jails. They put us in jails and tried to weaken the movement. “In the same way, I knew that they would put the farmers into jails to weaken their movement. There was a lot of pressure on us, we received calls from various sources. But we decided to stand in support of the farmers, which I think helped the farmer's movement,” he added. "A country where the farmers and the soldiers are sad can never progress. We have to keep politics aside and help the farmers, serve them and stand by them till their movement continues," the AAP supremo added. Addressing a press conference outside Kejriwal's residence, Sisodia earlier in the day claimed that he and several party MLAs were not allowed to meet the CM. He and some AAP members were later allowed to go inside the CM’s residence. The city police, however, denied the charges of keeping Kejriwal under house arrest. The Opposition BJP and Congress called the so-called house arrest of Kejriwal a "political gimmick". Delhi BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar said the AAP is indulging in politics of lies and betrayal. "AAP is constantly doing politics of lies and betrayal. Yesterday, CM Kejriwal went to Singhu border and he also went to a party in the evening. This is the video. They are calling resting at home as house arrest," he tweeted and posted a purported video of Kejriwal's residence. Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said, "It is a gimmick. How can he go out in support of Bharat Bandh when his own government has notified the new farm law? He must be waiting for Amit Shah's permission before leaving his residence." Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws failed to cut ice with farmer groups during the fifth round of talks on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-tried-its-best-to-ensure-i-don-t-step-out-to-support-protesting-farmers-kejriwal-925070.html

Farmer leaders have said emergency services will be exempted, and appealed to their affiliates to not force anyone to join the shutdown. Protesting farmers will block key roads and occupy toll plazas during their 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm. "The security across the national capital, especially on bordering areas, has been beefed up," a senior police officer said. He said that there is maximum deployment of Delhi Police personnel in the city to ensure normal movement of people on the roads so that no one faces any kind of inconvenience. Taking to Twitter, DCP (traffic western range) said, "Tikri, Jharoda Borders, Dhansa are closed for any Traffic Movement. Badusarai Border is open only for light motor vehicle like Cars and two wheelers. Jhatikara Border is open only for two wheeler traffic @dtptraffic." In another tweet, the police said available open borders to Haryana are Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Palam Vihar and Dundahera. On Monday, Bhartiya Kisan Ekta Sangathan president Jagjit singh Dallewala appealed to farmers to maintain peace and not to enter into any scuffle to enforce the bandh. "The Modi government will have to accept our demands. We want nothing less than withdrawal of the new farm laws," farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bharat-bandh-delhi-police-beefs-up-security-at-border-points-markets-among-other-places-924744.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||SC allows Centre, NHAI to go ahead with 8-lane Chennai-Salem expressway||The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the Union government was free to notify any land as highway or create a new highway for securing a social order and promotion of welfare of the people in the concerned region. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari allowed the Centre to go ahead with Rs 10,000-crore Chennai-Krishnagiri-Salem eight-lane expressway under the 'Bharatmala Pariyojana'. "The central government is fully competent to notify “any land” (not necessarily an existing road/highway) for acquisition, to construct a highway to be a national highway," the court said. It set aside a Madras High Court's order of 2019 that quashed notification under the National Highways Act, 1956, proposing acquisition of land for the project. "The central government is free to construct or build a new national highway... so as to empower the people of that area including provisioning new economic opportunities in the area through which the national highway would pass and the country’s economy as a whole," the court said. "The availability of a highway in any part of the State paves way for sustainable development and for overall enhancement of human well-being including to facilitate the habitants there at to enjoy a decent quality of life, creation of assets (due to natural increase in market value of their properties) and to fulfil their aspirations of good life by provisioning access to newer and present-day opportunities," the court added. The top court's judgement came on a batch of petitions filed by the Union government and the National Highways Authority of India. The court, however, agreed with the High Court that until the acquisition process was completed and possession of land was taken, the question of altering the mutation entry merely on the basis of notification cannot be countenanced. Going through the 1956 Act, the court said there was nothing, which impelled the central government to obtain prior environment clearance before exercise of the power expressing its intention to acquire the designated land. The court said, however, it would be open to the executing agency, NHAI, to make an application for environmental clearance, alongside the acquisition process. The Union government claimed the acquisition process initiated under the 1956 Act, a self-contained code, was completely independent and cannot be fusioned with the formalities and procedure before commencement of the project. The 277.30 km highway faced stiff opposition from activists, farmers and residents alleging loss of agricultural land and damage to forest, flora and fauna. The project, approved in February, 2018, was expected to cut down travel time between Chennai and Salem. The land owners claimed the state government was keen on developing Chennai-Madurai section and Chennai-Salem was not part of the original Bharatmala Pariyojna-project Phase I. The high court, in its judgement on April 8, 2019 on a batch of writ petitions by P V Krishnamoorthy and others, including PMK leader A Ramadoss, said the projection on benefits of the highway were illusory. In its 140-page judgement, the top court noted that the traffic from Chennai bound to Salem-Coimbatore and Pallakad, Kerala, currently used the Chennai Krishnagiri section of the Golden Quadrilateral (Chennai-Bengaluru) and the Krishnagiri-Salem section of the North-South corridor, congesting Chennai-Krishnagiri section. The Bharamala Pariyojna Phase I was conceived after a scientific study as a comprehensive project at the macro (national) level for 24,800 kms in Phase I, spanning over a period of 5 years (2017-18 to 2021-22) at an estimated outlay of Rs 5,35,000 crores.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-allows-centre-nhai-to-go-ahead-with-8-lane-chennai-salem-expressway-924767.html

On Monday, “very dense” fog had lowered visibility in some areas to “zero” metres. The Safdarjung and Palam weather stations recorded a visibility of 300 metres due to “moderate” fog at 8:30 am, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The visibility should be around 800 metres at the airport for flights to take off, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre. According to the IMD, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres, 51 and 200 is “dense”, 201 and 500 “moderate”, and 501 and 1,000 “shallow”. The mercury is likely to dip further with the wind direction changing to westerly-northwesterly. These icy cold winds blow from snow-laden western Himalayas towards the plains. Delhi's air quality was recorded in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Tuesday. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 393 at 9 am on Tuesday. The 24-hour average was 400 on Monday, 389 on Sunday and 404 on Saturday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 436), Greater Noida (415) and Noida (414) remained in the “severe” zone for the third consecutive day. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The IMD said the maximum wind speed will be around 12 kmph on Tuesday. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/moderate-fog-in-delhi-minimum-temp-dips-below-10-degrees-celsius-imd-924783.html

Mufti’s daughter Ilitija said that the PDP chief wanted to visit remote areas of Budgam where Gujjar families are being evicted. “But a heavy contingent of police and paramilitary forces reached our Gupkar residence and locked the main entry gate,” she said. The former chief minister also posted a video on her Twitter handle showing the main gate of her Fairview’ residence in the Gupkar area of the city locked by the police. “Illegal detention has become GOIs favourite go to method for muzzling any form of opposition. Ive been detained once again because I wanted to visit Budgam where hundreds of families were evicted from their homes (sic),” she tweeted. In another tweet, she alleged, “GOI wants to continue inflicting oppression & zulm on the people of J&K without any questions asked.” On November 26, Mufti was stopped in similar circumstances when she wanted to visit the residence of party’s youth president Waheed Para, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) last month for allegedly seeking help from the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit in seeking their support in the 2019 Parliamentary elections. Police had denied the allegation of keeping Mufti under house arrest by saying she was stopped due to “security reasons.” State Election Commissioner (SEC) K K Sharma had recently said that Mufti being the former chief minister needs to follow the proper security protocol while venturing out of her home.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mehbooba-mufti-put-under-house-detention-again-924785.html

Security was beefed up across the country and mainly in the national capital with heavy police deployment at the Delhi borders to curb violence. Farmer leaders, however, had said that the emergency services would be exempted and appealed others not to force anyone to join the strike.  Ahead of the nationwide strike, the Union Ministry had issued an advisory directing the states to ensure law and order to be maintained amid the coronavirus pandemic. As the protests across the country continue, here are 10 developments during the bandh: 1) Farmers stop trains in Maharashtra and Odisha: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna members stopped the Chennai-Ahmedabad Navjeevan Express at Malkapur station in Buldhana district while protesting against the farm laws. 2) Highways blocked: A highway connecting Ahmedabad to Viramgam was blocked near Sanand by protesters from the Congress party who placed burning tyres on roads, causing a traffic jam. Another group of protesters blocked a national highway in Vadodara. In another incident, a highway connecting Bharuch and Dahej in Bharuch district was similarly blocked near Nandelav by protesters. 3) Anna Hazare sits on hunger-strike: Social activist Anna Hazare on Tuesday sat on a day-long hunger strike to support agitating farmers who have called Bharat Bandh demanding the repeal of the Centre's farm laws. Hazare also said that the agitation should spread across the country so that the government comes under pressure to act in the interests of cultivators. 4) Railway tracks/roads blocked: Supporters of the Congress and Left parties blocked railway tracks at several places and held sit-ins on roads in West Bengal. In Kolkata, CPI(M) activists along with SFI and DYFI members blocked roads in Lake Town, College Street, Jadavpur and Shyambazar Five-Point Crossing. 5) Shops shut: Shops and commercial establishments remained shut at many places in Punjab and other states. Petroleum dealers in Punjab closed filling stations to back the call for the nationwide strike.  6) Normal life hit: Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. Many organisations in the state have come in support of the bandh called by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene (Green Brigade). 7) Parties support bandh: In Bihar, railway tracks, highways and roads across were teeming with supporters of the bandh. RJD supporters and workers of Pappu Yadav's Jan Adhikar Party fanned out to various parts of Patna, forcing shopkeepers to down their shutters and deflating tyres of vehicles plying on the roads. 8) Exams postponed: All examinations scheduled on December 8 under Osmania University jurisdiction were postponed. The revised schedule would be given in due course of time. 9) Widespread demonstrations: Demonstrations were held at several regions including Chennai, Tiruchirappalli, Thanjavur, Cuddalore and neighbouring Puducherry in which farmers bodies and DMK's allies including the Congress, the CPI(M), CPI and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi took part. 10) Section 144 imposed: Section 144 was imposed in all rural areas of Lucknow ahead of Bharat Bandh. The authorities have prohibited gatherings along with demonstrations, protests, or dharna in Uttar Pradesh's capital. Apart from the ongoing protests, Aam Aadmi Party, earlier today released a statement saying the Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was placed under house arrest by the Delhi Police. However, Delhi Police refuted these claims.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bharat-bandh-10-key-developments-to-know-924808.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||SC stays contempt notice against Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a contempt notice issued against Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari by the Uttarakhand High Court on a plea alleging his failure to pay market rent of about Rs 47 lakh for a government bungalow.  The accommodation was allocated to him as a former chief minister.  A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R F Nariman stayed the notice and tagged the matter with a pending petition. Koshyari, sitting Governor of Maharasthra, in his petition, filed through advocates Ardhendhu Mauli Prasad and Pravesh Thakur, had sought a stay on the High Court order.  The plea cited Article 361 of the Constitution which gave protection to President and Governors from invoking any such proceedings. The plea also contended that the market rent was exorbitant and it has been computed without any rationale. The process of determination of market rent has been arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of principles of natural justice, he said.  He also said the order by the High Court was passed without hearing him in the matter.  On October 26, the Supreme Court had already stayed the contempt proceedings against Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank initiated by the High Court for occupying the government bungalow after demitting office as Chief Minister without rent. The High Court had on May 3, last directed the former CMs to pay market rent for the period on which they occupied the government bungalows after demitting office. A PIL was first filed by Uttar Pradesh-based NGO 'Lok Prahari' in the top court which led to a verdict on August 1, 2016, against the allotment of bungalows to ex-CMs in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-stays-contempt-notice-against-maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-924815.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||SP workers take to streets in Uttar Pradesh to support 'Bharat Bandh'||Samajwadi Party (SP) workers came out on the streets of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, raising slogans in support of the 'Bharat Bandh' called by agitating farmers to press for repeal of the Centre's agri laws, leading to clashes with police at many places. Leaders of the opposition party also sat on a silent protest under the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan here to back the nationwide protest call. SP MLCs Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it. SP leader and former UP minister Arvind Singh Gope, meanwhile, told PTI that he has been put under house arrest in Barabanki. There were reports of clashes between police personnel and SP workers in Basti, Bahraich, Gorakhpur, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Etawah and other districts of the state. In Basti, police allegedly resorted to baton charge. A senior state government official, however, said the situation was peaceful. Throwing his weight behind the protesting farmers, Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit said that instead of resolving problems faced by them, attempts were being made to blame them. "A person who speaks about farmers' interest will rule the country. Days of handing a 'lollipop' to farmers and alluring them have gone. The way in which the farmers have been beaten up is not acceptable. If any farmer is beaten up in any part of the country, then farmers across the country will protest. Instead of resolving the problems being faced by the farmers, attempts are being made to blame them. This will prove costly," Dixit said in a statement. The people of the country get their food only because the "annadata" (farmer) toils hard in the field in extreme heat, cold and incessant rainfall, he said, adding "his efforts should not be ridiculed". Dixit also claimed that the minimum support price announced by the government has never reached the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. "The government has to revamp its style of working, otherwise the issue of doubling the income of the farmers will only remain a day dream," he said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws for the last 13 days. The bandh has been called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament recently. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sp-workers-take-to-streets-in-uttar-pradesh-to-support-bharat-bandh-924817.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Bharat Bandh affects life in Bihar, highways, railway tracks blocked||Railway tracks, highways and roads across Bihar were teeming with supporters of the 'Bharat Bandh', which affected normal life in the state on Tuesday with the opposition parties extending support to the protest led by the farmers' unions against the Centre's farm laws. Police were deployed in large numbers across the state to ensure that the movement of essential goods and services remained unhindered. RJD supporters, and workers of Pappu Yadav's Jan Adhikar Party fanned out to various parts of Patna, forcing shopkeepers to down their shutters and deflating tyres of vehicles plying on the roads. Many bandh supporters were seen carrying party flags, much to the embarrassment of their leaders who said that instructions were in place "not to give a political colour" to the support extended to the bandh. In Jehanabad, the movement of Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police. Burning tyres were placed on National Highway 110 and 83, resulting in the disruption of traffic, leading to long queues of vehicles. In Nawada, cadres of the Congress, the CPI and CPI(ML) hit the streets, raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanding the withdrawal of the agriculture laws terming these as "anti-farmer". Similar scenes were witnessed in the Khagaria district. The state police headquarters here said instructions had been issued to all district police chiefs late on Monday to firmly crackdown on any attempts to disrupt essential services and delivery of essential items. Neeraj Kumar, MLC of the ruling JD(U), said the opposition parties in the state were seeking "revenge" from the people for their defeat in the recently-held assembly polls. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari countered, claiming party activists have been asked to observe the bandh peacefully, and report to the administration "any attempts by anti-social elements to indulge in mischief and bring a bad name to the party".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bharat-bandh-affects-life-in-bihar-highways-railway-tracks-blocked-924821.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Fruit growers in Kashmir join Bharat Bandh call by farmers||Fruit growers and farmer unions in Kashmir Tuesday joined Bharat Bandh called by farmers who are seeking the repeal of three recent farm laws which they say are against their interests. Reports said the fruit growers and traders shut all the activities on Tuesday, especially in the fruit markets across the Valley in support of the bandh. At Sopore fruit mandi, the second-largest in Asia after Azadpur in Delhi, the traders had shut their shops to extend their support to the Bharat Bandh call.  President of fruit growers and dealers association of fruit mandi Sopore, Fayaz Ahmad Malik said, “In support of bandh call of farmers we closed all the activities today. We appeal to the Central government that in view of the sentiments of farmers the newly-framed farm laws should be rolled back immediately.” Bashir Ahmad Basheer, Chairman Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Cum Dealers Union (KVFGU), which is an Umbrella Body of all Fruit Associations of Kashmir said there is an apprehension right now across India that the new farm laws will have serious ramifications. “Kashmir’s horticulture is the mainstay of Jammu and Kashmir’s economy and our eight lakh people are directly involved with it. With the implementation of these new laws, farmers will indirectly become employees of corporates who would drive the sector as per their whims and wishes,” he said while extending full support to the Bharat Bandh call. The fruit season in Kashmir is at its peak and growers after harvest sell thousands of boxes in the fruit mandis which have been established in the Valley at different places. Elsewhere, in solidarity with the farmers protesting against “anti-farmer” laws, J&K Kissan Tehreek members joined nation-wide Bharat Bandh and held protest rallies across the union territory on Tuesday. A spokesperson of Tehreek said while maintaining social distancing norms, its members held demonstrations against the “anti-farmer approach” of the BJP government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/fruit-growers-in-kashmir-join-bharat-bandh-call-by-farmers-924847.html

08-12-2020||North and Central||Whistleblower sets himself ablaze to protest police inaction against illicit liquor mafia||Allegedly frustrated over the failure of the police to act against the illicit liquor mafia, which had been threatening him after he had tipped off the cops about their activities, a whistleblower set himself ablaze near the police chief's office in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad town, about 350 kilometres from here. The whistleblower, identified as Asif, a resident of Asalatpura locality in the town, suffered extensive burn injuries and was battling for life at a hospital in Delhi. Police sources here said that Asif, an auto rickshaw driver, had tipped off the cop about the activities of the illicit liquor mafia in his area. The police later raided their hideouts and recovered large quantities of illicit liquor. The members of the mafia, however, upon coming to know that it was Asif who had informed the cops, had been threatening to kill him. Asif approached the cops with his complaint and asked them to act against the mafia, but the latter failed to take any action. On Sunday, Asif poured kerosene oil over himself and set himself ablaze near the district police chief's office in protest against their alleged inaction, sources said. The cops who were present at the SSP office, managed to douse the flames, but by then Asif had suffered extensive burn injuries. He was rushed to the medical college in Meerut town, from where he was shifted to Delhi on Monday after his condition deteriorated, sources said. According to the doctors his condition was very critical. Police officials in Moradabad said that they were investigating the matter. "We are trying to ascertain if there was a failure on the part of the police in acting against the illicit liquor mafia", said an official.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/whistleblower-sets-himself-ablaze-to-protest-police-inaction-against-illicit-liquor-mafia-924861.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Bharat Bandh: Farmers block highways in Punjab, Haryana; shops, petrol pumps closed||Farmers blocked national highways and other key roads at many places in Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday as part of the their nationwide protest to press for repeal of the Centre's new agri marketing laws. Shops and commercial establishments remained closed at most places in Punjab and several places in Haryana as traders backed the agitating farmers. Public and private transport services remained shut in Punjab. In neighbouring Haryana, inter-state and intra-state bus services were disrupted. Petroleum dealers in the twin states kept filling stations closed to support the 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmer unions. Agitating farmers blocked several key roads, including Chandigarh-Delhi, Amritsar-Delhi, Hisar-Delhi and Bhiwani-Delhi national highways. They parked tractors, trucks and other vehicles in the middle of the carriageways. Carrying placards, the protesters squatted on key roads and raised slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre. There were sit-ins at toll plazas in several places. The road blockades led to inconvenience to commuters across both states, including Chandigarh. In BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, opposition Congress and Indian National Lok Dal have extended their support to the 'Bharat Bandh'. Police personnel have been deployed in adequate strength to maintain law and order, officials said. In Punjab, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu took part in a protest on Landran road in Mohali. Jakhar accused the central government of "ruining" the farming community with the new legislations. Farmer leaders in the state appealed to shopkeepers and traders to keep their shutters down during the bandh. “We are appealing to people to support the farmers' cause, and we are sure of getting support from all sections of the society," a leader of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee said in Amritsar. Several unions representing government employees, arthiyas (commission agents) and transporters have extended their support to the protest. Besides, all major political parties in Punjab — the ruling Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal — have also backed the farmers. Over 50,000 government employees in the state have taken mass casual leave in support of farmers, claimed Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, an apex gurdwara body, has also announced to keep its offices and institutions closed. In Haryana, police had issued a travel advisory stating that people might face traffic blockades on various roads and highways of the state. Haryana Roadways officials said their services were hit by the blockades. The Roadways' bus service towards Punjab has been suspended for the day. Buses on many routes towards Himachal Pradesh which pass through Punjab have also been suspended. In Ambala, the wholesale cloth market, Sarafa market and the grain market were closed even as some others were open. Shops at many places in Rohtak, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Bhiwani and Hisar districts also remained closed. In Chandigarh, Congress workers held a protest at the Hallomajra Chowk in support of the farmers bandh call. Traffic volume on the national highways passing through Haryana, including Ambala-Chandigarh, was stated to be comparatively less as many avoided travelling during the Bandh hours. Haryana Petroleum Dealers' Association state president Sanjeev Chaudhary said all petrol pumps, barring the 11 directly operated by the government, remained closed to extend support to the farmers. However, he said, supplies were not being stopped for emergency vehicles like those of the Fire department and ambulances, and also for those that are part of marriage processions etc. Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni has appealed to all sections of the society to observe a complete shutdown to support the farmers. "Everyone should hold a peaceful protest," he said in a video message. The Haryana Police traffic advisory issued on Monday had said "the main national highways, Delhi-Ambala (NH-44), Delhi-Hisar (NH-9), Delhi-Palwal (NH-19) and Delhi to Rewari (NH-48), may also see some traffic disruptions for a short time. The peak time of impact is expected to be between 12 pm to 3 pm". Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other areas have stayed put at various Delhi border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bharat-bandh-farmers-block-highways-in-punjab-haryana-shops-petrol-pumps-closed-924882.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Some Delhi auto, taxi unions join Bharat Bandh; movement largely unaffected||Public transport services in the national capital remained largely unaffected during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday even though some auto and taxi unions kept their vehicles off the roads in support of the shutdown called by farmers protesting against the new agri laws. Kamaljeet Gill, the President of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi which represents drivers working with app-based cab aggregators, claimed most of its members were on strike. "There are around 4 lakh app-based cabs in Delhi-NCR. Most of our members are on strike," he said. Many users of app-based cab services though said they did not face much difficulty in booking rides. "The wait time for Ola and Uber was like any other day. I did not have to wait much or face any issues today," said Pradip Dubey, a commuter. Autorickshaws were also easily available on the roads, said some other commuters. Sanjay Samrat, the President of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association, said drivers associated with several unions including those affiliated to Delhi State Taxi Cooperative Society and Kaumi Ekta Welfare Association were on strike. "Our strike in Support of Bharat Bandh has been successful, claimed Samrat. The members of striking auto, taxi unions held an 'Akhand Paath' at Bangla Sahib gurudwara praying for the wellbeing of farmers and drivers, he said. However, other auto and taxi unions claimed the strike did not have any impact on transport facilities in Delhi. "All our autos and taxis are running normally and the strike has no impact at all. We support the farmers and their demands, but strike causes problems only to ordinary people," said Rajender Soni, the general secretary of the Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union. The auto and taxi services were normal at places like airport, bus stations and railway stations, he claimed. The IGI airport taxi union president Kishanji also said black and yellow taxi services were normal and it was not part of the strike. Agitating farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during their 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm as part of their stir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/some-delhi-auto-taxi-unions-join-bharat-bandh-movement-largely-unaffected-924886.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Bharat Bandh evokes mixed response in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh||The 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmer unions and supported by the Congress and other organisations evoked a mixed response in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday barring sporadic protests. In Gwalior district, police used water cannons to disperse agitators who were led by a Congress leader. Shops remained open in several cities even as Congress workers took out rallies appealing shop-keepers to down shutters. In Morena, the Lok Sabha constituency of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, the bandh evoked a mixed response as farmers couldn't reach the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) to sell their produce. The functioning of APMCs in many parts of the central Indian state, including in Bhopal, was affected as farmers failed to reach the market yards to sell their produce. Bhopal vegetable market, however, functioned normally. In Gwalior, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers staged a sit-in protest outside the residence of Tomar, following which police detained 50 of them. In Bhopal, farmers tried to take out a march on the residence of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan under the banner of the Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangh, but police stopped it midway at Chunabhattiarea. Congress workers led by former union minister Arun Yadav and District Congress Committee (DCC) president Kailash Mishra led a protest in Bhopal's New Market area. Mishra claimed that most of the markets in Old Bhopal remained closed as part of the shutdown. He said workers of the Congress urged shopkeepers to down shutters in different areas. However, most of the shops in Bhopal remained open. Yadav said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should meet farmers, who are staging protestson the borders of Delhi in biting cold, and sort out their problems. "The Centre should withdraw the three anti-farmer laws. The congress is with agriculturists," he said. In Indore, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh led a demonstration at Sanyogitaganj Anaj Mandi where slogans were raised against the Narendra Modi government. "After introducing demonetisation and GST, the Modi government, in order to benefit big persons, has brought these black laws in the agriculture sector. Besides farmers, labourers working in mandis (agri markets) have hit the roads in protest," Singh told a gathering. He also discussed the new farm laws with farmers and others working in market yards. In Dabra in Gwalior district, Congress MLA Suresh Raje led a protest and burnt an effigy of the Central government, prompting the police to use water cannons on protesters. The shutdown also evoked a mixed response in Sheopur, Narsinghpur, Tikamgarh, Vidisha, Rajgarh, Rewa, Bhind, Shahdol, Hoshangabad and other districts even as protests were held by the Congress and farmers. Markets in Guna, Barwani, Mandsaur, Jhabua, Umaria and some other districts remained open. Earlier in the day, protests were held in Seoni-Malwa area in Hoshangabad district. The protesters under the banner of the Krantikari Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan (KKMS) raised slogans and demanded repeal of the new agriculture laws. State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal told PTI the bandh failed to make any impact in Madhya Pradesh. "The Congress made a failed attempt to mislead farmers. The Congress supported the farm reforms while it was in power, but changed its stand when in opposition. This exposes the double standards of the Congress," he said. The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bharat-bandh-evokes-mixed-response-in-bjp-ruled-madhya-pradesh-924903.html

Markets and business activities were partially affected at other places such as Kota, Jodhpur and Bikaner. Shops in a few towns in Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar were closed to support the farmer unions' call for a nationwide strike against the Centre's agri laws, while others were open as usual. Roadways buses, trucks and mini buses were seen plying on the roads as well as auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws. In Jaipur, NSUI members holding a demonstration in support of protesting farmers clashed with BJP Yuva Morcha workers outside the saffron party's office. Workers of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress, had assembled outside the BJP state headquarters to hold a demonstration, and members from both sides confronted each other and clashed. "We were holding a peaceful demonstration but the Yuva Morcha members hit some of our members," NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati charged. DCP Manoj Kumar said some protestors tried to forcefully enter the BJP office and were stopped by police. He said the situation is under control, and added that there was no stone-pelting incident. BJP state president Satish Poonia condemned the incident. "Congress party's support to 'Bharat Bandh' is unfortunate. At the behest of the government, the goons of the Congress pelted stones at the BJP office today. The chief minister wants to create chaos. Today's incident is condemnable," he said in a video message. Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyaws and his supporters visited markets in the state capital on tractors and other vehicles and appealed to the shopkeepers to participate in the bandh called by farmers. The minister, who was seen driving a tractor, passed through several markets, including Sodala, MI road and in the walled city area. Another vehicle rally was taken out in Malviya Nagar and JLN Road to show solidarity with the protesting farmers. The members were holding placards that read "No Farmers, No Food". Shops in several markets of Jaipur had opened in the morning but they were forced to shut later, locals alleged. Shopping malls and some restaurants were closed as well. In Kota, Congress workers, led by the local leader Ravinder Tyagi, marched in the main markets and appealed to business and trade organisations and shopkeepers to support the farmers' protest.   In Bikaner, most business establishments were open, barring the shops in the main markets at the district headquarters. Mandis were closed. Jodhpur division also witnessed a partial impact of the strike. The bandh has been called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament recently. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mixed-reaction-to-bharat-bandh-call-in-rajasthan-bjp-congress-workers-clash-in-jaipur-924916.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Mixed response to Bharat Bandh in UP; SP workers protest in number of districts||The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions, protesting the three Central agri laws, drew a mixed response in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even holding up a train in Allahabad. Samajwadi Party leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow in support of the bandh. SP MLCs Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it. However, life in state capital remained mostly unaffected with District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash saying that attendances in offices were absolutely normal. "The impact (of the Bharat Bandh) was zero in Lucknow as all the markets were open. The mandis were also open," he said. Ashish Tripathi, a lawyer, said it was a normal day for him and his colleagues, and it took them almost the same time their office as on any other day. "Banking activity in the state was also by and large normal and there was no impact of Bharat Bandh," Dilip Chauhan, the UP General Secretary of All India Bank Officers' Confederation told PTI on Tuesday. Regional Manager of UPSRTC P K Bose said, "Passenger flow was less on Tuesday as compared to other days. However, operation-wise it was a normal day for us." Samajwadi Party workers came out on the streets of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, raising slogans in support of the 'Bharat Bandh', leading to clashes with police at many places. They stopped the Bundelkhand Express at Prayagraj station, and raised slogans while sitting on the railway track. Allahabad Superintendent of Police (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh said, "Those who tried to hold up the Bundelkhand Express were taken into custody and the train later departed. Our teams are patrolling railway and bus stations and important places. So far, there has been no blockade of traffic and all markets are open." Abhilash Basak, who runs a tour and travel agency in Allahabad, said, "Almost all the shops in the Civil Lines area are open and it is a normal day for us. Heavy police force has been deployed in the area." Around 14 Samajwadi Party leaders in Banda were put under house arrest, while in Chitrakoot district, some SP workers who tried to stage a protest were arrested, police said. Some SP leaders in Mahoba were under house arrest from Monday itself. The call for bandh did not evoke any response in Amethi and Kaushambi as shops were open and business activities were normal. Shops remained open in Hamirpur, Jalaun and Lalitpur as well. In Bundelkhand the response to the call for bandh was partial and in Mau shops remained closed. In Mainpuri, lawyers abstained from work and the business at the wholesale grain market was affected, while for other establishments in the district it was a normal day. In Aligarh, hundreds of farmers squatted on a road leading to the Yamuna Expressway and blocked traffic for several hours. Samajwadi Party leader and former Lok Sabha MP from Aligarh Brijendra Singh and a group of party workers were arrested when they squatted a the crossing on the Exhibition Road in solidarity with the protesting farmers, police said. Despite some protests by SP and Congress workers in Gorakhpur, shops were open and traffic was as usual, while there was normal attendance in private and government offices. Police said that some political leaders and workers were detained for maintaining law and order. City Magistrate Abhinav Ranjan Srivastav said, "All markets were open and police and administrative officials were vigilant. Some people who violated section 144 of CrPC (which prevents assembly of five or more people at one spot), were detained to maintain law and order." SP leader and former minister Arvind Singh Gope told PTI that he has been put under house arrest in Barabanki. Senior Congress leader Pradeep Mathur also claimed that he has been arrested along with many party workers in Mathura. There were also reports of Congress leaders and workers being put under house arrest or getting arrested in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Chitrakoot, Saharanpur and Kanpur. A senior state government official, however, asserted that the situation was peaceful in the state. Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit alleged that instead of resolving problems faced by the farmers, attempts were being made to blame them. "This will prove costly," he warned. Dixit alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government never reached the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. "The government has to revamp its style of working, otherwise the issue of doubling the income of the farmers will only remain a day dream," he said. Agitating farmer unions have given a call for a nationwide strike on Tuesday to press for the repeal of the Centre's agri laws with almost all opposition parties and several trade unions backing the it and many announcing parallel protests in support of the farmers. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mixed-response-to-bharat-bandh-in-up-sp-workers-protest-in-number-of-districts-924929.html

08-12-2020||North and Central||Mixed response to 'Bharat Bandh' in Uttarakhand||The 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmer unions against the agri laws evoked a mixed response in Uttarakhand on Tuesday, with little effect seen in the hill districts of Chamoli, Pauri, Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag while the border district of Pithoragarh observed a complete strike.  In the state capital, scores of party workers led by PCC president Pritam Singh marched from the state party office here to Paltan bazar to enforce the bandh but ran into arguments with shop owners who refused to down their shutters. Later they sat on a dharna at the busy clock tower shouting slogans against the new farm laws causing a brief traffic jam in the area. However, police intervened to restore traffic detaining the PCC president along with his supporters and taking them to the police lines. However, most shops in Rajpur road area, the heart of the town remained open. Traffic was also normal except for the brief disruption due to the sit-in by Congress workers.           While the bandh did not have a major impact in Dehradun district with open shops and normal traffic on the roads it produced some effect in parts of Udham Singh Nagar district where farmers' organisations hit the streets to enforce the bandh.  However, there was no disruption of peace anywhere.  Security had been beefed up in all the districts to ensure there was no law and order problem anywhere during the bandh, DGP Ashok Kumar said. Udham Singh Nagar SSP Dilip Singh Kunwar said a strict vigil is being maintained and there is no report of any disturbance from anywhere.  However, shops and business establishments at Jaspur, Kashipur, Bajpur, Gadarpur, Kichcha, Sitarganj, Khatima and Nanakmatta in the district remained shut.   Led by Congress leader Tilak Raj Behad, party workers shouted slogans against the Centre at Rudrapur and demanded withdrawal of the farm laws.          Former municipal council chairperson Meena Sharma, who was seen holding a cut out of a plough as the symbol of farmers in her hands, said the Centre will have to repeal the new farm laws. "We won't tolerate the insult of farmers," she said.  In the hill districts of Uttarakhand like Chamoli, Pauri, Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag the bandh had little effect. However, in the border district of Pithoragarh in Kumaon region the bandh was almost total with the main markets completely closed.  Vehicle owners also kept their vehicles off the road in response to an appeal by bandh supporters, bandh coordinator for the district Susheel Khatri said However, no untoward incident was witnessed in any part of the district, circle officer of Pithoragarh TS Rautela said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mixed-response-to-bharat-bandh-in-uttarakhand-924948.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protests: Lawyers at various Delhi district courts hold protests in solidarity||Lawyers held peaceful protests at various district court complexes in the national capital on Tuesday in support of farmers' agitation against the new farm laws. While lawyers at Karkardooma district courts held a protest march raising slogans to take back the laws, lawyers at Tis Hazari district courts held a meeting in solidarity with the farmers and put forward certain demands on their behalf. At the Tis Hazari protest meeting, advocate Rajiv Khosla, Chief Coordinator of the Action Committee of the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), said the government should put a condition in the farm laws that private companies pay 5 per cent above the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farm produce, and in case of default they may be subjected to criminal action ranging from 3-5 year punishment, said a statement. According to the statement issued jointly by the BCD and the Coordination Committee of all district courts bar association in Delhi, Khosla said the action committee of lawyers would soon give a call for all India agitation in case the demands were not met and soon fix a date for it after consulting with several state Bar councils and Bar associations. According to the statement, Sanjeev Nasiar, Chairman of the Co-ordination Committee, said the government was conspiring to suppress the voice of the people by alleging that every movement against the Centre was led by anti-national people and trying to project through false propaganda via social media that the farmers agitation has been backed by 'Khalistan'. Nasiar further said in the meeting that the Bar Associations stand with the farmer community on their demands and in case the government tried to implicate the farmers in any false case, then the lawyers would provide all legal help to them at all levels. As per the statement, Khosla said the alleged illegal step of the government for getting the disputes adjudicated from Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) and Additional District Magistrate (ADM) instead of Judges was aimed only to deprive the farmers from getting any justice as these officials were always under the thumb and control of ministers and MLAs. He said the government action in deleting the staples - potatoes, tomatoes and onions - from the Essential Commodities Act was allegedly aimed at providing heavy profits to big traders and would deprive the common citizen from purchasing these at an unaffordable price while there would be no penal action against the big traders for keeping them locked in their godowns, the statement said. Advocate Satya Prakash Gautam said around 100 lawyers held a protest march inside the Karkardooma courts premises showing solidarity with the farmers' agitation. “We are with the farmers. If the government or the police takes any illegal and unconstitutional action against them, we will fight with them for free till the Supreme Court if need arises. We demand that the amendment be withdrawn,” Gautam said. Enacted in September, the new farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protests-lawyers-at-various-delhi-district-courts-hold-protests-in-solidarity-924967.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||3 Covid-19 vaccine candidates under active consideration of DCGI: Health Ministry||Three Covid-19 vaccines, developed by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer, are under active consideration of India's drug regulator and there is hope that early licensure is possible for all or any of them, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday. Over the last four days, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech have applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for their Covid-19 vaccines. At a press briefing, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the Covid-19 situation in India has stabilised. With active cases reducing, a "clear-cut declining trend" in the pandemic is being seen even though the situation in many other countries is becoming quite serious, he said. The concern and anxiety following an increase in daily cases of infection in Delhi also looks like to have settled, Paul added. Asked what steps would be followed by the DCGI in the absence of a water-tight emergency use authorisation law for granting licence to vaccine makers, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said not all countries' regulatory framework or rules and acts mention emergency use authorisation. "So, the fact that this phrase is not used in the national regulatory framework of any country does not mean that a specific country would not have an enabling provision to accord an approval which is early and distinct from a regular market approval. "India's regulatory framework has a specific provision for grant of emergency use authorisation, although this phrase is not used," he said. The New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, clearly specifies that under specific special situations, relaxation, abbreviation, omission, or deferment of data including local clinical trial data may be considered for approval. "This is our law. Similarly, other countries too have their laws," Bhushan said. Giving a bird's-eye view of the Indian landscape of Covid-19 vaccines, Bhushan mentioned that eight vaccines are at different stages of development. One is Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca. Phase two and three clinical trials of this vaccine is underway and the firm has applied for emergency use authorisation. Another is Covaxin, which is being indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and is in phase three of clinical trials. It has also applied for emergency use authorisation. The third one is ZyCOV-D, being developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd in Ahmedabad in collaboration with the Centre's Department of Biotechnology and is in phase two of the trials. The fourth vaccine candidate is Sputnik V which is being manufactured by Dr Reddy's Lab, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Russia's Gamaleya National Centre. The phase two trial in India is over and phase three will begin next week. The fifth one is NVX-CoV2373, which is being developed by Serum Institute of India in collaboration with Novavax and its phase three clinical trial is under consideration with the drug regulator. The sixth vaccine candidate is Recombinant Protein Antigen-based vaccine, to be manufactured by Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad, in collaboration with MIT, USA. Its pre-clinical animal studies have concluded and phase one and two human clinical trials have started. Another one is HGCO 19, being manufactured by Genova in Pune in collaboration with HDT, USA. Its pre-clinical animal studies are over and phase one and two clinical trials is set to start. The eighth vaccine is being developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University, USA and it is at the pre-clinical stages. "Another vaccine, which is in the initial stage, is being developed by Aurbindo Pharma. So, there are nine vaccines out of which six are in clinical trials and three are in pre-clinical stage," Bhushan said. "There are multiple vaccine candidates in different stages of development and some may get licensed in the next few weeks. But we cannot foretell at this moment because licensure or market authorization is the domain of the national regulator." Most of the vaccines are of two or three doses to be administered three to four weeks apart. However, even after vaccination, Covid precautions must be taken and this has been advised by WHO also, Bhushan said, adding, "Vaccination does not mean people become carefree." About cold chain infrastructure augmentation, the health secretary said presently the system consists of 85,634 equipment for storage of vaccine at about 28,947 cold chain points across the country. "Current cold chain is capable of storing additional quantity of Covid-19 vaccine required for first the three crore -- healthcare and frontline workers," he said, adding states have collected data of frontline healthcare workers who would get the shots. The data is being uploaded on Co-WIN software, Bhushan said. The ministry, in consultation with states, has assessed the additional requirement for cold chain storage and the first supply of such additional equipment would begin from December 10, the health secretary said. Bhushan said that while 2.38 lakh auxiliary nurse midwives help in vaccination under universal immunisation programme, only 1.54 lakh such health workers will be used for Covid-19 inoculation. Additional vaccinators are being arranged in collaboration with states and UTs, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/3-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-under-active-consideration-of-dcgi-health-ministry-924996.html
08-12-2020||North and Central||Centre's new farm laws 'farmer-friendly', says Shivraj Singh Chouhan||Terming the Centre's new agri laws as "farmer-friendly", Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said only 12 lakh to 13 lakh out of an estimated 80 lakh cultivators in the state sell their crops as per pre-determined minimum support price (MSP). He said many people are spreading "confusion" about the three agricultural-marketing laws enacted a few months ago, but their efforts will not succeed, comments coming on a day when agitating farmers observed a nationwide shutdown to demand a roll-back of the contentious legislations. The Centres farm laws are farmer-friendly. These will not only increase farmers' income significantly but also provide economic security to them. "Procurements (of farm produce) will continue at MSP... there is no question of ending this mechanism. Mandis (agri markets) will also continue to function as usual," Chouhan said. Besides, under the new laws, farmers will benefit as they will be able to sell their produce outside existing mandis at competitive prices, the BJP leader said in a statement. The government is committed to safeguard the interest of farmers and the new laws will prove beneficial to them. There are about 80 lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh, but only 12 lakh to 13 lakh of them sell their crops at MSP," he said. Chouhan said Madhya Pradesh has recorded the highest annual growth rate in the agriculture sector among states in the last few years. The farmers of MP understand that these new agricultural laws are beneficial to them. Many people are spreading confusion (about the laws), but their efforts will not succeed, he said. The chief minister said the Manmohan Singh government was in favour of amending the APMC Act to facilitate entry of private players in the farm sector. NCP president Sharad Pawar, as the Union Agriculture Minister under the Congress-led UPA, had written to CMs, underlining the need to amend the Act to encourage private participation in the key sector for overall interest of farmers, he said. Chouhan said more agricultural produce was purchased at MSP during the last six years of the BJP-led NDA government than under the previous UPA administration (2004-2014).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/centres-new-farm-laws-farmer-friendly-says-shivraj-singh-chouhan-925000.html

The ‘chakka jam’ call by the farmers’ organisations, protesting against the agricultural reforms on the Delhi borders for the 13 days, impacted traffic in Punjab and Haryana and there were reports of farmers squatting on railway tracks in Sangrur in Punjab. In the national capital, agitating farmers blocked traffic at the Delhi-UP border at Ghazipur at Chilla, and the Haryana borders in Tikri and Singhu in West and North Delhi respectively. “We have received reports that the Bandh was observed at 10,000 places across 25 states of the country. This is a nationwide bandh and not limited to Punjab, as claimed by the government,” Yogendra Yadav, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) told reporters at the Singhu Border. While farmers blocked some entry points to the national capital, most markets remained open and public transport also was largely unaffected. The ruling AAP generated some political heat by claiming that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had been kept under house arrest, which was stoutly rejected by the Delhi Police. As many as 24 political parties including the Congress, Akali Dal, AAP, Left outfits had declared their support for the shutdown call and their activists carried out demonstrations denouncing the Modi government across states. In Rajasthan, Congress and BJP workers clashed near the BJP office in Jaipur prompting the police to intervene to calm the scuffling groups. Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar, Smriti Irani, G Kishan Reddy hit out at the opposition parties, accusing them of blocking India’s progress. “Opposition wants anarchy and does not want their duplicity to be exposed. The opposition cried from rooftops that MSP would be scrapped and APMC markets would be shut down. None of this has happened,” Irani told the media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mixed-response-to-bharat-bandh-in-northern-states-925050.html

The DM said he visited rural areas extensively where he interacted with the farmers and was happy that they reciprocated in equal measure without creating problems for the administration. In the urban areas of the district, over 80 activists and leaders of different political parties were detained in the Police Lines area, City Magistrate Manoj Kumar Singh said. A 'Kisan Yatra' taken out, led by the Samajwadi Party, between Jabra and Mant area of the district was stopped as the participants were detained. In support of protests against the farm laws, a peace march of local farmers was taken out in the Yamuna Expressway led by Ram Babu Katelia, president of Bhartiya Kisan Kalyan Samiti. “On December 12, a similar peace march covering 10 kilometres would be taken out on the Yamuna Expressway, by the farmers of the area in case the demand of agitating farmers are not conceded," he stated. The Mant toll plaza was blocked by farmers of the area on both sides for a few hours. After some time, vehicles were allowed to go through but only on one side of the road, SP (Rural) Srish Chand said. There was no work in the courts in support of farmers, said Sunil Kumar Chaturvedi, Secretary of Mathura Bar Association.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-150-politicians-activists-detained-in-mathura-during-bharat-bandh-925062.html

The whistleblower, identified as Asif, a resident of Asalatpura locality in the town, suffered extensive burn injuries and is battling for life at a hospital in Delhi. Police sources in Lucknow said that Asif, an auto-rickshaw driver, had tipped off the cop about the activities of the illicit liquor mafia in his area. The police later raided their hideouts and recovered a large quantity of illicit liquor The members of the mafia, however, upon coming to know that it was Asif, who had informed the cops, had been threatening to kill him. Asif had approached the cops with his complaint and asked them to act against the mafia but the latter failed to take any action. "On Sunday Asif poured kerosene oil over himself and then set himself ablaze near the district police chief's office in protest against their alleged inaction," sources said. The cops, who were present at the SSP office, managed to douse the flames but by then Asif had suffered extensive burn injuries. He was rushed to the medical college in Meerut town and from where he was shifted to Delhi on Monday after his condition deteriorated, sources said. According to the doctors, his condition is very critical. Police officials in Moradabad said that they were investigating the matter.

Movement of trains and vehicles was paralysed after the main Opposition parties, the RJD, Congress and the three Left organisations, hit the streets. In the State Capital, there was a minor skirmish between the police and the bandh supporters, particularly the associates of former MP, Pappu Yadav, who used brute power to enforce bandh. Elsewhere, the Left party workers, particularly those from the CPI, CPM and the CPI-ML, blocked the movement of trains in Bhojpur, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Jehanabad and Gaya. The RJD and Congress workers, who supported the farmers' call for Bharat Bandh given by All India Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (AIKSS), disrupted vehicular movement on National Highway (NH-31) at Begusarai, Khagaria, Katihar and Kishanganj. Movement on the Mahatma Gandhi Setu, the main link connecting North Bihar with Patna, was also paralysed after the RJD supporters blocked the bridge on Ganga for several hours.

08-12-2020||North and Central||Roshni Act: Jammu and Kashmir HC advances hearing of review plea to December 11||Roshni Act: HC asks CBI to file ATR in sealed cover on progress in cases, advances hearing of review plea to Dec 11 The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Tuesday asked the CBI to submit its Action Taken Report (ATR) in a sealed cover on the progress in cases registered to probe alleged irregularities in the Roshni Act and fixed December 11 for hearing a review petition by the Union Territory administration to review its earlier order in this case. Chief Justice Gita Mittal, who retired on Tuesday, and Justice Rajesh Bindal, appointed as the acting head, listed the case for Friday after allowing the urgent hearing motion filed by the government through its additional advocate generals (AAG) for preponement of the date in the now-scrapped Roshni Act. "We are informed by Ms Monika Kohli that the report of the CBI is ready and she is filing it during the course of the day. "We direct that any report by the CBI shall be filed in a sealed cover and presented to the Bench on the date of hearing in court," a two-page order of the court said while listing the case for December 11. The CBI is likely to submit its report on Wednesday, officials said. On Monday, the court had adjourned the hearing in the case till December 16. The government filed the petition on December 4 for modification of the nearly two-month-old judgment stating that a large number of common people would suffer unintentionally including landless cultivators and individuals who are themselves residing in dwellings in small areas. It said there was a need to distinguish between the common people and the wealthy land grabbers among the beneficiaries, and favoured that landless labourers or those with one house in personal use be allowed to keep the allotted land under the Roshni Act. After the AAGs, Asseem Sawhney and F A Natnoo, pleaded for an early hearing in the case, the division bench fixed the matter for December 11 for hearing the review petition moved by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. The court also heard advocates Sheikh Shakeel Ahmed for the petitioner and Kohli for the CBI in the virtual hearing. The court, in a verbal observation, cautioned the agency against conducting a roving inquiry against small officials and landowners and asked it to focus on the "big sharks" and not selectively target first the cases where the anti-corruption bureau is already dealing with the matter or charge sheet has been presented, Ahmad said. Ahmad said the court passed "significant oral observations". He said that "we do not want a lopsided investigation, also do not want discrimination of any kind in the name of religion, region, culture and status". This was contested by Kohli who said this was a presumption made by Ahmad without any basis as only the CBI's ATR will prove to the contrary, the officials said. Ahmad is representing Prof S K Bhalla who had challenged the Roshni Act in the court, which on October 9 finally declared the law "illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable" and ordered a CBI probe into the allotment of the land under this law. In its petition filed two months after the judgment amid criticism over its role in not defending the Act in the court, the government which has started releasing separate lists of beneficiaries of Roshni Act and encroachers of government land said the common people are unfortunately clubbed along with rich and wealthy land grabbers who have obtained a title over state land through the provision of now struck down Act. "There is a need to distinguish between these two classes of people; the fact of being either a landless cultivator or house-holder with at the most one dwelling house in personal use, would be the primary criteria for differentiating between two classes," the petition read. The petition prayed for permission to formulate an appropriate mechanism to enable people like landless cultivators and single dwelling owners to continue to remain in possession of their land, subject to an appropriate ceiling and on payment at appropriate rates. On November 1, the Union Territory administration cancelled all land transfers that took place under the JK State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 -- also known as the Roshni Act. Under the Act, 2.5 lakh acres of land was to be transferred to the existing occupants. According to the high court order, a total of 6,04,602 kanals (75,575 acres) of state land had been regularised and transferred to the occupants. This included 5,71,210 kanals (71,401 acres) in Jammu and 33,392 kanals (4174 acres) in the Kashmir province. According to the order, complete identities of influential persons, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, government officials, police officers and businessmen, their relatives or persons holding benami for them, who have derived benefit under the Roshni Act, will be made public within a period of one month. The Roshni Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land. The scheme was finally repealed by the then governor Satya Pal Malik on November 28, 2018. Earlier, the National Conference took a dig at the J&K administration over its alleged failure to defend the Roshni Act and said thousands of citizens who were bonafide beneficiaries under the scheme are now virtually deprived of their homes and hearth for no fault of theirs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/roshni-act-jammu-and-kashmir-hc-advances-hearing-of-review-plea-to-december-11-925088.html

Gehlot was addressing a NABARD seminar through video conference. He said that the cooperation of banks is important in the development of agriculture sector. NABARD and cooperative banks as well as nationalised banks should extend credit facilities for agriculture and allied sectors so that the financial needs of the farmers are met in a timely manner and paves the way for their prosperity, Gehlot added. On this occasion, he also released NABARD's 'State Focus Paper: Year 2021-22'. He also said the geographical conditions of Rajasthan are uneven but there are immense possibilities of development in the agricultural sector. "Keeping this in view, NABARD, Reserve Bank and other banks should increase the ratio of long-term agricultural credit in agricultural credit by 20 per cent for growth of infrastructural development." The chief minister added that there is a need to take bold decisions like loan waiver along with expansion of loan facilities to pull the farmers out of debt trap. After the Congress formed government in the state, decision was taken to waive farmers' loans, benefiting 20 lakh farmers. He said that more farmers can get the benefit, if nationalised banks cooperate. NABARD Chief General Manager Jaideep Srivastava said the bank has assessed a credit potential of Rs 2.33 lakh crore for the priority sector in Rajasthan in 2021-22, which is 10.4 per cent higher than the previous year. He added that the bank is also trying to promote farmer producer organisations in the state. There is a target of setting up about 500 new FPOs in Rajasthan in the next three years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-agriculture-key-for-economic-growth-their-upliftment-top-priority-of-state-government-gehlot-925126.html

The plea filed by Delhi-based lawyer Reepak Kansal has sought framing guidelines to balance citizens right to protest with right to free access and movement. “The petitioner seeks indulgence of this Court to protect and safeguard the human and fundamental rights of protesting farmers who are not allowed to enter in Delhi for peaceful protest and on other hand citizens of the country who have been suffering due to said gathering of protestors at borders of Delhi.  “The right of free access and movement of general public and protesting farmers are infringed due to blocked roads/ borders of Delhi by the law enforcing agencies/respondents,” the plea said. The plea said States have an obligation to respect the right of protest and should not prevent, hinder or restrict right to protest.  “In the present protest, the respondents have failed to fulfill their respective obligation even-after several requests made by the groups of farmers to protest peacefully at the designated places for protest.  “Ignoring the requests of the protestors, the respondents have used excess force by using lathi charge, tear gas shells and water cannon in winter season on the protestors,” the plea said. The PIL has also sought direction not to use force on the protesting farmers who have been protesting peacefully.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/plea-in-sc-to-allow-farmers-to-protest-at-designated-place-925133.html

The trial court had said that the act of the accused amounted to attempt to murder as he had the knowledge that being HIV positive his crime could have resulted in transmitting the potentially lethal disease causing death. However, the high court which noted that there was no intention to kill the victim, said there was no material furnished along with the charge sheet to establish that the victim was infected with AIDS or was HIV positive and even her tests for HIV had yielded a negative result. The high court did not agree with the trial court's reasoning that since the man was aware that his acts could result in transmitting the potentially lethal disease, he had knowingly committed an act, which if resulted in transmitting of HIV and the victim's death from it would amount to murder. Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the high court does not concur with the trial court’s view that the appellant man was guilty of the offence of attempt to murder. “The import of holding so would also mean that any sexual activity by a person infected by HIV is punishable under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC, notwithstanding that his or her partner has consented to such sexual activity. “This is because the culpable act under Section 307 of the IPC does not cease to be one if the victim of such an act has also consented to the same,” the high court said. It further said "if the reasoning adopted by the trial court is extended further, it would also mean that a healthy person, who willingly engages in unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV positive partner and as a result acquires the disease that eventually proves fatal, would have committed suicide. "And the HIV positive partner would be guilty of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC if not guilty of committing murder," it said. The high court was deciding the appeal filed by the man who was held guilty by the trial court of the offence of raping his step daughter, who was around 15-year-old at the time of offence in 2015, and since he was infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), he was also convicted for the offence of attempt to murder. Besides rape and attempt to murder, the trial court in 2012, had also convicted the man for the offence of causing miscarriage without woman’s consent and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Though the man has been acquitted of the offence of causing miscarriage of the woman by the high court, he would have to spend 10 years in jail for the offence of rape. The high court noted that the man had not raped the victim with an intention of causing her death. According to the prosecution, the man was lonely after the death of his wife, who was also HIV positive, and he had sexually preyed on his step daughter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hc-upholds-hiv-mans-conviction-for-raping-step-daughter-acquits-of-attempt-to-murder-925135.html

She said the new laws were meant to help farmers and eradicate middlemen and not end the APMC mechanism as alleged by Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel. She said the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi had spoken previously about "ending the APMC Act". The sole focus of the new laws was to allow farmers to sell their produce to anyone, anywhere at the best prices, she said. "In Chhattisgarh, 234 farmers have committed suicide in the last one year. What right does CM Baghel and Congress have to say that they are protectors of farmers," she asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/234-farmer-suicides-in-one-year-in-chhattisgarh-bjp-leader-925139.html
08-12-2020||Opinion||Data on transgender people in prisons: Tool or weapon?||Every year, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), which is part of the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Government of India, publishes a report called Prison Statistics India. It contains valuable data for policymakers, advocacy organisations, and researchers; therefore, digitised editions of reports from 1995 to 2019 are available on the NCRB website. Until 2019, the report data on prisoners was collected under two categories – male and female. On December 7, 2020, the Government of India told the Delhi High Court that it would include ‘transgender’ as a separate category to classify prisoners for the PSI report on this year’s data. Why is this a significant development? In a report titled Lost Identity: Transgender Persons Inside Indian Prisons (2020), published by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Arijeet Ghosh and Madhurima Dhanuka write, “There is one group which remains largely invisible within prisons, which has received little, if at all any, attention in the Indian prison reform discourse. This group comprises prisoners belonging to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI+) communities. While there is much international discourse on the issue, similar discourse in India on LGBTI+ communities and prisons is still evolving.” Being counted is necessary to enjoy rights guaranteed by law; therefore, the decision to maintain accurate information on transgender prisoners does come across as a step in the right direction. The NCRB was compelled to take this step in response to public interest litigation initiated by legal journalist Karan Tripathi. His petition argues that non-recognition of a separate transgender identity would leave transgender prisoners “extremely vulnerable to harassment, violence and sexual assault in jails and also by the police.” Unfortunately, this petition conflates the terms ‘transgender’ and ‘third gender’. In doing so, it fails to take into account the lived experiences of transgender persons and collectives that have articulated their critique of the Supreme Court of India’s judgement on transgender rights (National Legal Services Authority versus Union of India) in 2014, and of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. While there are transgender people who also identify as ‘third gender’, not everyone who is transgender wants to identify as ‘third gender’. In a blog post titled ‘Not Just Unconstitutional’ published on Medium.com in July 2020, transgender rights activist and law student Kanmani Ray indicates that she vehemently rejects the use of the word ‘third gender’ as “a catch-all term” for transgender people. She writes, “It reinstates a sexist exclusionary hierarchy (violating Article 14 & 19). If every transgender person is supposed to be referred to as a third gender person, then who is the first gender? Cisgender Men? Then will cisgender women accept the status of ‘second gender’ under the Constitution?” These are valid concerns, not semantic squabbles. The ‘transgender umbrella’ includes various identities such as hijra, kinnar, jogappa, kothi, aravani, shiv-shakti, nupi manbi, genderqueer, agender, non-binary, genderfluid, and others. Many of them do not self-identify as ‘third gender’. While any attempt to remedy the erasure of transgender people from official documentation and policy mandates is worthy of applause, it is advisable to tread with caution while dealing with data collection processes. The act of being recorded often involves being put into a box. The NCRB has committed to a two-day online training programme to sensitise officials about collecting data on transgender prisoners. This effort can help counter prejudice and stigma if it is thoughtfully designed with the involvement of experts and facilitators from transgender communities. If data collection brings up fear, that must be acknowledged. Vulnerable communities know that data can be used as a tool or a weapon; to improve their living conditions and secure their rights, or to target them with surveillance and acts of violence. The dehumanisation of transgender persons in Indian prisons is deeply linked to our colonial history. Ghosh and Dhanuka write, “Violence against the LGBTI+ community, and in particular the hijra community is believed to have had its roots in laws legislated during colonial India. A prime example was the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which was legislation entrenched in British colonial morality and ethos...The Act designated certain communities and tribes to be criminals from birth wherein criminality was being passed on from one generation to another.” There are other questions that arise: What is being done to ensure that transgender prisoners feel safe to come out as transgender? If they suspect that self-identification will make them more susceptible to police brutality, or physical violence and psychological abuse from fellow prisoners, why would they place themselves at risk? Is it even ethical to push them to come out in order to become data before the infrastructure to support them is in place?

08-12-2020||Panorama||It has been a fascinating journey for India-US ties, best is yet to come: Taranjit Singh Sandhu||Taranjit Singh Sandhu has been a part of the story of India-US relations and has seen at close quarters the ties between the two ‘natural partners’ grow. Over his 32-year-long career in diplomacy, he served at the Embassy of India in Washington D.C. as a First Secretary (Political) from 1997 to 2000 and then again as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2013 to 2017. He returned to Washington D.C. earlier this year and took over as India’s ambassador to the US on February 3 – just days before President Donald Trump’s visit to Ahmedabad and New Delhi. With Trump now on his way out and President-elect Joe Biden set to take over the Oval Office on January 20, the ace diplomat is ‘certain’ that India-US relations will continue to scale new heights. He tells DH's Anirban Bhaumik why he is certain that relations between the two democracies will continue to scale new heights. Excerpts: Q. Can you please give us an overview of the India-US relations? How did the relations between the two nations progress in the past years and how do you see the prospects of the relations over the next four years? A. India-US relations have grown steadily over the years. There is bipartisan support for strong India-US ties in the US. It also has cross-party support in India. We have made significant progress under each US administration. I have been part of this journey in the last two and half decades.  It might be an oft-repeated phrase, but it’s true and at the core of this relationship: we are “natural partners”. Our relationship is based on shared values – democracy, rule of law and pluralism. Over the years, there has been increasing convergence in bilateral, regional and global issues. There has also been significant momentum in the high-level of political interaction in the last two decades.  There are certain factors which I would like to highlight here: It is a people-driven and people-centric partnership. The Indian-American community, nearing around 4 million, has been a source of strength for this relationship. Over 2 lakh Indian students in the US mostly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Management) areas has been another important bridge. Flowing from this is the strong knowledge partnership.  As societies that respect innovation and ingenuity, we have been collaborating more and more in technology and cutting-edge innovation areas. Indeed, there’s no area of human endeavour where India and the US are not working with each other.  I am not just optimistic, but certain that the relationship can only touch new heights in the days ahead, given the true potential of what we can achieve together, not just for each other but for the world. Q. What will be the priorities for India in its engagement with the new US administration? A. Controlling the pandemic is of immediate relevance. We would also like to build on the pillars that facilitate economic recovery in both countries. This is the need of the hour.  I will choose four main baskets of priorities: First, given the pandemic, cooperation in healthcare and pharma and Covid-19 management including affordable vaccine development and delivery; Second, the entire Information and Communication Technology, innovation and digital space, the salience of which has also grown with the times; Third, the energy basket, especially renewables, including solar, that will allow us to combat climate change; and the last but not the least, the education and knowledge collaboration.  Every basket is important and has a lot to offer. Each one of these is critical not just for India or the US, but for all of humanity.  These are, of course, all in addition to our partnership in strategic sectors including in the Indo-Pacific.  Given our membership in UNSC from January 2021, we would also like to see more cooperation in the multilateral sphere.  Q. How do you view the prospects of India-US cooperation in the healthcare sector, particularly in containing the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as well as for preparing the two nations and the world better to deal with future pandemics? A. As you are aware, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated the need for a vaccine that is “accessible and affordable” for the world. Indian pharma capabilities are now well recognized around the world, including in the US. The past several months have proved the mettle of the Indian pharmaceutical industry. The scale and speed in vaccine manufacturing and delivery that India can offer will be the key to ensuring universal public health. We have said that we are willing to leverage our domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity and engage with friends and partners for early delivery of vaccines not only in India but also in low and middle-income countries, especially in Africa. From the initial days of the Covid-19 outbreak, Indian and US scientists and institutions have been actively engaged in the exchange of information. There are currently five vaccine candidates which are under joint collaboration between India and the US.    The significant part is, we are building on a solid foundation. India has a long-standing partnership with the US in the area of health and scientific research.  We have closely collaborated in combating diseases such as tuberculosis, cancer, HIV and eye diseases. Under the India-US Vaccine Action Program, National Institute of Health and the Indian Department of Biotechnology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have been collaborating for the last 33 years. We have done a phenomenal job together, and there is a lot more to be done: in pharma, basic research, vaccines, diagnostics, devices, telemedicine and hospital administration. Q. There are concerns that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” may be at odds with President-elect Joe Biden’s “Make-in-All-of-America” and come in the way of further expanding India-US bilateral trade and investment relations. What is your view?  A. As PM Modi said, Atmanirbhar Bharat is about transforming India from a passive market to an active manufacturing hub at the heart of the global value chain. We, of course, remain engaged with the world, an aspect that our American friends appreciate.   Through building capacities at home, India will contribute to the global markets and also mitigate disruptions. As such, there is no contradiction between an India that is building its domestic economic capacities, and an India that is looking to play a bigger role in global business, trade and innovation. We have said, ‘Make in India; Make for the World’. Our FDI figures during the pandemic, which has almost doubled year-on-year, should be a good benchmark, as regards what the world sees in India. And the US has been a significant source country for our FDI. As regards the trade and economic partnership, today the US is our largest trading partner. Our bilateral trade, which touched $150 billion in 2019, has witnessed double-digit growth in the last 10 years. India’s exports in goods and services in 2019 stood at the US $88 billion showing a year-on-year increase of 4.8 per cent while imports from the US stood at around US $61 billion showing a year-on-year increase of 3.6 per cent.  India’s trade and economic ties will continue to grow with the US. You would remember that India-US relationship has had a history of breakthrough and game changing achievements. It is in the inherent nature of this relationship. I am optimistic that there is nothing we cannot achieve together if we sit across the table and discuss.  Q. How do you think India and the United States can cooperate to enhance supply chain resilience after the pandemic and support global economic recovery? A. Reconfiguration of global supply chains has been underway before the pandemic. This shift towards de-risking and diversifying supply chains was accelerated by the pandemic. India is among the countries looking to benefit from this global shift. India’s democratic credentials, skilled workforce, relatively low labour cost, low tax rates and large domestic market give it an edge. Not to forget India’s strong digital infrastructure, vibrant ecommerce market, robust startup ecosystem, and fintech opportunity. The government has endeavoured to put in place an enabling and investor-friendly FDI policy and has undertaken series of tax and labour related reforms. Investor confidence in India is reflected in US $35.7 billion that India received between April and August this year. The US is an important partner in India’s growth. India and the US have a robust economic partnership, with bilateral trade touching US $150 billion and US $60 billion in two-way investments. This partnership has remained steadfast in face of the pandemic. We have excellent science and technology collaboration, including in therapeutics and vaccine development. India proved itself a reliable partner. During the last few months, several US companies have invested in India’s tech and retail sectors. In near future, India and the US could identify certain priority sectors for supply chain collaboration and at the same time work with like-minded countries to achieve supply chain resilience.  Q. Indian Information Technology (IT) professionals have been contributing to the competitiveness of the US economy. High-skilled professionals from India played a key role in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis in the US. Will issues concerning the Indian-American community continue to get priority in India’s engagement with the new US Administration? A. The people-to-people linkages and trade and economic cooperation, especially in technology and innovation sectors, are important dimensions of the India-US strategic partnership. High skilled Indian professionals bring important skill sets to the US and add to the technological and competitive edge of the US companies. They have also been a critical component of the workforce that is at the forefront of providing Covid-19-related assistance in key sectors, including health, information technology and financial services. With technology gaining prominence in the present situation and in the post Covid-19 world, the value addition brought in by the Indian IT professionals along with STEM graduates will play a critical role. They are actively involved in the innovation process including in our joint fight against Covid-19.  The US has always welcomed talent from abroad and we are hopeful our professionals will continue to be welcomed in the USA in the future. Q. How do you view the prospects of India-US defence cooperation and the strategic convergence in Indo-Pacific? A. The India-US defence and strategic partnership is a critical component of the relationship. The Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) mechanism, launched during President Barack Obama’s tenure, has been working well. The aim of the DTTI Group is to bring sustained leadership focus to the bilateral defence trade relationship and create opportunities for co-production and co-development of defence equipment.  We have built on defence ties over the last two decades: whether it is the designation of India as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ by the US and the accordance of Strategic Trade Authorization -1 Status by the US Department of Commerce or the signing of LEMOA, COMCASA, Industrial Security Annex and now BECA or the 2+ 2 Ministerial mechanism.  We have consistently crafted new milestones and moved ahead. Our defence trade stands at US $21 billion in a short span. We are now collaborating in new domains like joint R&D, innovation, and experimenting in new domains of cooperation. In the last decade, our maritime surveillance capability has increased with the acquisition of the P-8i from the US. We continue to work closely to ensure a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. The US platforms like Chinooks have helped us operate at high altitudes. The C-17 (Boeing) and C-130 (Lockheed Martin) transport aircraft have helped us move relief material – medicines and medical equipment – and evacuate Indian nationals. There’s increasing military-to-military cooperation as well. The first tri-service exercise between the two countries, Tiger Triumph, was held last year. It is now on the calendar of the two countries. The Indian and the US Navies are cooperating both in bilateral and plurilateral format. The recently-concluded Exercise Malabar with US, Japan and Australia has been yet another important development.   Q. President-elect Joe Biden’s recent statements signalled his intention to steer the United States away from unilateralist nationalism that many believe defined the foreign policy of the outgoing administration. The United States is likely to rejoin the Paris Climate Change agreement and the World Health Organization. How do you view it? India has been reaffirming its commitment to multilateralism but has also been stressing on reforms in multilateral institutions. How do you see the prospects of India-US cooperation in multilateral fora and in reforming the multilateral institutions? A. We look forward to working closely with the US and all other friends and partners in the multilateral fora.  Our United Nations Security Council membership from January 2021 will be an important phase. As India has always held, we need to see reform of the multilateral institutions to reflect the realities of today. The democratization of world order can no longer remain elusive. Today’s challenges and today’s aspirations cannot be met using structures built upon and built by yesterday’s realities. It was the Obama-Biden Administration that first recognized India’s legitimate aspiration to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council The United States understands that India is a responsible, trusted and resilient partner for the world.  We need to grow, but we have also chosen a green path to growth. Be it Jal Jeevan Mission or Ujjwala Scheme or SATAT, all these show our commitment to green growth and our commitment to humanity at large. We are also the only G-20 nation which has been able to achieve targets set out under Paris Agreement. We have also been a leader in more ways than one: International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure are just a few recent examples. We will continue to work with the US in combating common challenges and reforming the multilateral system.  Q. Can you tell us a little bit about the interactions between President-elect Biden and Prime Minister Modi?  A. In line with our democratic ethos, Prime Minister Modi was one of the early world leaders to congratulate President-elect Biden through a tweet.  The Prime Minister was also one of the early world leaders to have a congratulatory phone call with President-elect.  You would remember Prime Minister Modi’s historic address to Joint Session of the Congress in 2016. The then Vice President Biden co-chaired the session. I was Deputy Ambassador in Washington D.C. then. I have seen myself his strong support for India-US relations.  When Prime Minister Modi visited the US in September 2014, Vice President Biden had hosted a lunch for him. He had always been supportive of stronger US-India ties – both as a Senator and as the VP. This is evident from the Op-Ed he wrote in October and the special address he gave on August 15.   On the India-US relation Biden said in his Op-Ed: “Fifteen years ago, I was leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to approve the historic Civil Nuclear Deal between our nations and advance our technology sharing and defense cooperation. At the time, I said if the United States and India became closer friends, then the world will be a safer place. Seven years ago, as Vice President, I told business leaders in Mumbai that the US-India partnership was the defining relationship of the 21st Century.” “The Obama-Biden years were some of the best we've ever had between our two countries.  A Biden-Harris Administration will build on that great progress and do even more. We can and should be natural allies.” As I always say, India-US relations has so far been a fascinating journey indeed but the best is yet to come!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/it-has-been-a-fascinating-journey-for-india-us-ties-best-is-yet-to-come-taranjit-singh-sandhu-924695.html
08-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Lockdown leverage||Lockdown has proved traumatic to those with wanderlust. To some, however, it has been a wake-up call. The rude jolt to a never-imagined harsh reality has resurrected a few, potentially considered defunct for long. The realisation dawns at 80, that you have the capacity to function better than you ever did in earlier days. At 60 you had convinced yourself that your abilities were on the wane and charted your schedule accordingly.  At 70, you were scrap-heap material in the zone of domestic chores. Whatever, chores notwithstanding, you find you have time to read books left midway, strum a few discordant notes and sing songs like “those were the best days of my life,” that you belted long, long ago. A home-bound person by choice, a clamp on outdoor sprees meant nothing. Dispensing with the maid, however, for what I thought was a short period, was mind-boggling. The kitchen and I were never inseparable amigos. I stepped in only on occasions when my culinary efforts were indispensable. I have always been lucky with cooks or rather with a family that does not complain about food. These days, with delivery systems and caterers of every kind, food was no problem to reckon with, I thought until the lockdown barred that as well! My mother’s words echoed from a distant past, “If you cannot circumvent troubles, learn to navigate them.” My mornings now defy senectitude. Kitchen chores, and all of it over, I rush to my study. I plonk into my chair and gaze out of the large, breezy windows. Dulcet bird-notes percolate through the leafy network. A flurry of frisky squirrels play hide and seek, setting foliage all a-quiver or race up the bole of a palm, or make a dash for nowhere. A duo of koels with plaintive cries, a solitary kingfisher, a splash of blue, cinnamon white and burnt ochre, on the curry-leaf tree; sometimes a golden-backed woodpecker hammering away with its beak on a bark in staccato-beat; tailor-birds flitting from bush to bough; not to forget the pesky crow which attempts to encroach into the joie-de-vivre of other birds with its craft and caw! I experience a metanoia as I open my eyes to the beauty around me and to the drink of the magic elixir called interest! A far-fetched equation perhaps, but I am reminded of New Zealand news camera-man, Olaf Wiig, who after having been kidnapped and held hostage for thirteen days and released, announced  with a broad smile on his face, “I feel more alive now than I have in my entire life.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/lockdown-leverage-924691.html
08-12-2020||Second Edit||Philanthropy: A poor record||The list of India’s top philanthropists and their contributions, released every year, is not one that makes us very proud. This year also, the list published by EdelGive and Hurun India shows that the country’s record of philanthropy is poor. Most of the names that find a place in the list are known and familiar, and even their order in terms of the size of contributions remains more or less unchanged. Industrialist Azim Premji and family top the list, donating ₹7,904 crore, with Shiv Nadar and Mukesh Ambani families coming in the second and third spots, donating ₹795 crore and ₹458 crore, respectively. There are other top industrialists among the first 10. The difference between the top and second contributor is striking, but still more striking is the general unwillingness of India’s rich and privileged class to do their mite to help the poor and the needy with voluntary acts of giving.  According to last year’s Credit Suisse report, 4,460 Indians have a net worth of over ₹350 crore. India has over 750,000 dollar millionaires as of 2019. Yet donations above ₹10 crore, made by high net worth individuals, comprise 55% of individual philanthropist funding and, according to the 2019 Bains’ report, ‘’about 80% is Azim Premji’s donations”.  The total contributions amount to only Rs 45,000 crore annually and this is very low in a country where just 828 people hold about a third of the country’s GDP. In the US, about 2.5% the GDP goes for charity, but in India it is less than 0.5%. Some of the richest people in the world like investor Warren Buffet have announced that they would give away most of their wealth to charity. While some find fault with such announcements on various grounds, it is a fact that such acts of generosity make a difference to the lives of many. Social welfare and wellbeing do not depend on individual acts of kindness, but they are important and have a role.  Philanthropy has grown in India over the years but has not kept pace with the growth of wealth and individuals incomes. The number of billionaires and millionaires has increased steadily but with that the gap between the rich and the poor has also grown. Even during the Covid times, it is not the rich but the poor who have suffered. Though there is much more scope for philanthropy and charity in India, the country has lagged behind western countries in this respect. We think that the western society is individualistic, materialistic and acquisitive and that we have higher values of renunciation and compassion which place the community over the individual. But our actions belie the values we claim to have.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/philanthropy-a-poor-record-924681.html
08-12-2020||South||Bharat Bandh: DMK-led Opposition hits the streets in TN, Puducherry||Opposition DMK and its allies including the Congress held protests and took out rallies on Tuesday backing the farmers' nation-wide shutdown call which did not affect normalcy in Tamil Nadu but hit routine in Puducherry. In the neighbouring UT, ruled by the Congress, the bandh call evoked a near total response with buses, taxis and autos staying off the roads and traders, and other commercial establishments downing shutters to support the shutdown and all the outlets reopened in the evening. In Tamil Nadu, normalcy was largely unaffected and public and private transportation continued as usual. Shops and businesses were opened and banks and government offices functioned as usual. Local markets were, however, closed in parts of the state including in Nagapattinam, Erode and Tiruvarur. In Tirupur, majority of the shops and commercial establishments and knitwear manufacturing units were shut. CPI(M) affiliated Tamil Nadu Farmers Sangam said the bandh in the state is a complete "success." The Sangam claimed barring Chennai, a majority of shops were closed by traders in all other districts and protests were held in hundreds of locations in which thousands participated. The TN Government Employees Association, which supported the farmers protest, said it held demonstrations across the state in support of the ryots. Agitations were held in most regions of the state including Chennai, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai, Coimbatore, Thanjavur, Salem, Tirunelveli, Cuddalore and Puducherry. DMK's allies including the Congress, the CPI(M), CPI and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi took part in the protests and took out rallies as well in several locations. Cauvery Urimai Meetpu Kuzhu (Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee), a ryots body joined the protests at Thanjavur. At Pamban in Ramanathapuram district, a section of fishermen and Communist Party of India activists waved black flags and protested against the farm laws in support of the farmers. Farmers leader P R Pandian participated in a protest here and said ryots actively participated in demonstrations across the state. Cadres, waving flags of their parties, gathered at important locations and shouted slogans against the union government's farm laws alleging the new legislations only favoured the corporate entities and not the farmers and sought its immediate withdrawal. Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, extending solidarity to the bandh, visited the protest venue at Puducherry and said agriculture came under the state list of Constitution and the union government should have consulted states before rushing with the laws. He said a resolution would be adopted in the Assembly during the winter session opposing the farm laws. "The Centre must unconditionally withdraw the three laws immediately," he said. Tagging a picture of protest, Lt Governor Kiran Bedi said under these circumstances, COVID-19 cases in the union territory could see a comeback. "Medical and enforcement agencies will need to be prepared for this. It is just an alert for the people," she said and appealed to the public to take precautions to avoid the spread of the infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bharat-bandh-dmk-led-opposition-hits-the-streets-in-tn-puducherry-924786.html

Despite the Covid-19 situation, polling percentage reached close to 50 per cent by noon. Polling to 6,910 wards of 395 local bodies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Idukki districts will be held on Wednesday. The local body elections, being held in three phases on December 8, 10 and 14, are considered as the semi-finals to the Assembly polls to be held in five months. Counting of votes is scheduled for December 16. The BJP is pinning high hopes of winning the Thiruvananthapuram corporation, which they lost to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) by only a few seats in 2015, and retaining the Palakkad municipality. But internal feuds among the party state leaders is indeed a cause for concern for the party. The CPM-led LDF is concerned if the series of allegations against the government over nexus with gold smuggling accused and irregularities in a housing scheme for the poor would affect their prospects. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that it would be a cakewalk for the left-front owing to the welfare and development initiatives of his government over the last four year. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the local body election results would witness the Left Front facing another debacle owing their corrupt governance. He also said that the polls would once again prove that there was no space for the BJP in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/first-phase-of-local-body-polls-underway-in-kerala-924827.html

The government rushed medical experts to Eluru in Andhra Pradesh state to investigate the illness, which first appeared Saturday causing seizures, nausea and chronic pain. Officials said nearly 500 people have been treated -- with most swiftly recovering -- but the death of a 45-year-old man at the weekend was attributed to the mystery disease. India is already in grip of coronavirus with the world's second-highest number of cases -- and soon expected to pass 10 million. "Some people are saying that it is mass hysteria but it is not," said A.S. Ram, a senior doctor at Eluru government hospital. He said most victims had suffered genuine symptoms, but "we are unable to diagnose what is causing it". Other officials pinpointed a possible role of chemical additives in pesticides, while residents have highlighted a problem with garbage and feral pigs. They released a report on Monday which said symptoms included "epilepsy for 3-5 minutes, forgetfulness, anxiety, vomiting, headache and back pain." The government has sent doctors from the National Institute of Virology, National Centre for Disease Control and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences have been sent to investigate. The team was collecting samples of edible oil, rice, blood and urine for analysis. "Most of the patients are coming in with minor head injuries or a black eye as they collapsed suddenly with the seizure," Ram said. "But within one or two hours most of them are fine." Police constable Kiran Kumar -- who collapsed while on duty Monday -- said he had been left "scared" after being semi-conscious for more than two hours. "My colleagues told me, I shouted something and collapsed. I injured my right shoulder due to falling on the road." According to district officials, the illness is not spread person-to-person. They released a report on Monday which said symptoms included "epilepsy for 3-5 minutes, forgetfulness, anxiety, vomiting, headache and back pain".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mystery-illness-frays-indias-coronavirus-nerves-924871.html

With reports suggesting that the 'big sharks', as termed by a court in Kochi considering the gold smuggling case, is a person associated with the ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front and holding a constitutional post, the Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front and BJP-led NDA have stepped up attack against the Pinarayi Vijayan government. While Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP Kerala president K Surendran demanded Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to open up and reveal the name of the VIP involved in the dollar smuggling, Vijayan said that the people could not be misled by the baseless campaigns of the Congress and the BJP against the LDF. The BJP even went a step ahead on Tuesday with Surendran raising suspicions over the frequent foreign trips of a CPM leader holding a constitutional post. The said leader was on the defensive earlier also as video footage showing his connection with the gold smuggling accused surfaced. It was after considering the fresh statements of gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh and P S Sarith to the Customs that the court considering economic offences said last week that the revelations about the involvement of 'big sharks' in dollar smuggling were shocking and persons holding high positions were suspected to have misused their position. Meanwhile, putting an end to the allegations of Opposition parties that Vijayan was keeping off from active campaign for the local body elections because of the embarrassment to face the people due to the serious allegations against the government, Vijayan joined the election campaign in his home district Kannur from Monday. The gold smuggling case has already caused much embarrassment to the government as Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar was arrested in this connection and the Chief Minister's additional private secretary C M Raveendran is summoned by the Enforcement Directorate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/speculation-rife-over-big-sharks-in-kerala-dollar-smuggling-case-924900.html

The top court, in its verdict, however, dismissed the appeal of land owners against the acquisition of their land for the project. The apex court's verdict came on a batch of appeals filed by the Centre and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and few land owners and others including PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss. These pleas were filed against the Madras High Court's judgement, delivered on April 8, 2019, holding as “illegal and bad in law” the notifications issued under Section 3A(1) of the National Highways Act for acquisition of specified lands for construction of the new highway which was part of the larger 'Bharatmala Pariyojna– Phase I5' project. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Krishna Murari partly allowed the appeals of the Centre and the NHAI to the extent of quashing of the notification to acquire land for the highway project by the Madras High Court and gave its nod to again proceed with the process. “The impugned judgment and order is modified. The challenge to impugned notifications under Sections 2(2) and 3A of the 1956 Act, respectively, is negative. The Central Government and/or NHAI may proceed further in the matter in accordance with law for acquisition of notified lands for construction of a national highway for the proposed section/stretch,” the judgement said. The ambitious 277.3-km-long eight-lane greenfield project aims to cut travel time between the two cities Chennai and Salem by half to about two hours and 15 minutes. However, it has been facing opposition from a section of locals, including farmers, over fears of losing their land, besides environmentalists who are against felling trees for it. The project runs through reserve forest and water bodies. Justice Khanwilkar, writing the 140-page verdict for the bench, agreed with the High Court's judgement directing the revenue authorities to restore the mutation entries effected in favour of the NHAI merely on the basis of notification issued under the NHAI Act. “By virtue of notification under Section 3A of the 1956 Act, neither the acquiring body nor the NHAI had come in possession of the concerned land nor the land had vested in them, so as to alter the mutation entry in their favour. To that extent, we agree with the High Court that until the acquisition process is completed and possession of land is taken, the question of altering the mutation entry merely on the basis of notification under Section 3A of the 1956 Act cannot be countenanced and, therefore, the earlier entries ought to be restored,” it held. The verdict said that it has not expressed “any opinion either way on the correctness and validity of the permissions or clearances accorded by the competent authorities under the environment and forest laws. It said that the orders granting permissions under the environment and forest laws were not the subject matter or the issues before the High Court and hence, it would be open to the affected persons to question the validity before the appropriate forum, it said. The bench said that it did not wish to deal with the judgements relied upon and the effect that the Project of this nature may have environmental impact and ought not to be taken forward. “We have not examined the efficacy of the permissions/clearances granted by the competent authority under the environment or forest laws, as the case may be. If those permissions/clearances are assailed, only then the decisions (previous judgements) may be looked at,” it said. Referring to judgements mentioned on legality of grant of environmental clearance to projects, the top court said that in those cases it was called upon to “examine the challenge in the context of permissions given by the competent authority under the environment laws.” The apex court praised lawyers for their able assistance in dealing with bulky files that too in hearings conducted through video conferencing due to ongoing pandemic. Earlier, the high court's order had come on a batch of petitions filed by 35 land owners and PMK leader Ramadoss. They had challenged the land acquisition proceedings. The high court had made clear that grant of prior environmental clearance would undoubtedly require a thorough study of the area and before that, a public hearing was needed to be conducted. It had also held as "unsatisfactory" the project report of a consultant and said it needed to be scrapped. It had said unless a proper study was made, the impact on the forest lands, water bodies, wildlife, flora and fauna cannot be assessed. Environmental clearance was mandatory since the project would have an adverse impact on the environment, including water bodies, it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-upholds-centres-notification-to-acquire-land-for-nhais-chennai-salem-highway-924918.html

Even the state Secretariat opened after 1 pm on Tuesday as the government did not arrange buses in the morning for the employees to reach Velagapudi. There was not much impact on normal life as the supporters of the bandh mostly confined their protests to bus stations and highways where traffic blockades were held. Educational institutions, however, remained shut on the advice of the state government while banks and other Central government offices functioned normally. The Left parties took out protest marches in different towns of the state demanding that the Centre scrap the new farm laws that would benefit only the corporates and not the actual farmers. The Telugu Desam Party and the Congress too supported the bandh. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu called for a national debate on the farm laws and wanted the Centre to build a consensus after deliberating with the farmers and the farmers' associations. He said minimum support price should be made a statutory right for the farmers and not be at the mercy of someone. The ruling YSR Congress, which was pushed on to the defensive as it supported the farm laws in Parliament, said it hoped a solution to the ongoing crisis would be found soon, particularly over the minimum support price issue. State Agriculture Minister K Kanna Babu, in a statement, said the YSRC supported the farm laws on the condition that they would not harm the farmers' interests in any way. We supported the new legislation only after the Centre gave a categorical assurance that MSP will be strictly implemented and that the farmers' interests will be protected. We wish the talks between the Centre and the farmers' unions will soon bear fruit and solve the current crisis, Kanna Babu added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bharat-bandh-no-impact-on-normal-life-in-andhra-pradesh-924947.html

Despite the Covid-19 scenario, the polling per cent reached 72.56 per cent as per initial reports in the evening. Many who tested Covid-19 positive by Monday evening, as well as those under quarantine, turned up for voting by wearing PPE kits during the last hours of polling as instructed by the State Election Commission, while other Covid-19 positive persons were given the postal voting option. Even very aged people, including the aged coupe of Pathanamthitta who received much attention after reviving from Covid-19, turned up for voting despite the pandemic scenario. Polling to 6,910 wards of 395 local bodies in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Idukki district was held on Wednesday. The next two phases of polling are on Dec 10 and 14. Counting of votes is scheduled for December 16.  Congress senior leader A K Antony, who has his vote in Thiruvananthapuram, could not turn up as he was under treatment for Covid-19 in Delhi till recently, while former Chief Minister and veteran CPM leader V S Achuthanandan, who used to regularly cast his vote in Alappuzha district, did not turn up owing to health problems. The local body polls are considered as the semi-finals of the Assembly polls to be held in five months time.

Earlier, the state cabinet decided to seek legal opinion on moving court against the farm laws. Government sources said the state law department suggested that certain portions of the law amounted to infringement into state's powers and hence there was scope for filing an appeal. The minister on Monday said the state would move the apex court against the new laws this week itself. The state was prepared to face any consequences of the decision. The new laws would destroy food security and public distribution system, he said. CPI's Rajya Sabha MP from Kerala Binoy Viswam had already moved the SC against the farm laws. The Left-front was of the view that the Centre did not consider the opinion of states and farmers before finalising the bills. The new laws violated the fundamental principles and it would cause hardships to farmers. Meanwhile, Kerala was exempted from the nationwide strike observed on Tuesday as part of the ongoing stir by farmers in Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-agri-minister-v-s-sunil-kumar-to-move-sc-against-new-farm-laws-925002.html

The protest was also against the National Education Policy 2020, which IMA Tamil Nadu chapter president Dr C N Raja and Honorary Secretary Dr A K Ravikumar, in a joint statement alleged that spoke of medical pluralism and lateral entry laying the foundation for legitimising 'mixopathy.' The IMA and TNGDA demanded the withdrawal of the notification which sought to incorporate the postgraduate courses namely MS Shalya Tantra and Shalakya Tantra (General Surgery). "The modern medicine surgical procedures listed out under Shalya Tantra and Shalakya Tantra, fall under the ambit, authority and jurisdiction of modern medicine having been prescribed by the then Medical Council of India as the competencies ascribable to the postgraduate course titled MS (General Surgery)," statement said. Also, anesthesiologists required for surgery were not yet available in Ayurvedic medicine, it said. The November 20 Central Council of Indian Medicine's notification listing 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Postgraduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016, has become a bone of contention for the IMA.

The proposed 277.3-km Green Corridor Express Highway connecting Salem with Chennai has been at the centre of a controversy since 2018, causing much resentment among farmers in the five districts of Tamil Nadu whose fertile lands will be acquired for the project. Though the expressway, once fully functional, will reduce the travel time between the two cities by three hours and distance by 68 km, the project has been vehemently opposed by farmers and Opposition farmers. Farmers, whose land was to be acquired, knocked at the doors of the Madras High Court which scrapped the land acquisition process. However, the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the notification for acquisition of land for the Rs 10,000-crore project. “Our opposition to the project will continue come what may. We are not ready to part with our lands. We are convinced that the new highway will serve no purpose as three highways already exist between the two cities. And these are our farmlands. Why should we part with them?” Arul Arumugam, spokesperson of the Movement Against Salem-Chennai Expressway told DH. Sivagami of Ramalingapuram, a village which might face the axe if the project sees the light of the day, said they have decided to intensify the protests against the project. “The only school in our village and a temple will be razed if the project comes into force, besides our farmlands. We were the first to protest against the project and we are not budging from our stand,” she said, adding that they will hold a dharna on Thursday and launch relay fasts from next week. Ramalingapuram, 20 km from Salem on the existing Chennai-Salem highway via Ulundurpet, is among several villages that would be affected due to the project. This DH correspondent had visited 16 villages spread across Salem, Dharmapuri and Tiruvannamalai districts in September 2018 only to find out that the highway has been designed in such a way that it passes through the middle of fertile farmlands, rendering remaining land on both sides useless. In total, nearly 150 villages will be affected and hundreds of acres of coconut, betel nut, banana and mango plantations would face the axe, if the farmlands are acquired.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-farmers-up-the-ante-against-salem-chennai-expressway-925068.html

Raveendran kept off from appearing before ED twice earlier last month citing Covid-19 infection and post-Covid treatment. Subsequently, ED issued a fresh summons asking him to appear on December 10. Since he got hospitalised today, the chances of him appearing before ED on Thursday was bleak. Sources at the Thiruvananthapuram government medical college hospital hospital said that Raveendran came to the hospital on Tuesday afternoon complaining of fever, cold and cough and sought treatment for post-Covid ailments. Subsequently he was hospitilised. The opposition parties had earlier raised doubts even over the Covid infection of Raveendran and alleged of deliberate attempts to evade ED quizzing. The allegations assumed significance as he was very close to the Chief Minister and many other CPM leaders. Raveendran was learnt to have come under ED scanner after Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar, who was earlier held by ED, was quizzed. ED had already collected details regarding wealth and investments of Raveednran as well his family members, said sources.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cms-staff-hospitalised-ahead-of-ed-questioning-for-third-time-925083.html

Out of these, 16 hospitals come under the department of medical education while 53 are under the health department. Holding a symbolic protest on Monday, the KARD said many doctors didn’t receive pay for three months. As per the data shared by the association, 57 resident doctors at the Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences weren’t paid for three months, 38 at the Chamrajnagar Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) weren’t paid for two and a half months, 54 at the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) didn’t receive salary for two months, while 80 doctors of the KR Hospital, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) went without pay for a month. Dr C P Nanjaraj, Dean, MMCRI, told DH that the doctors haven’t been paid only for November. “We have to compile the attendance from the places where they were posted. This will be done latest by December 15.” Salary within a week: Minister Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar assured resident doctors that their salaries will be released within a week. “The delay is due to technical reasons,” he said. Until then, the administrative bodies of the colleges have been instructed to pay the doctors. Dr Caron Harshitha, Forensic Medicine SR at CIMS, told DH that the doctors were entitled to Rs 60,000 per month. “We are posted to rural areas where we have to fend for ourselves with no accommodation and pay.”  The file has not even moved in a few colleges, said Dr Dayanand Sagar, president of KARD. “Salaries haven’t been credited even once. At BMCRI, we have been told that the stipend for two more months will be credited soon,” he said.   The doctors have also demanded allowance for Covid work outside hospitals. As academic activities came to a grind in the past nine months, they demand a refund of their fees (junior residents have paid Rs 1,20,000, superspeciality residents have paid Rs 2,30,000) for the current academic year. For MBBS house surgeons who are doing compulsory rotatory internships, there are no guidelines on when their internship will come to an end. They have been told that it may be extended by three to four months. These students have to prepare for MD or MS entrance exams but are engaged in endless Covid work, they say. Dr Gayatri V, a BMCRI house surgeon, said, “Internship is a training period when we have to do undergo mandatory training in hospital services for 365 days, which we have competed. But here, we’re doing only Covid. We want the skillset that a normal merit student possesses. We want clarity on when our internship will end.” Dr Namrata C, a postgraduate student of BMCRI, said that in the past nine months, the government has failed to recruit doctors for Covid duties and has exploited postgraduate students. “We demand medical colleges to be exempt from Covid work,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/doctors-on-covid-19-grind-not-paid-for-months-in-karnataka-924672.html
08-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka seized record 5,000 LSD strips this year, compared to 150 in 2019: Basavaraj Bommai||The state government has seized over 5,000 strips of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) this year, which is the highest haul when compared with previous years, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday.  “We’re going after synthetic drugs. There are LSD strips measuring 1-1.5mm. We have seized 5,049 strips this year compared with 150 last year. The seizure of these strips did not exceed 200 in recent years,” Bommai said in a brief discussion on the drugs menace during question hour.  The BJP government has “waged a war on drugs”, Bommai said, adding that the police had booked 3,852 cases till November this year under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. “There were 1,126 cases in 2017, 1,031 in 2018 and 1,661 in 2019. Of the 3,852 cases booked so far this year, charge sheets have been submitted in 2,285 cases. The others are under investigation,” he said.  Bommai claimed that this government was the first to “infiltrate” the dark web. “We have broken into 21 dark websites where LSD strips among other drugs were being sold,” he said.  The minister was responding to a question raised by former Congress minister Eshwar Khandre, who said there was a delay in filing charge sheets because of shortage in the forensic science laboratory (FSL). Bommai admitted this: “It’s true that there’s a bottleneck in getting FSL reports.” To overcome this, the government has introduced a new technology at FSL. “Earlier, testing of samples took time. Say, if we sent 20 samples, the FSL had to test one at a time. We have not modernized the FSL, which can now test 51 samples at one time. A separate narcotics section has been opened at the FSL,” Bommai said, adding that this would help the police file charge sheets sooner.  The government was working on a “comprehensive law” to tackle drugs, which will be recommended to the Centre. “Under the NDPS Act, we’re revisiting the rules. We’re simplifying them to help make more raids and seizures. The amended rules will be out soon,” he said.  Legislators R Narendra and Priyank Kharge expressed concern on mushrooming of hookah bars and recreation clubs. Another MLA Abbayya Prasad said he saw youngsters consume whiteners in his Hubli-Dharwad East constituency.  “Narcotics come in different forms now. In Raichur, we saw a powder that was mixed with water to get high. There are polishes, whiteners and glues that contain alcohol. Since they’re available in stationery shops, we can’t tell if they’re being used for substance abuse,” Bommai said.  The minister said urban local bodies should regulate the opening of hookah bars. “As far as recreation clubs are concerned, they usually get an order from the High Court to get a licence,” he said.  The government was aware of the ganja business taking place in slums. “We must fight this. Earlier, rave parties were fashionable. Now, they’re seen as a crime. We’ve managed to instill fear,” Bommai said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-seized-record-5000-lsd-strips-this-year-compared-to-150-in-2019-basavaraj-bommai-924873.html

Much to the surprise of BJP leaders, the opposition JD(S) MLCs, who stood by the farmers’ cause in the morning, softened their stand and supported the amendment to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act (1961) that allowed non-agriculturists to buy agricultural land in Karnataka. On a day when farmers outfits had called for ‘Bharat Bandh’ to protest against the centre, Revenue minister R Ashoka tabled the bill in the Upper House of the state legislature. The same had earlier been passed by the Legislative Assembly by voice vote during the monsoon session of the Karnataka Legislature in September 2020. Dissenting against the bill, the opposition leaders voiced concern that many farming communities would be deprived of ownership of their land due to the new rules. Leader of the opposition in the Upper House, SR Patil said, “The government is introducing these amendments just to obey the High Command. You can either create history and be remembered for generations to come by taking a pro-farmer stand or you will eventually pay for the consequences of these amendments in the days to come.” Several opposition MLCs including BK Hariprasad, Maritibbegowda criticized the government over the amendment. Responding to the concerns of the opposition leaders, CM BS Yediyurappa clarified that the government has put a condition to the buyers that purchase of any irrigation land has to be used for irrigation purpose. “Farmers are intelligent and no farmer will sell their land just because there is a law. Our government will not bring any law which would be detrimental to the interest of the farmers. We have used only two per cent of the land in the state for industries and the proposed amendment is to help industries flourish in Karnataka,” Yediyurappa said. Following a heated argument, Congress leaders surprisingly demanded the division of votes assuming that a combined opposition of Congress-JDS would defeat it even as nine Congress MLCs were absent in the House. Much to their surprise, JDS MLCs barring Maritibbegowda supported the bill and voted in favour of the government. The ‘controversial bill’ of the state government amending the Karnataka Land Reforms Act of 1961 was passed with 37 and 21 votes. While 37 MLCs from BJP and JDS (10 MLCs) supported and voted in favour of the amendment, 21 MLCs from Congress voted against the bill.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-strikes-at-opposition-unity-passes-controversial-land-reforms-bill-with-jds-support-925060.html
08-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Siddaramaiah questions whether there was democracy in Karnataka||Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly Siddaramaiah on Tuesday questioned whether there was democracy in the state, as he alleged that neither the Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa nor officials in his administration have bothered to respond to his repeated letters on various issues. Speaking in the Assembly during the debate on Minimum Support Price (MSP), he said that he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 6 stating that prices fixed were not scientific and to reconsider it, but received no response. "...when you (state government) don't give (response to letters) why will he (PM) give.". "...I have written three letters to the Chief Minister, he did not respond to even one till today, I have been writing letters expecting that he may respond some time and I will keep writing," Siddaramaiah said. Chiding the state government, he said that he had written to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar regarding MSP for copra, who responded to him, but the state government or Chief Minister did not. "Is there democracy in Karnataka?" Stating that he had written to Tomar in June, for which he got response in October, Siddaramaiah said, though late, he has at least responded, you don't even do that. "Do you have any privilege in a democracy. Have you got any privilege in the constitution not to respond to whoever it may be, whether it is leader of the opposition or any one?" Pointing out that he had written three letters to the Chief Minister- in October last year, January and again in October this year- which elicited no response, Siddaramaiah questioned what should we tell to the people of the state. "...are we in a democracy or not? The government is answerable to the House (assembly) and the people of Karnataka. You are accountable, if you say you are not accountable...?" The former Chief Minister also charged that even officials don't give the information sought. "I wrote to the Chief Secretary and Secretaries, why are they for? Is it not their duty and responsibility to assist the government, to give information sought by the leader of the opposition. Can you call it a government? If you (Ministers and CM) conduct yourself responsible, they (officials) will also conduct in the same way, if you don't, they too will not," he added. Pointing out that the Centre has fixed MSP for 'common variety' paddy at Rs 1,868 per quintal and for 'A' grade variety at Rs 1,888 per quintal for the current year, Siddaramaiah said, Maharashtra is giving Rs 700 above MSP, and demanded that the state give at least Rs 500 above MSP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/siddaramaiah-questions-whether-there-was-democracy-in-karnataka-925099.html

Hazare also said the agitation should spread across the country so that the government comes under pressure to act in the interests of cultivators. In a recorded message, Hazare appreciated farmers' protests at the borders of Delhi saying no violence has taken place in the last 10 days of the agitation. "I appeal to the people of the country that the agitation which is going on in Delhi should spread across the country.

But no one should resort to violence," said Hazare who began his fast in Ralegan Siddhi village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra.

Hazare also expressed the need to grant autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and to implement the recommendations of the M S Swaminathan Commission. The octogenarian warned of agitation if the government fails to grant autonomy to the CACP and implement recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission.

The police have detained volunteers from the All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Communist Party of India, Satyashodhak Vidyarthi Sangatana, Students Federation of India and other associations.

Navlakha is an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik said it has learnt about how spectacles of Navlakha were stolen inside jail and the prison authorities refused to accept the new spectacles sent by his family through courier. "Humanity is most important. Everything else will follow. Today, we learnt about Navlakha's spectacles. This is the high time to conduct a workshop for even jail authorities," Justice Shinde said. "Can all these small items be denied? These are all humane considerations," he added. Navlakha's family members on Monday claimed that his spectacles were stolen on November 27 inside the Taloja prison, where he is lodged. They claimed that Navlakha is "almost blind" without the spectacles and yet, when they sent a pair of new spectacles to him by post earlier this month, the prison authorities refused to accept it and sent it back. "Presently Gautam Navlakha is in acute distress, is unable to see things around him and consequently his blood pressure has shot up," read a statement circulated on Monday evening by Navlakha's lawyers that was signed by the activist's wife Sahba Husain. The high court was hearing two petitions filed by activists, Ramesh Gaichor and Sagar Gorkhe, challenging their arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. Senior counsel Mihir Desai, appearing for Gaichor and Gorkhe, told the HC on Tuesday that the duo were arrested by the NIA only because they refused to make statements before a magistrate against the other accused in the case. The petitions also said the case should be held before the special NIA court in Pune, and not in Mumbai. "The offence is alleged to have occurred in Pune. The case was initially held before a court in Pune. However, after the NIA took over the probe, it was transferred to the special NIA court in Mumbai even when there is a special NIA court in Pune," Desai said. NIA's advocate Sandesh Patil sought time, following which the HC posted the matter for hearing on December 21. Navlakha had surrendered before the NIA, which is probing the nearly three- year-old case, on April 14, 2020. Between August 29 and October 1, 2018, the activist had been kept under house arrest. The case pertains to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Maharashtra's Pune district on December 31, 2017, which, the police alleged, was funded by Maoists. The speeches made by some activists at the conclave triggered violence near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial on outskirts of Pune city the next day, according to the police charge sheet. The NIA later took over the case in which several activists and academicians have been named as accused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/humanity-most-important-hc-on-jailed-activist-gautam-navlakhas-stolen-specs-924885.html

Patil, who is also Maharashtra's water resources minister, wore black ribbon to express solidarity with the agitating cultivators. Speaking to reporters here, Patil said, I am sporting black ribbon today to extend support to the farmers." Asked about the BJP's claims that the new farm laws have provisions similar to what NCP chief Sharad Pawar had backed when he was the agriculture minister in the UPA government, Patil said the NDA lead constituent need not take a stand on current issues using letters written years ago. If they listen so much to Sharad Pawar saheb...Saheb made several suggestions later (to the BJP-led NDA government) on how difficulties faced by farmers can be solved. Those should be accepted by the Centre then, Patil said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik, who is also a minister, led a protest of party workers in suburban Chembur. Launching an attack on the BJP, he dubbed it as a party which "loots" farmers produce. It wants to loot farmers again with the farm laws... these laws will cause injustice to farmers, Malik claimed. NCP Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule pitched for the Centre to engage in dialogue with farmers. "Farmers are ones who provide food. It is the moral responsibility of the government to resolve (a problem) through dialogue if there is anger in any section of the society," the Baramati MP tweeted in Marathi. Maharashtra health minister and NCP leader Rajesh Tope took to Twitter to express support to the agitating farmers. "My farmer, my support #isupportfarmers," Tope said on the micro-blogging site. The bandh was called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the Modi government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain in place.

The Congress has taken the lead in the protests called nationwide by farm outfits who claim three new agri-marketing laws introduced by the Centre are aimed at allowing corporates to take over the agriculture sector at the expense of cultivators. Addressing a public function in Mehsana, some 75 kilometres from here, Rupani said Gandhi and his party were indulging in politics by opposing the same set of reforms they had once advocated. "I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he knows the difference between coriander and fenugreek," Rupani, who was in Mehsana to lay the foundation stones of Narmada canal-based drinking water supply projects worth Rs 287 crore, said. "In its 2019 election manifesto, the Congress had said it would bring changes in the APMC Act if voted to power and give farmers the freedom to sell their produce outside these markets. Now, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi brings in these reforms, why is the Congress opposing it," the CM questioned. "Rahul Gandhi once called a meeting of Congress chief ministers and asked them to delist vegetables and fruits from APMC to bring down prices. Now, when we are doing the same to empower farmers, the Congress is opposing it. The people want an answer as to why the party is taking such a stand," Rupani further said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bharat-bandh-gujarat-cm-vijay-rupani-aims-coriander-fenugreek-barb-at-rahul-gandhi-924965.html

However, it is suspected that when the Mithi river overflowed during the monsoon – the crocodile would have entered the well. It was spotted by locals during the weekend, who raised an alarm and got in touch with an animal rescue organization SAARP. Immediately, SAARP founder-president Santosh Shinde and members Arbaaz Khan, Sheldon D’Souza, Mitesh Solanki and Umesh Sawant mounted a rescue operation, but the crocodile was difficult to manage. On  Monday, another rescue was undertaken after which the crocodile was rescued and winched up. The task was mammoth as the water was first pumped out. The Maharashtra Forest Department was intimated and the crocodile was examined by veterinarian Dr Sunetra Wakade.  “It was released back to its natural habitat under supervision of forest officials,” Shinde said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/crocodile-rescued-at-marol-in-mumbai-925005.html

A bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing the final arguments on a plea filed by Mumbai resident Sunaina Holey, who has been booked by the Azad Maidan police for allegedly posting offensive tweets against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aditya. Holey, through her counsel Abhinav Chandrachud, has sought that the FIR against her be quashed. During the day's hearing, advocate Chandrachud argued that the facts in the FIR against Holey did not reveal any offence, and said that she had merely posted a video and was not the author or creator of the same. Advocate Chandrachud further argued that Holey had not referred to any community, caste or religion in her post and therefore, the post did not constitute any offence. The Maharashtra government's counsel senior advocate Manoj Mohite, however, told the court that an officer of the Mumbai police's social media department found "something fishy" in Holey's tweets and hence an FIR was registered. At this, the court asked what other democracies in the world did in similar cases. The court said that the advocates from both sides must throw some light on the stand taken by other democracies, as the same might be useful for academic purposes too in the future. "In the entire world, how many democratic countries are there like India? In those countries, what is the stand taken on such tweets, WhatsApp messages or any criticism?" the bench asked. "Give details of it if it is possible, for academic interest," it stated. The arguments will continue on December 14.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/high-court-seeks-to-know-action-taken-by-other-democracies-over-offensive-tweets-925006.html

In rural and semi-urban areas, most of the shops and establishments were shut. The three MVA partners Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, its allies Prahar Janshakti Party, Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana, Left Front constituents, trade unions and farmers organisations joined the protests. The operations of the APMC markets in the state were affected because of the bandh. Though a majority of the wholesale markets across the state remained shut, retail vegetable markets and local vendors were working in the morning in some cities, but were shut later in the day.

Meanwhile, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who is being targeted by the BJP, has reached the national capital and would meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday. Minister of state for labour Bacchu Kadu described the 3 new farm laws as a “dacoity” of the farmers. “If needed we will intensify the agitation,” he said.

It sought protection for all employees from the "malicious witch hunt" allegedly being carried out by the Maharashtra authorities. Ghanshyam Singh, "assistant vice president, distribution" of Republic TV was arrested on November 10 and and "tortured, beaten and harassed in custody", it alleged. Singh was given bail last week. The police was working in a "pre-determined manner to falsely implicate" Goswami and others from ARG Media by "influencing witnesses, and extracting false statements against the petitioners", petition alleged. The court should, therefore, transfer the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any other independent agency, the petition said. It is yet to be listed for hearing. When contacted for reaction, senior police officials refused to comment. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers.
