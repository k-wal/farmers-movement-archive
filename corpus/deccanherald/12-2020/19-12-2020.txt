Speaking to media persons, here on Saturday, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene District Unit President Mallashettihalli Channabasappa threatened that they would smear the MLA's face with black paint if he does not apologise to farmers. He said the MLA termed farmer leader as a fake social activist and broker for supporting road transport employees strike. "We strongly condemn this and demand apology from him. He also dared the government to seize Kodihalli's illegal wealth if he has any such property." He said employees serving in road transport are the children of farmers. So, Kodihalli Chandrashekhar led the strike. He charged that the MLA made remarks against the farmer leader to tarnish his image and to please Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to get a ministerial berth. He said the MLA's father was a teacher and he had ten children, but the family had only eight acres of land, adding that Renukacharya was serving in a borewell agency before he obtained properties worth crores of rupees and after he became an MLA and that the government must probe into his wealth.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/davangere/farmers-threaten-to-blacken-mlas-face-for-remark-against-kodihalli-929264.html
19-12-2020||In Perspective||National Family Health Survey 5: Time to end denial ||The first phase of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5, released on December 12, has a reference period of 2019-20 and covers 17 states and five Union Territories. The introduction contains a caveat – that readers should be cautious while interpreting and comparing the trends as some states/UTs may have smaller sample size. I am informed that this is because in smaller states/UTs, the size of samples available for some indicators was very small, and therefore generalised application of the data would be explained after the survey is completed and national data is announced. Yes, stunting among children below five years has indeed increased drastically in several states, including the more progressive ones, such as Kerala and Goa, and in some of the traditionally better nourished North-East states, particularly Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura. But Bihar, a difficult state, has shown remarkable improvement in reducing stunting, with rural data better than the urban data. In other states, except Telangana, where stunting has increased, the position appears to be more or less static. The percentage of wasted children in most states has also increased, the highest increases coming from Ladakh, Nagaland and J&K. Karnataka has shown remarkable improvement, down from 26.1% to 19.5%. Drastic increase in stunting and wasting of children is a serious issue, both epidemiologically and socially, and it would be important for government to enquire into the causes and take preventive measures immediately.    It would also be useful to study whether reduction in stunting is because children are steadily getting taller and then transitioning into the normal/underweight category -- or whether stunted children are losing weight and slipping into the wasted category. This would provide important insights into the real trends within these indicators.   However, the good news is that immunisation rates had gone up uniformly in all states and there has been significant decrease in infant, child and neonatal mortality rates. So too, the Body Mass Index (BMI) of women and men between 15 to 49 years has improved substantially.  Anaemia remains a worrisome issue defying ongoing interventions, and has in many states increased among children, mothers, and women and men from 15 to 49 years. This has serious repercussions on the cognitive and physical growth of children and adolescents, their learning ability and physical activity, and on the working and earning capacity of adults -- in short, upon the quality of our human resources.   Another disturbing indicator that persists is the percentage of infants below 24 months receiving adequate diet. In most states, it remains below 20%, with only Kerala, Meghalaya, Ladakh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Goa having 20-30% children receiving adequate diets, and Gujarat just 5.9%. Not surprising, as the coverage of supplementary nutrition under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is decreasing, and there is no affordable complementary food available in the market. Unless this deficit is addressed, the hard core of our underweight, stunted and wasted children problem will remain untouched.    A distinct urban-rural divide is also clearly visible in the data, with almost all indicators being much worse in rural areas as compared with urban areas. Poverty and unemployment are fundamental to this divide, and perhaps because the economic impact of demonetisation was more severe on rural communities. The survey years follow two consecutive years of the impact of demonetisation on employment and wages, and of urban-rural migration among the rural poor. These issues need further research, as also the effect of two consecutive years of floods in Kerala, of long curfews in J&K on food consumption by children, and of the demographic dynamics of growing migration from North-Eastern states and Bihar. The initial data presents us with serious concerns that need urgent attention, primarily from the government and policymakers, from whom we have not heard any comment yet. It is important that experts, practitioners and policymakers review existing programmes and their outcomes, especially the inter-sectoral interventions and platforms, and seriously examine why we are not able to make a dent on this silent, invisible malady that does not directly kill, is not infectious, and has no extraordinary symptoms, except of chronic fatigue and lesser cognitive and physical growth. ‘High burden’ and ‘aspirational’ districts have the poorest development indicators and delivery systems, and the lowest per capita income. They remain pockets of chronic poverty and malnutrition. Clearly, additional targeted interventions within national programmes, through governmental or non-governmental sectors, are urgently required. Will the policymakers take a relook and redesign public nutrition/health programmes accordingly, articulate new priorities, structure new interventions and obtain results? The foundation for becoming a world power, which we aspire to be, lies in the power of our human resources.

19-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||‘Siddaramaiah was responsible for HDK operating from hotel’||MLA and JD(S) leader Sa Ra Mahesh said, "Leader of Opposition party Siddaramaiah was responsible for former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy operating from a hotel in Bengaluru." Addressing a media conference here, on Saturday, Mahesh was reacting to Siddaramaiah’s statements during Grama Janadhikar Samavesha of Congress workers of Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency here, on Friday. “As Siddaramaiah did not vacate Kaveri, the official residence of the CM, Kumaraswamy had to take resort in a hotel. Was not Kumaraswamy coming to Vidhana Soudha? As his house was far away, at JP Nagar, he used to relax in a hotel. Is it a sin?,” Mahesh asked. Commenting on the statements of Siddaramaiah on his defeat in Chamundeshwari, Mahesh said that politics is nothing, but a lot of conspiracies. “Did not they conspire against Kumaraswamy’s son Nikhil in Mandya Lok Sabha segment? Did not the Congress conspire against Ambedkar, to defeat in elections? Did they not conspire to defeat former prime minister H D Deve Gowda in Tumakuru Lok Sabha constituency?" he asked. “Siddaramaiah did not accept Kumaraswamy as CM whole-heartedly. It is a known fact that Siddaramaiah is always close to H D Revanna, but not Kumaraswamy. The world knows that Siddaramaiah nurses a grudge against Deve Gowda's family. Even though Kumaraswamy was the CM, Siddaramaiah’s supporters claimed that the latter was CM, on multiple occasions. Under such circumstances, how could a CM function?” Mahesh asked. To Siddaramaiah’s comment that Kumaraswamy had become inaccessible to ministers and MLAs, Mahesh said, Kumaraswamy is the most accessible person among all the CMs Karnataka had so far. “We know that Siddaramaiah has created the record of presenting the highest number of state budgets. But, it is a fact that he is the CM, who borrowed the highest amount of loans. Siddaramaiah is a senior politician, but his use of singular for others reduces his stature. He should not set a bad example for junior politicians,” Mahesh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/siddaramaiah-was-responsible-for-hdk-operating-from-hotel-929308.html
19-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||One who back-stabbed others, understands pain now: AHV||MLC and BJP leader A H Vishwanath said that the one who always back-stabbed others, understands the pain now. Addressing a media conference here, on Saturday, he was reacting to former chief minister and Leader of Opposition party Siddaramaiah’s statements during Grama Janadhikar Samavesha of Congress workers of Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency, in Mysuru, on Friday. “Siddaramaiah, who now expresses unhappiness over the conspiracies of his own Congress partymen, for his defeat in Chamundeshwari Assembly election, in 2018, does not have concern for others. Siddaramaiah effected the exit of the person, who facilitated his entry to the Congress. He has been back-stabbing all those who helped him. Now, he understands the pain of back-stabbing. He is an ungrateful person. He himself is the cause for his defeat,” Vishwanath said. He said that his ego, arrogance, disrespect to elders, use of singular to others, attempt to divide Veerashiva-Lingayat community and other factors caused his defeat. “Siddaramaiah weakened the Lokayukta, to avoid his prosecution in Arkavathi denotification case. It is Siddaramaiah who himself should introspect, as he is trying to decimate the Congress, which made him the CM. As he was sure that he would not win in Chamundeshwari, he fled to Badami. Did he not know that he conspired against G Parameshwara at Koratagere in 2013?” Vishwanath asked. Vishwanth said that with former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy accusing Siddaramaiah and Siddaramaiah holding Kumaraswamy himself responsible for the fall of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government, he was relieved. “Thus, they should stop accusing us, the 17 MLAs, who resigned and went to Mumbai, for toppling the government,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/one-who-back-stabbed-others-understands-pain-now-ahv-929312.html
19-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||This deity gets Guard of Honour every day||Guard of Honour is offered to the top executives of the nation, as mark of respect. However, a similar state honour is offered to goddess Chamundeshwari by the Police department in Mysuru, claimed as state deity, everyday. A police personnel offers guard of honour to the deity everyday. On special occasions like mantapotsava and rathotsava two personnel perform the guard of honour. The police pay respects at 9.30 am and 8.30 pm, during mahamangalarathi, every day. It is believed that Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the 22 maharaja of the Yadu dynasty of the erstwhile Mysore state, who ruled between 1799 and 1868, started to offer Barjit, paying respect, to the deity. However, there is no sufficient document on why and when the guard of honour to the goddess commenced. According to sources, the then Maharajas of Mysore started to offer daily respect, since 1799, after Tipu Sultan was killed in the Fourth Anglo Mysore War. British East India Company took indirect control of Mysore and restored the Wadiyar rule. The Kingdom of Mysore became a princely state, a subsidiary to British India. Historians claim that there is no mention of the guard of honour to Chamundeshwari Devi in either books or official documents. Eachanur Kumar said, "There is no much supporting documents about the history of the guard of honour to the devi. Chamundeshwari devi was declared as ‘National Deity’ and Dasara was declared as ‘National festival’ in the Mysore Legislative Assembly in 1957." After unification of Karnataka, Dasara was declared as a national festival and Chamundeshwari, also the deity of Maharaja's clan, obtained statehood because of the unification, he said. Kumar said, "There is a need for research on the guard of honour to the goddess. I have not found any document, which has mention about the guard of honour to the deity. The Mysuru Administration report, which exist since 1868, is authentic. But, it has not mentioned about paying respect to the goddess." "Documents such as Mysore State Handbook, Mysore Gazetteer, police manual and Police department material have not mentioned about the guard of honour. But, circulars about the pujas, others rituals conducted in the temple are available. Chamundeshwari is decorum and dignity to the state and guard of honour to it is commendable,” he said. However, there are documents about guard of honour offered to VIPs at Mysuru Palace and Government guesthouse since the days of the Maharajas. “Guard of honour was offered to VIPs, such as guests from foreign nations or governor general, at Mysuru Palace and the same tradition is followed at Government guesthouse since 1805. The guard of honour is still in practice at the guesthouse,” he said. According to Chamundeshwari Devi temple chief priest Shashishekara Dixt, he is witness to the police offering guard of honour since his childhood. "Earlier, during the period of the maharajas, soldiers used to offer ‘Barjit’ to the goddess and the police have continued the tradition, by offering guard of honour.  Chamundeshwari Devi is the only deity in the nation to get a salute from the police. It is a matter of pride," he said. A police personnel, who has offered the guard of honour several times, said it is not self-pride, but pride for the entire Mysuru Police. "Though the procedure of offering guard of honour is simple, it has its own significance. Paying respects to the state deity needs more caution and dedication," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/this-deity-gets-guard-of-honour-every-day-929313.html
19-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Cong initiates steps to strengthen party in Mysuru region||Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition party Siddaramaiah has initiated steps to strengthen the Congress in Mysuru region, for the first time since his defeat in the 2018 Assembly poll in Chamundeshwari constituency. Thanks to the Gram Panchayat (GP) elections. Following Grama Janadhikar Samavesha of party workers of Chamundeshwari constituency, in a private community hall here, on Friday, he chaired a meeting of Congress leaders of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts at a private hotel on Saturday. An introspection on the defeat of the party candidates, including Siddaramaiah himself, in the 2018 Assembly poll and in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll in Mysuru region, was a part of the meeting. It has to be noted that besides the traditional rival, JD(S), the BJP is also trying to gain a foothold in the region, of late. Thus, strategies to be adopted, to strengthen the party for the 2023 Assembly polls, to face both JD(S) and BJP were discussed. It has to be noted that Siddaramaiah, now MLA of Badami in Bagalkot district, used to frequently visit Mysuru, his hometown, to attend private engagements. He also had toured villages under Varuna constituency, represented by his son Dr Yathindra. But, he had not taken any step to organise or strengthen the Congress. Former minister H C Mahadevappa, who had stayed away from both Siddaramaiah and the Congress, citing health issues, ex-MP R Dhruvanarayana, MLAs H P Manjunath, Anil Chikkamaadhu and C Puttaranga Shetty, ex-MLAs Vasu and K Venkatesh and party office-bearers attended the meeting. Earlier, recalling his statements of Friday, that not only the secret pact of the JD(S) and BJP, but also some Congressmen caused his defeat in the Chamundeshwari segment, he clarified that he mentioned of only Congress leaders of the particular segment and did not name any leader. To a query on a tweet by former CM H D Kumaraswamy, describing him as the father of secret pacts, Siddaramaiah declined to comment. “The world knows, who had formed secret alliances. The JD(S) and the BJP had an understanding in 29 Assembly segments,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/cong-initiates-steps-to-strengthen-party-in-mysuru-region-929315.html

Among the 41 GPs in Hunsur taluk, Mookanahalli stands first, by receiving arrears amounting to Rs 3.58 lakh, while Doddahejjuru is the least, with a collection of Rs 50,462. As defaulters are not eligible to contest the polls, most of the candidates and aspirants of the GP polls have paid their pending taxes, to their respective GPs. They have obtained tax paid certificates and also certificates for having constructed toilets in their respective houses. Mookanahalli Panchayat Development Officer (PDO) Srinivas said that the GP staff used to regularly visit each household, urging the residents to pay the arrears, towards tax and cess. “However, they used to give excuses and tax collection had become a problem for the personnel, rendering the GP a handicap in finances. Now, to obtain the certificates, the aspirants and candidates have paid the arrears. Similarly, all beneficiaries of the infrastructure and amenities should be mandated to obtain certificates, to use the benefits,” he said. Taluk Executive officer Girish appealed to the people, to pay the arrears towards the taxes, like their representatives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/poll-effect-gps-collect-rs-64-lakh-in-tax-929316.html

Speaking to media persons, here on Saturday, he said the former chief minister is blaming leaders of Congress party who gave him various positions. Let the Congress leader reveal backbiters, he dared. He taunted that if Siddaramaiah had implemented pro-people schemes during his tenure as chief minister, he would not have faced defeat in the Assembly elections. It seems he has realised it after two years. Reacting to the Congress leader's allegation that he lost Chamundeshwari Assembly seat due to an internal-alliance between BJP and JD(S), he said if it is true, Siddaramaiah would have lost even in Badami Assembly constituency. "Doesn't he have common sense?" he asked. He also asked the Congress leader to tender an apology for addressing union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in singular or accept that disrespecting woman was his culture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/ks-eshwarappa-dares-siddaramaiah-to-reveal-backbiters-929278.html
19-12-2020||Main Article||Caste and Development: Social mis-engineering||“There is no doubt, in my opinion, that unless you change your social order, you can achieve little by way of progress. You cannot mobilise the community either for defence or for offence. You cannot build anything on the foundations of caste. You cannot build up a nation; you cannot build up a morality. Anything that you will build on the foundations of caste will crack and will never be a whole.” These words, written by Babasaheb Ambedkar in his essay, ‘Annihilation of Caste’, are both profound and insightful. While one can draw inspiration from this thought and other ideas that he expresses in this essay, one can surmise that attempts to undo the historical injustice done to the marginalised Dalits, tribals and other caste groups lower down in the social order in India would be to ensure their complete integration into the political, social and economic fabric of the nation. While the founding fathers kept in mind this deep-seated reasoning and necessity for social engineering while framing the Constitution, caste has been reduced to a mere political tool in the last several decades. The rapidly visible downward slide began when prime postings were driven by caste compulsions around the late 1970s. Whether it is the office of the Chief Minister or the personal sections of each minister, the tendency ever since has been to populate them with people who belong to the same caste as the minister concerned. What one has begun to see is a dangerous process of social mis-engineering. The consequences of this are not only tragically irrevocable but can potentially undo the constitutionally obligated task of reducing inequities. Whether it is the recent formation of the Maratha or the Veerashaiva Development Boards, or the agitation launched by the Kuruba community demanding the ST tag, or a monk threatening to agitate for a separate caste-based state, things could not be worse. Politicians alone may not be culpable for this kind of thinking. Religious mutts and casteist organisations thrive on the support given by people of their denominations. It is an open secret that most of them are known to lobby or use their influence to ensure people from their castes occupy high positions in government. It is also known that politicians lobby with religious heads to secure their support and the votes of their followers before every election cycle. The current situation is further worsened by caste-based appointments for heads of universities and research institutions and even constitutional bodies. The creation of special purpose vehicles or ‘Development Boards’ is being justified with the reasoning that they will hasten the development of those marginalised and reduce the social and economic gaps. While there is a certain element of truth in this argument, the current levels of efficiency and corruption in the state agencies has ensured that reality is different. No comprehensive evaluation of the SC/ST Development Corporation (one of the earliest to be established) has been done and there is very little evidence to justify the enormous amounts of money spent till date or a calculation of the return on investment in terms of reducing inequities. The purpose of affirmative action and provisions in the Constitution in terms of the Special Component Plan and the Tribal Sub-Plan was to ensure correction of the historical injustice meted out to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Today’s decisions are only serving to create injustices which may no longer be politically tenable for correcting in the future. Consider the example of adding two communities – Parivara and Talawara -- to the list of Scheduled Tribes earlier this year in Karnataka. These communities, numbering close to 1.1 million, has further resulted in marginalising the shrinking numbers of forest-dwelling indigenous tribal communities. It is amidst this scenario that one must see the recent trend of several other communities agitating for inclusion. The proverbial Pandora’s box has been opened with the Kodavas (160,000) and Kurubas (more than five million) and other castes like Madiwala, Besta, Golla and Gangamata agitating to get the ST tag, or other dominant caste groups like Veerashaivas and Vokkaligas demanding special privileges and reservations under the Backward Class category. Most governments till date have seen the process of classifying caste groups and extending special privileges not based solely on their social or economic marginalisation. What drives the decision-making is neither evidence nor constitutional guidelines, but political exigency and potential vote banks. When new castes are added to the ever-growing list of SCs, STs and OBCs, the very purpose of special attention to the extremely marginalised is nullified. The government is obligated to take care of all citizens but is expected to protect the weak and the marginalised first. It cannot make them weaker in the name of protecting the strong and politically powerful. What we need to do instead is spend serious time and effort in ushering in equality at every opportunity, especially for those who need it the most. Special safety nets based on rational and evidential calculations to restore balance in education and employment will go a long way in bringing in merit-based opportunities, at least a decade from now. What is needed is an evolution amongst religious leaders, the political parties and government leadership, and not a senseless caste-based mis-engineering that will only serve to undermine and stigmatise rather than to bring about equality.

Chetan Sood is busy giving a final touch to a tattoo on the arm of a Sikh youth, who has come from Hoshiarpur, Punjab, to the Singhu border to protest against the Centre's three contentious farm laws. Sood and his five assistants wanted to contribute whichever way possible. Therefore, the group decided to do what they know best. The six men reached the Delhi-Haryana border on Friday morning carrying ink, tattoo machines, needles and stencils. It takes 30 minutes to complete a tattoo, the artists say, aiming to complete around 200 such body arts for free in three days. "The purpose is to send out a message: the common man is with the farmers," says Sood, who runs 'Tattoo Club' in Punjab's Ludhiana district. The theme for the tattoos is agriculture. It depicts farmers harvesting crops, holding farm equipment, tractor, among others. There are tattoos with slogans too, such as 'kar har maidan fateh' (win every battle), 'nishchay kar apni jeet karo' (emerge victorious with firm resolve) and 'nirbhau, nirvair' (not afraid, no enemies). "These are permanent tattoos. Each costs at least Rs 3,500," says 29-year-old Sood. The farmers have been camping at several border points into Delhi for over three weeks, demanding that the new farm legislations be repealed as they claim it would benefit the corporates and end the traditional wholesale markets and the minimum support price regime. "People are talking about the farmers' protest in every household across the country," Sood says. "This is probably the largest organised movement in the modern India." Dheerpal Singh, 33, from Hoshiarpur was upbeat after getting a tattoo of a tractor inked on his forearm. "This is surely going to lift the spirits of the youngsters here," he says. At a nearby medical camp set up by Baba Balwant Ji Charitable Trust, a team of 15 volunteers distributed kits of "immunity booster" medicines among the farmers and local residents on Friday. Doctor Ashwini Kumar from Hoshiarpur district said the kit included multi-vitamins, zinc, iron. "The farmers have been camping here for around three weeks. The weather has changed. The severe cold can harm the elderly. There are sanitation-related issues too," Kumar says. Of the 1 lakh kits, 50,000 have already been distributed. Around 100 metres away from the spot where tattoos are being inked, volunteers of Meri Peri Welfare Society have been distributing free turbans among the farmers and locals. The twelve volunteers at the camp have also been teaching people how to tie a perfect turban. "Guru Gobind Singh ji said anyone can wear a turban," Ranjit Singh, a volunteer from Ferozepur, said. "It unites everyone, binds everyone in one thread."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-afraid-youths-ink-protest-tattoos-at-singhu-border-929018.html

Banerjee held an internal meeting with a select group of leaders at her residence to take stock of the situation. According to party sources, Banerjee told TMC leaders not to be "worried about the desertions" as the people of the state are with them. "Our party supremo during the meeting told us not to be worried about the desertions as it is good that the rotten elements are leaving the party on their own. She said deserters were baggage for the party," a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity after the closed-door meet. The meeting, which began at 7 pm, continued till 9.30 pm. In a jolt to the TMC ahead of the assembly elections, heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari quit the party on Thursday after resigning as an MLA. Hailing Adhikari, Pandabeswar MLA and Asansol civic body chief Jitendra Tiwari also quit the party, amid speculations that they may switch over to the BJP. Barrackpore MLA Silbhadra Dutta and Uttar Kanthi MLA Banasri Maity had also quit the party on Friday. West Bengal's ruling TMC was rocked by a fresh bout of desertions on Friday with at least 10 leaders exiting, deepening the crisis in the party hours before the arrival of the senior BJP leader and Union Home Amit Shah on a two-day visit. There is intense speculation that Adhikari, along with several other TMC leaders, is likely to switch over to the BJP camp during Shah's mega rally at Midnapore on Saturday. The brewing discontentment in the party may adversely impact the TMC's prospects in the assembly polls due in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/its-good-that-rotten-elements-are-leaving-bengal-cm-mamata-to-tmc-leaders-929060.html

The announcement was made during a press conference on Friday evening, with top World Health Organisation (WHO) officials, CEOs of several vaccine manufacturing firms as well as government officials from several countries. The deal will enable participating countries to have access to doses of the vaccine in the first half of 2021, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of the following year. A Covax representative told DH on Friday that India will be the beneficiary of a tailored package whereby the country will receive between 190 and 250 million total doses of the vaccine. The Union government intends to vaccinate 300 million primary recipients with two doses each. Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, WHO, said the allocation was subject to regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery. Vaccine manufacturers have agreed to supply the doses through 2021 and 2022, added Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  “For the vast majority of these deals, Covax has guaranteed access to a portion of the first wave of production, followed by volume scales as further supply becomes available,” Hatchett said.  Among the vaccine manufacturers who have committed to supply, some of the largest doses are the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Astra Zeneca which has pledged 170 million doses. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the SII, said his firm had signed an early commitment of 200 million dosages to Covax at a special price of Rs 220 per dose. “There is also a further option that Covax has the right to first refusal, to put on to us for another 900 million doses which we look forward to supplying and committing as well,” Poonawalla said. In addition, Dr Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson said 200 million doses of its investigational single-dose Janssen Covid-19 vaccine would be delivered to Covax in 2021, with more in 2022. Clarifying how allocation of the vaccines would be carried out, Swaminathan said the doses will be distributed in tranches based on the percentage of the population. “We cannot go for mass vaccinations on Day 1. We understand that most countries have prioritised their health workers and frontline workers and social care workers which normally constitute 2% to 3% of the population. Doses will be sent to cover that part of the population first and then moving progressively to cover 20% of the rest of the population,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/international-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-program-covax-gets-2-billion-doses-250-million-for-india-929074.html

"At this stage, I believe that the details we have are in fact that there was no one hurt but there has been a vehicle damaged in an incident and the mission is currently investigating the incident,” UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said. Official sources in New Delhi have said the reports emerging from the Pakistani side regarding attacks on the UN vehicle by Indian troops along the Line of Control are completely false, baseless and factually incorrect. Since movements of UN vehicles are known in advance, the question does not arise of any such firing, the sources said, adding the allegations are baseless. In response to a question by PTI, Haq said the UN is aware of what both sides have been saying at this stage about the incident. “We're simply aware that a vehicle was hit by an unidentified object. Like I said, no one was harmed in this incident but a vehicle sustained some damage, and we are investigating the incident.” Separately, Indian military sources also rejected the allegation by the Pakistan Army. "Reports of targeting United Nations vehicle are not true," said a military source.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/un-investigating-incident-of-unmo-vehicle-damage-along-loc-vehicle-hit-by-unidentified-object-929078.html

Quad is the informal grouping of four major democracies in the region: US, Australia, Japan and India. The meeting followed the productive discussions held in Tokyo during the second Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on October 6, the State Department said in a readout. The four democracies discussed practical ways to cooperate on countering disinformation, to strengthen supply chain resiliency, and to coordinate efforts to support countries vulnerable to malign and coercive economic actions in the Indo-Pacific region, it said. "The participants also explored opportunities for future Quad engagement on topics ranging from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to coordinating efforts on COVID-19 response and vaccines and expanding coordination in multilateral forums, including the United Nations and related organisations,” the State Department said. During the meeting, the officials reviewed recent strategic developments throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including the South China Sea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Mekong sub-region. “The four countries welcome the opportunity to continue regular consultations, including at the Ministerial, senior official, and working levels as a testament to the growing diversity and depth of engagement among the Quad members,” the department said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/quad-officials-meet-to-advance-a-free-open-and-inclusive-indo-pacific-region-929083.html
19-12-2020||National||India's Covid-19 tally crosses 1-crore mark||India's Covid-19 tally crossed the 1-crore mark on Friday, reaching 1,00,04,599. Meanwhile, the death toll rose to 1,45,136. On Saturday, India reported 25,152 fresh cases; 347 deaths. The active Covid-19 caseload currently stands at 3,08,751 with a recovery rate of 95.4 per cent. The Union Health Ministry said that 95,50,712 people have so far recovered from the infection.  In September, the vast nation of 1.3 billion people had been recording daily new cases of almost 1 lakh and looked on track to surpass the United States as the worst-hit country. But the pandemic has accelerated in the US and appears to have lost momentum in India, despite the country being home to some of the most crowded cities on the planet. The United States, with a population a quarter the size of India's, has been reporting upwards of 200,000 new cases in recent weeks, 10 times as many as India. India's fatality rate is also considerably lower -- less than half that of the US. Brazil has also reported more deaths at 185,000. Residents in the capital New Delhi told AFP they were still worried but were more comfortable than before about leaving their homes. "Obviously the fear levels have come down over time. Initially, it was more scary. Now we don't worry that much," housewife Huma Zaidi said. "But we are still taking precautions like wearing masks when going out and avoiding social gatherings." India has lifted restrictions on most activities to boost the struggling economy, although some states and territories have reimposed curbs to stem the spread of the virus. The 1-crore mark came as the world's second-most populous nation gears up for the vast and challenging task of starting to vaccinate the population next year. The government aims to inoculate 300 million people initially, with health workers and other frontline staff expected to be the first to receive the jabs. India has yet to approve any vaccines but several drugmakers have applied for authorisation, including AstraZeneca, which has partnered with India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker. Health ministry officials were expected to meet staff from the Election Commission -- which carries out vast state and national polls -- in the next few days as they map out how to distribute the shots, the Press Trust of India reported Thursday. Experts have cautioned that the country could struggle because of its weak cold-chain infrastructure -- needed for keeping vaccines refrigerated -- particularly in poor and densely populated urban areas and remote rural regions. "All the experience that India has in vaccinating is on the much smaller game of annual vaccinations of children," Satyajit Rath, an immunologist at the National Institute of Immunology, told AFP. "I'm not sure that India's public healthcare systems are sufficiently developed... Even mildly below-freezing requirements (for vaccine transportation and storage) are likely to prove extremely challenging in the rural hinterland's healthcare system services."

19-12-2020||National||Who gets to breathe clean air in New Delhi?||Monu and Aamya live in one of the world’s most polluted cities. Only one of their families can afford air purifiers. We measured their exposure to pollution for a day, to see how much inequality makes a difference. Air pollution killed more Indians last year than any other risk factor, and Delhi is among the most polluted cities in the country. But the burden is unequally shared. Children from poor families in Delhi spend more of their lives outdoors. Their families are more likely to use wood-burning stoves, which create soot. They can’t afford the air filters that have become ubiquitous in middle-class homes. And often, they don’t even think much about air pollution, because they face more pressing threats, like running out of food. Money can buy a family less exposure to Delhi’s deadly pollution — but only to a point. Air purifiers and well-sealed rooms can do only so much. Though precise estimates are impossible, even well-off kids like Aamya could lose roughly a year of life because of the amount of toxic air they breathe. And Aamya has asthma, so her parents are especially concerned. Still, over the course of one day, Monu was exposed to about four times as much pollution as Aamya. A long-term, consistent disparity like that could steal around five years more life from someone in Monu’s position, compared with an upper-middle-class child like Aamya. We know Monu was exposed to more pollution, because we measured it. Working with researchers from ILK Labs, on Dec. 3 of last year, journalists with The New York Times tracked how much air pollution the two children were exposed to over the course of a single day. As Monu and Aamya went about an otherwise ordinary school day, we followed them with cameras and air-quality monitors that measured how much fine particulate matter was in the air they breathed at any given moment. Known as PM2.5, these are tiny toxic particles, especially dangerous because they can infiltrate the bloodstream. Monu and Aamya have never met, but their families know about each other. Their parents agreed to participate in this report after we explained what we could learn by measuring the pollution exposure of children from different backgrounds. Aamya’s mother said she hoped it would help raise awareness about the greater health risks faced by families with fewer resources. We could see the difference in the quality of the air they breathed, just from the filters in their pollution monitors. The pollution in Delhi has an almost physical presence. You can see it, a haze just up the street. You can smell it, like an acrid campfire, and you can taste it on your tongue. It can make your eyes burn, your throat itch and your head pound. The tiny particles floating in the air increase the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks. They can damage your liver and brain. Some of the particles are composed of very poisonous materials like arsenic and lead. Other components may be less toxic in and of themselves, but their cumulative effect is another matter. With alarming regularity, researchers release new findings on the many ways air pollution harms the human body. Soon after our reporting, the coronavirus pandemic struck. Pollution levels plummeted this spring during India’s strict lockdown, producing a rare sight in the city: pure blue skies. Sadly, this was short-lived. Once the lockdown lifted in summer, the pollution came back. And now, as winter bears down, the air pollution across India is once again hitting hazardous levels. Doctors worry that the toxic air is making the virus even deadlier. Exposure to high levels of pollution causes inflammation of the airways, which makes people more prone to all kinds of infections. “We’re seeing it happen in front of us,” said Dr. Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi. “A lot of people are coming to hospitals from the periphery areas where population density and pollution levels are very high.” It is a reminder, if one were needed, that not everyone breathes the same air. “The rich can have the best quality air purifiers,” Kumar said. “The poor can’t.” The pollution hung gray in the air the morning we drove to Monu and Aamya’s homes. Government measurements put fine particulate matter at 130 micrograms per cubic meter — five times worse than the World Health Organization says is safe. But locals said it was a good day for air quality. Understandable, since the most polluted day there last year measured four times worse. There is no single cause of India’s pollution problem — and no single solution. But Indians have learned to count on one thing: Fall and winter are pollution seasons. As air temperatures dip and wind speeds drop, pollutants concentrate over India’s cities, especially in the north, which lies in the shadow of the Himalayas. The mountain range forms a barrier that cuts down air movement even further. The pollutants themselves come from multiple sources. By some estimates, vehicle exhaust accounts for around 20% to 40% of the PM2.5 in New Delhi, which is notorious for its traffic. Household fires and industrial emissions also play a role. And as the weather cools in the fall, farmers in rural areas burn remains from their crops, sending up huge clouds of black smoke that drift for miles and settle over the city. The end result is that the city’s smog is some of the thickest in the world. India’s government has not made battling pollution a priority. Many officials see it as a price they are willing to pay for rapid economic growth, which has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Outrage is not always easy to find on the street, either, no matter how smog-shrouded. Environmental activists say most people have no idea about how bad it really is. “We are talking about people who grew up in rural areas and they come to the city with no preparation,” said Ravina Kohli, a member of My Right to Breathe, a nationwide clean air group. “When they see polluted air, they don’t even think it is polluted.” There is also little data on how socioeconomic disparities may worsen pollution exposure in New Delhi, according to Pallavi Pant, a staff scientist at the Health Effects Institute. “We aren’t putting a careful enough lens on people’s occupation, or where they live, or what their socioeconomic status is,” she said. Clearly, money helps. Aamya’s parents, for example, have managed to shield her from some of the pollution. But it isn’t nearly enough. In fact, researchers say, there is no amount of personal spending that can fix the problem. Much broader action needs to be taken, they say, to make India’s cities healthy for everybody — rich or poor. A Day of Pollution Exposure Waking Up:Around 7 in the morning, Monu, 13, lifts his mosquito netting and crawls out of bed onto a dirt floor. Outside, his mother cooks breakfast over an open fire. A few miles across New Delhi, the world’s most polluted capital, 11-year-old Aamya finally gives in to her mom’s coaxing. She climbs out of bed and treads down the hall, past an air purifier that shows the pollution levels in glowing numbers. The air is relatively clean in Aamya’s apartment in Greater Kailash II, one of Delhi’s upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Well-fitted doors and windows make the home more airtight, and its rooms purr with the sound of three purifiers that scrub dangerous particles from the air. Monu breathes fouler air. He lives in a hut in a slum near the Yamuna River, which itself is seriously polluted. This morning, he sits in the open entryway to his house, drinking milky tea. He is the seventh of nine children and watches as one of his brothers coughs and huddles for warmth near the family’s wood-burning clay stove. Commuting: Aamya and Monu started their morning commute through the smog. Monu rode his bike to a free open-air school under a bridge, about five minutes from his house down a dusty road. He likes physical activity, and he wants to be an officer in the Indian army when he grows up. Aamya likes sports, too, but she wants to be a musician. She rode to school with her mom in the air-conditioned cabin of the family Hyundai. Arriving at School: Aamya attends a private school, the Ardee School, known for its efforts to insulate its students from air pollution. The school costs about $6,000 per year. The Ardee School posts pollution readings on its website and on a board in the building that uses colored flags to signal the air quality. When it gets too bad, students are required to wear masks. Very few wore one while we were there, because it was not considered a bad day. Monu’s school is free — but it has neither walls nor doors. For these students, the outside air <i>was</i> the inside air. Volunteer teachers struggled to be heard as metro trains thundered overhead every five minutes. At School: Both Monu and Aamya sound fatalistic. “It will keep increasing,” Monu says. “If we have 10 sick kids today, it’ll be 20 tomorrow. Lots of people will get sick, and their parents and doctors will say that it’s because of the pollution.” Aamya thinks that the government is to blame, and that one person can’t make much of a dent in the problem.“There are a lot of trees, which are not helping that much,” she says. “What my teacher says is that we can make a difference. But I don’t believe in that, because we have tried a lot.” Having Lunch: In the afternoon, after lunch at home, Monu went to another school, which he does every weekday. The outdoor pollution levels began to fall, as they do on most days when the morning traffic clears up and the winds shift. Preparing Dinner: At day’s end, an invisible enemy seeps through the doors and windows of rich and poor alike. With school over, Aamya and Monu are back at their houses, settled in to do their homework. When he is done, Monu watches his mom cook over an open fire, just like he did in the morning. At Aamya’s home, a servant does the cooking in a separate room. As Aamya’s family takes their seats at the dinner table, the air purifiers continue their reassuring hum. But there is only so much the machines can do. In Delhi, the air is the air, and like most buildings in the city, Aamya’s house is outmatched. Falling Asleep: As Aamya sleeps, she is breathing in more pollutants than most children in the world. It is far worse for Monu. As he arranges the mosquito netting around his bed and lies down, his exposure is over twice as high as Aamya’s. There is no escape for him. The most polluted part of his day happens at home, as he sinks into his dreams.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/who-gets-to-breathe-clean-air-in-new-delhi-929103.html
19-12-2020||National||All you need to know about India's immunisation guidelines||On Friday morning, India hit the one crore (ten million) mark of total Covid-19 cases. Following the United States' approval of Moderna mRNA Covid vaccine earlier Saturday and Pfizer's counterpart the week before, there have been questions about a possible vaccine rollout in India, and whether it would be made mandatory. The Ministry of Family Health and Welfare (MFHW) put out a document answering some of the main questions about vaccinations in India. Here is all you need to know. 1. The MFHW on Thursday clarified that the Covid-19 vaccine can be taken on a "voluntary" basis if and when it gets approved, adding that it is "advisable" to get the shot. "Vaccination for Covid-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of Covid-19 vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers," the ministry said in a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). 2. Those who have already gotten the virus and recovered from it are also advised to take the shot, as it would help the individual's immunity, the ministry said, adding that those who were Covid-19 positive would have to isolate themselves for a 14-day period before attending the vaccination camp.The ministry identified health care and front-line workers as "priority groups" to receive the vaccine, and also said that those above 50 years of age could be included in the list depending on the availability of the vaccine. 3. Registrations would have to be done online and would require citizens to upload a document of any government-issued photo ID, which they would have to produce at the site of immunisation. 4. "Photo ID is a must for both registration and verification of beneficiary at session site to ensure that the intended person is vaccinated."  Driving License, Health Insurance Smart Card issued under the scheme of Ministry of Labour, MGNREGA Job Card, Official identity cards issued to MPs/MLAs/MLCs, PAN Card, Passbooks issued by Bank/Post Office, Passport, Pension Document, Service Identity Card issued to employees by Central/State Govt./Public Limited Companies, Voter ID are among the listed documents. 5. The details regarding the date and venue of the vaccination camp would be conveyed via SMS to the beneficiary's registered phone number, they stated. 6. The two doses of the Covid-19 jab would be administered 28 days apart and antibodies develop two weeks after receiving the second dose, the ministry estimated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-you-need-to-know-about-indias-immunisation-guidelines-929118.html

With the two countries having held several rounds of talks to resolve the issue, Singh said India wants peaceful resolution of disputes, but asserted no harm to its self-respect will be tolerated. India and China have been locked in an over seven-month standoff at eastern Ladakh. In his address at the Combined Graduation Parade at the Air Force Academy at Dundigal on the outskirts of the city, Singh also said China's "attitude reflected that country's intentions" during the Covid-19 crisis. "But we have shown that India is not weak. This is new India that will give a befitting reply to any kind of transgression, aggression or any unilateral action," he said. India has found the support of many countries, even as it has received accolades, he said. Pointing out that rounds of talks have been held at the diplomatic and military levels to solve the issue, the Defence Minister said "let me reiterate, we don't want conflict, but peace. "But we will not tolerate any harm to the country's self-respect," the Defence Minister asserted. The country was prepared to face any situation, he said. Referring to the western sector, Singh said Pakistan was indulging in skirmishes on the borders and charged the neighbour with indulging in a "proxy war" using terrorism, despite being defeated by India in four wars. The armed forces and police were effectively dealing with terrorism, he said. The country was not only handling terrorism effectively within, but even taking action beyond the borders, he said. Referring to the airstrikes at terror camps in Balakot in Pakistan, he said they demonstrated India's military strength to the world and the country's firm intentions against terrorism. Stressing the need to change the strategies of war according to evolving times, Singh said the country may face challenges not only across the borders and the seas but also Space and Cyber domains, for which it needs to be prepared. "So it is necessary that you need to update yourself constantly. For future warfare and betterment, it is necessary that there should also be a scholar in you, besides a soldier," he said. The Defence Minister asked the newly commissioned officers to keep themselves updated about military strategy and technology and also focus on Artificial Intelligence. Observing that the government has recently taken several important measures to empower and promote indigenisation in the armed forces, he said, on the one hand, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas has been inducted and operationalised, while, on the other, the fifth-generation multi-role fighter plane Rafale has also been included. As part of reforms, many steps, including an increase in FDI limit in the defence sector, new policy on defence manufacturing and corporatization of ordnance factories were taken, Singh said. He also said air defence and maritime command are at an advanced stage of consideration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/want-peace-but-wont-tolerate-any-harm-to-indias-self-respect-rajnath-singh-on-indo-china-border-row-929143.html

Speaking at an Assocham convention, Modi highlighted reforms spanning from the manufacturing sector to labour to say India has during the last six years emerged as the world's preferred destination for investment. Record foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during the pandemic is a testimony to the faith that the world now has in India, he said. "Agriculture reforms initiated six months back have started benefitting farmers," he said without elaborating. Hundreds of farmers from states like Punjab and Haryana have blocked some of the highways leading to Delhi for more than three weeks now against the new farm laws which they fear will prompt the government to stop making direct crop purchases at minimum state-set prices, called minimum support price (MSP). The government, however, says the three new laws remove restrictions on marketing farm products and allow cultivators to engage with private companies to sell their crops. This, it says, allows farmers an alternate avenue to sell crops, raising their income, and is aimed at making farming more competitive. Also, the new laws do not end MSP-based procurement and mandis would continue to function, the government has stressed several times.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/agricultural-reforms-have-started-benefitting-farmers-says-pm-modi-929155.html

Rana, 59, has been declared a fugitive by India, where he is facing multiple criminal charges for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He was rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India. “The Extradition Hearing in this case is continued to April 22, 2021, at 1:30 p.m,” Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian, the US District Court of Los Angeles, said in his order dated December 17. Rana is a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, the Pakistani-American LeT terrorist who was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. Headley, 60, was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. Judge Chooljian said Rana will file opposition to the request for extradition by not later than February 1. The US government, which is supporting the extradition of Rana to India, has time till March 22 to file its reply motion. Both the parties have agreed that their motion either in support or opposition to the extradition request by India would not be of more than 50 pages. The judge on December 10 had denied Rana his bail application asserting that he is a flight risk. Judge Chooljian, in his order on December 10, said that Rana "presented a robust bail package" and offered conditions that significantly mitigate the risk of flight. But the "Court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight" and as such granted the request of the US government to the continued detention of Rana. Meanwhile, the US government in the court has supported India's request that the documents submitted by it in support of extradition of Rana be not made public. The extradition documents presented by India apparently include information about Rana’s involvement in the Mumbai terrorist attack that would be shared with him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-extradition-case-to-continue-till-april-2021-929156.html

Priya Kour from uptown Sanat Nagar area of the city not only earned Rs 25 lakh, but she also won the hearts of many with her good performance and witty answers on the sets of the popular TV show anchored by Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan. Kour, who appeared on the ‘Students Special Week’ series of the show, was also awarded Rs 5 lakh as part of a scholarship for her education. Earlier on Friday, during the fastest finger first, she made a record of the season by answering the round in just 2.67 seconds. The young Sikh girl, a student of class 10 from Simin Rose Garden Montessori School in Baghat Srinagar, sees inspiration in Mother Teresa and wishes to follow her path. “I believe in charity and would give some amount in a charity as well. The world is our family and one has to take care of that family as well,” she told reporters in Srinagar over the phone. Kour, who aspires to become an IAS officer, wants to serve the people in Kashmir Valley. “I want to become an IAS officer. Kashmir is my motherland, my birthplace. I want to serve my people and contribute towards the education sector,” she said. She has a younger sister, who is studying in class 8 while her father is in the transport business and mother a former teacher and now, a homemaker. Her proud father, Ravinder Singh said that his daughter has always been hardworking and that has been the reason that she has reached to this point of her life at such a tender age. “I am proud of her as she was brought laurels to Jammu and Kashmir by her hard work and dedication,” he said. Amitabh Bachchan praised her for the feat on the show that was telecast Thursday evening.

SP president Akhilesh Yadav called the contentious laws a clamp for the farmers. "The BJP didn't allow the farmers to have the slightest idea of the farm laws before making them. Now, they are pretending to make them understand the benefits of the legislations by holding farmers convention," Yadav said. "The truth is the farmers will really benefit only after the implementation of the Swaminathan report," Yadav said. "Only then, the farmers' income will double." In a tweet on Saturday, BSP president Mayawati said: "The central government should adopt a sympathetic approach, and not be stubborn, while dealing with the protesting farmers and accept their demands. "The BSP demands that the three new farm laws should be withdrawn," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/samajwadi-party-bsp-hit-out-at-bjp-over-farm-laws-929163.html

"Industry must be purpose-oriented and not only profit-centric. You must strive to bring within yourself the spirit of inclusion, hand-holding and transparency that you expect from the government and the society,” Modi said in his keynote address at industry body Assocham’s foundation week celebrations. Hailing their efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, which helped India become the “pharmacy of the world”  the Prime Minister asked industry to increase investment in research and development in sectors including agriculture, defence, energy, construction, information technology and pharmaceuticals to achieve the goal of self-reliance as soon as possible. “In countries like the USA, about 70% investment in research and development is made by the private sector but in India, it is the government which spends the most on R&D and the private sector’s contribution is minimal,” he said asking them to set aside a definite amount for such a purpose. Our challenge is not only self-reliance but how soon we achieve that, the prime minister said adding the world is now positive about India’s growth story and moved on from “why invest in India to why not invest in India”. The government has been continuously making efforts to reform old laws, taxation system, labour laws and removing red tape. The industry, he said, also needs to plan and act in order to make India the leader when the world is moving towards the fourth industrial revolution. The prime minister said that the next 27 years are critical for industry when they have to work with their fullest capacity and dedication to see a new India when it celebrates its 100th year of independence in 2047.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/be-the-change-you-want-to-see-in-govt-pm-modi-to-industry-929164.html

Akhtar had last month filed a criminal complaint against Ranaut before the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate, for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in television interviews. He had sought action against the actor under relevant sections of the law. The magistrate court on Saturday asked Juhu police to investigate the matter and submit their report on January 16, his lawyer Niranjan Mundargi said. The veteran lyricist was also present in the court during the proceedings. His lawyer argued that Akhtar has built his reputation from scratch in the last 55 years. He said that Ranaut made baseless comments against Akhtar on national television and social media, causing damage to his reputation. In his complaint, Akhtar has alleged that Ranaut dragged his name while referring to a "coterie" existing in Bollywood following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June this year. She had also claimed that Akhtar had threatened her to not speak about her alleged relationship with actor Hrithik Roshan, it said. All these statements made by Ranaut have garnered views in lakhs and thus tarnished Akhtar's reputation, the complaint added||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/police-asked-to-probe-javed-akhtars-defamation-plaint-against-kangana-ranaut-929170.html

"Yes there will be periods of discontent, there will be opposition, but there is never any dithering or any ... running away ... You want a lockdown, you got a lockdown, you showed the country as one that responded to shutting out of power and lights for few minutes, you made that happen. “It's not cosmetic, it’s not showmanship, it has put the country together showing we can stand up and marshal our efforts to do what you have set ourselves to do. "It is now our job as industry, to follow this, to show the benefits of this leadership which I am quite confident we will do," Tata said. Thanking the Prime Minister for leading the country through this difficult period, Tata said "I think if we all stand together and follow what you have said, what you have done and what you have shown, we will have a situation where the world will look at us and say this Prime Minister said it could happen and he made it happen".

The ministry, in a statement, said comprehensive and widespread testing on a sustained basis has resulted in bringing down the positivity rate. According to the health ministry, 11,71,868 samples were tested in the last 24 hours which has increased India's total cumulative tests to 16,00,90,514. The cumulative positivity rate stands at 6.25 per cent as of now and India's daily testing capacity has been boosted to 15 lakh, it said. India's Covid-19 caseload surpassed the somber one crore-mark on Saturday, adding 10 lakh cases in nearly a month, while the total number of recoveries surged to 95.50 lakh, according to the Union Health Ministry's data. The ministry further said India has reported more daily recoveries than the daily new cases during the past 24 hours. "The trend of more daily recoveries than the daily cases has led to a continuous contraction of India's active caseload which presently stands at 3,08,751 today," it said. The health ministry's data updated at 8 am on Saturday showed that the total number of cases mounted to 1,00,04,599, and the death toll reached 1,45,136 with the virus claiming 347 more lives in a span of 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-cumulative-covid-19-tests-cross-16-crore-mark-929182.html

While in one of the cases, the court ordered release of two arrested Muslim youths after the police failed to produce any evidence against them, in another, the court stayed the arrest of a Muslim man, who had been booked under the new law. The police in Moradabad district had, last month, arrested a Muslim youth under UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020, after the mother of a woman alleged that her daughter had been tricked into marrying him, though the woman pleaded that she had married him of her own volition. The 22-year old pregnant woman had been heckled and humiliated publicly allegedly by workers of a saffron outfit for marrying the Muslim youth. The woman's marriage was termed as 'love jihad' by the saffron outfit's workers, who forcibly took her and her husband to the police station, where he and his brother, who was also with him, were arrested while the woman was sent to a shelter home. The woman claimed that she miscarried in the district hospital after she was administered some injections. The officials refused to comment on the charge. After spending over two weeks in jail, the two youths were released on Saturday on the orders of the district court after the police failed to produce any evidence against them. In another case, the Allahabad high court stayed the arrest of a Muslim youth, who was charged with 'luring' a Hindu woman into conversion in the state's Muzaffarnagar district and was booked under the new law. Several cases of alleged 'love jihad' were reported from different parts in UP since the new law came into effect. The new law provided for a maximum imprisonment of ten years and also a fine for religious conversion through deceit, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/two-cases-of-love-jihad-in-up-fail-legal-test-no-evidence-in-one-court-stays-arrest-in-another-929198.html

Vivek Doval had filed a criminal defamation complaint against The Caravan Magazine and Ramesh for allegedly defaming him through an article and a press conference based on it respectively. Ramesh said his remarks were based on a news article and added that "some independent verification of the facts may have been in order". Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sachin Gupta heard the matter and closed the case against the Congress leader after Doval accepted the apology. The case, however, will continue against the magazine. In his statement made before the court, Ramesh said, "I want to clarify that these statements or accusations were made drawing conclusions from an article that was published the previous day in The Caravan Magazine. As the case progressed, I realised that perhaps some independent verification may have been in order." "However, the general elections were close and the questions raised in the article seemed appropriate for being highlighted in making certain insinuations against you (Vivek) and your family. "Thus, I would like to offer my apologies to you and your family for any hurt the statements may have caused. I would also urge the INC to remove the press conference available on their website," the former Union minister said. Doval had claimed that the allegations levelled by the magazine and later, repeated by Ramesh at a press conference were baseless and false, and damaged his reputation in the eyes of his family members and professional colleagues. In his complaint, Doval had said the magazine and Ramesh attempted to "deliberately malign and defame" him to "settle scores" with his father. The Caravan, in an online write-up titled "The D Companies", had said Vivek Doval "runs a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands", which is "an established tax haven", and it was "registered merely 13 days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government demonetised all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes in 2016". According to the complaint, Ramesh had held a press conference, reiterating the "baseless and unfounded facts" as narrated in the article. Doval had alleged that the contents of the article presented "no illegality" on his part, but the entire narration was presented in a manner that suggested "wrongdoings" to the readers. With regard to Ramesh, the complaint said the press conference addressed by the Congress leader went "beyond the mere narration in the article" and that he was already geared and armed to launch an attack, "merely waiting for the publication of the article", which could then provide a "smokescreen to the otherwise targeted and deliberate attack on the reputation of the complainant and his family."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jairam-ramesh-tenders-apology-to-vivek-doval-in-defamation-case-929212.html

The minister of state for finance said that in the past six years, the Modi government has consistently introduced reforms that have brought about significant changes. "And now all indicators, from inflation to fiscal deficit, from forex reserves to current account deficit, from GDP growth to financial inclusion– all point to a very stable and sustainable economic position,” Thakur said. Talking about the recovery post unlock, he said, it has been broad-based and has not come only from the agriculture sector. Of the 48 high-frequency indicators used by the Reserve Bank to track the economy, 30 parameters overtook February's level, he said addressing the 48th National Convention of Company Secretaries. "We have seen a stellar recovery in passenger vehicle sales, 2-wheeler sales, oil consumption, steel production, cement production,  international air cargo amongst other areas,” he said. Due to the gradual and thoughtful unlocking of the lockdown and the resumption of the business activities in the second quarter, he said, "we are looking at a strong economic revival, based on strong fundamentals and a slew of structural reforms.” Thakur, who was conferred the honorary membership of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI), said India is building a conducive ecosystem for enterprises and entrepreneurs to emerge as dominant global players. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic strategy of Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not only aimed at self-reliance but also sustainability across sectors, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-can-achieve-double-digit-growth-with-expansion-of-manufacturing-base-anurag-thakur-929217.html

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has published a draft notification and invited comments from the public for adoption of the E20 fuel. Though the current permissible level of blending is 10% of ethanol, India reached only 5.6% of blending in 2019. Adoption of E20 fuel means blending of 20% of ethanol with gasoline as an automotive fuel. “The notification facilitates the development of E20-compliant vehicles. It will also help in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, etc. It will help reduce the oil import bill, thereby saving foreign exchange and boosting energy security," said a statement from the Road Transport ministry. Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has been pushing for promoting green fuel like ethanol to reduce huge Rs 8 lakh crore crude import dependence. The minister aldo had said that the government aspires to take the ethanol economy to Rs 2 lakh crore in the next five years from Rs 22,000 crore at present. Ethanol is a biofuel and a common by-product of biomass left by agricultural feedstock including  corn, sugarcane, hemp and potato. Adoptation of E20 fuel will also help in reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, etc, the statement said. The move will help reduce the oil import bill, thereby saving foreign exchange and boosting energy security, it added. "The compatibility of the vehicle to the percentage of ethanol in the blend of ethanol and gasoline shall be defined by the vehicle manufacturer and the same shall be displayed on the vehicle by putting a clearly visible sticker," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-plans-e20-fuel-to-cut-vehicular-emissions-reduce-oil-imports-929232.html

The comments come as the country's Covid-19 caseload surpassed the one crore mark, though the number of daily cases and daily fatalities have been continuously coming down. Noted virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said India's curve for daily cases is on a downward slope since a peak in mid-September. "At this time, we are getting about 25,500 cases daily compared to over 93,000 cases per day in mid-September. I believe the worst is over. But there will be small peaks in the future just as we witnessed in late November," he said. "I don't think there would be a second peak as we have gone through the festive season (Dussehra to Diwali) and a state election without a significant jump. What is the reason for this? If we go by the second national serosurvey, likely cases were 16 times confirmed cases. By that factor, India would have 160 million cases now," he told PTI. It is possible that by now there are over 300-400 million infections in the country, Jameel said. "By that token, we are seeing large parts of the population getting protected and breaking transmission of the virus," he said. "Unexposed and susceptible people will continue to get infected. If immunity lasts a year or less, then we may have small peaks at regular intervals for the next few years. Good vaccine coverage will control this effectively," he said. When asked about a possible second peak of Covid-19, noted clinical scientist Dr Gagandeep Kang opined the transmission will not be as rapid as was seen the first time and the peak will not be as high. "I don't think the exposure is enough to say that we have herd immunity and won't need to worry about it again, but I think it is enough to ensure that we will have some level of protection so that the transmission will not be as rapid as was seen the first time and the peak will also be not as high," she said. "The problem has not gone away it will not go away with herd immunity, but I don't think necessarily we will see second higher peaks as has been seen in the West," Kang said. Dr K K Agarwal, an eminent cardiologist, said there is still 30-40 percent population in India which has not been infected by Covid-19. He said India, Argentina and Poland are the three countries among the 15 nations having the highest number of Covid cases that are not showing a second peak. "By all probability, India may not have a second peak, and if the second peak comes, it will only come due to the 501 new variant. Two of them have been described, one in south of England and one in South Africa. "If you don't get that strain, then there will not be a second peak. If India starts its vaccination programme by the end of this month and vaccinates around 30 crore people, we should be able to control this disease by March 25," Agarwal told PTI. However, if there is a second wave , he said, then it would be a new variant of the virus which will mean more cases but lesser mortality and the second peak will help in building herd immunity. Asked if the worst was over for India, Dr Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the epidemiological curve has come down for some states, while there is a fluctuation for others. "In more states, we have seen effective control while in some of the states we need to be mindful and watchful. The state scenarios are different from each other," Panda told PTI. India on Saturday crossed the somber milestone of one crore Covid-19 cases, adding 10 lakh infections in nearly a month, even as the virus spread slowed and recoveries surged to over 95.50 lakh, according to Union Health Ministry data. The health ministry's data updated at 8 AM on Saturday showed that the total number of cases mounted to 1,00,04,599, and the death toll to 1,45,136 with the virus claiming 347 more lives in a span of 24 hours.

Vardhan was speaking while chairing the 22nd meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19 through video-conferencing on Saturday. The meeting comes on a day India's Covid-19 caseload surpassed the sombre one-crore mark. "India's Covid 19 pandemic growth has dropped to 2 per cent and case fatality rate is among the lowest in the world at 1.45 per cent," Vardhan said. "India's Recovery Rate has peaked to 95.46 per cent while the strategy of testing one million samples has decreased the Cumulative Positivity Rate to 6.25 per cent," he added. Observing that despite festivals in October and November, no new surge in cases was observed due to comprehensive testing, tracking and treatment policy implemented on the ground, Vardhan appealed to people to diligently maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour even at a time when the country is at the cusp of authorising the first set of vaccines, a Union Health Ministry statement said. He also expressed the need for an expeditious vaccination drive to cover all the target populations estimated to be around 30 crores, it added. Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar, Civil Aviation minister Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai also joined Vardhan during the meeting. Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, Amarjeet Sinha, adviser to the prime minister and Bhaskar Khulbe, were present in the meeting virtually. Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director (NCDC) presented a detailed report on how the data-driven graded government policies have helped India achieve significant control over the pandemic. He showed figures related to the number of cases, the number of deaths, their growth rate and how they compared favourably to the rest of the world which is witnessing a meteoric rise in these parameters, the statement said. He also presented a granular analysis of the trajectory of the pandemic in each state, pointing out critical parameters like positivity, RAT and RT-PCR per cent breakup, concentration of cases in particular districts and other trends like fatality and fatality within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization, the statement said. He also presented data on the total dedicated Covid-19 facilities in the country, according to which a total of 15,359 such facilities, over 15 lakh isolation beds, 2.70 lakh oxygen supported beds, 80,727 ICU beds and 40,575 ventilators were present. Through a detailed presentation, Paul apprised the GoM on three critical aspects of vaccination -- the process of pre-clinical and clinical trial of all vaccines, the details of the six vaccine candidates undergoing trial in India (in terms of composition, manufacturers and technical partners, numbers of doses, conditions for storage and efficacy) and the composition of target populations in India, in terms of age, occupation and comorbidities and how they compare with other countries and WHO's recommendations, it said. He also briefed the GoM about requests for vaccines received by the Ministry of External Affairs from 12 other countries. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan noted the importance of Health Seeking Behaviour among the population as a key driver in checking fatalities. Explaining the paradox of some States/UTs reporting very high cases but minimal fatalities while others reporting low cases but comparatively high fatalities, he said this phenomenon results from people not coming forward for testing even if they are symptomatic in the second category of states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/need-for-expeditious-covid-19-vaccination-drive-to-cover-targeted-population-harsh-vardhan-929237.html

Claiming that he has waived Rs 15,000 crore of farmers’ loans from the state’s cooperative banks, the chief minister, while talking to reporters in Delhi, said he has been unable to waive loans from various nationalised and commercial banks owing to the lack of cooperation from the Centre. He said the nationalised banks come under the purview of the Centre which is dithering on directing banks to waive their loans to farmers. “We have waived farmers’ loans from cooperatives banks but nationalised banks comes under the Centre and the RBI. They are not able to waive loans as the Centre is not talking to them (for it),” Gehlot told reporters in reply to a query on the issue. "We have written a letter to the Prime Minister to direct nationalised banks to waive-off farmers’ loans just like state government did. They have not decided on it as yet. So, the fault is of the Centre," Gehlot asserted. State Cooperative Minister Udaylal Anjana said due to lack of cooperation from the nationalised banks, the waiving of loans taken from them has not happened as yet. “The state government will do its part if we get cooperation from the nationalised banks. Waiving loans taken from the nationalised and commercial banks is possible if banks agree to waive a part of it. If they do it, the government can give a fixed percentage of the amount," Anjana told reporters. Cooperative Registrar Muktanand Agarwal said the issue of waiving loans of nationalised banks is not related to the state Cooperative Department. "The issue of nationalised banks is not related to the Cooperative Department. The domain of Cooperative Department is limited to cooperative banks. Meanwhile, the state government has cleared its point of view on this issue," Agarwal said. Ahead of the Rajasthan assembly elections in 2018, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi had promised to waive farmers’ loans within 10 days, if his party is voted to power in the state. After the Congress emerged victorious, an order issued by the State Cooperative Department on December 19, 2018 said all short-term crop loans availed by eligible farmers from state cooperative banks, outstanding as on November 30, 2018 would be waived off. The order added that loans waivers from all nationalised banks, scheduled banks and regional rural banks would apply to “financially weak” and “defaulting farmers” up to Rs 2 lakh. It said it was applicable for short-term crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh availed from all nationalised banks, scheduled banks and regional rural banks which were overdue as on November 30, 2018. As per the Cooperative Department, the state government has waived short-term crop loans of Rs 15,000 crore of 20.81 lakh farmers. Meanwhile, opposition BJP has been hammering the Congress government on the issue for long. BJP state president said the then Congress president had promised that its government will waive entire loans of farmers within 10 days of assuming power. "It was a temptation because of which people voted for the Congress. Now, they are realising it was a fake promise. Its effect can be seen in the result of panchayat elections in the state, which he Congress lost," Poonia said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ashok-gehlot-blames-centre-for-state-govts-failure-to-waive-farmers-loans-929248.html

He also said that the vaccine makers are going to propose this to the government while speaking at a virtual panel on the challenges of developing a Covid-19 vaccine at the Carnegie India's Global Technology Summit on Friday. "We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits. In fact, COVAX and other countries have already started talking about that," Poonawalla said. It is because when frivolous claims come up, and something is blown out of proportion in the media, scepticism sets in that definitely something can happen due to the vaccine and to dispel that, the government needs to step in to spread the right information, he added. "... the government can act, the US, for example, has in fact invoked a law, to say that during a pandemic, and this is especially important only during a pandemic, to indemnify vaccine manufacturers against lawsuits for severe adverse effects or any other frivolous claims which may come about, because that adds to the fear and also will bankrupt vaccine manufacturers or distract them if they have to just all day fight lawsuits and explain to the media what is happening," Poonawalla said. These are a few things that the government can do and that is what the vaccine manufacturers are going to propose, he added. Last month, Serum had rejected charges that a 40-year-old man who took part in the 'Covishield' vaccine trial in Chennai had levelled against the company, alleging serious side effects, including a virtual neurological breakdown and impairment of cognitive functions. He had also sought Rs 5 crore compensation in a legal notice to Serum and others, besides seeking a halt on the trial. Refuting the charges, Serum had said, "It is evident that the intention behind spreading of such malicious information is an oblique pecuniary motive. The Serum Institute of India, will seek damages in excess of Rs 100 crore for the same and will defend such malicious claims".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-must-indemnify-coronavirus-vaccine-makers-against-all-lawsuits-adar-poonawalla-929250.html

A spokesperson of the ED said, the probe agency has attached three houses and a commercial building belonging to octogenarian Abdullah in Srinagar, Baramulla and Jammu under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Besides, houses and commercial building, land belonging to Abdullah, has also been attached at four places in J&K.  “During the investigations it is disclosed that out of the aforesaid attached properties the residence and land of Farooq Abdullah at Gupkar Road (Srinagar) and commercial buildings at Residency Road (Srinagar) are basically State lands obtained on lease,” he said. The ED also disclosed that the attached house at Bhatindi, in Jammu had been constructed by Abdullah on State land and Forest land. While the book value of these attached properties is Rs 11.86 crore, their market value stated to be about Rs 60-70 crore, sources told DH. The ED statement said that from 2005 to 2011, the JKCA received Rs. 109.78 crore from the BCCI. “Between 2006 to 2012, when Abdullah was the President of the JKCA, he misused his position and clout by illegal appointments of office bearer to whom he gave financial powers for the purpose of laundering of the JKCA funds. Investigation clearly brings out that Abdullah was instrumental as well as beneficiary of the laundered funds of the JKCA,” the ED probe reveals. It has also come to the fore during the investigation that despite existing regular bank account of the JKCA, six new bank accounts were opened for parking of the funds and siphoning of the same, the statement reads. One dormant bank account in the name of Kashmir wing of the JKCA was also made operational for the same purpose. The ED probe has revealed JKCA funds to the tune of more than Rs 45 crores has been siphoned, which includes heavy cash withdrawals of around Rs 25 crores, "with no corresponding justification." “Investigations disclose that for the purpose of generation of proceeds of crime, the funds were layered by way of complex interbank transfers in all the bank accounts of the JKCA and also by transfer to several personal bank accounts, followed by siphoning of the funds,” it added. On October 19 Abdullah, who represents Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency in the Parliament, was questioned by the ED for seven hours in the case. Two days later he was again summoned by the probe agency and questioned him about his role and decisions taken when the alleged scam took place. Last July, Abdullah was also questioned by the agency, days before the Centre’s August 5 decision to end special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. Earlier, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had in 2018 filed a charge sheet against the NC president, and three of his associates, for alleged misappropriation of funds.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jkca-scam-enforcement-directorate-attaches-farooq-abdullah-s-properties-worth-rs-1186-crore-929260.html
19-12-2020||National||Delhi court takes cognisance of offence of sedition against Sharjeel Imam||A Delhi court on Saturday took cognisance of the offence of sedition against JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to the violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in December last year, which resulted in damage to public property and injuries to police near Jamia Millia Islamia. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat took cognisance of the offences under sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), and 505 (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against Imam. The court had earlier taken cognisance of the offence under section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Imam, but deferred taking cognisance of offences under IPC sections 124 A, 153 A, 153 B, 505 as the requisite sanctions were awaited. The court took cognisance of the offences after the Delhi Police filed a supplementary charge sheet mentioning the requisite sanctions granted by the authorities concerned. "The requisite sanction...has been filed. I have perused the supplementary charge ­sheet. In view of the same, I take cognisance for commission of offence under Section 124A/153A/153B/505 IPC,” the judge said in his order. The Delhi Police had filed another supplementary charge sheet against Imam in the case in July this year. The police had alleged in the charge sheet that Imam gave inflammatory speeches at several places, including Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University during anti-CAA protests. The charge sheet said that Imam allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt and disaffection towards the Centre and instigated the people which led to the violence in December last year. "The present case has emerged from a deep seated conspiracy which was hatched under the garb of opposing the Citizenship Amendment Bill. Earlier even before the Presidential assent, the present accused (Imam) along with his associates were involved in circulating falsehood by canvassing in the Muslim dominated areas about this Bill that the Government of India intended to take away the citizenship of Muslims and also that the Muslims will be put in detention camps," it alleged. The charge sheet further alleged that "falsehood and rumours" were being continuously spread with mischievous intent that the Citizenship Amendment Bill, coupled with National Register of Citizens (NRC), intended to take away citizenship of Indian Muslims. "False messages were shared over social media, pamphlets were distributed among masses, individual, members of societies/NGO's were roped in to give speeches which made innocent teens believe that CAB would indeed take away the citizenship of the Indian Muslim community. "Protests against the CAB and later on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were started deliberately to create a sense of insecurity amongst the Indian Muslim population,” it alleged. Imam was arrested for his alleged inflammatory speech at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13 and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, where he allegedly threatened to "cut off" Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India. "In the garb of protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block the highways leading to the major cities and resort to 'chakka jaam', thereby disrupting normal life. Also, in the name of opposing CAA he also openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-court-takes-cognisance-of-offence-of-sedition-against-sharjeel-imam-929271.html
19-12-2020||National||From the Newsroom: Poonawalla bats for immunity of vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits||In your evening news brief, From The Newsroom, Poonawalla bats for immunity of vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits; Two cases of alleged ‘Love Jihad’ fail to clear the initial legal test and Wistron releases a press statement acknowledging that senior executives failed to take corrective measures.  Vaccine manufacturers need to have protection against all lawsuits for their vaccines especially during a pandemic, Serum Institute of India (SII) Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla has said. He also said that the vaccine makers are going to propose this to the government while speaking at a virtual panel on the challenges of developing a Covid-19 vaccine at the Carnegie India's Global Technology Summit on Friday. "We need to have the government indemnify manufacturers, especially vaccine manufacturers, against all lawsuits. In fact, COVAX and other countries have already started talking about that," Poonawalla said.   Of about a dozen cases of alleged 'love jihad' after the new 'anti-conversion' law in Uttar Pradesh, two have failed to clear the initial legal test. While in one of the cases, the court-ordered release of two arrested Muslim youths after the police failed to produce any evidence against them, in another, the court stayed the arrest of a Muslim man, who had been booked under the new law.   Last week, on the morning of December 12, several contract employees of Wistron ransacked the company's premises, factory equipment and burned the cars of the senior executives.  A preliminary investigation from the labour department of Karnataka state government revealed that there were several lapses from Wistron and its employee hiring agencies. The company failed to resolve the late salary payment issue and discrepancies related to faulty work logging system. Now, the Taiwanese company's primary client Apple has announced that it has put Wistron on probation and will no longer receive any new business from Apple before they complete corrective actions. Earlier today, Wistron also released a press statement acknowledging that senior executives failed to take corrective measures to resolve the issues faced by the employees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-poonawalla-bats-for-immunity-of-vaccine-manufacturers-from-lawsuits-929274.html

Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said discussions among unions are currently underway to decide their strategy, adding that they are also seeking legal opinion on the matter. "Our meetings are being held for the next course of action. We are hopeful that in the next two-three days, we will have clarity on whether we should be part of a committee as suggested by the court," Kakka told PTI. Another leader Balbir Singh said farmers will not call off their protests until their demands are met. "We are ready for a long haul. We are here for our rights. We are in the process to decide our stand following the court's order," he also said. Thousands of farmers have been staying put at several Delhi border points for the last 23 days, demanding a repeal of the new agri laws. Meanwhile, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) Saturday claimed that 33 farmers participating in the ongoing protests have so far died since November 26 due to accidents, illness and cold weather conditions. According to AIKS, 'Homage Day' will be observed in different parts of the country on Sunday to pay tributes to those farmers who lost their lives. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and mooted the idea of putting on hold the contentious farm laws to enable negotiations with the agitating farmers, which was opposed by the Centre, which said the agriculturists would not come forward for the talks then. The apex court, which made it clear that the issue of farmers' protest and the right of others to move freely would be dealt on priority at the moment and not the validity of the laws, also said it was thinking of setting up an "impartial and independent" panel of agriculture experts and farmer unions to resolve the impasse. The top court said it was of the view that the farmers' right to protest should not infringe the fundamental right of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blocking the entire city. The apex court, which said it was worried with the way things are going on, was told by both the Centre and one of the farmers' unions that the negotiations are not happening at the moment. It also said the farmers cannot keep on protesting without talking to the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-agitation-will-decide-next-course-of-action-in-2-3-days-say-protesting-unions-929280.html

The NCP is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state alongwith Thackeray's Shiv Sena and the Congress. "Some Congress leaders may have complained to Sonia Gandhi," said Nawab Malik, a state minister and NCP spokesperson, speaking to a news channel. The MVA alliance is committed to the CMP but there have been cuts in budgetary allocations for some development works due to the coronavirus pandemic, he said. "Some Congress leaders may have complained about this," he said. Senior Congress ministers Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan are part of the coordination committee of the MVA and aware of the situation, he said. "Internal bickering in Congress is not new. The issues regarding CMP could have been brought up before the coordination committee by the two ministers," Malik added. In her letter dated December 14, Gandhi sought the implementation of certain measures for Dalits and tribals such as reservation in government contracts for SC/ST rofessionals. She also expected that the government will fulfill the CMP in its true spirit in her first such letter to Thackeray since the coalition government was formed last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/complaints-by-congress-ministers-may-have-led-to-sonia-gandhis-letter-ncp-929281.html

Now we have offered our help to government and various agencies who will be in-charge of distribution and administration of vaccine to check counterfeiting and supply of fake vaccines which is a high possibility in a big country like India,” said APDI Chairman Kunwar Vikram Singh at the International Corporate Investigators Summit. “We are fully equipped and have wherewithal in dealing with such a situation. Our professional investigators and spy agencies can assist law enforcement and health agencies in tackling with the problem of fake and counterfeit items. We have been doing this successfully in the past," said Singh. Singh said when the Covid-19 pandemic had surfaced in India that the APDI had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi offering help in dealing with the problem of counterfeit and fake items. “The Union government had written to state governments about this crucial issue and later our investigators worked with various state police and local administrations in dealing with the situation.

The meeting comes a day after BJP leader and former Union minister Chaudhary Birender Singh joined a protest in support of the farmers at Haryana's Rohtak. The dharna was organised by the members of the Sir Chhotu Ram Manch. Singh is the grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram, a prominent Jat leader of the pre-independence era who championed the interests of farmers. This is the second time the Haryana chief minister met Tomar at his residence since the protests broke out, a state government official told PTI, adding that he had met the Union minister earlier on December 8. The two leaders are believed to have discussed the ongoing protest at Delhi's borders and the way forward to resolve the issue at the earliest, sources said. Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for three weeks to demand a repeal of three recent farm laws. They worry that these laws will eliminate the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP), do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system and leave them at the "mercy of big corporates", apprehensions the government has been insisting are misplaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/haryana-cm-meets-tomar-discusses-farmers-protest-929287.html

Romil Ramgarhia, who was BARC's COO between 2014 and 2020, was held on Thursday by Mumbai Crime Branch and he was produced before additional chief judicial magistrate S B Bhajipale on Saturday at the end of his initial custody. The probe agency sought further remand saying it had retrieved certain chats from his phone for which he needed to be questioned and to probe if there was a connection between BARC and Republic TV, one of the channels accused of manipulating the TRP mechanism. Republic TV, however, has refuted all allegations. Ramgarhia's lawyer, Aditya Mithe, told the court his client had no role to play in the case but had been arrested on "flimsy grounds". The court accepted the police's plea and extended his custody till Monday. Ramgarhia is the 14th person to be arrested in the case. The police have claimed Ramgarhia provided secret and confidential information to which he was privy as COO between 2014 and 2020. The police have said he also had access to information on households where the barometers have been installed. The police began a probe into the alleged scam after BARC filed a complaint through Hansa Research Agency about the rigging of TRP by some channels. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/trp-scam-custody-of-ex-coo-of-ratings-agency-barc-extended-929288.html

Her resignation came on a day Congress president Sonia Gandhi met a group of party leaders, including some who had written to her seeking complete organisational overhaul. During the meeting, they discussed ways to strengthen the party at all levels and it was decided to hold conclaves similar to Panchmarhi and Shimla to chalk out the way ahead. "I regret to announce that I have resigned. I am grateful to Rahul ji and Sonia ji for giving me this opportunity," Gupta, a key Rahul Gandhi appointee, tweeted. "Congress has a crucial role in the Indian polity today but…," she said, tagging two Op-Eds by her -- one which was published on Saturday and the other from last year. In a message posted by her on the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) office bearers' WhatsApp group, Gupta said, "I am writing to you to announce that I have resigned. "As you know, important organisational changes have remained pending for very long: the national committee took 1 year 3 months; state president orders have remained pending for months." "Many other state units are waiting for reorganisation to make space for new activists. These continuing delays by the GS(O) (general secretary organisation K C Venugopal) are damaging the organisation but in the present circumstances, it is not possible to escalate repeatedly to Congress President. The situation has thus become untenable," she said. In her Op-Ed published in the Hindu on Saturday, Gupta said the Congress needs to address issues of party organisation, grassroots level connect and establish a "strong top-down leadership". She said she believes only Rahul Gandhi could lead the party and asserted that "this is not a sycophantic statement - if any other leader had to emerge in the party, he would have done so over the last year". "Instead, different factions prefer status quo rather than allowing one group to ascend and upset the balance of power for everyone. Organisational power thus continues to reside in Mr Gandhi. The way then to revive the Congress and consolidate this power is one and the same - it's full and frontal exercise," she wrote in the Op-Ed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cong-joint-secy-in-charge-nsui-ruchi-gupta-quits-post-cites-delays-in-organisational-changes-929294.html

In the eighth and final phase of polling on Saturday, nearly 51 per cent turnout was recorded across 28 constituencies spread over 18 districts of the union territory, State Election Commissioner (SEC) K K Sharma said here. The DDC elections, the first democratic exercise in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state and divided it into two union territories, commenced on November 28 amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing a press conference, Sharma said the polling was peaceful and largely incident-free, barring a few minor incidents. "We had a successful last phase of the polls which recorded a turnout of 50.98 per cent for the entire J-K," Sharma told reporters. He said while 72.71 per cent polling was recorded in the Jammu Division in the final phase, 29.91 per cent turnout was registered in the Kashmir Valley. While the first phase recorded 51.76 per cent polling, the subsequent phases on December 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 witnessed 48.62, 50.53, 50.08, 51.20, 51.51 and 57.22 per cent polling, respectively. The counting of votes for the DDC polls, which were held along with by-elections to panchayats, will be held on December 22. He said over 3.21 lakh electors came out to vote in the final phase for which polling was held from 7 am till 2 pm, even as Kashmir valley reeled under sub-zero minimum temperatures. “At some places the voting continued after 2 pm as several voters were waiting for their turn to cast the ballot,” he added. Sharma said that in the final phase in the Kashmir Valley, Kupwara district in the north recorded the highest turnout of 63.8 per cent, followed by 56.5 per cent in Bandipora, 44.6 per cent in Baramulla, 35.12 per cent in Budgam, 11.2 per cent in Kulgam, 8.6 per cent in Anantnag, 8.58 per cent in Shopian and 8.50 per cent in Pulwama. In the Jammu region, Poonch recorded the highest turnout of 83.58 per cent, followed by Reasi (81.92), Rajouri (77.31), Kathua (73.93), Samba (73.65), Kishtwar (73.45), Ramban (73.42), Doda (70.33), Jammu (69.39), Udhmapur (60.49). Sharma said polling was held in a peaceful atmosphere and remained largely incident-free. "There has not been any significant incident. However, at a few polling stations, attempts of intimidation and ballot papers being torn were reported. Re-polling was ordered after contesting candidates from several political parties, other candidates and voters complained about unlawful activities during polling at some polling stations of Mendhar and Shopian DDC constituencies,” he said. The SEC said a candidate came under a minor incident of stone pelting in Poonch. “The PSO of the candidate acted properly and opened fire in air to stop the crowd. This led the people to disperse and there was some injury. This was an unfortunate incident,” he added. He said people have participated with very keen enthusiasm in the polls. The people of J-K want to participate in the development of the UT, he said. “I want to recognise the role of political parties and independents for participating in these polls. Also, I thank the government machinery including the police and CAPFs for their efforts,” Sharma said. On a question about the possibility of the assembly polls in the UT after the successful culmination of the DDC polls, Sharma said, "Assembly election is the mandate of the ECI (Election Commission of India). It is not right for me to comment. But, they (assembly polls) will happen sometime and the ECI will take steps for it." Earlier this morning, the voting began on a dull note at various polling stations due to early morning chill. However, it picked up the pace as the winter sun shone and long queues of voters were visible outside almost all polling stations across the Union Territory. Over 6.30 lakh electors, including 3,03,275 female voters, were eligible to vote in this phase, officials said, adding a total of 1,703 polling stations -- 1,028 in the Kashmir Division and 675 in the Jammu Division -- were set up. The DDC elections recorded a heavy voter turnout in Jammu at 64.2 per cent in the first phase, 65.54 in second, 68.88 in third, 69.31 in fourth, 66.67 in fifth, 68.56 in sixth and the highest 71.93 in the seventh phase. However, 10 districts in the Kashmir Division recorded a voter turnout out of 40.65 per cent in the first phase of the DDC elections, followed by 33.34 in second, 31.61 in third, 31.95 in fourth, 33.57 in fifth, 31.55 in sixth and 39.52 per cent in the seventh phase, the officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/j-k-ddc-polls-conclude-peacefully-with-overall-turnout-of-51-counting-of-votes-on-dec-22-929295.html

The government has issued an e-booklet in English and Hindi highlighting the success stories of farmers who have benefited from the reforms enacted in September. "There is a lot of content, including graphics and booklets that elaborate on how the recent Agro-reforms help our farmers. It can be found on the NaMo App Volunteer Module’s Your Voice and Downloads sections. Read and share widely," the prime minister tweeted sharing snapshots of pages from the Hindi version of the booklet. Later, he also tagged the English version of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar's open letter to farmers and said do read it out "to our hardworking farmer sisters and brothers". "The letter elaborately explains aspects relating to the agricultural reforms and how they will benefit farmers," Modi said. Tomar, in an eight-page open letter to farmers, had said on Thursday that the Modi government is committed to the welfare of farmers and stressed that the new agri laws are aimed at benefiting small and marginal farmers. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Five rounds of formal talks have been held between the government and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock. The unions, however, are demanding a complete rollback of the central laws. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) system will remain and also redress their other key concerns, but it failed to break the stalemate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-urges-people-to-read-e-booklet-highlighting-how-agro-reforms-help-farmers-929301.html

Not only is the R down for India, pegged at 0.86, but almost none of the states with the maximum number of active cases have an R-value more than 1. Among the big cities, only Mumbai and Pune have R greater than one and even for Mumbai, the very recent data seems to suggest that R may have just gotten below one. This is the finding of a model being run by Sitabhra Sinha, a mathematician at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai who has been tracking the pandemic since it started. “It is probably the best week after Covid-19 started in India in terms of the R estimates for the country as a whole and for various states. It is even marginally lower than the previous minimum of 0.88 that occurred in late October,” Sinha told DH. R or reproduction number is a measure of an epidemic’s ability to spread. If the R is 1.9, it means 10 infected persons can transmit the disease to 19 individuals. For an epidemic to be contained, the R-value has to fall below one and remain at that level consistently. In its latest run with data up to December 16 for India and December 14 for the states, the model threw up R-value under one for all big states like Maharashtra (0.71), Kerala (0.95), West Bengal (0.85), Karnataka (0.74), Delhi (0.78) and Tamil Nadu (0.96). Among the metro cities, Bangalore fared the best with an R of 0.66 followed by Kolkata (0.81) and Chennai (0.95) – a clear sign of the epidemic in recession in such urban conglomerates. With 25,152 new infections, the total number of active cases slumped to 3.08 lakh on Saturday even as India’s Covid-19 positive cases crossed the one-crore mark. The death toll stands at 1,45,136 of which 347 were added in the past 24 hours. During the worst phase of the pandemic, India was registering more than 90,000 cases daily reaching up to 98,000 once. But since then, there was a steady decline in the number of daily cases and death tolls notwithstanding the Diwali-Dussehra-Chhath festivities as well as Assembly and local body elections in several states where there was considerable mingling among people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-r-value-under-one-almost-all-over-india-best-week-since-pandemic-began-929303.html
19-12-2020||National||TMC challenges Suvendu Adhikari to name beneficiary, says he lacks courage||Stung by desertions, a combative Trinamool Congress challenged Suvendu Adhikari, who led the exodus on Saturday, to name the person he alluded to as the beneficiary "bhaipo" (nephew) of the party. There is no aspirant for the chief minister's post from the family of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, senior party leader Kalyan Banerjee told newspersons here. Referring to the comment by Adhikari, who joined the saffron camp at a rally by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Midnapore, to remove the "bhaipo" (nephew) from TMC, Banerjee told newspersons that none in TMC has any personal interest driven by family interests. Challenging Adhikari, Banerjee said, "You (Adhikari) lack courage so you cannot name whom you mean." He said, "None from the family of Mamata Banerjee have any aspiration to occupy the CM's post. None in our party has any family-driven personal interest. Everyone works under the directive of our leader Mamata Banerjee for the sake of the people and the party." Adhikari and other BJP leaders, including Shah and Kailash Vijayvargiya, had often in the past used the word "bhaipo" (nephew in Bengali) alluding to Banerjee's nephew and party youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee. It had evoked strong rebuttal from the chief minister. "Don't make personal attacks. TMC is not being driven by any family or propelled by its interests. There are instances of parivar tantra in the case of those who are making such cheap attacks," Banerjee said. The Adhikari family, to which Suvendu Adhikari belongs, is a prominent political family in East midnapore district. His father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyendu are TMC MPs in the district. The TMC leader ridiculed Shah having lunch at a farmer's home in West Midnapore district. "You(Shah) cannot be called a friend of farmers. It is all fake. You cannot turn into a friend of farmers by having lunch at a peasant's home. Your three farm bills remind one of the indigo cultivators in Bengal in the 19th century and the rebellion by the farmers then". Labelling BJP as a party of looters, Banerjee said "leaders like Shah are using different agencies to issue threats to opposition leaders, tempting them and using coercion." Accusing Shah of producing "a garbage of lies" at the Midnapore meeting, Banerjee said BJP leaders like him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi do not have the right to talk about the great personalities of Bengal and their sacrifices. "Shah paid tribute to martyrs Khudiram Bose, Matangini Hazra and social reformer Iswarchandra Vidyasagar in Midnapore today. Had their words and objectives motivated Shah, his name would not have been linked with the 2002 Gujarat riots," he said. The union home minister, he said, is either ignorant about the history of Bengal politics or is trying to mislead the people by his public comments. "Shah today claimed that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had also left her party like Suvendu Adhikari to launch Trinamool Congress. Doesn't Shah know that she had been forced to quit Congress to which she then belonged and then formed TMC ? The TMC leader continued, "Suvendu Adhikari had got all the prime postings in TMC in all these years. He can never be compared to Mamata Banerjee. Shah is defending a person who spreads falsehoods. Stating that Adhikari cannot take the sole credit of the Nandigram movement, the TMC leader said Mamata Banerjee had led the people's movement and her name is synonymous with the common people. "She has been made the chief minister by the people of West Bengal, not by any leader". Hinting that Adhikari does not enjoy as much support as was being projected, Banerjee "So why did you (Adhikari) lose the 2004 or the 1996 parliamentary polls? It shows when you won, it was not due to your charisma but due to Mamata Banerjee." He claimed there was not much crowd in the Midnapore rally which showed that not many people from Nandigram and Khejuri, which are reportedly Adhikari's strongholds, attended it. Wondering why it took 10 years for Adhikari to realise his "folly" of being with TMC, Banerjee "You have touched Amit Shah's feet on the stage today. In the past 10 years you had similarly touched the feet of Mamata Banerjee. So you were play acting all these years." Continuing his attack against Adhikari, Banerjee said "You (Adhikari) said you want respect. You got ministerial portfolios, you became MP twice. You had been appointed to several corporations committees as chairman. You had been party observer in many districts. "Isn't that enough? What kind of respect did you want?" he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tmc-challenges-suvendu-adhikari-to-name-beneficiary-says-he-lacks-courage-929306.html

Senior diplomats of India, Japan, Australia and the United States had a virtual ‘quad’ consultation on Friday – following up on the meeting between ministers of the four nations that took place in Tokyo on October 6. The ‘quad’ is largely seen as a US-led move to bring the democratic countries of the Indo-Pacific region together in order to build a bulwark against expansionist and hegemonic aspirations of China. They “reviewed recent strategic developments throughout the Indo-Pacific region, including the South China Sea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Mekong sub-region”, the US State Department stated in a press release issued from Washington D.C. after the consultation among the diplomats of the four nations. The press release issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi, however, did not have any specific reference to a discussion on Hong Kong, Mekong sub-region, South China Sea and Taiwan. Even as its soldiers are engaged a military stand-off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh, New Delhi refrained from directly referring to discussion among the diplomats of the four nations on the communist country’s growing belligerence in the contested waters of the South China Sea as well as in the Taiwan Strait. The press release issued by the MEA also had no reference to a discussion on Hong Kong, where the Chinese Government’s crackdown on democracy activists triggered concerns within the international community. “The officials exchanged views on regional and global issues of common interest,” the MEA stated in its press release. “They also reviewed ongoing and proposed practical cooperation in the areas of connectivity and infrastructure development, and security issues, including counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, maritime security, humanitarian and disaster relief, with the objective of promoting peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region”. The officials reaffirmed their commitment towards “a free, open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on shared values and principles and respect for international law especially the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea),” added the MEA. The virtual consultation among the ‘quad’ officials took place on a day Indian and Chinese diplomats had yet another video conference to end the military stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector. The senior officials of the four nations underscored during the quad consultations the importance of enhancing the resilience of supply chains for an expeditious and sustainable global economic recovery. They also highlighted the need to ensure safe, effective and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines, stated the MEA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-refrains-from-hurting-chinas-taiwan-and-hong-kong-sensitivities-after-quad-meeting-929317.html
19-12-2020||National||Farmers' agitation not affiliated to any political party, farmers group writes to PM Modi, Tomar||The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee on Saturday wrote letters addressing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar where it asserted the ongoing farmers' protests are not affiliated to any political party. In separate letters in Hindi to Modi and Tomar, the AIKSCC said that the government is wrong in assuming that the farmers' agitation against the three farm laws is being engineered by opposition parties. It comes a day after the prime minister accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers over the three farm laws. "The truth is that the farmers' agitation has forced political parties to change their views and your (PM's) claim that political parties fuelled it (protest) is wrong," AIKSCC, which is one of around 40 unions protesting at several Delhi border points for the 23 last days, said in its letter to the prime minister. Addressing farmers of Madhya Pradesh on Friday, Modi had defended the new farm laws, saying they were in the works for decades and those who are opposing them now for gaining lost political ground were once votaries of the same reforms. The opposition parties were against the new laws as they were upset that he would get the credit, Modi said, adding that he did not seek any credit but nobody should mislead farmers. In the letter, the AIKSCC said, "Any demand of any protesting farmer union and group is not affiliated to an political party." The AIKSCC alleged that the minister was diverting the main issues of farmers from discussion. In an open letter addressing farmers, Tomar had Thursday accused the Congress and other opposition parties of spreading falsehood about the new farm laws. He had also appealed to the agitating farmers not to fall prey to these "white lies" and said the Centre was ready to address all their concerns. The minister, in an eight-page open letter to farmers, had said the Modi-government was committed to their welfare and stressed that the new legislations were aimed at benefitting small and marginal farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-agitation-not-affiliated-to-any-political-party-farmers-group-writes-to-pm-modi-tomar-929328.html
19-12-2020||National Politics||Amit Shah's recipe: Hindutva, nationalism and farmers||Cultural nationalism, Hindutva politics and farmer outreach will be on full display during Home Minister Amit Shah’s two-day visit to West Bengal starting from Saturday. The former BJP chief is scheduled to address public gatherings and party workers to galvanise the saffron party’s poll machinery ahead of the elections in the state next year. Shah will also hold a review meeting of election management works with central ministers from West Bengal, organisation secretaries, zonal observers and BJP state general secretaries. Ahead of Shah’s visit, the BJP has assigned responsibilities of Assembly seats falling in all 42 Lok Sabha seats of the state under “Mission Bengal” to six Union ministers, who will stay in their assigned constituencies for a fortnight every month to strengthen the party and help identify winnable candidates. Ministers Gajendra Singh, Arjun Munda, Pralhad Patel, Sanjeev Baliyan, Nityanand Rai and Mansukh Bhai Mandaviya will take charge of five to six Lok Sabha seats each to ensure that the party, which is organisationally not very strong in the state, plugs its weaknesses. The BJP is making a serious bid for power in the state after winning 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. The saffron party had won just two seats in the 2014 general elections. BJP’s Lok Sabha tally in West Bengal was just four less than the ruling TMC, which had won 22 seats while the Left, whose over three-decades-long rule came to an end in 2011, scored a duck. The Congress had won two. The Lok Sabha MPs of West Bengal will give their feedback to the in-charge ministers. They will then apprise Shah, BJP chief J P Nadda and party general secretary organisation B L Santosh of their plans. Shah will also have lunch with a farmer family on Saturday. The event comes in the backdrop of the farmers’ agitation on Delhi border against new farm bills and the sensitivity of the issue in West Bengal, where Mamata Banerjee had come to power in 2011, building a campaign around farm protest in Nandigram and Singur. There is a possibility that former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari may join the BJP during Shah’s visit. The BJP is likely to make it a big spectacle by inducting several TMC leaders including a few MLAs. Shah will begin his tour by visiting Ramakrishna Mission, which has good hold among the people of the state including the intelligentsia. Besides visiting the famous Maa Siddeshwari Mandir at Medinipur and Devi Mahamaya Temple, Shah’s itinerary takes care of popular nationalistic and cultural symbols. He will offer tributes to freedom fighter Shaheed Khudiram Bose on Saturday and visit Shantiniketan to pay tributes to Rabindranath Tagore and address a gathering at Bangladesh Bhawan Auditorium on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shahs-recipe-hindutva-nationalism-and-farmers-929082.html

According to the India Meteorological Department, the national capital recorded its coldest day on Saturday with the minimum temperature dropping to 3.9 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides the representative data for the city. The mercury dipped to even lower levels in some parts of the city, recording 3.3 degrees Celsius and 3.4 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road and Ayanagar, respectively. The agitation has also led to traffic diversions at various border points causing inconvenience to commuters. Taking to Twitter on Saturday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the closure of certain roads and suggested them to take alternative routes. It said the Ghazipur border is closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad due to the ongoing protest. However, those traveling to Delhi can take alternative routes via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara and Bhopra borders, it said. "Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for two wheelers and pedestrian movement," it said in a tweet. However, for those traveling to Haryana, the Delhi Traffic Police said some borders are opened -- the Jharoda border (only for single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera. The Chilla border between Noida and Delhi is open for traffic but just one carriageway. However, the other carriageway from Noida to Delhi is closed, according to the traffic police. "Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Sabholi & Mangesh borders are closed. Please take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road," the traffic police said. "Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road, NH-44," it tweeted. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at the various borders of Delhi for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers' unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the newly enacted laws. The farmers have been saying these new laws will pave the way for a dismantling of the Minimum Support Price mechanism and the mandi system, leaving them to the "mercy" of big corporates, apprehensions the government insists are misplaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/protesting-farmers-steadfast-in-their-demands-as-delhi-temperature-plummets-to-seasons-lowest-yet-929141.html

You must strive to bring within yourself the spirit of inclusion, hand-holding and transparency that you expect from the government and the society,” PM Modi said in his keynote address at industry body Assocham’s foundation week celebrations. Hailing their efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, which helped India become the “pharmacy of the world”, the Prime Minister asked industry to increase investment in research and development in sectors including agriculture, defence, energy, construction, information technology and pharmaceuticals to achieve the goal of self-reliance as soon as possible. “In countries like the USA, about 70% investment in research and development is made by the private sector but in India, it is the government which spends the most on R&D and the private sector’s contribution is minimal,” he said asking t hem to set aside a definite amount for such a purpose. Our challenge is not only self-reliance but how soon we achieve that, the prime minister said, adding the world is now positive about India’s growth story and has moved on from “why invest in India to why not invest in India”. The government has been continuously making efforts to reform old laws, taxation system, labour laws and removing red tape. The industry, he said, too needs to plan and act in order to make India the leader when the world is moving towards the fourth Industrial Revolution. The prime minister said that the next 27 years are critical for the industry when they have to work with their fullest capacity and dedication to see a new India when it celebrates its 100th year of independence in 2047.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/be-the-change-you-want-pm-modi-highlights-shift-in-global-narrative-929154.html

The health ministry's data updated at 8 am on Saturday showed that the total number of cases mounted to 1,00,04,599 and the death toll reached 1,45,136 with the virus claiming 347 more lives in a span of 24 hours. Taking a dig at the prime minister's remarks in March that the Mahabharata war was won in 18 days and the war against coronavirus will take 21 days, Gandhi tweeted, "1 crore Covid infections with almost 1.5 lakh deaths! The unplanned lockdown did not manage to win the battle in 21 days' as the PM claimed, but it surely destroyed millions of lives in the country." 1 Crore covid infections with almost 1.5 lakh deaths!

Singh is the grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram, a prominent politician during the pre-independence era who championed the interest of farmers. Singh, whose son Brijendra is a sitting BJP MP, said it was his moral responsibility to stand with the farmers who he said are "worried" as they fear the new legislations will have an "impact" on their economic condition. "Whatever I have achieved in politics, would not have been possible had I not been the grandson of Sir Chhotu Ram," Singh said on Friday. "Therefore, it is my moral responsibility to stand with the farmers in their fight today and, therefore, I have decided to support this (farmers') fight," said Singh, a prominent Jat leader in Haryana. Singh further said that he along with his supporters will soon observe a symbolic hunger strike in Haryana's districts bordering Delhi. Under the banner of Chaudhary Chhotu Ram Vichar Manch, the former Union minister along with his supporters had sat on a protest at Rohtak on Friday. Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for three weeks to demand a repeal of the farm laws. Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP), do away with mandis system and will leave them at the "mercy of big corporates", apprehensions the government has been insisting are misplaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-leader-ex-union-minister-birender-singh-extends-support-to-farmers-agitation-929177.html

A sitting TMC MP also joined the saffron party. A CPI(M) MLA who joined the TMC in 2018 without resigning from her post joined the BJP along with a CPI(M) and a Congress MLA. Apart from Adhikari, TMC MLAs Banasri Maity (Kathi North), Silbhadra Dutta (Barrackpore), Biswajit Kundu (Kalna), Sukra Munda (Nagrakata), Saikat Panja (Monteswar) joined the BJP. CPI(M) MLA Dipali Biswas (Gajole) who joined TMC in 2018 joined BJP along with another CPI(M) MLA Tapasi Mondal(Haldia). CPI(M) MLA Ashok Dinda (Tamluk) and Congress MLA Sudip Mukherjee (Purulia) also joined the saffron party. TMC MP Sunil Mondal (Bardhaman East) joined the BJP. The scene at Shah’s rally would have been difficult for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to imagine. One of her trusted lieutenants, Adhikari, who played a key role in the Nandigram land agitation which catapulted her to power in 2011, gave the call to “hand over” Bengal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I want the same party to be in power at the Centre and the State. Otherwise, Bengal will not survive. The economy here is ruined. There are no jobs and only corruption. The only way to recover from this is to hand over Bengal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Adhikari. An ace organiser, the former Minister issued a direct challenge to the TMC supremo stating that her party would be pushed to the “second place” in the 2021 Assembly elections while BJP would occupy the first place. Adhikari slammed the Chief Minister for dubbing BJP leaders as “outsiders” and said that “we are Indians first and then Bengalis.” Lashing out at the TMC for dubbing him as a “traitor” Adhikari reminded the party that it had once been a constituent of the BJP-led NDA. The defection, especially that of Adhikari, would most likely have a severe impact on TMC’s organisation ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections. Adhikari, who was perhaps the only leader in the TMC after Mamata, with a substantial mass base, has significant organisational clout in at least 50 Assembly constituencies in Bengal and may deliver a severe blow to his former party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/heavyweight-suvendu-adhikari-joins-bjp-9-mlas-1-mp-also-change-sides-929186.html

Shah’s comment comes on a day when the BJP dealt the most severe blow to the TMC by roping in six of its sitting MLAs including heavyweight leader and former Minister Suvendu Adhikari. A sitting TMC MP also joined the saffron party along with a few MLAs from other parties. “This is just the beginning. By the time the next Assembly election will be held you (Mamata Banerjee) will be the only one left in the TMC,” said Shah. He was addressing a well attended BJP rally in West Medinipur district. He also said that the TMC leaders were leaving the party in large numbers to join BJP voluntarily without any kind of pressure. Shah said that the TMC supremo was worried to see the growing public support for the BJP in Bengal. “You (Mamata) never imagined the kind of tsunami you saw today. This is only the beginning,” said Shah. Shah also said that BJP would come to power in Bengal in the next Assembly election by winning more than 200 seats. He said that “honest people” from the TMC,CPI(M) and Congress joined the BJP under Adhikari’s leadership to work under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Refuting the Chief Minister’s allegation that the BJP was trying to engineer defection in her party, Shah asked was not it defection when she founded the TMC after leaving Congress in 1998. “Senior party leaders are leaving the TMC and Mamata didi is accusing the BJP of trying to engineer defections in her party. We have nothing to do with engineering defection,” said Shah. Accusing the TMC of indulging in corruption the Union Home Minister said that the party came to power in Bengal with the slogan of “Maa, Mati, Manush (Mother, soil and the people) but it lapsed into “extortion, corruption and nepotism.” He further alleged that TMC leaders resorted to corrupt practices with the relief fund following the cyclone Amphan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/by-the-time-west-bengal-elections-arrive-mamata-will-be-left-all-alone-amit-shah-929230.html
19-12-2020||National Politics||Congress decides to hold more Panchmarhi-like conclaves as Sonia holds rapprochement meeting with 'letter writers'||Seeking to quell recent dissension in the party, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday met a section of leaders including some who wrote to her this August demanding a complete organisational overhaul.     The highlight of the five-hour meeting, which ended with a plan to hold a 'chintan shivir' at the earliest opportunity to chalk the Congress' future strategy, was a demand by Sonia Gandhi's loyalists that Rahul Gandhi should assume the party leadership again. Rahul Gandhi said that he was "ready to take any responsibility given by the party", but at the same time mentioned that the decision on presidentship should be left to the electoral process. His response was applauded by the attendees, according to sources. Overall, the meeting stood out as an ice-breaking session with the 'letter-writers' whom Sonia Gandhi assured a constancy of dialogue and meetings to address their issues, besides announcing that the internal election process was underway and a brainstorming conclave like the ones held in Shimla and Panchmarhi in the past would be held soon. The meeting, which included Sonia Gandhi's close associates, was significant as it was the first effort by the Congress leadership for a rapprochement with the 'letter-writers' who had raised questions over the leadership. Some leaders like AK Antony, Ashok Gehlot, Ajay Maken and Pawan Bansal wanted Rahul Gandhi to assume the responsibility of Congress president. The former Congress chief said he liked working with the senior leaders as they had also worked with his father late Rajiv Gandhi and he knew them since childhood. Sonia Gandhi told those present that they were all a big family and will work together to strengthen the party. The sources said she also gave a go-ahead to hold a 'chintan shivir' soon to resolve ideological issues within the Congress and the strategy of taking on the BJP as also to tell people about the ruling party's "massive failure" in governance. The leaders said they had faith in the unifying face of party leadership and its ideological commitment, according to the sources. The 'letter-writers' stressed that their concern was to strengthen the party and asserted that they were not "rebels" or "dissidents", as construed by some. They said they had only raised issues in the party's interest to strengthen it, the sources said. They also pointed out the acrimony at the last CWC meet held virtually. Those attending the meeting from among the 'letter-writers' were Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, deputy leader of the party in the Upper House Anand Sharma, former chief ministers Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, and MPs Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha and Shashi Tharoor. The sources said after everyone raised their concerns, Azad said they were grateful that the leadership heard them and hoped the issues raised by them would be resolved "with integrity and honesty". Asserting that there was no dissidence in the Congress, party leader Pawan Bansal, a Sonia Gandhi loyalist, said the meeting was held on a positive note and in a congenial atmosphere with all the leaders expressing their views and suggesting ways to make the party stronger. Sonia Gandhi also agreed that more working committee meetings should be held, the sources said. This was also the first time that Gandhi met Congress leaders in person since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The meeting was held at the lawns of her 10, Janpath residence, which was followed by lunch. Besides former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were among those who attended the meeting. "Discussions were held on a positive note at the meeting where leaders talked about how to strengthen the party at all levels. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said we all are one big family and we all should work to strengthen the party. Rahul Gandhi also talked about strengthening the party," Bansal told reporters after the meeting. "There is no dissidence in the Congress party and all are committed to working unitedly to energise the party and fight all those forces which are trying to put upend the idea of India, as enshrined in the Constitution and as articulated by the founding fathers of India's Constitution," Bansal said. Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said this was the first meeting to discuss ways to strengthen the party and more such meetings would be held. He said 'Chintan Shivir' like those held in the past in Shimla and Panchmarhi would be organised. The Congress had organised both the Pachmarhi and Shimla 'Chintan Shivirs' when the party was in the opposition. While the Pachmarhi Shivir was organised in September 1998 when Gandhi had just taken over the party's reins, the Shimla Shivir was held later in July 2003. Another Congress leader Harish Rawat said that every leader spoke about unitedly working towards strengthening the party. Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and senior leader P Chidambaram were also part of the meeting, the sources said. Among Sonia loyalists were A K Antony, Ambika Soni, Ashok Gehlot, Harish Rawat, Ajay Maken, Pawan Bansal and Bhakt Charan Das. Incidentally, AICC general secretary (Organisation) K C Venugopal and the party's media in-charge Randeep Surjewala were not part of the meeting. Among the prominent 'letter-writers' who were absent was Kapil Sibal. The sources added that Chidambaram called for strengthening the PCCs instead of becoming a "general secretary-specific party". He also suggested that general secretaries should spend more time in party offices, while Anand Sharma said that they should be on the ground in the states. The Congress has already decided to hold elections for the post of Congress president and that process is underway. This followed a stormy Congress Working Committee meeting in August after the letter's contents became public.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-decides-to-hold-more-panchmarhi-like-conclaves-as-sonia-holds-rapprochement-meeting-with-letter-writers-929254.html

Among other things, the new laws enacted by the Union government provide a framework for contracts between private entities and farmers. Addressing a gathering at Karamsad in Anand district as part of the BJP's campaign to create awareness about the contentious farm sector reforms, Rupani also claimed that the Congress manifesto spoke about allowing the sale of produce outside Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs). "I must ask Congress, why your government in Punjab, your chief minister (Amarinder Singh) granted permission for contract farming to large companies and distributed permission letters from the stage?" Rupani said. "And now they are out to oppose contract farming?" he asked. "Contract farming is the future. In contract farming, farmers are assured of the price they will get for their produce," he said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had in the past written letters to chief ministers of party-ruled states seeking that farmers be allowed to sell their produce in open markets, and the same promise was made in the party's 2019 election manifesto, Rupani further claimed. APMCs will continue to function contrary to the fear that they will be abolished, and the Centre, as well as the Gujarat government, have earmarked crores of rupees for their modernization, Rupani said. His government gave farm loans at zero per cent interest, he said. "If the Congress is so much concerned about farmers, then give loans to them at zero per cent interest in (Congress-ruled) Rajasthan," he said. He also dared the Congress to state how many farmers benefited from loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh during its rule. "Anti-national elements" who do not want to see the country progress and farmers lead a happy life have joined the agitation against the new farm laws, Rupani alleged. "Farmers are not part of it. Farmers across the country did not participate in the Bharat Bandh call given by the opposition," he claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/why-did-congress-allow-contract-farming-in-punjab-asks-gujarat-cm-vijay-rupani-929258.html
19-12-2020||National Politics||Chintan shivir, parliamentary board on Congress menu for revival||Five months after the ‘dissent’ letter, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday met senior party leaders – the first face-to-face meeting in eight months – to chart out plans to revive the organisation reeling under successive electoral losses. The four-hour meeting on the lawns of Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence, was attended by 19 leaders, including some of the 23 letter writers, who made suggestions for holding a brain-storming session (Chintan Shivir) and acting on the advice made by senior leaders on improving the functioning of the party. The meeting, seen as an attempt by Gandhi to iron out internal differences, also saw the now customary calls for Rahul Gandhi to return as Congress President and reconstitution of the Congress Working Committee after the organisational elections. “I am willing to work for the party as all of you desire,” Rahul told the meeting, according to senior leader Pawan Kumar Bansal. However, sources said Rahul avoided a clear response on returning as party chief or contesting the presidential poll and merely referred to the process of organisational elections set in motion by the party. Saturday’s meeting was attended by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Prithviraj Chavan – all ‘dissenters’ besides loyalists such as A K Antony, Ashok Gehlot, Kamal Nath, Ambika Soni. Also present were P Chidambaram, Ajay Maken and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. At the outset, Gandhi made an emotional appeal saying the “Congress was one big family” and everyone should make efforts to strengthen it. Reeling under successive electoral losses, Congress was rocked by a letter by 23 leaders demanding more visible leadership, a move that was seen as an attempt to challenge Gandhi’s leadership. During the meeting, former Union Minister Manish Tewari made the suggestion on holding a Chintan Shivir on the lines of similar sessions held at Pachmarhi and Shimla in 1998 and 2003 when the Congress was in the opposition. “This was the first meeting and several more such discussions will follow. We are satisfied with the discussions that took place today and we have put our views forward. We have to all work together in national interest and the interest of the Congress party,” former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, one of the 23 letter writers, told reporters after the meeting. The leaders also sought regular meetings of the Congress Working Committee and revival of the Parliamentary Board to enable sharing of views on important issues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/chintan-shivir-parliamentary-board-on-congress-menu-for-revival-929286.html
19-12-2020||National Politics||PM Modi, Amit Shah reach out to farmers as protests enter 24th day||As the farmers' protest entered the 24th day with no resolution in sight, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday highlighted how his government's reforms have changed the world's perception about India and Home Minister Amit Shah had lunch at a farmer's house in West Bengal in full media view, apparently seeking to counter the Opposition's "anti-farmer" campaign against the NDA government. Speaking during his keynote address at ASSOCHAM, Modi asserted that farmers have now got the benefits of farm reforms that were introduced by the government six months ago. Separately in a tweet, Modi urged people to read and share widely an e-booklet issued by the government highlighting how the recent agro-reforms help farmers. “There is a lot of content, including graphics and booklets that elaborate on how the recent Agro-reforms help our farmers. It can be found on the NaMo App Volunteer Module’s Your Voice and Downloads sections. Read and share widely,” the prime minister tweeted sharing snapshots of pages from the Hindi version of the booklet. At the ASSOCHAM event, he merely said "agriculture reforms initiated six months back have started benefiting farmers," but did not elaborate on it. While the 100-page e-booklet in English and Hindi released by the government has highlighted the success stories of farmers who have benefited from the reforms enacted in September, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday wrote an open letter to farmers reassuring them on MSP and seeking to allay their fears on farm laws. However, nothing seems to be resolving the deadlock, the Agriculture Minister's letter further backfired with farmers questioning the mention of the Opposition parties role in the letter and slammed the attempt to link their protest with Opposition parties and it has led to attempts to forge a better unity among the farm unions. In Haryana, former Union Minister and BJP leader Chowdhary Birender Singh also extended support to farmer agitation. On Friday, Modi had said the government was ready "with our heads bowed, our hands folded, with humility" to allay any concerns over the issue while Tomar had expressed hope of resolving the issue of protesting farmers before the new year. Farmer unions are also not very enthused by the Supreme Court's intervention into the matter and have asserted that no farmer organisation approached the court in the first place and asked for its intervention in the matter. In the poll-bound West Bengal's Paschim Medinipur district, Shah had lunch at the house of a farmer as part of his exercise to strengthen relations with the farmers, a move coming in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers protests in Delhi to which Mamata Banerjee was quick to announce her support last last month as soon as protests had broken out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-amit-shah-reach-out-to-farmers-as-protests-enter-24th-day-929293.html
19-12-2020||National Politics||We want Tamil Nadu to produce a prime minister, says BJP national general secretary C T Ravi||BJP national general secretary C T Ravi, a Hindutva firebrand, is in charge of the party’s affairs in Tamil Nadu, a state where the saffron party is itching to make a mark in next year’s elections. Ravi tells Bharath Joshi how things are shaping up. Excerpts:  What is your understanding of Tamil Nadu politics from the BJP’s lens? Since 1967, power has switched between AIADMK and DMK. For the first time, there’s a (leadership) vacuum in both parties. There are 30% linguistic minorities - Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Saurashtrians among others who prioritize national interests. We’re yet to get into power politics, but activities are BJP-centric. Earlier, the BJP was kept out, but that’s not the case now. For Tamil Nadu’s development, the Centre has given 5.19 lakh crore whose beneficiaries need to be converted as voters.  Tamil Nadu is big on ‘land’ and ‘language’ as against the BJP’s Hindutva narrative and its image of being a Hindi party.  Ours is a nationalist party. Is there a nation without Tamil Nadu? Ours is a party that protects culture. The NEP has stressed on all languages. Now, there’s a chance to learn Tamil outside Tamil Nadu. PM Modi has, on various platforms, remembered Thiruvalluvar and Kamba Ramayanam. It was our government that supported Jallikattu. Also, the Chinese premier was taken to Mahabalipuram whose history goes back to 4,000 years as opposed to 400 years of the Taj Mahal. Tamil Nadu’s emblem is that of a temple, but most people who’ve ruled the state have no respect for God. We’re fighting against this.  What is the BJP doing organizationally?  We’ve asked our workers to win their booths, and the state will be won automatically. There are 68,000 booths and we’ve formed committees in 45,000 of them. We have ‘A’ category Navaratna booths and ‘B’ category Pancharatna booths. Two tasks have been assigned: Identify issues that influence voters and identify influential voters. There’s a receptive mood.  But, Tamil Nadu thrives on regional parties.  Things can change if we can provide leadership that inspires confidence. What happened to the BJP in Karnataka in the 1990s I’m now seeing in Tamil Nadu. At one point, Tamil Nadu had people who gave national leadership. After the Dravidian movement started, national leaders stopped. Too much of regionalism will do that. We want Tamil Nadu to produce a PM. That’s the politics we want for Tamil Nadu. Now, there are people using Tamil Nadu’s name only for self-interest, family and corruption. Language is often cited as your weak area. How are you managing with Tamil?  No doubt, language is important. I can speak with emotions only in my language. In most meetings, I’m asked to speak in Kannada with the help of translators. It’s only when I speak in Kannada that I get responses from the crowd. They say they understand half of what I say. Even during personal conversations, I’m trying to pick up Tamil in a simple way: Sapadaacha? Ukkarango and so on. How do you see Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan?  The worship of individuals is more in Tamil Nadu than in any other state. I won’t comment on them. It’s up to the people. We’re confident that the model we followed in other states will give us success in Tamil Nadu also.  If the BJP wins at least 5-10 seats, would that be a job well done? We’ll be satisfied only when we can influence Tamil Nadu’s people. We need to take the first steps in any journey. In the late 1960s, it was a big deal when we won the Udupi municipality under V S Acharya. Every small win will lead to bigger ones.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/we-want-tamil-nadu-to-produce-a-prime-minister-says-bjp-national-general-secretary-c-t-ravi-929334.html

19-12-2020||North and Central||World heading towards another Industrial Revolution, says PM Modi||Amid the deadlock between the Centre and the protesting farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday urged people to read and share widely an e-booklet issued by the government highlighting how the recent agro-reforms help farmers. The government has issued an e-booklet in English and Hindi highlighting the success stories of farmers who have benefited from the reforms enacted in September. “There is a lot of content, including graphics and booklets that elaborate on how the recent Agro-reforms help our farmers. It can be found on the NaMo App Volunteer Module’s Your Voice and Downloads sections. Read and share widely,” the prime minister tweeted sharing snapshots of pages from the Hindi version of the booklet. While speaking at ASSOCHAM Foundation Week 2020, PM Modi said, "The world has confidence in the Indian economy. During the coronavirus pandemic when the world is distraught over channelling investments, we have received a record amount of FDI. We have to increase our domestic investments in order to sustain this confidence." "In the coming years, for Atmanirbhar Bharat, all of you should exert all possible force which can be mustered. The world is heading towards another Industrial Revolution. So from today we must plan and act on achieving our nation-building targets," PM Modi said.  Ratan Tata, Chairman Tata Trusts, thanked PM Modi at the event. He said, "In all the years that I have been in business, I have valued what our PM has been wanting to do. He has led the country through the pandemic for which we should be obliged. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock. The unions, however, are demanding a complete rollback of the Central laws. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) system will remain and also redress their other key concerns, but it failed to break the stalemate.

A division bench comprising Justice Pankaj Naqvi and Justice Vivek Agarwal was hearing a writ petition filed by Nadeem against whom an FIR was lodged at Mansoorpur police station in Muzaffarnagar. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate SFA Naqvi argued that the ordinance is ultra vires of the Constitution and any criminal proceeding initiated under provisions of the ordinance shall be quashed. Nadeem had sought quashing of the FIR lodged against him under sections 504, 506 and 120 B of the IPC and section 3/5 of the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. According to the FIR, the petitioner often used to visit the complainant's house and by taking undue advantage of acquaintance with the wife of the complainant, was attempting to persuade her to change her religion so that he may marry her. He also gifted a mobile phone to the complainant's wife. The bench observed, "There is no material before us that any force or coercive process is being adopted by the petitioner to convert the wife of the informant."

"There was a time in November when the daily cases went up to nearly 8,600. But, even then it wasn't a panicky situation in Delhi, and beds were available. We fought it all together. The fresh cases count today is 1,133, the official report will soon be out," he told an online briefing. The highest single-day spike to date — 8,593 cases — was reported on November 11. The chief minister said the situation in Delhi has improved significantly as the positivity rate had gone up to 15.26 per cent as in early November. It is now down to 1.3 per cent, one of the lowest so far in Delhi, and nationally too, he said. "It seems, together all of us have brought the third wave of the pandemic in Delhi under control," Kejriwal said. The active cases, which were around 45,000 in November, are now down to about 12,000, he added. "The daily average test count falls in the region of 90,000 in Delhi. Someone had advised us to show improvement in testing figures through fraudulent procedures... I issued strict orders, I can say that all our test figures are genuine," he said. The chief minister said, "I salute Covid-19 warriors, frontline workers; thank Centre, political parties and religious institutions for their support and cooperation".

The agitation demanding the Rs 13,000 crore dues from the Delhi government will continue in other forms, he said and hoped that the chief minister will have a "change of heart" and will find solutions to the problems being faced by people. The decision to call off the dharna came amid a deteriorating health condition of the protesters, including many women councillors, protesting in the open during the cold wave, Delhi BJP's media cell head Navin Kumar said. Three women councillors including former South Delhi mayor Sunita Kangra, who sat on the fast, were hospitalised on Friday. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash and South Delhi Mayor Anamika Mithilesh also fell sick and were recommended hospitalisation on Saturday, Kumar said. Puri expressed regret that Kejriwal did not meet the protesters even once during their 13-day dharna. The mayors and a few senior leaders of the three municipal corporations launched the indefinite hunger strike at the protest site on Thursday to demand the release of the Rs 13,000 crore from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. Speaking in the Assembly on Friday, the chief minister said even courts have said the Delhi government has paid all dues to the civic bodies. The police sent a notice to North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Saturday, asking him to end the hunger strike and leave the dharna site near the chief minister's residence in the Civil Lines area. "It has been more than 11 days since you have been sitting on a dharna near the CM's residence and you, along with others, have already been read over, explained and given a copy of the order of the Delhi High Court dated August 22, 2017, regarding procession/dharna in the Civil Lines area by the SHO, Civil Lines," the notice stated. It asked the protesters to vacate the site and move to a designated site if they wanted to continue with the dharna.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/civic-body-mayors-call-off-dharna-near-delhi-cms-residence-after-13-days-929255.html

There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the “crime” being investigated,” he tweeted. The properties attached are largely ancestral dating from the 1970s with the most recent one built before 2003. There can be no justification for the seizures because they fail the very basic test of having been acquired as the proceeds of the “crime” being investigated. Omar, also a former chief minister, said that they will fight the case in the court. “Dr Abdullah is in touch with his lawyers & will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters - a court of law, where everyone is presumed to be innocent & is entitled to a fair trial unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP managed social media,” he said in another tweet. Dr Abdullah is in touch with his lawyers & will fight all these baseless charges in the one place that matters - a court of law, where everyone is presumed to be innocent & is entitled to a fair trial unlike in the court of the media or the court of BJP managed social media. Omar also alleged that the news was published before senior Abdullah was given any official notice. “My father has seen the media reports regarding attachment of his properties in the ongoing investigation in to the JKCA matter. Not surprisingly the media was tipped off regarding the seizure before he had received any official notice or documentation,” he wrote. While terming the ED action as an attempt to make him bow, Farooq Abdullah said “I won’t.” “Let them (ED) do their job, and I will do mine,’ he told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-justification-for-attaching-properties-omar-on-ed-action-on-farooq-abdullah-929297.html

19-12-2020||North and Central||Trust unveils design of mosque, hospital to be built in Ayodhya||The design of a mosque and a hospital to be built on a five-acre land in Ayodhya's Dhannipur village allocated by the Supreme Court in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case was unveiled on Saturday at the IICF office here. The Uttar Pradesh State Sunni Central Waqf Board had formed the trust, Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), to construct the mosque and other utilities on the plot. Prof SM Akhtar of Jamia Millia Islamia, who joined the programme through video conferencing, displayed the designs of the mosque and the 200-bed hospital that will come up at the site. A community kitchen (saarvjanik bhojnalaya) and a modern library will also be set up in the complex. "The design of the mosque has been prepared using modern technology, and it will be egg-shaped without any dome. The two-storeyed mosque will not have any minaret. Solar power will be installed in the mosque, and around 2,000 people will be able to offer 'namaaz' at the same time," he said. The hospital will provide state-of-art facilities, much needed in the surrounding population, with a focus on the needs of the children who are suffering from malnourishment and expectant mothers, the IICF said in a statement here. The building structure will also house the trust office and publication house focusing on research and a publication house of Indo Islamic Cultural-Literature Studies. "The construction work of the mosque was scheduled to begin from January 26, but in this period getting the map approved seems to be difficult, hence the construction is likely to begin from August 15," Athar Husain, secretary of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), told reporters. Asked whether the Uttar Pradesh chief minister will be invited for the foundation laying programme, Hussain said that as per Islamic traditions, no big function is organised while laying the foundation stone of a mosque. "After the hospital mosque is constructed, prominent people of the country and the state will be invited," he said. To a question on the name of the proposed mosque, Hussain said, "The mosque will not be named after any king or nawab. Personally, I have suggested that the mosque be named as Dhannipur Masjid." He also said that the work on the mosque will begin soon. "The mosque will be eco-friendly, and plants from across the world will be planted. The hospital will be a different building, which will a ground floor plus four floors," he said. Prof Pushpesh Pant, a consultant curator for the archives and museum at the site, said that there is a need for a good museum to showcase the joint accomplishments and struggles of the Hindu and Muslim communities in India. After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court had on November 9 last year ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. The mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992, by 'kar sevaks' who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/trust-unveils-design-of-mosque-hospital-to-be-built-in-ayodhya-929299.html

A group of transgenders also joined farmers at their protest site at Chilla border during the day and entertained them with songs and dance, with some of them also taking digs at the government over its alleged adamant attitude over farm laws. Scores of protestors from various districts of western Uttar Pradesh are camping at the Chilla border here and at a nearby Dalit Prerna Sthal since the first week of December. As members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), who are at Chilla border, burnt copies of the minister's letter, Yogesh Pratap Singh, the UP unit chief of farmers' group, said, “The protest will not be over until the three laws are repealed.” The traffic movement on the Noida-Delhi Link Road via Chilla border, meanwhile, remained disrupted as only one carriageway was open and the other closed for commuters due to the agitation. “The Noida to Delhi lane is closed but the other lane (Delhi to Noida) is open. Other routes between Delhi and Noida – the DND and Kalindi Kunj – are open for commuters,” a Noida Traffic Police official said. On Saturday, a group of farmers from Eta district also joined the BKU (Bhanu)-led a demonstration at the Chilla border, while scores of BKU (Lok Shakti) members stayed put at the Dalit Prerna Sthal. A group of farmers from adjoining Bulandshahr district had attempted to move to Delhi via Greater Noida and Noida to join the larger protest sites at Delhi-Haryana border but were stopped by the police, said officials. “These protestors had gathered at the Luharli Toll Plaza in Dadri area where they were pacified by police officials and convinced into returning home. They agreed to return after submitting a memorandum of their demands to officers,” a police spokesperson said. Normal traffic was restored soon at the toll plaza, the official added. The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the larger stir sites at Delhi-Haryana border. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has been maintaining that the new laws will bring better opportunities for farmers and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-burn-copies-of-narendra-singh-tomars-letter-929302.html

The landslide hit the road at Bhoom in Chanderkote area, completely blocking the highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country, they said. The officials said two vehicles suffered some damages after being hit by debris, but their occupants escaped unhurt. Road maintenance agencies have pressed men and machinery, and efforts are on to restore vehicular movement on the highway, they said, adding that it is expected to take nearly four hours. Earlier during the day, a truck turned turtle at Nachlana in Ramban, causing a temporary blockage of the highway. Traffic movement on the highway is restricted to one-way in view of the ongoing four-laning project and accordingly, vehicles were allowed from Srinagar to Jammu this morning as per the already announced schedule under which traffic plies alternatively from the twin capital cities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/landslide-blocks-jammu-srinagar-national-highway-hundreds-of-vehicles-stranded-929310.html
19-12-2020||North and Central||TMC filled with individuals who don't bother about anyone: Suvendu Adhikari in open letter||In an open letter to grassroots members of the Trinamool Congress, Suvendu Adhikari, a heavyweight TMC leader who joined the BJP on Saturday, said that West Bengal is standing at a critical juncture as people are destined to make a choice in the 2021 Assembly elections that will impact them forever. Adhikari claimed in the letter that "an extremely deep rot and malaise" has set into the TMC. "Neither West Bengal nor the Trinamool Congress is anyone's fiefdom," Adhikari, who resigned his ministership and left the party following differences with its top leadership, wrote. Asserting that the party was not built in one day with the contribution of one person, he wrote that it was a continuous and contiguous effort on a mammoth scale, the culmination of which was the TMC's coming to power in West Bengal in 2011. He alleged that the TMC, which the ordinary people built brick by brick selflessly, is now filled with individuals who do not bother about anyone but themselves. Adhikari, who played a significant role in the Nandigram anti-land acquisition movement that helped Mamata Banerjee win the 2011 Assembly elections bringing down the 34 -year old CPI(M)-led Left Front government, claimed that the problems faced by people a decade ago remain the same and "in some cases, has become worse." Alleging that the TMC has reneged on its pledge to serve the 'Maa, Mati and Manush', he said, "The individuals currently in charge of the party are treating it like their personal fiefdom." "The individuals have now hired external assistance, people with no knowledge of ground realities," Adhikari wrote in an indirect reference to poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his organisation I-PAC engaged by the TMC. Enumerating the sacrifices of the grassroots workers in building the party in the six-page letter, Adhikari claimed that these people are now being sidelined, humiliated and outcast. He alleged that the party is now filled with those working for personal gains. Adhikari alleged that the TMC is now working against the Bengali culture while claiming to defend it. He also wrote about Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar drawing "public attention (on) more than 100 instances of a total break down in the law and order situation." Alleging that the people of the state were being fooled by the ruling dispensation, Adhikari said, "Belated attempts such as Duare Sarkar (government at doorsteps) programme which were conceptualised 10 years after being in power, cannot placate our great people." The 'Duare Sarkar' programme was launched by the TMC government on December 1 to help people avail the benefits of welfare schemes, setting up camps in many localities across the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/tmc-filled-with-individuals-who-dont-bother-about-anyone-suvendu-adhikari-in-open-letter-929318.html
19-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Cruising down the Ganga||Maha Vishnu was reclining on Adi Sesha, reading his favourite newspaper and sipping a steaming cup of heavenly ambrosia. “Listen to this.” He waved the paper excitedly. “They are setting up a Ramayana luxury cruise in Ayodhya on the river Sarayu. Imagine the money it will bring to my temple.” Lakshmi yawned. It would only mean more noise, crowds and corona. Who will spoil a holiday wearing masks and sitting ten feet apart? But Vishnu continued, unfazed. “Smart guy, this Modi. He will smear his forehead with turmeric, perform homa and havan and chant mantras, while calculating the revenue that Ayodhya will generate .” “He is better than all your economists who win the Nobel Prize,” added His consort. “I also think he is a great strategist,” continued Vishnu. “He wins elections by promising temples. Then, he himself will perform pujas in them. He builds roads and canals for devotees to visit them. Then gets film stars to make biopics on himself traveling on them. And now look, he is converting my Ayodhya into a tourist center.” Lakshmi looked pensive. “He may do the same with the Kashi Viswanatha temple next. Do you think Siva will agree?” Maha Vishnu laughed. “Who cares what that mendicant thinks or says? He can open his third eye for all that Modi cares.” Lakshmi did not like her husband’s tone. “Don’t underestimate His powers,” she warned. “If He blocks the Ganga flowing from His locks, your prime minister’s touristy dream will end.” Bur Vishnu was not listening. “Mathura will become a paradise on earth,” He mused. “They will install a son et lumiere on the banks of the Yamuna. When the PM presses a button, hundreds of gopis will jump into the water to bathe. A helicopter will carry me to steal their clothes and dance my fearful Kaliya Marthana. Tickets will be sold out in minutes. I tell you, this PM is a genius. Lakshmi was thoughtful. “Do you think it is fair to waste resources on theme parks and luxury cruises during a pandemic? Maha Vishnu was not listening. He was lost in a reverie. “You and I will go on that cruise in Varanasi and sing “Under the bridges of Kashi with you…” He fell asleep with a beatific smile on His face. The time had arrived for His next avatar on earth.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/cruising-down-the-ganga-929016.html
19-12-2020||Second Edit||Shot in the arm for Kerala’s ruling LDF||The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the CPM, has notched up an impressive victory in the recent local body elections in Kerala, and the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the Congress, has suffered a major setback. The results of the elections are important for two reasons. One is that the state is heading for Assembly elections early next year and the performance of the two contending fronts could provide an indication of the likely outcome. There was also increased interest in the elections because the LDF government of Pinarayi Vijayan has been under pressure in recent months because of a number of cases and scandals. The Chief Minister’s Office came under scrutiny in a gold smuggling case which central agencies are investigating. The state CPM secretary had to go on leave after his son was alleged to be involved in a drug-related money laundering case. But the LDF seems to have weathered the adverse situation and come out on top. It won most of the municipal corporations and district, block and gram panchayats. The success may owe much to its handling of two consecutive floods and the Covid-19 situation, especially in the early stages, and its welfarist programmes. It has always claimed that it was being politically targeted by the central agencies and the opposition. The results show that the opposition’s contentions have not been taken seriously by voters and they may be taken as a vote on the government’s track record and an affirmation of confidence in it. The LDF also admitted into its fold a faction of the Kerala Congress which was part of the UDF before the elections. Kerala has a tradition of voting out governments every five years but going by the local poll results, there does not seem to be a strong anti-incumbency sentiment working against the LDF government currently. Congress has claimed that the party’s support base is intact, but it has suffered substantial political and psychological damage. There are accusations against the leadership from within the party and allies have blamed it for bringing the alliance down. Issues like poor selection of candidates, a clandestine understanding with a party linked with the Jamaat-e-Islami, and declining support from Christians, who have been an important support base of the party, are being highlighted as reasons for Congress’ poor performance. The BJP has improved its performance from earlier elections, though it will be disappointed by its failure to meet its own expectations. The UDF will have to raise itself to a new level if it has to challenge the LDF successfully in the Assembly elections, though the dynamic and issues of state-level elections will be different form local body polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/shot-in-the-arm-for-kerala-s-ruling-ldf-929012.html

A Covid-19 negative certificate based on RTPCR test done within 48 hours ahead of reaching Nilakkal will be also mandatory from December 30, said the order issued on Friday considering a batch of petitions on the restrictions at Sabarimala. The daily number of pilgrims allowed at Sabarimala was initially fixed at 1,000 for weekdays and 2,000 for weekends. It was later increased to 2,000 and 3,000, respectively, considering the plea of the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages temple citing the steep fall in revenue from the temple. The state government had also decided to insist on RTPCR test for all pilgrims and employees after the Mandala Pooja on December 26. Over 300 persons, mainly staff and police personnel, were tested Covid-19 positive at Sabarimala after the pilgrimage season began on November 16. The pilgrimage season will end by the middle of January after the Makaravilakku. The High Court decided to allow more pilgrims considering factors such as Sannidhanam cannot be said to be a closed place with poor airflow and a decline in registration of pilgrims. The Travancore Devaswom Board recommended that up to 10,000 pilgrims can be allowed daily by adhering to Covid-19 protocol. Various Hindu outfits had earlier raised concerns over allowing more pilgrims citing that in case Covid-19 spreads among temple priests, it may affect the routine rituals also.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/up-to-5000-pilgrims-to-be-allowed-at-sabarimala-from-dec-20-929114.html

The 'green office' would strictly follow the ban on plastic and disposable articles, removal of unused furniture and e-waste and installation of waste treatment facilities for the disposal of organic and inorganic waste and introduction of eco-friendly utensils. Such offices would also have features such as organic vegetable gardens and facilities to conserve water and electricity. The green offices would be dust-free and toilet-friendly also, the Mission officials added.

"Experts opine that an increase in cases can be seen after the elections. We need to be extremely careful for the next two weeks. People should not think that elections are over and the Covid-19 has gone. Even though the government has lifted the restrictions, people should restrain themselves and follow the Covid-19 health protocol," she said.

A few passers-by clicked selfies with the dead reptile, some others stood as mere spectators, but a group of villagers who noticed the serpent had other ideas. The python was run over by a truck when it attempted to cross the road, at Nadar Kottai near Bargur in the district on Saturday morning, according to local people. Some of them decided to give a 'decent' burial to the python, garlanded the snake, paid their respects to the reptile, draped it in a white cloth, carried it in a procession and "laid it to rest," all rituals generally done in these parts to a deceased man or woman. Earlier, rose water was also sprinkled on it. A video of the people's act went viral. "This is unusual. Such funeral processions for pythons are uncommon.This was done for the first time by some villagers who wanted to display to the python equal respect and unwavering love one expresses to human beings," Krishnan, a villager,said. Meanwhile, a Forest department official said villagers could have paid their respects to the reptile out of some sentiment, "as snakes are worshipped in various parts in the country." While such an incident was uncommon, he said in certain parts of the country, people pay respects to a monkey if it died.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/villagers-perform-last-rites-to-python-killed-in-road-accident-in-tamil-nadu-929300.html

Police officials in the district were surprised on learning that a gang which had kidnapped an eight-year-old boy in Ujire on Thursday evening had demanded Rs 17 crore ransom in bitcoins. Anubhav, who is the grandson of A K Shivan, an entrepreneur based in Ujire, was playing in front of his house when he was abducted by four men. Later, the kidnappers contacted the family and demanded a ransom of Rs 17 crore. Initially, the kidnappers demanded 100 bitcoins (Rs 17 crore) but later reduced it to Rs 10 crore.   Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police B M Lakshmi Prasad on Friday said the gang had been identified. "The suspects are known to the family," said Prasad, who earlier in the day had visited the boy's house in Ujire. Police have also launched an investigation on why the kidnappers had demanded the ransom in bitcoins. Prasad told DH that the boy's father owned a hardware shop and was into online marketing.

19-12-2020||State||Lotus-shaped Shivamogga airport cost shoots up||The cost of the upcoming Shivamogga greenfield airport, about 300 km from Bengaluru, has gone up from Rs 220 crore to Rs 384 crore, after Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa ordered that it must be upgraded to operate larger aircraft.  Also, the terminal of the airport, which is coming up in Yediyurappa’s home district, will be shaped like a lotus, according to sources in the Infrastructure Development Department (IDD).  Originally, the airport was planned to operate smaller air traffic - ATR-72 day visual flight range operations - suited for low-cost regional carriers. However, Yediyurappa directed authorities to make the airport viable for all-weather, night-time and Airbus A-320 operations, pushing up the cost significantly.  The decade-old project started out with an estimated cost of ₹40 crore. According to IDD sources, the push to upgrade the Shivamogga airport came from Shimoga MP B Y Raghavendra, who is also Yediyurappa’s son. Both Yediyurappa and Raghavendra have been bullish on the airport project.  In June, Yediyurappa flagged off the construction of the airport, which is coming up at Sogane village, about 12 km from Shivamogga city. The government hopes that the airport will boost tourism and industrial activity in the region. The plan to upgrade the airport will not have a bearing on the completion time, IDD principal secretary Kapil Mohan said, adding that the project would be ready in 18 months.  The first phase of works will cover the airport’s runway, taxiway, apron, approach roads, peripheral roads and the compound wall. This has been awarded to Ibrahim Shareef, a Class-1 contractor. A second package for the construction of the terminal building, ATC tower, electro-mechanical works among others is awaiting approval to be given to another Class-1 contractor V P Karikal.  It was proposed that Shareef and Karikal be awarded the works required to upgrade the airport "because of similarities in the works of the first phase". However, this faced resistance from officials. As a result, Shareef will take up the entire first phase of works, whereas a fresh tender will be floated for the second phase, according to a government order.  The project, now fast-tracked, languished since 2009 when its foundation stone was laid by Yediyurappa, who was the CM then.  The Shimoga Airport Developers Pvt Ltd, a joint venture firm, had bagged the contract in December 2010 and work was to be completed in 24 months. Eventually, in 2015, the agreement was cancelled because work was not completed within the stipulated time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/lotus-shaped-shivamogga-airport-cost-shoots-up-929071.html

Gadkari was speaking after laying the foundation stone for 25 National Highway projects worth Rs 5,459 crore covering 552 km length in what was a virtual event. The union minister said 19 works costing Rs 31,035 crore under Bharatmala and other schemes were under progress. “Keeping in view the safety of road users, three works to provide protective measures on hill slopes in Shiradi Ghat on NH 75, Charmadi Ghat on NH 73 and Sampaje Ghat on NH 275 have been sanctioned amounting to Rs 115 crore,” Gadkari said, according to a release from the chief minister’s office. A detailed project report (DPR) was approved for the construction of a tunnel for Shiradi Ghat for a length of 23.60 km with a tentative cost of Rs 10,000 crore after it was vetted by the Indian Institute of Science, Gadkari said. “Bid document, statutory clearances and land acquisition plans are under progress,” he said. The final feasibility report on setting up a multimodal logistics park at Muddalingenahali near Dabaspet is expected in February 2021, he said, adding that this project would improve efficiency and reduce logistics cost. Also, three projects spanning 76 km in the Bengaluru-Chennai expressway were approved, he pointed out. Speaking on the occasion, Yediyurappa asked Gadkari to expedite the improvement of all congested NH intersections connecting Bengaluru city. He also sought fast-tracking of upgrading the existing 4-lane NH from Bengaluru to Tumakuru section to an 8-lane with service road. “I will direct all deputy commissioners to ensure speedy disposal of pending cases regarding land acquisitions to speed-up highway projects,” Yediyurappa said. Ethanol policy soon Gadkari said the Centre would soon come out with an Ethanol Policy to benefit farmers, especially sugarcane and paddy growers. "The government is very well aware of the plight of sugarcane growers and paddy growers. Sugar and rice production are surplus in the country and therefore, the Government of India intends to encourage production of ethanol from sugarcane and rice to support the farmers," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/morth-to-invest-rs-116-lakh-crore-in-karnataka-nitin-gadkari-929257.html
19-12-2020||State||Cash-strapped RTCs seek to raise loan to meet liabilities||Increasing financial stress has forced the four road transport corporations (RTCs) to seek loans from banks and multilateral agencies to meet the employee expenditure, especially to fulfill the provident fund (PF) deposits, at a time the pandemic has eroded their revenue generation. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) have already issued request for proposal notification seeking to raise Rs 230 crore and Rs 120 crore, respectively. Covid-19 has already pinned the corporations to a corner to an extent that they sought government aid to pay salaries over the last nine months. BMTC Managing Director C Shikha said Rs 230 crore was meant to clear old liabilities, including the PF, where we end up paying 12% or 13% high interest. “The government has helped in funding 50% of the employee salaries. We still have to raise the remaining amount from internal resources. We hope that the increasing trend in our ridership will help us in the coming days,” she said. The corporation, however, hopes that the trend of the rising ridership on its buses continues in the coming days. From 2 lakh daily riders in the initial months of the lockdown, the ridership has come close to 19 lakh. “It’s a positive sign. But there is still the large gap of 15 lakh between the pre-pandemic daily ridership (over 35 lakh),” she added. The KSRTC, which had posted cumulative losses of Rs 311 crore last year, is also raising Rs 120 crore as the revenue generated by the corporation’s services are falling short of meeting the operation expenditure.  Principal Secretary, Transport Department, Anjum Parvez said raising the loan was a viable method to reduce stress on the corporations. He said the two other RTCs in north east and north west of the state will also follow suit in the coming days. Noting that delaying PF deposits amounts to violation of rules, he said raising loans at around 8% interest rate would help avoid paying 12% or 13% interest on delayed PF deposits.  Meanwhile, officials fear that the burden of accumulated losses, which stood at Rs 2381.41 at the end of 2018-19, expected to double by the end of 2020-21 as limited earnings and rising expenditure has threatened the financial stability of the corporations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/cash-strapped-rtcs-seek-to-raise-loan-to-meet-liabilities-929324.html

I regret if that has hurt the sentiments of Kodavas. I am aware of Kodava culture and I greatly respect it,” he said in a tweet. Siddaramaiah had reportedly said that even Kodavas eat beef, for which he faced flak. “You have already tainted Dalits and backward classes by saying they eat beef. If that wasn’t enough, you’ve unwisely spoken about Kodavas. The entire state knows your love for beef. If you speak about self-esteemed Kodavas, they will make you think before stepping on their land,” BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said in a tweet. Kodavas plan stir on Dec 21  Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah’s comment has not gone down well with the Kodavas. Various Kodava organisations have planned a protest condemning Siddaramaiah’s beef consumption remarks, in Madikeri on Monday. “Kodavas worship cattle during Kail Muhurtha and other festivals. We do not even send old cattle to slaughter houses. We are not a beef-eating community.

Let him build a regional party to understand what it's like to build a party from scratch and sustain it, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy charged at the Congress leader on Saturday.  "I challenge him to build a regional party from scratch and win 10 seats on his own merit," Kumaraswamy said. The regional party leader's comments came in the wake of Siddaramaiah's recent claims that the JD(S) had an understanding with the BJP, causing him to lose from Chamundehswari constituency in 2018 Assembly polls. "Siddaramaiah, who is the king of striking internal political deals, should not be talking about JD(S) making deals. He claims he lost Chamundeshwari constituency because of JDS' internal deal with BJP. If that were true, would we have let him win in Badami," Kumaraswamy asked. The regional party leader further alleged that Siddaramaiah himself had struck so many political deals behind the scenes that if he were true to himself, he would have to quit Congress party for being a traitor. "Let him reflect upon the kind of deals he struck during 2013 Assembly elections. Wasn't he the one who started conspiring on toppling the coalition government very soon after JD(S) and Congress came to power together?"||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hd-kumaraswamy-dares-siddaramaiah-to-form-party-and-win-10-seats-929330.html

Further, will assess the situation across Karnataka for about 15 days and subsequently we will discuss the reopening of schools for lower grades," CM B S Yediyurappa said.  In the meantime, the Education Department has decided to relaunch the Vidyagama programme for classes 6 to 9, and hold classes on the premises of the schools. However, it is not mandatory for students to come to schools. Those who wish to attend the classes at schools must obtain a consent letter from parents or guardians.  The chief minister even pointed that hostels run by the Social Welfare Department will also reopen effectively from January 1, 2021, to cater to the requirements of the students of classes 10 and 12. The state government has directed all the schools to strictly adhere to the SOPs issued by the Health Department and take necessary measures to maintain the health and hygiene of children and staff at the schools.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-schools-to-reopen-for-class-10-12-from-january-1-929172.html
19-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Kumaraswamy challenges Siddaramaiah to build regional party and win 10 seats||Former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy on Saturday challenged Congress leader Siddaramaiah to build a regional party and win at least 10 seats on his own strength before criticising JD(S) and his leadership abilities. In a series of tweets, he also hit back at Siddaramaiah for alleging that there was an "internal understanding" between BJP and JD(S). "I have a challenge for Siddaramaiah, who repeatedly criticises about the number of seats JD(S) could win, about Deve Gowda (JDS supremo) and me. Come out of the shelter of the national party, build a regional party and win at least 10 seats on your own strength... then speak about our leadership," he tweeted. "... Don't speak lightly about the number of seats JD(S) has won. Building an independent regional party requires leadership. You are not aware of the efforts that are required for it. It is not possible from you," he added. Kumaraswamy was reacting to Siddaramaiah's statement in Mysuru on Friday that the former could become CM as Congress agreed to give him the post despite JD(S) winning just 37 seats after the 2018 assembly polls. The Congress leader had hit out at Kumaraswamy for the collapse of the coalition government last year, alleging that he tried to run the administration from a five-star hotel and could not keep his MLAs together. Kumaraswamy alleged that Siddaramaiah had planned to bring down the coalition government months after it was formed and that most congress legislators who defected to the BJP, eventually leading to the party coming to power, were his loyalists. On the charges of running the administration out of a five-star hotel, the JD(S) leader noted that Siddaramaiah had 'shamelessly' not vacated his official residence after the 2018 loss. "Does Siddaramaiah have the moral right to speak about me... I used to work at the office till 12 in the night while he used to go to undisclosed locations after 6 pm during his tenure." Siddaramaiah on Friday had also blamed a section within Congress for his defeat in Chamundeshwari assembly constituency in the 2018 assembly elections and asked those who had worked against the party during the polls to introspect and quit. To this, Kumaraswamy accused Siddaramaiah of having had an internal understanding with opponents to get some of his own Congress leaders defeated in some previous elections as he feared getting sidelined within the party. "If he (Siddaramaiah) introspects rightly, he will have to quit Congress," he said. With no party getting a clear majority in the 2018 assembly polls, Congress-JD(S) that had fought against each during the election joined hands to form a government with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister to keep the BJP out of power. However, following the rout in Lok Sabha polls, internal differences cropped up and the rebellion by some MLAs led to the collapse of the coalition government last year. Since then Congress and JD(S) leaders have been blaming each other for it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/kumaraswamy-challenges-siddaramaiah-to-build-regional-party-and-win-10-seats-929269.html

He also launched a veiled attack on the people opposing the project and said there was no scope for "negative, divisive and anti-national forces" in the state. He was addressing a state-level Goa Liberation Day anniversary function here, hours after some protesters blocked a railway line in a South Goa village to oppose the track-doubling project. "Goans are always happy, positive and optimistic in their approach towards life. There is no scope for negative, divisive and anti-national forces in the state, which is the ultimate truth. It has been proved time and again in the state," he said. "I take full responsibility of preserving the environment while implementing development projects in the state," Sawant added. Several protesters blocked the railway track at Arossim village in the early hours of Saturday against the track-doubling project of South Western Railway, saying that the move was aimed at facilitating private companies to transport coal. They said that the government was allowing the state to be turned into a coal hub. Several NGOs and political parties have been opposing the project claiming that it is being done by cutting trees in Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and the National Park to help the coal handling companies transport the raw material from Mormugao Port Trust to their plants in Karnataka. During the function, Sawant further said that the state government helped the citizens during Covid-19 pandemic by providing essential services, health care facilities to them, besides assisting farmers and conducting school examination, among other things. "The sincere attempts of the state government were acknowledged by the people, which was reflected in the results of the recently-held Zilla Panchayat elections (where BJP won most of the seats)," he said.

The undertrial escaped from the Thane Civil Hospital during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, they said. The man was arrested on December 8 for allegedly stealing a mobile phone. A court had sent him to judicial custody and he was lodged at Thane central jail, a police official said. "He tested Covid-19 positive recently and was admitted to the civil hospital. He was undergoing treatment in a special ward for coronavirus patients there. As police guards have to sit outside the ward as per the protocol, the undertrial was handcuffed to the bed," he said. Around 3 am on Friday, when the police guards went for a round, they did not find the undertrial on the bed, although the handcuffs were still attached to it. They checked the toilet and found that a stool was placed below the exhaust fan, the official said. "It was found that the undertrial had removed the exhaust fan and escaped through hollow space. A search was carried out in the premises, but in vain," he said. Thane Nagar police have registered a case under IPC section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) against him and a search was on.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-positive-undertrial-flees-from-hospital-in-thane-929167.html

The Karnataka Assembly recently passed a stringent Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020. In a memorandum submitted to Sawant on December 15, the CSJP urged him to take up the issue with his Karnataka counterpart and request him not to notify the bill in order to protect the livelihood of hundreds of meat traders in Goa, who are dependent on this trade. Cow slaughter is banned in the BJP-ruled Goa, but bulls and buffaloes are allowed to be slaughtered at certified abattoirs. CSJP director Fr Savio Maria Fernandes said that Karnataka passed the anti-cow slaughter bill that bans the slaughter of bulls and buffaloes in that state, and also prevents their sale and transportation. "This bill has badly affected the meat traders in Goa, which are totally dependent on Karnataka for the supply of beef for human consumption," Fr Fernandes said in the memorandum. He said that in 2015, the Maharashtra government had also passed such bill, because of which Goa was made to depend totally on Karnataka for the beef supply. "Since agricultural activities are not carried out on a large scale in Goa, the animals needed for supply of beef are not available in the state," he said. "The supply of beef or live animals for slaughter blocked by both the neighbouring states has seriously affected the livelihood of hundreds of meat traders, who along with their families depend solely on this trade for their survival," Fr Fernandes added. "In a multi-cultural society like India, such a ban will prove to be a challenge in upholding the plurality, which is the essence of our nation," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/church-officials-urge-pramod-sawant-to-look-into-beef-shortage-929191.html

Gandhi has written a letter to Thackeray, in which she has reminded him of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in the state and sought implementation of certain measures for the welfare of Dalits and tribals. In the letter dated December 14, she demanded reservation in government contracts for SC/ST professionals to promote entrepreneurship among them, among other things. Talking to reporters, Thorat, who is Revenue Minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government said his party was not unhappy in the alliance. "Congress's stand has always been in favour of uplift of poor and deprived sections of the society and Gandhi's letter was part of dialogue on how welfare measures can be taken. There is no resentment," he said. Meanwhile, when asked about the letter, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson of UPA and she has contributed to the formation of MVA. "A CMP for the welfare of different sections of the society is the agenda of the MVA and Uddhav Thackeray is working in that direction. Some issues might have gone on the back burner due to the pandemic. But the government is slowly getting back on track and focusing on the CMP," he said. Replying to a question, Raut denied that there was pressure politics behind the letter. "There is no pressure politics in this," he said. In her first letter to Thackeray, Gandhi has made several suggestions, including legislative backing for utilisation of funds meant for SC/ST communities during the same year. Gandhi said she expected that the CMP would be implemented in letter and spirit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sonia-gandhis-letter-to-maharashtra-cm-not-out-of-resentment-balasaheb-thorat-929231.html

A company official said that the zoo will be ready in two years and will be open for the public. “World’s biggest zoo is going to come up at Jamnagar in Gujarat. This zoo is being developed by Reliance Industries and it will be called “Greens Zoological, Rescue & Rehabilitation Kingdom”. All the required approvals from concerned central and state government authorities have been received. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, work on this project has been delayed. We hope to have this zoo ready in two years’ time,” said Parimal Nathwani, Director-Corporate Affairs, RIL and a Rajya Sabha MP. He said that the rescue centre at Jamnagar is separate from the zoo project which is not open for public. The rescue centre is a CSR initiative of RIL and it is to support the forest department so as to keep big carnivores like leopards who are injured or in conflict with humans. This centre recently received 12 leopards from the forest department for their upkeep. On Friday, M K Das, additional chief secretary in the Chief Minister’s office, also mentioned briefly that “world’s biggest zoo is also coming up in Jamnagar.” He said this during a presentation on Gujarat at a virtual conference “ASSOCHAM Foundation Week”. Senior officials said that the zoo may not be the “biggest in the world” in terms of area but it will house “biggest variety of birds and animals.” The Jamnagar zoo will be spread in over 250 acres of land.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ril-s-jamnagar-zoo-to-come-up-in-two-years-929311.html
