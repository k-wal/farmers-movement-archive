12-12-2020||First Edit||BBMP Bill: A thoughtless drill||The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Bill, 2020, passed by the Karnataka Assembly, is half-baked and has missed a golden opportunity to address the woes of the crumbling capital city. While there has been a long demand for an exclusive legislation to govern Bengaluru, the new Bill covers only BBMP, defeating its very purpose. What the city needs is an umbrella law bringing within its ambit various civic agencies like Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Bengaluru Development Authority, Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Namma Metro, among others, as the total lack of cohesion among these organisations is the biggest stumbling block in the city’s planned growth. The silver lining, however, is that the BBMP will have some administrative stability as it will have only two mayors during the five-year period, with a tenure of 30 months each, as against the present system of electing a new head every year. Another positive feature is the decentralisation of developmental works which will now be under the control of 15 local zones.  Perhaps, the biggest pitfall of the Bill is to expand the city limits by a radius of 1 km, thereby subsuming several villages on the outskirts and increasing the number of wards from the present 198 to 243. This move is totally illogical as BBMP is still unable to provide basic facilities like water supply, underground drains and roads in the 110 villages that were merged with the city 13 years ago. At best, this will come as a boon to real estate sharks as land rates increase with urbanisation. The expansion of the city’s borders also goes against the grain of the recently notified rules permitting increase in floor area ratio (FAR) to enable vertical growth of the city. The government had committed itself to the vertical growth of Bengaluru, an idea first mooted over two decades ago, to manage people’s mobility through certain fixed corridors and reduce the overall vehicle footprint, encourage use of public transport and lessen the pressure on civic agencies to provide amenities in far-flung areas by drawing power and water lines from the city. The BBMP, which is already struggling to fulfil its basic responsibilities, will now become even more unmanageable and is certain to collapse under its own weight with the inclusion of new areas. In the absence of an all-encompassing legislation to administer the city, it would have been better to split BBMP into smaller corporations on the lines of Mumbai. The Bill also does not address the issue of autonomy, as MLAs will continue to have a stranglehold over the corporation. The new Bill is a thoughtless exercise that threatens to do more harm than good to the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bbmp-bill-a-thoughtless-drill-926313.html
12-12-2020||In Perspective||Why principals should teach||‘A teacher affects eternity, he can never tell where his influence stops’ – Henry Adams Principals are teachers by definition. They are at best premier teachers, may be first among the equals. Therefore, they are quintessentially teachers, first and last. What a poignant statement on the significance of teaching in the life of a principal! This is true of both school and college principals. The sad fact, however, is that many principals do not teach. Some of the best teachers are lost to the profession by making them principals. This is a paradox in itself. They are chosen in most cases because they are very good teachers. Then they cease to teach. When they stop teaching, they become a spent force and do not inspire their fellow teachers as much as they would if they continued to teach. We, the writers, who have spent 3-4 decades in teaching and administration, tried to delve deep into this conundrum. Why does this happen? What are the factors that militate against the principals’ right to teach? We found out that some of the reasons given by principals themselves are not based on any professional imperatives. They are personal choices in many cases. For instance, some principals choose not to teach on the plea that they have other chores to attend. This is a totally untenable pretext. For some, not having to teach is an assertion of their own importance. A false sense of superiority gives them the impression that they should be a cut above teachers by not being one of them. A dubious complacency or a false sense of self-importance creeps in, whose real name is ‘inertia’ associated with sinecure jobs. There are principals who do not like to teach because they may not do as well as other better-known teachers in the same subject. So not to teach is a diplomatic withdrawal from the scene to salvage their reputation. There are people who feel that you need to keep off the work that others do, in order to establish your own credentials to judge others. This, of course, is a highly mistaken notion of the very foundation of any supervisory job. Then there are some employers who want the principals to be managing the school all the time. They, perhaps, do not know that the principal’s leadership which is his/her avowed mission can be realised only in the classrooms, the hallways and the playgrounds. We should also know that managing is a non-academic activity that requires a manager with certain other skills. Principals are supposed to be academic leaders with a vision who can share their vision with their teachers, for the larger good of the school. Now, to the reasons why principals should actually teach. First and foremost, a principal gets to know his/her school well only by teaching. Teaching gives the principal a deeper sense of empathy and better understanding of the classroom challenges. To be able to monitor the teachers’ work and to motivate them to do better, the principal himself/herself should be a practitioner. A principal who teaches can establish an effective connection with the teaching and learning process in the school. Clear idea A teaching principal gets a clear idea about what a teacher is going through. If a principal never teaches, he/she loses the much-needed credibility to correct the teachers. You can never ask someone to do something that you do not do yourself. Principals who teach will have an all-pervasive, over-arching influence in relation to students, teachers and parents. Such principals will share their teaching expertise with other teachers, and in that process they themselves will learn many new skills from their fellow-teachers. It is a collective learning exercise. During the present Covid crisis, principals have an added responsibility to go the extra mile and show how to be an effective teacher even in a virtual mode. A crisis throws up an opportunity for leaders to prove their mettle and imagination. Effective leadership of a school calls for both instructional leadership and human relationship. True relationship is nurtured in the classrooms and during activities where teachers interact with students. Like teachers, principals should also be a part of this ever-exciting journey of school life. The overall school climate is envisioned by a principal and that vision is shared by the teachers, and then by the students and parents. The chief architect of this school climate is the principal and the best means for him to influence the whole school is being an active participant in the teaching-learning process. Once principals start teaching, they will realise that the imagined glamour of administration can’t hold a candle to the thrill and excitement of teaching a live class of young students. Soon they will realise that the most fulfilling part of their job is the teaching time. The best motivation for teachers is to have a model teacher in their principal, first and foremost. Students too will long remember their principal’s classes above everything else.

12-12-2020||Main Article||Seeking universalism||Religion is necessary for the human psyche. The real-life link between politics and religion has resulted in a politics-religion nexus, which often misuses this human necessity to divide people on the basis of religion, for electoral or other benefit.  Rationalists and liberals decry religion, some even claiming that religion is responsible for violence. Adherents of every religion maintain that their religion does not advocate violence, although individuals wreak violence in the name of religion. India, host to multiple religions, is no stranger to communal violence, and it behoves us to take a closer look at religion in the current context. Spirituality - Mother of religions: Spirituality implies understanding that there is more to life than the universe which we observe with our cognitive senses. It raises philosophic questions like: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the meaning of life? Philosophy uses the tools of logic and reason in attempting to answer these questions. Normal rational thought processes spontaneously giving way to stillness of the meditative mind, and losing sense of self, is spiritual experience. In this state of mind, the distinction between the personal and the external disappear as the mind enters into a beatific state. Spiritual experience is intuitive, based in human consciousness, beyond cognition and language. Persons from different periods in human history, from different cultures across the globe, who have experienced such super-consciousness, are considered as seers or teachers. Such teachers communicate their intense, illuminating, out-of-world spiritual experience to followers, providing them with an idea of a deity with attributes, nature and form according to their culture. With or without the teacher’s guidance, the followers create a dogma of beliefs, ideas, practices and rituals, which characterise the religion. Many religions do not accept questioning of their dogmas and doctrines, and proscribe what is false according to them. They maintain that theirs is the only way to God and liberation, thereby dividing people as believers or non-believers. Throughout history, followers of the original teachers have (mis)used religion to gain power in society. In present times, the politician-clergy nexus within different religions, uses religion to prescribe, influence or control beliefs and behaviour of individuals, communities and societies. The religion-politics nexus in societies worldwide, has caused religions to become far removed from their founder’s spirituality. Indian culture, philosophy and theism: India’s syncretic culture has evolved from pre-historic to present times, meld ing multiple traditions and ways of life throughout the sub-continent. It has developed into a unique combination of spirituality, philosophy and religion. Throughout India’s five-millennium cultural history, sages and thinkers have developed and refined philosophy based upon personal spiritual experience. The principal tools of their philosophy are logic, reasoning, uncompromising questioning and informed debate. The recognised schools (darshanas) of philosophy are Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta, all focusing on the ultimate goal of liberation of the individual from mortal bonds. They provided a philosophical and theological foundation for society.  Social outcomes: According to the Darshanas, the endeavours of life are the four Purusharthas, namely, Dharma-Artha-Kama-Moksha. Dharma, concerning moral-ethical values, includes duties, rights, laws, conduct and virtues. Artha pertains to prosperity and economic values, Kama to fulfilling desire and psychological values, and Moksha to liberation and spiritual values. Also, life was defined as comprised of four successive stages or Ashramas. These were Brahmacharya (student primarily of Dharma), Grihasta (householder, active contributor to society), Vanaprastha (retired from active contribution to society), and Sanyasa (renunciate, devoted to thought and meditation). An individual was required to always strive to attain the ultimate goal of Moksha while adhering to the values of the Purusharthas, particularly Dharma, even as he passed through the Ashramas of life. The focus was spirituality, not religious practice. However, Shudras – the people lowest in caste hierarchy – and women did not enter the stage of Brahmacharya, and so could not receive education in Dharma. From pre-historic times, most societies have been patriarchal, with girls and women having subordinate status. Consequently, all aspects of daily life in family, community and society were male-dominated and perpetuated gender bias, including in life-defining events of birth, marriage and death. With caste-status being hereditary, caste bias got conflated with endemic gender bias in society. Discriminatory caste bias and patriarchal social practice prevailed over spiritual-philosophical values. Although constitutionally banned, gender-caste discrimination survives in present times within homes and in society, often manifesting as male-macho-entitlement to commit violent crimes against women and Dalits. Syncretic universalism:Upanishadic texts teach “Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti”, that truth is one but the wise perceive it differently. At the spiritual level, this truth, this “one”, is independent of religion. At the religious level, it becomes: God is one but the wise call Him by different names or perceive Him differently. “Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti” combined with the Upanishadic concept of Vasudhaiva kutumbakam - meaning the family of Earth (vasudha) including all living and non-living matter – expresses universalism, which embraces and validates all streams of philosophical thought and religious belief, faith and worship, without exception. At the 1893 Chicago World’s Parliament of Religions, Swami Vivekananda spoke of the oneness of humanity, holding that different religions are merely different ways of reaching the universal truth. This is inclusive secularism which is implicit in syncretic universalism, unlike the western concept of “separation of Church from State”. It unifies people and communities. Understanding this unifying philosophy is vital when the politics-religion nexus within different religions causes social disharmony and communal violence by dividing people on the basis of religion or caste. Without prejudice to their respective faiths, wise political leaders would use the moral compass of syncretic universalism. Only this can steer a path between the disruptive trio of a-religious liberalism, pseudo-secularism and gender-caste biased religious nationalism. Only this path can ensure communal peace and social harmony, which in turn will provide women equal status with men. But do we have enlightened leadership?

Only 50% of the buses operated, causing inconveniences to the public. The number of buses was less at the Sub-urban bus stand, on Friday morning, inconveniencing a lot of passengers. The situation was similar in the city bus stand also. The Mysuru-Bengaluru buses, that were plying every 10 minutes, were seen reaching the bus stand at a gap of one hour. As a result, there was a heavy rush for the buses, and the people were seen neglecting the covid norms. The buses to other districts like Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Hassan stayed away from the roads in the morning. However, the bus service to rural areas were not affected. Stone pelting Unidentified people pelted stones on two buses on Hullahalli route, damaging the window panes. In all, nine buses were damaged in stone pelting in the rural areas. Out of 577 KSRTC buses, only 300 buses operated from the sub-urban bus stand till 12 noon. Out of 250 buses that had to leave the city bus stand, only 130 buses were operated, according to sources. While the buses were operated normally from the Kuvempunagar and Bannimantap depot, the buses from Vijayanagar and Sathagalli stayed away from the roads, causing inconvenience to many passengers. A bus driver was injured in stone pelting, on route number 68, bound for Kanakadasa Nagar, in Mysuru, according to Mysuru Divisional Controller Marigowda. Districts The strike was almost total in Mandya district, with 90% of the buses staying away from roads. The bus service on Bengaluru-Mysuru route was totally stopped. However, the strike did not have much impact in Chamarajanagar district. KSRTC employees staged protests in Gundlupet taluk. In Hassan district, around 30% of buses were not operated. The passengers bound for Bengaluru and other districts were affected. However, the bus service returned to normalcy by afternoon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/transport-strike-partial-in-mysuru-region-passengers-hit-926349.html

The government hospitals in Mysuru district, including K R Hospital, functioned normally and the doctors attended the duty by wearing a black band, as a mark of protest. The out patient departments at private hospitals were not affected. The office-bearers of the association staged a protest in front of the IMA building and raised slogans against the Union government. The doctors criticised the government’s decision of giving permission for the Ayurveda doctors to conduct surgeries, as unscientific. Those who have completed MBBS courses are not allowed to perform surgeries. They need to complete ‘master of surgery’ degree to be eligible to perform surgery. Even then, they are not allowed to perform all surgeries. But, the Centre has taken an unscientific decision to give permission to the Ayurveda doctors to conduct surgeries, theysaid. Each form of medical science has a uniqueness of its own. It should not be merged. Those treating the patients through allopathy method should be called doctors, following Ayurveda method as practitioners and Unani as Hakeem, they stressed.As the IMA had called for the strike in a hurry, the government doctors were not able to participate totally in the strike, said a doctor. As per the norms, the government should be informed in writing about the protest 15 days in advance. Otherwise, the government has all the rights to take action against the doctors. Hence, the government doctors could not participate totally, he explained. K R Hospital Resident doctor Dr Rajesh said, “The doctors attended duty wearing black band. There will not be any problem for the in patient and out patients”. The outpatient departments of most of the private hospitals functioned normally. However, the number of patients to the hospitals were less on Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/mixed-response-for-doctors-stir-in-mysuru-region-926350.html

Several real estate agencies have shown interest in developing the lands into sites and constructing houses, luring the prospective buyers. But, constructing a house in the old town limits has become very difficult for the residents of Nanjangud, as the city municipal council is not giving permission, citing technical issues. Nanjangud was upgraded from Town Municipal to City Municipal around three years ago, in 2017. Earlier, it was easy for the residents to construct houses getting permission from the TMC. But, now, Nanjangud has been included in the local planning area and is part of the Mysuru Urban agglomerate.  As the city municipal does not have the authority to issue clearance certificates for construction activities, as per the Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, the people are now running to MUDA and municipal offices to get their work done. Lack of coordination between the MUDA and the city municipal office employees has left hundreds of people in the lurch. A few have also planned to file a public interest litigation, said Sanath Kumar of the town. The residents also claimed that the MUDA has not been issuing no objection certificates for building houses at Old Town limits. It is alleged that this has given room for corruption. Officials visit the spot and warn of imposing hefty fine. They demand bribe through middlemen. The banks refuse to provide home loans if there are no clearance certificate.  CMC commissioner Karibasavaiah said, as per the government circular of 2017-18, building license is provided only if the competent authority approves it. A letter has been written to MUDA in 2018, seeking authority to issue permission. The MUDA commissioner has been requested to solve the issue, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/nanjangud-residents-face-hurdles-for-construction-of-houses-926351.html

Issues related to the state were understood to have been discussed during the meetings. The state government has been seeking funds for its different development initiatives, besides implementation of assurances of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. This is Rao's first meeting with Shah after the recent Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections which witnessed a bitter war of words between the ruling TRS and BJP. Shah was among the top leaders of the BJP who campaigned for the party in the polls The BJP made surprise gains in the GHMC polls winning 48 out of the total 150 wards, a major increase from the four it had won in the previous city civic polls in 2016. Though it emerged as the single largest party winning 56 wards, the tally of TRS witnessed a sharp decline compared to the 99 it bagged in 2016. During the poll campaign, the BJP accused the TRS of failure in effective disbursement of relief to those affected by recent heavy rains and flooding in the city and having an 'unholy' alliance with the AIMIM. The TRS had countered it, alleging that the NDA government has not provided funds to the state towards flood- relief measures among others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/telangana-cm-k-chandrasekhar-rao-meets-union-ministers-amit-shah-shekhawat-in-delhi-926302.html

12-12-2020||National||India readies for 60 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses; to use standard cold storage||India will deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, the expert leading the initiative said on Friday. The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F), said V K Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for Covid-19 that advises India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India's vaccine. "The four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines," he told Reuters in an interview. Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca's Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates. And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia's RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine per year in India. The government expects the first approvals "very soon" from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said. "I am hoping at the earliest because we are ready." The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said. "The Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price." Supplies and Storage At present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc , AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech. But, Pfizer's limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure. "In a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so," Paul said. Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna , which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage. India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul. "We would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well." Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator. "As of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects," he said. India has the world's second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower. Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme. This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections.

The assertion by MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava came in response to queries on whether India had gotten in touch with US President-elect Joe Biden's transition team and on the American Democrat leader using the term 'Asia Pacific' instead of the more recent formulation 'Indo-Pacific' at a recent event. "You would have seen the press release which was issued after the conversation that the PM (Narendra Modi) had with President-elect Biden where it was conveyed that he looks forward to working with him to further strengthen India-US relations," Srivastava said at an online briefing. "As you are aware there is a consistent and strong bipartisan support in the US to strengthen its strategic partnership with India and to work together on addressing global challenges," he said. India looks forward to working with the next US administration once it assumes charge in January 2021, Srivastava said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/consistent-strong-bipartisan-support-in-us-to-strengthen-strategic-ties-with-india-mea-926402.html

In a statement, the INS said the Indian newspaper industry has played a vital role in the dissemination of verified and factual news in these challenging times which has been duly acknowledged by the Supreme Court and functionaries, from time to time. L Adimoolam, the president of INS, has urged upon the government to announce a stimulus package for the newspaper industry, which the INS has been seeking for the past few months, the statement said. He has pointed out that the newspaper industry is facing an "unprecedented crisis" with its revenue streams, as both advertising and circulation have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, many of the publications have either shut down or suspended some of their editions, indefinitely, the INS said. If this situation prevails, many more will be compelled to close their operations in the near future, it said. In the past eight months, the industry has already lost around Rs 12,500 crore and the annual loss is likely to be around Rs 16,000 crore, the statement said. "One can well imagine, the downfall of the fourth pillar of the world's largest democracy will have severe socio-political repercussions, as well as affect its 30 lakh workers and staff, who are directly and indirectly involved in the newspaper industry as journalists, printers, delivery vendors and many others," the INS said. The devastating ripple effect of the collapsing newspaper will impact lakhs of Indians, including employees and their families, as well as the larger eco-system of allied industries, printing presses, distribution supply chain including newspaper vendors and delivery boys, etc. who have for decades, been earning their livelihood from these operations, the INS said. The entire industry is putting in its best efforts to bounce back and now looking forward to the government to provide the much needed stimulus package, it said. The INS urged the government to remove residual 5 per cent customs duty on newsprint, GNP & LWC paper, provide two years tax holiday, 50 per cent increase in the government advertisement rates, 200 per cent increase in the government spend on print media and immediate settlement of outstanding bills of advertisements released through the Bureau of Outreach and Communication and state governments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ins-urges-centre-to-provide-stimulus-package-for-newspaper-industry-926406.html

12-12-2020||National||Centre against involuntary methods for population control, Supreme Court told||The Union government has told the Supreme Court that it was against the use of "involuntary methods" in family planning, saying international experience showed that any coercion to have a certain number of children would be counter-productive and would lead to demographic distortions. "The family planning programme in India is voluntary in nature, which enables couples to decide the size of their family and adopt the family planning methods, best suited to them, according to their choice, without any compulsion," the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. The response of the ministry came in an affidavit to a petition filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in the top court for bringing in measures to strictly implement the two-children norm.  The Union government maintained that the 'public health' was a state subject, being placed at entry 6 of the List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. It is of the view that the State must lead the process for health sector reforms in a suitable and sustainable manner to protect the common individual from health hazards, the government said. Claiming that it did not have any direct role, the government said it was a prerogative of the respective state government to implement various schemes as per the prescribed guidelines. "By way of allocating funds, it is facilitating the implementation of the approved schemes," it said.  "Moreover, India is witnessing a constant decline in Total Fertility Rate (TRF), which was at 3.2 at the time of when the National Population Policy, 2000 was adopted. It has now declined substantially to 2.2, indicating that the couples on an average do not want more two children. Also, as many as 25 States out of 36 States and Union Territories have already achieved the replacement level fertility of 2.1 or less.'' Responding to the affidavit, petitioner Upadhyay said, "It's very unfortunate that officials even don't know that Population Control and Family Planning is part of Concurrent List (List-III, Entry 20A) hence the Centre is empowered to make population control law." However, the government, for its part, pointed out as per census, 2001-2011 is the first decade in 100 years which has not only added less population as compared to previous ones but also registered a sharp decline in decadal growth rate from 21.54% in 1991 to 2001 to 17.64 % in 2001-2011. The government also listed out various schemes and programmes like observation of World Population Day, Mission Parivar Vikas, compensation scheme for sterilisation acceptors, home delivery of contraceptives, and 360-degree media campaigns to achieve the goal of population stabilisation and advancing the development targets of the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-against-involuntary-methods-for-population-control-supreme-court-told-926454.html

The internal inquiry is underway and strict action will be taken if any adverse role of any CBI official surfaces, the CBI spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday evening. The Madras High Court had on Friday directed the Tamil Nadu Crime Branch-CID police to probe the case of "missing" gold, which left the country's premier investigating agency red-faced. The "missing" gold is part of 400.47-kg bullion and ornaments confiscated by the CBI when it carried out searches at the office of Surana Corporation Ltd in Chennai in 2012 in a case pertaining to alleged favours extended by officials of Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India (MMTC) to the firm in import of gold and silver. When the vaults, kept in Surana premises, were opened between February 27 and February 29 in the presence of bank officials and official liquidator for Surana, the seized gold was 103 kg short with CBI seals still intact. Sources in the agency said when the matter came to the notice it was clear that seals were intact so the first move was to ascertain what could have happened. They said that in case such a thing happened from "malkhana" of the CBI immediate action could have been initiated but since the gold was in sealed vaults in the premises of Surana it was important to understand what could have happened before alleging theft. An inquiry under a Superintendent of Police-ranked officer was ordered in March but soon after the Covid-19-induced lockdown came into force, making it difficult to call people and record statements, they said. The officers involved in the seizure in 2012 had retired and it was difficult to track them during the lockdown, they said. In the meantime, Surana approached the high court following which a decision was taken to wait for its orders, they said. In statement issued late Saturday evening, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur clarified the position that the inventorised gold was not kept in "malkhana (case property room)" of the CBI. Rather, it was kept in the premises of Surana only under the seal. "As per the directions of the Hon'ble High Court the vaults were opened in the presence of official liquidator, officials belonging to six banks and independent witnesses and inspected from 27/02/2020 to 29/02/2020 to hand over the gold to the lender banks of Surana Corporation. The seals affixed on the vaults were found intact. However, gold weighed only 296.66 kg," the statement said. "As the discrepancy between the quantity mentioned in search memo and as per the weight came to notice, CBI promptly ordered an internal inquiry by a senior officer to look into the role of its officials, if any," it said. The spokesperson said while the inquiry was on, the petition was filed in the high court, which passed an order on December 11. The CBI's internal inquiry continues and if any adverse role of any CBI official surfaces, strict action will be taken against them, it said. The high court had noted, "Had any property been lost either from the malkhana (property room) of the court or from the malkhana of the CBI, what should have been done?” The answer to this question is obvious. A regular FIR for theft should have been registered in the jurisdictional police station and the police investigation under Chapter XII of Cr.P.C. should have been conducted." "At the end of the investigation, the Investigating Officer may come to the conclusion that the actual gold that was seized was only 296.606 kg, but it was mistakenly entered in the inventory as 400.47 kilogram. Strangely, this has not been done in this case till date. One can understand if the difference had been a few grams, but this Court is unable to fathom as to how there could be a discrepancy of more than 100 kilogram in the weight of gold. Gold will not diminish in weight like ganja by efflux of time," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/103-kg-of-gold-missing-from-cbi-custody-madras-high-court-orders-probe-926458.html

Speaking at the Annual Convention of FICCI, Modi said that small villages and towns would power India’s growth in the 21st century and his government was removing hurdles in development through various reforms. “The aim of all these reforms is to increase farmers' income and make farmers prosperous. If farmers of the country are prosperous, then the country would also prosper,” the prime minister said even as thousands of farmers protested against the farm sector reforms on the borders of the national capital. “We have seen barriers in the agriculture sector and allied areas such as agricultural infrastructure, cold chains, food processing, storage. Now, these barriers are being broken down,” Modi said, urging the private sector to channel greater investments in the farm sector. The prime minister said that after agricultural reforms, farmers of India can sell their produce both at the mandis, as well as outside. "Farmers can also sell their produce on digital platforms. We have been taking all these initiatives to increase the farmers' income and make them more prosperous", the prime minister said. “These reforms will give farmers new markets, advantages of technology, and help bring investments. It is my country's farmers who will benefit the most from all this," he said. The prime minister also asked industry leaders to increase spending in the agriculture sector and pointed out that the private sector had not spent that amount it should have ideally on agriculture. Modi said that the Indian economy was recovering at a swift pace and economic indicators were encouraging. The country and the world had gone through many ups and downs during the year, the Prime Minister said and added that the good thing was that things were recovering at a fast pace. “Things in December have changed a lot since Feb-March. The economic indicators today are encouraging,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-farm-laws-will-give-farmers-access-to-technology-says-pm-modi-926466.html

With less than 1000 pilgrims daily, online speeches and classes by dignitaries and no usual mass meetings and programmes, the 88th edition of the pilgrimage would be celebrated fully in adherence with the Covid protocols and guidelines. Mutt management sources here said preparations already began for the three-day pilgrimage. "This time, the pilgrimage will be in compliance with the strict Covid protocols. It will be held on December 30, 31 and January 1 as virtual pilgrimage," they said. To avoid heavy rush, only less than a thousand pilgrims would be allowed to enter Sivagiri daily, Mutt officials said in a meeting, chaired by additional district magistrate V R Vinod at the Collectorate, on Friday. The meeting, attended by Sree Narayana Dharma Sangam Trust general secretary Swamy Sandrananda and district police chief, B Ashokan among others, was held to take a stock of the preparations of the annual event. The Sivagiri Mutt is the headquarters of the Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham, an organisation established by the Guru to propagate his doctrine 'One Caste, One Religion, One God for Man'. Located over 50 kms from the Kerala capital, the Mutt used to attract thousands of pilgrims and VVIP guests annually during the time of the pilgrimage. "This time, there will be no mass meetings and programmes like in the past. Speeches and classes by dignitaries will be telecast online on Sivagiri TV from December 25," the Mutt officials said. As part of efforts to avoid overcrowding during the pilgrimage, no trade stalls would be allowed in and around Sivagiri. There would be no food distribution or accommodation facility for pilgrims as usual, the additional district magistrate said. Pilgrims should avoid coming as large groups and the Mutt authorities should give them strict instruction in this regard, he said. There won't be regular special bus or train services this time as part of reducing congestion, he said adding that facilities should be ensured for all pilgrims to meet Covid protocols. For this, sanitiser and thermal scanners should be made available and special arrangements should be made for pilgrims to wash hands at the Mutt and other parts of Sivagiri. The health department has been directed to provide necessary medicines and other facilities for pilgrims at Varkala Taluk hospital, officials added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/keralas-sivagiri-to-host-virtual-pilgramge-due-to-covid-19-926484.html

Banerjee, in the letter, has alleged that the summons seems to be with "political motive."  Kalyan Banerjee, the chief whip of the Trinamool Congress in Lok Sabha, alleged that the Centre was resorting to coercive means to intimidate the state administration, and the top officials were summoned at the instance of the Union Home Minister. "We want to inform you that law and order is within the domain of the state under 7th Schedule of the State list...How in respect of the law and order situation you can call both the officers for any sorts of discussion?" he asked. He said that in respect of law and order, the state government is accountable to the legislative assembly "but not to you or to your home minister". "It appears that with a political motive and at the instance of your minister, who is a political person belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party, you have issued the said letter. You are trying to coerce the officers of West Bengal with political vindictiveness. It appears you are interfering with the federal structure," Banerjee added. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Friday, a day after JP Nadda's convoy was attacked in West Bengal, had summoned West Bengal’s chief secretary and police chief on December 14 for an explanation on the law and order situation in the state. Banerjee also claimed that a person, who is a convict in a case and named in 59 other criminal cases, was in the convoy of Nadda on December 10 and "made provocative gestures" to the TMC supporters standing on the roadside. The MHA summon came following a report submitted by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar on the incident that took place in Kolkata's Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, on Thursday. Nadda's convoy was attacked with stones and sticks and Dhankar had alleged that violators had the protection of the state government. The chief secretary wrote to the Union home secretary, saying that he has been directed to request to "dispense with the presence of the state officials" in the meeting convened on December 14.  (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tmc-leader-dubs-mha-summons-over-naddas-convoy-attack-political-move-926486.html
12-12-2020||National||Explainer | Covid-19 vaccine: What is Emergency Use Authorisation?||Earlier this week, Indian regulators also reviewed proposals from pharma major Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII) for emergency use approval. India India does not have a term like the EUA as in the US or UK in its regulatory processes. But in the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, there are provisions for pharmaceutical companies to get approvals for clinical trials for new drugs or vaccines in India. Regulatory bodies in India can provide for an ‘accelerated approval process’ for certain drugs in special circumstances, like the Covid-19 pandemic. In this situation, the vaccine has to have a “meaningful therapeutic benefit”. The law also states that if a vaccine or a drug is needed to treat a fatal disease like the one caused by novel coronavirus, a new drug can be given the green light if it shows “remarkable efficiency” during its second phase of human trials conducted in the country. USA In the US, the FDA allows the use of unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved drugs in case of an emergency under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). To get the EUA, it needs to be established that there is a life-threatening disease in the country that poses a risk to the public and needs to be diagnosed, treated, or prevented, much like the coronavirus. It must be noted that a EUA is different from an FDA approval of a vaccine. To issue an EUA, the FDA has to study available data and evidence and gauge the potential risks and benefits of a vaccine candidate. It needs to ensure that the benefit-risk assessment is favourable before making the product available to the public. Now, for a particular company to get the EUA, it must submit its proposal to the FDA, which then determines if all criteria are met and studies the scientific evidence about the vaccine. Pharma companies also have to include dosage information and instructions in their proposal. The regulatory body also expects companies to continue clinical trials on drugs or vaccines that have received the EUA, to get additional data.

He also emphasised on the need for a "social contract" between the government, private sector, and the broad civic society that allows creation of harmony to navigate changes together. "Having grown up as a son of an Indian civil servant, I think quite a bit about the public sector and also the institutional strength of our public sector institutions is so important...how do we get the public sector to the efficient frontier of even technology use. "And, this is where I think some of the work that's happening in India, whether it is the ID system or the banking API or the payment API, so it's pretty enlightening," Nadella said during FICCI's annual general meeting (AGM). He added that there is a need to ensure that the public sector is being supported in their modernisation. Nadella said the public-private partnership is helping adopt changes and bring about more ubiquity to that change, which is going to be very important. "That's one way for developing economies to be able to recover from the pandemic. "But, more importantly, when we've talked about catch-up growth, I think in the next 10 years, catch-up growth is possible when both the public institutions and the private sector are able to move rapidly," he added. The India-born executive said technology has played a critical role during the pandemic across sectors, and has expanded from just driving future transformation to being at the core of business continuity. "The ability to use digital tools to be able to deal with a tail event, because we can't predict what the next tail event is but whatever that is, I think, our built-in infrastructure and capability around digital tech is going to create resilience and transformation," he added. That is the most exciting thing to see, Nadella said. He cited the example of telemedicine, which has been around but the adoption has accelerated amid the pandemic, and how even small retailers are turning to technology to drive business. Nadella highlighted the innovation in India around digital infrastructure across fields — from financial services to healthcare to retail — that are driven by factors like availability of computing, use of AI and data capabilities, and ubiquity of mobile phones. "I think the exponential adoption of these three layers is going to change... And, so, the question is what is that social contract we have between the government, the private sector and the citizens and the broad civic society," he added. That allows us to create that harmony to navigate this change together because if any one of us is changing and the others are being left behind, that's going to create more turmoil, he said. Nadella said an important factor would be how everybody is brought together to "navigate" these exponential curves. Talking about navigating through challenges, he said it is important to keep in mind the sense of purpose and mission of the organisation and the culture. "Once you have that, you have to get a lot of things right but your chances of getting all those other things right like strategies and tech picking and people picking, becomes so much easier with these two pillars," he added. He said leaders have three key attributes — an innate capability of coming into ambiguous, uncertain situations and creating clarity; creating energy not just within their teams but overall; and not waiting for the perfect pitch. "I can't say hey look, I'll perform after the pandemic is done. I mean, you and I and everyone in the room, have to keep working in spite of what the world throws at us. "And, that ability to solve sometimes the over constraint problem is what leadership is all about and driving success," he further said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/satya-nadella-reveals-why-public-sector-is-close-to-his-heart-926493.html

The government has taken various initiatives to improve the income of people engaged in the farm sector, he said, adding that farmers now have options to sell their crops in mandis as well as to outside parties. The government at any cost is committed to protect the interest of farmers through "its policies and intentions", he emphasised. Expressing dissatisfaction over the limited participation of India Inc in the agriculture sector, the Prime Minister asked industries to show there interest and increase investment in the sector.  Frankly speaking, he said, unfortunately, the India Inc "has not made adequate investments in agriculture and private players did not explore the sector to its full potential, rather they worked in limited fashion". Citing an example, he said, "the private sector's participation is not as per the desired level in cold storage and fertiliser manufacturing". Addressing the FICCI Annual Convention, the Prime Minister said tax terrorism and Inspector Raj are things of the past. India is now among the few nations which have implemented faceless assessment and faceless appeal with regard to tax matters, Modi said. Even the corporate tax in India is very competitive after the moderation affected last year, he added. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the new farm laws which they claim will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporate houses. The farming community has expressed apprehension that three new laws -- Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-committed-to-protect-interest-of-farmers-pm-modi-926495.html

Sharma was on a two-day visit to the state to inquire into "inaction" on 267 complaints, including two the women's rights panel has initiated on its own. "The worrisome situation in West Bengal is police don't reply, and no action has been taken on the complaints. Neither the director-general of police nor the chief secretary meets me, and this not the first time. They send their subordinates who are clueless about everything," she told PTI. "In the last eight months, there have been more than 260 complaints, and no report has been sent to us," Sharma added. She said that she will write to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and if the commission doesn't get any response on the complaints within the next 15 days, the matter will be forwarded to the home ministry. "We met governor during our visit this time. I am not saying the government can control things, but it can at least take action," she said. The commission has raised concern about the "rising problem of trafficking of women" from north Bengal and tribal areas of the state. West Bengal's Women and Child Development Minister Sashi Panja said women are safer in the state than any other part of the country. "The state government has taken all steps for the security of the women.

The wounded employees were shifted to a private hospital and are undergoing treatment. Two persons are reportedly in a serious condition. There is no confirmation of any death. The incident took place during the lunch hour and a shift change, which prevented a bigger catastrophe in terms of loss of life and injuries. The blast, said to be of a reactor, has ripped off the roof of the shed and collapsed the structure. Window panes of nearby buildings were shattered due to the impact. Thick smoke enveloped the unit for some time. Five fire-tenders rushed to the spot - Vindhya Organics, and brought the fire under control, preventing it from spreading to the neighboring factories. Furnaces, reactors etc in the adjacent units were shut and workers also evacuated as a precautionary measure. Local MLA Mahipal Reddy, who visited the site, has blamed the private company's management for the industrial accident. “The management is risking the workers' lives with their negligence. Inspector of factories, pollution control officials are not focussing attention to prevent such disasters,” the TRS MLA said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/eight-injured-in-explosion-fire-in-chemical-factory-near-hyderabad-926502.html

In a statement, the ministry said the drop has been possible due to recoveries exceeding daily new cases and the low number of fatalities per day. “India's trajectory of active cases continues to follow a steadily dipping path. The total active caseload has dropped below 3.6 lakh (3,59,819) today (Saturday),” the ministry said. "India's present active caseload consists of just 3.66 per cent of India's total positive cases. The new recoveries of 33,494 in the last 24 hours have led to a net decline of 3,930 in the total active cases,” it said. The rolling average for the last week shows the sustained decline in the daily cases for the six most affected states - Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, it said. “The daily new recoveries recorded in the country have been more than the daily cases registered since the last 15 days. The number of daily new cases in the last 24 hours is 30,006. While 33,494 cases recovered and discharged during the same duration,” the ministry said. It also said that there is a steady decline in the number of daily deaths over the last few days. For the last seven days, daily deaths have been below the 500-mark.

The announcement of the meeting was made by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). "The first trilateral working group meeting between India, Iran and Uzbekistan on joint use of Chabahar Port will be held virtually on December 14," the MEA said. The port is being developed by India, Iran and Afghanistan to boost trade ties among the three countries in the wake of Pakistan denying transit access to New Delhi. Located in the Sistan-Balochistan province on the energy-rich Iran's southern coast, the port can be easily accessed from India's western coast, bypassing Pakistan. It is considered to be a major transit point to connect with several Central Asian countries. The trilateral meeting is taking place in the backdrop of India pitching for participation of Uzbekistan in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) project. "India welcomes the interest of Uzbekistan to use the Chabahar port as a transit port. This would open up economic opportunities for the traders and business community of the region," the MEA said in a statement. "Besides Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries have also shown interest in using the port. India seeks to cooperate closely with regional countries on this issue," it said. Ways to speed up connectivity projects linking Central Asia was a major focus of a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. The International North South Transport Corridor is a 7,200-km-long multi-mode transport project for moving freight among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe. Monday's meeting would be jointly chaired at the deputy minister level by Uzbekistan and Iran while the Indian delegation would be headed by a secretary-level officer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-iran-uzbekistan-to-hold-talks-on-joint-use-chabahar-port-on-december-14-926513.html

The Court, while ruling that the action is "not maintainable and premature", clarified that proceedings may be initiated again if the authority concerned deemed the same is required after proper assessment. The prosecution case was that Karti, the Congress Member of Parliament, representing Sivaganga, and his wife Srinidhi received Rs 6.38 crore and Rs 1.35 crore in cash respectively, through sale of land owned by them near Muttukadu. However, they had neither disclosed the same in their assessment nor paid taxes for the income. Hence, the I-T department initiated criminal prosecution for alleged non-disclosure of income by them to the tune of Rs 7.73 crore for 2015-16 fiscal. Challenging the same, the duo contended that the prosecution is liable to be quashed for procedural lapse. They argued that the prosecution has been initiated for filing of false return, which amounts to offence of giving false evidence before a court under the Indian Penal Code. As per the Income Tax Act, the proceedings of the assessing officer are deemed to be that of a proceeding of a civil court and therefore, only the assessing officer should have initiated the prosecution. But in this case, a deputy director of investigation of the department has initiated the prosecution, they claimed. Granting liberty to the department to initiate penal action as per law, if it chooses to, Justice N Sathish Kumar said, the prosecution launched by the Deputy Director is not maintainable. The present complaint lodged by the prosecution is a premature one. If the assessing officer comes to the conclusion in proceedings under Section 153 of the Income Tax Act, it is open to the Department to initiate penal action as per law. Justice Sathish Kumar, who pronounced the order on Friday, observed that unless a finding is recorded by the assessing officer as to a willful attempt to evade tax or filing false verification, the complaint filed by the Deputy Director is not maintainable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/madras-high-court-quashes-income-tax-case-against-karti-chidambaram-926514.html

Of this, Rs 4,939.81 crore has been released as the first instalment. In a statement, the ministry said all states, except Tamil Nadu, have availed benefits of the newly announced scheme for 'Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure', which was announced on October 12 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package. "So far capital expenditure proposals of Rs 9,879.61 crore of 27 states have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. An amount of Rs 4,939.81 crore has already been released to the states as the first instalment under the scheme," it said. The ministry said the scheme is aimed at boosting capital expenditure by the state governments who are facing difficult financial environment this year due to the shortfall in tax revenue arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. "Capital Expenditure has a higher multiplier effect, enhancing the future productive capacity of the economy, and results in a higher rate of economy growth. Therefore, despite the adverse financial position of the Central Government, it was decided to extend a special assistance to the state governments in respect of capital expenditure, in financial year 2020-21," it added. The capital expenditure projects have been approved in diverse sectors like, health, rural development, water supply, irrigation, power, transport, education, urban development.

He was speaking at the 93rd Annual Convention of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). “You (FICCI) do the research and study on the (EV) parts we are making in India and what we are importing. We are importing EV parts—lithium-ion battery, magnets—from China…Whatever we are importing, need to find out the swadeshi alternative in the country, without compromising the quality and cost. That is the main mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat," Gadkari said. Apart from import substitution, there was a need to focus on rural, agriculture, and backward areas in the country, he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 3 lakh crore for MSMEs (Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises). The government will provide 15% of the equity to successful MSMEs and those with a good record of GST and income tax and bank turnover to facilitate them to go raise funds in the capital market. "The priority of the government is to increase turnover of the village industry to Rs 2 lakh crore in two years.

In an interactive session at the FICCI's annual general meeting, Jaishankar also said that what has happened in eastern Ladakh was not actually in China's interest as it has significantly impacted public sentiment in India. Calling the "events" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) very disturbing, the external affairs minister said that they have raised some very "basic concerns''. When asked whether it will be a long-haul or a breakthrough is expected soon, Jaishankar said: "I would not go into prediction zone at all whether it is going to be easy or not, and what will be the timelines and so on." "I also believe that what has happened is not actually in the interest of China. Because what it has done is -- it has significantly impacted public sentiment (in India). Professionally, I have seen the evolution of how the Indian public feels about China over the last many decades and I am old enough to remember much more difficult days, especially in my childhood and in my teens," he said. Jaishankar said that a lot of work had gone into developing the relationship on both sides. "I do not believe that the events of this year have helped at all. In fact, I think the real danger is that the goodwill which was so carefully developed will dissipate." "But I also would say that, yes, we are being tested. I have every confidence that we will rise to the occasion; we will meet that national security challenge. But beyond that, at this time, I would really frankly keep my own counsel," Jaishankar said. The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks.

This comes against the backdrop of an attack on the convoy of BJP President JP Nadda who was visiting Bengal last Thursday. The three officers -- Bholanath Pandey (SP, Diamond Harbour), Praveen Tripathi (DIG, Presidency Range) and Rajeev Mishra (ADG, South Bengal) -- were responsible for the security of Nadda during his December 9-10 visit. Sources said the decision to ask the three officers to serve in central deputation was taken under the rules governing All India Services officers. The West Bengal cadre IPS officers were called in view of the security breach that led to the attack on Nadda's convoy. In normal circumstances, the state government's consent is taken before any All India Service officer is called for deputation at the Centre but the Centre bypassed the Bengal administration as the row is escalating. With the West Bengal elections due in April-May next year, the political battle for supremacy between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the BJP is intensifying in the state and the latter is hoping to unseat the Mamata Banerjee-led party from power. In a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday, senior Trinamool Congress leader Kalyan Banerjee alleged that the "motive is very clear that by taking them (IPS officers), you want to create pressure upon the said three police officers". He also said in the letter that it is "shameful and dangerous that all laws have been thrown out in the river by your action at the instance of Amit Shah, the BJP leader and Home Minister of India. You are indirectly trying to impose emergency in the state of West Bengal. You are terrorising all IAS and IPS officers of our state." The move also comes close on the heels of the MHA summoning Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and Director General of Police Virendra next Monday to explain about the law and order in the state as well as the steps being taken to prevent political violence. The Chief Secretary, however, had already written to the Union Home Secretary urging him to “dispense with” the presence of state government officials at the scheduled meeting. Banerjee also referred to the summons issued to the Chief Secretary and DGP and claimed that Nadda, a Z-category protectee who was provided with a bulletproof vehicle, proceeded to Diamond Harbour without intimating and obtaining permission from the local police and allowed 50 motorcycles and 30 cars in his convoy. While asking whether a Z-category protectee is allowed to bring other vehicles in the convoy without permission, he accused Bhalla of being "politically vindictive" at the behest of Shah. "You (Bhalla) are trying to coerce the officers of West Bengal with political vindictiveness. It appears you are interfering with the federal structure embodied under the scheme of Indian Constitution," Banerjee added. Soon after the attack on Nadda's convoy on Thursday, the Centre had sought a report from the West Bengal government, which hadn't submitted one as of Friday evening. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar has submitted his report. तृणमूल शासन में बंगाल अत्याचार, अराजकता और अंधकार के युग में जा चुका है। टीएमसी के राज में पश्चिम बंगाल के अंदर जिस तरह से राजनीतिक हिंसा को संस्थागत कर चरम सीमा पर पहुँचाया गया है, वो लोकतांत्रिक मूल्यों में विश्वास रखने वाले सभी लोगों के लिए दु:खद भी है और चिंताजनक भी। Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had also spoken to the West Bengal chief secretary on Thursday after Bengal BJP Chief Dilip Ghosh shot off a letter to Shah complaining about the incident. Ghosh had alleged, "During his (Nadda's) different engagements in Kolkata, it was observed that there were serious lapses on security arrangements, purportedly due to negligence and/or casual approach of the state police department".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nadda-convoy-attack-mha-summons-3-west-bengal-ips-officers-to-serve-in-central-deputation-confrontation-escalates-926555.html

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta did not agree on a direction issued by Telangana High Court to Kamineni Academy of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Hyderabad to create an additional seat to grant admission to Mothukuru Sriyah Koumudi in MS (General Surgery) course in the academic year 2020-21. The court, however, directed the college to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the candidate, who "lost one precious year for no fault of hers" for having been "illegally" denied admission. It also found that the college adopted "unfair means" to allot the seat to some other candidate, who was not just below her in the merit list. It ordered one seat in the course from the management quota of the college for the next academic year (2021-22) shall be granted to her. "The manner in which the college acted in depriving admission to the candidate and giving admission to the other candidate is deplorable. The managements of the medical colleges are not expected to indulge in such illegalities in making admissions," it said. The court noted that as the last date for admissions for the present academic year was August 30, 2020, it was not inclined to grant admission to the candidate for this academic year. It also said cancelling the admission of the other candidate would also be of no help. To an appeal filed by the National Medical Council against the HC's direction to the college to create an additional seat, the bench said directions cannot be issued for increasing annual intake capacity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/annual-intake-of-medical-courses-cant-be-increased-supreme-court-926558.html

Addressing the annual meeting of Ficci virtually, the MSME and road transport minister highlighted the need to reduce imports and increase exports. He said this can help enhance economic growth and boost the contribution of domestic manufacturing to the GDP to up to 30 per cent. Citing the example of magnets used in electric vehicles, he asked industry experts to study which parts are being imported by India. "Now the magnet, there are a lot of things we are importing from China. I am not a businessman or a business expert but I am seeing a huge potential for electric cars, e-bikes, electric autorickshaws and even electric trucks," said the minister. He called upon business experts to deliberate with the domestic automotive industry, especially those engaged in manufacturing of electric vehicles, to find out what products are being imported, like magnets and lithium ion batteries. "We should find out swadeshi alternatives in the country without compromising with the quality and cost," he added. Highlighting the need for injecting liquidity into the market, he said: "I know that there are some problems. RBI has got Rs 9 lakh crore deposited by the banks, getting 2 per cent interest. That we are trying. The Prime Minister is telling them to use it for the people, finance it to the people". Gadkari said the government has sanctioned Flex engines which can function using 100 per cent ethanol or petrol. He called for developing cost effective and pollution free import substitutes, saying that the country presently has a Rs 8 lakh crore of crude oil import requirement. "We can develop an industry of Rs 2 lakh crore in rural areas by making bio fuel," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-calls-upon-industry-to-find-swadeshi-alternatives-to-imports-926565.html

The Opposition party's assertion came a day after Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said some "anti-social elements" are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers, and appealed to the protesting farming community to be vigilant against their platform being misused. Also, Food, Railway and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal was more direct in his charge, alleging that certain Leftist and Maoist elements seem to have taken "control" of the agitation and rather than discussing farmer issues, they seem to be having some other agenda. Tagging a media report on Goyal's remarks, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted, "Mr. Modi, autocracy has no place in democracy. Yours and your ministers' policy is to declare every opponent a Maoist and an anti-national."  "Apologise to the farmers who are on a sit-in braving the fierce cold and rains, and accede to their rightful demands immediately," he said in a tweet in Hindi. In another tweet, Surjewala attacked Modi for his remarks on Saturday at an event that the agri reforms will be beneficial for the farmers, saying farmers want pro-people governance not flowery speeches, and the people in the country want cheap ration. "The whole country is fed up of your enticing 'lollypops'," he said in a tweet in Hindi, attacking the prime minister. Farmers are protesting the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-accuses-modi-govt-of-branding-every-opponent-maoist-anti-national-asks-it-to-accept-farmers-demands-926568.html

Farmers' leaders said that the new farm laws pose a "greater threat" to the lives of protesters than Covid-19. Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's different border points for over two weeks, demanding a repeal of the three agriculture reform laws. Senior Medical Officer (Sonipat) Anvita Kaushik, who is also the in-charge of medical facilities at the Singhu border protest site, said despite her team's "best efforts", farmers are not willing to get tested for Covid-19. "Our district's medical vans and teams have been deployed at Singhu border. They (protesters) are getting medicines from us for cough, fever and other health problems, but are are unwilling to undergo Covid-19 test," Kaushik told PTI. The district medical officer said the ongoing protests by farmers, only a few of whom wear face masks, not only pose a threat to their lives but also to those of hundreds of workers of various factories located on the Delhi-Sonipat road. She said the administration has been distributing masks among the protesters so that they can protect themselves against coronavirus. However, Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta (Ugrahan) Punjab general secretary Sukhdev Singh said farmers don't want to "create a problem" by undergoing the Covid-19 test. He said farmers have come to Delhi to protest against the new farm laws and not for coronavirus testing. Asked why most farmers are not willing to undergo the Covid-19 test, Singh said, "If some farmers test positive, the government will have a reason to isolate them and that will only weaken our agitation against the new farm laws. "We have been protesting for over five months and coronavirus cannot stop us from raising our voices." Two DCP-rank officers of the Delhi Police overseeing security arrangements at Singhu border have tested positive for Covid-19. Both of them are in isolation. The farmers worry the new farm laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crops. The farmers have rejected a government offer to amend the farm laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the MSP system. They have also threatened to block railway tracks across the country and all highways leading to Delhi if the farm laws are not repealed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protesting-farmers-unwilling-to-undergo-covid-19-test-says-sonipat-medical-officer-926574.html

In absence of adult males, women have taken the charge of irrigating fields, sprinkling fertilizers in them, tending cattle, milking cows and chopping fodder for them with their children’s help, while keeping their spouses and adult sons assured all the while not to worry about the chores back home and focus on their protests. “With children’s help, we are taking care of wheat crop, cattle and other jobs,” said 44-year-old Paramjit Kaur, a resident of Jhita Kalan village in Amritsar district. Kaur's husband, Harjit Singh, is a farmer leader, currently engaged in farmers' stir at Delhi border. The couple’s two children, Manmeet Kaur and Yuvraj Singh having nothing to do with farming earlier, are now enthusiastically helping their mother in agricultural and allied activities. Both have cleared their IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exams and aspire to study abroad, Kaur told PTI over the phone. Yuvraj is now irrigating wheat fields and taking care of cattle. “I have sown wheat for the first time,” said Yuvraj who has cleared his 12th standard. Yuvraj's 20-year-old Manmeet Kaur who wishes to study in Canada, said, “We never did these jobs. We were involved in our studies. My job was limited to the kitchen but now we are doing agricultural work as well. I am taking care of vegetable fields and other errands now.” Jaspreet Kaur, 35, the wife of another farmer camping at Delhi border, said she was taking care of the cattle at her village Jethuke in Bathinda district. “I am now milking cows and buffaloes in absence of my husband,” said Kaur, whose family sell milk for their livelihood. She said that they have roped in some labourers for watering fields and sprinkling urea. “The problems are there but we have to face them,” said Kaur, a mother of three. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh said in several areas, villagers and labourers have come forward to irrigate fields of farmers pitching in at Delhi borders in protests of farm laws. Committees have also been formed in several villages where fellow villagers irrigate crops of those who are at the protest site. Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for two weeks now, demanding the repeal of three recent farm laws of the Centre. Farmers are protesting against the farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. They have rejected the government offer to amend the farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/as-farmers-pitch-in-at-delhi-borders-families-take-charge-of-farming-back-home-926576.html

Addressing a press conference at Singhu Border here, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu said that thousands of farmers will start their 'Delhi Chalo' march from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi Highway at 11 am on Sunday. He said that farmers from other parts of the country are also on their way to join the protesters here and they will take the agitation to the next level in the coming days. “If the government wants to hold talks, we are ready, but our main demand will remain the scrapping of the three laws. We will move onto our other demands only after that,” the farmer leader said. Farmer union leaders will also sit on a hunger strike between 8 am and 5 pm On December 14 against the new agriculture laws, he said. Pannu alleged the government tried to weaken the agitation, but that the protesting farmers did not let it happen. The farmer leader vowed to keep the protest peaceful. The government on Friday asked the protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some “antisocial” as well as “Leftist and Maoist” elements were conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation which has been going on for over two weeks now. Photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these “antisocial elements” are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/with-march-and-hunger-strike-farmers-to-intensify-protests-926593.html
12-12-2020||National||Cricket Betting Case: CBI 'witness' booked for cheating two banks of Rs 71 crore||In a twist of fate in the alleged corruption case against two officers of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and about eight others including several alleged cricket bookies, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked one of the accused in a separate case for duping banks to the tune of Rs 71 crore. The CBI raided places belonging to Paresh D Patel and his Ahmedabad-based firm Sayona Colors Pvt Ltd and Shamrock Chemie Pvt Ltd through which he is alleged to have cheated two banks-erstwhile State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore through manipulated books of accounts and diversion of funds. Incidentally, Patel is said to have voluntarily consented to turn prosecution witness for the CBI to testify against the ED officers who were booked while probing a pan-India cricket match-fixing racket and had arrested several big time bookies from various parts of the country back in 2015. Before volunteering to become a witness, Patel had recorded his statement under section 164 of CrPC in which he allegedly disclosed his and others' role in the corruption case. Patel "confessed" of having collected Rs 4 crore on behalf of one of the accused ED officers, Sanjay Kumar, who was then the investigating officer of the cricket betting case. The other officer who was charge-sheeted by the CBI is IRS officer Jitendra Pratap Singh who was then heading the ED office in Ahmedabad as its joint director. Both the officers and eight others were accused by the CBI of collecting Rs 8.75 crore as "protection money" from several bookies whose names appeared as suspects in the investigation. However, the investigating agency failed to recover any money from these two officers. The fresh case against Patel is alleged to have cheated the banks by fudging books of accounts and diversion of funds for loans taken back in 2014. Sources said that there may be more revelation of Patel's involvement in other financial irregularities in the coming days. Sources said that the CBI team, which probed ED officials, were in the know of alleged scams involving Patel but the central agency didn't heed. Back in 2015, the ED officials in Gujarat, led by its joint director J P Singh, had cracked down on cricket bookies located in various cities including Delhi, Mumbai, among other cities. They had claimed to have unearthed a money-laundering racket worth over Rs 5,000 crore. They had claimed that the network of this racket was spread in Dubai, Pakistan and England. At the peak of investigation, Singh and his deputy Sanjay Kumar were raided by their own department. They were shunted out and eventually CBI arrested them in 2017 along with eight others including Patel. All the accused are out on bail. Last year, Singh had filed a complaint with Central Vigilance Commission, Delhi alleging the then Director, ED, of accepting bribes of Rs 10 crore from bookies the former was probing for cricket betting. Singh also alleged CBI's investigating officer for taking bribes from cricket bookies.  Meanwhile, Patel's application for turning a witness was denied by the special CBI court. However, Gujarat High Court allowed his plea. The accused ED officers have moved Supreme Court which has stayed the trial till further hearing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cricket-betting-case-cbi-witness-booked-for-cheating-two-banks-of-rs-71-crore-926595.html

"Roshni Act has been struck down by High Court and (it) termed the act illegal and unconstitutional. It clearly defined why this act had been brought in...just to help a few big names whether in politics, business or bureaucracy, " Thakur, who is the BJP's election in-charge for Jammu and Kashmir, told reporters here. Thakur said he was glad that the court had taken an initiative and there has been a fair inquiry into it. "I am sure that 3.42 lakh kanal (17,000 hectares) of land will be returned to state of Jammu and Kashmir. There will be action against who were involved in the corrupt practice, " he added.

Addressing a press conference at Singhu Border here, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu said that thousands of farmers will start their 'Delhi Chalo' march from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi Highway at 11 am on Sunday. He said that farmers from other parts of the country are also on their way to join the protesters here and they will take the agitation to the next level in the coming days.   Escalating the confrontation between the Centre and the West Bengal government, the Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday unilaterally summoned three IPS officers of West Bengal to serve in the central deputation, prompting the Trinamool Congress to describe it as a move to "terrorise" IAS and IPS officers. This comes against the backdrop of an attack on the convoy of BJP President JP Nadda who was visiting Bengal last Thursday. The three officers -- Bholanath Pandey (SP, Diamond Harbour), Praveen Tripathi (DIG, Presidency Range) and Rajeev Mishra (ADG, South Bengal) -- were responsible for the security of Nadda during his December 9-10 visit. Sources said the decision to ask the three officers to serve in central deputation was taken under the rules governing All India Services officers. The West Bengal cadre IPS officers were called in view of the security breach that led to the attack on Nadda's convoy.   The Congress on Saturday accused the Modi government of branding every person opposing it a "Maoist" and an "anti-national", and urged the Centre to accede to the demands of the protesting farmers. The Opposition party's assertion came a day after Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said some "anti-social elements" are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers, and appealed to the protesting farming community to be vigilant against their platform being misused.   The strike called by the transport corporation workers has continued to cripple the bus services for the second day. The KSRTC and BMTC, which would have seen thousands of departures by 10 am, recorded less than 100 services. Lakhs of commuters continue to suffer as the strike entered the second day, throwing to wind all their plans.   An adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has condemned Morocco's normalisation of ties with the Islamic republic's arch foe Israel, calling it a "betrayal of Islam". The kingdom on Thursday became the fourth Arab state this year to normalise relations with Israel, in a deal announced by outgoing US President Donald Trump. In return, Washington fulfilled a decades-old goal of Rabat by recognising its sovereignty over disputed Western Sahara. "The deal between the triangle of America, Morocco and the Zionist regime was done in exchange for Morocco's betrayal of Islam (and) the Palestinian cause, selling Muslims' honour to international Zionism," foreign policy adviser Ali Akbar Velayati said on his official website Friday. He added that the normalisation of ties with Israel was "not a new thing" as the kingdom had maintained a liaison office in Israel in the past.   Source: DHNS / PTI/  AFP||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-farmer-leaders-ready-to-hold-talks-with-government-926633.html

There have been start-stop trade talks between Washington and New Delhi as both sides tried to resolve long-pending issues including on some sensitive sectors and greater market access.

Picking up instances of waving of placards demanding release of activists such as Varavara Rao, the Modi government alleged that the farmers’ protests have been hijacked by “naxalites and maoists”, prompting a sharp rebuttal from the farmer leaders. “We have no connection with those posters. Those are not associated with the 32 farmers’ organisations spearheading the agitation,” Kawalpreet Singh Pannu, President of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, told reporters at the Singhu Border, the epicentre of the agitation. Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said the government has confidence that they will not allow Maoist and Naxal forces to influence the people across the country. Pannu also announced plans to take the agitation pan-India, beginning with the blocking of the Delhi-Jaipur highway on Sunday and laying siege to district collector offices on Monday. “We request our sisters and mothers to become part of the protest. We are arranging for the seating, sleeping and hygiene facilities for women protesters. We appeal to the girls and women across India to join the protest,” Major Singh Punnawal, of the All India Kisan Sabha, said. The farmer leaders said they were ready for another round of talks with the government, but they would stick to their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws. Saturday was the 17th day of farmers' protest on different borders of the national capital. Thousands of farmers, who began their sit-in from Singhu border on Delhi-Chandigarh border on November 26, are braving the chilly winter under open skies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-govt-claims-farmers-protests-hijacked-by-naxalites-and-maoists-kisans-to-take-rally-pan-india-926651.html

Addressing the 93rd annual convention of industry body FICCI, he said that management of the immunisation programme and election process in the country gives the government confidence that even the vaccine initiative could also be successfully imparted to the target groups. “We have three applications today for the emergency use authorisation on sound principles. We have Pfizer, we have Bharat Biotech and we have Serum and they have not only met the deadline, they have overtaken the deadline,” Paul said. Terming the current period as an inflection point, he said that decisions regarding the vaccine would roll out in a matter of a few days. "Importantly, these decisions will be science-based, evidence based, rules based. Our regulator will make the right decision. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy will drive the decision," Paul noted. He further said, "We have absolutely no pressure on the regulator to do the decision one way or the other; I can say this with authority. We have insulated that system. We respect their decision making process." Paul said taking the right decision was important for the nation. "There is a reputation to be kept. Our vaccines go to half of the world. If we compromise today we will be hurting ourselves," he noted. He also said that DCGI was in touch with the UK regulator. "We are trying to work together irrespective of a particular vaccine which is common to both the nations,” Paul said. On starting the process of imparting the vaccine, he added that the process would have to be regulated so that the most needy get the dosage first. Paul said that conventional cold chains have been built up to store the vaccine and so has been the capacity of syringes and needles. "We have vaccinators being lined up, partly from the government system because we don't want to load the government system because if we depend totally on the government system their other priorities like primary health care, particularly immunisation will suffer, so therefore additional elements are being brought up," he added. Paul also informed that an IT platform for vaccination purposes has been built. “We have also built a strong IT platform which will be doing the logistics management..it will also give messages for appointments and inform which day a person needs to go for the vaccination. It is almost ready, testing is being done. We also believe that once ready we will also offer it to the world for any country which would like to adopt it,” he noted. He said preparations till block level was being done for effective imparting of the vaccine. “What gives us confidence is not only the experience of universal immunisation programmes where you have more than 9 million sessions each year and where 650 million dosages are given to children and women every year, but also we have the experience of conducting elections,” Paul said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/emergency-use-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccine-only-after-detailed-analysis-niti-aayog-member-v-k-paul-926653.html

Thirteen BJP, five Congress and three Independent candidates were elected as chief in 21 zilla parishads in Rajasthan on Thursday. The BJP and the Congress candidates were elected to 98 posts each of 222 panchayat samiti heads across 21 districts. "The BJP is projecting as if it's their clear victory in the panchayat election. But, it's not the reality. The voting percentage of the Congress was better than the BJP," Dotasra said at a press conference, adding that about 70 per cent of the elected sarpanches were from the Congress. He said the result was unsatisfactory as the state government was busy in Covid-19 management and the party's state executive was yet to be formed, among others. The Congress leader targeted BJP state president Satish Poonia for stating that the saffron party did not need any big face in assembly elections. "I want to tell him (Poonia) that Congress is strong and united in Rajasthan, and will win with full majority in all coming elections," Dotasra said. Reacting to it, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareekh said instead of giving excuses, the Congress should have had its defeat. Dotasra also hit out the Centre over the contentious farm laws, alleging that the Modi government wanted to take away the right of the states over agriculture, which is a state subject, by bringing legislations for "big capitalists".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-projection-of-rajasthan-panchayat-poll-results-not-reality-congress-926655.html

The farmers, who called themselves progressive, also handed over a memorandum to the minister supporting the farm sector reforms with the amendments suggested by the Centre. “We support the demand of the Kisan Unions for continuance of the MSP and APMC systems, but urge you to also continue with the reform measures after incorporating the amendments suggested by the government,” read the letter signed by the farmers led by Guni Prakash of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Mann) of Haryana. This is the second set of “progressive” farmers calling upon the government to continue with the farm sector reforms in a week, which is seen as an attempt to whip up support for the farm laws that has farmers, mainly from Punjab up in arms. Earlier, Padmashri awardee Kanwal Singh Chauhan, who gave up the traditional wheat and paddy crops and moved to lucrative produce such as baby corn and mushrooms, had met Tomar and declared his support for the farm laws.

The delegation, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union's (Mann) Haryana state leader Guni Prakash, submitted a "letter of support" to Tomar on the farm laws passed by Parliament in September and demanded the government to continue with these legislations. "We will also protest if the government repeals the laws. We have given a memorandum to all districts," Prakash told reporters after the meeting.  He also sought to know why the previous government did not implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission till 2014. "Everyone has a right to protest. They have, so do we. We are in support of the three laws, but this protest is being led by Leftists and those who are violent," he said. Claiming that the ongoing farmers' agitation is no longer a peasant movement, the BKU leader said, "It has taken a political colour. Farmers will get real freedom through these three laws." This was the second group of farmers from Haryana that met Tomar and extended support to the farm laws. The first group had met the minister on December 7. No breakthrough has been achieved during the six rounds of talks between the Centre and the agitating farmers so far, as the farmers have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the laws, despite the government sending them a draft proposal to amend specific issues without abolishing the legislations. The three laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and scrap the mandis (wholesale markets), leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained that the MSP and the mandi system would continue and would rather be improved and strengthened further.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-group-in-support-of-new-farm-laws-meet-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-threatens-to-protest-if-repealed-926659.html

Now there is a target of 450 GW by 2030,” the Prime Minister said through a video link at the UN Climate Ambition Summit that celebrated five years of the historic Paris accord. “India is not only on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets, but to exceed them beyond expectations. We have reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels.” The target is to reduce the emission intensity of the GDP by 33-35% by 2030. According to an assessment made by the Union Environment Ministry, India is the only G20 country whose nationally determined contributions (NDC) lead to less than two degrees Celsius rise in temperature – the central goal of the Paris treaty. None of the developed countries’ NDCs are Paris-compliant. “In 2047, India will celebrate 100 years as a modern, independent nation. Centennial India will not only meet its own targets, but will also exceed your expectations,” the Prime Minister said. A day before Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said India's historical contribution to climate change was only 3%. “India is not responsible for the problem of climate change. Still we will do our bit. Presently, we are contributing only 6.8% of global emissions and per capita emissions is only 1.9 tonnes. Thus, our historical as well present contribution to Green House Gas emissions is low.” "We are among the few countries who are Paris Agreement compliant, which means our actions lead to maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius which is to be achieved by 2100. India is the only G20 country complying with the Paris agreement," Javadekar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-not-only-on-track-to-achieve-its-paris-agreement-targets-but-to-exceed-them-prime-minister-narendra-modi-926661.html

12-12-2020||National||India will rise to security challenge posed by China: S Jaishankar||India will rise to the “national security challenge” posed by China’s aggressive moves along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday, even as he declined to predict when the seven-month-long military stand-off between the two nations would be resolved. He said the goodwill that was “carefully generated” for China in India could “dissipate”, as the neighbouring country deployed a large number of soldiers along the LAC, violating the bilateral agreements inked by the two nations since 1993. The minister’s remarks came a day after New Delhi asked Beijing to match its words with actions to restart the stalled process of withdrawing troops from the face-off points on the LAC—the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector. The war of words between New Delhi and Beijing over the military stand-off along the disputed boundary of the two nations again intensified as the talks between the diplomats and the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) apparently hit an impasse once again, after some signs of progress in September and October. “I do not believe that the events of this year have helped at all. In fact, I think the real danger is that the goodwill, which was so carefully developed will dissipate,” Jaishankar said while participating at an interactive session in the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “But, I also would say that, yes, we are being tested. I have every confidence that we will rise to the occasion; we will meet that national security challenge. But beyond that, at this time, I would really frankly keep my own counsel,” he said. He declined to predict if the stand-off between the Indian Army and Chinese PLA could be resolved anytime soon or could go long. “I would not go into prediction zone at all whether it is going to be easy or not, and what will be the timelines and so on,” he said, in response to a question.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-rise-to-security-challenge-posed-by-china-s-jaishankar-926663.html

Speaking at the 93rd annual convention of industry chamber FICCI, he said that in the current pandemic the vaccine has to be made available broadly, equitably as well as in a timely manner. Pune-based Serum Institute of India is conducting clinical trials of Oxford University-AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covishield in India. “We started working in April with Oxford University and currently we are hoping to get emergency use authorisation approved and that can potentially mean that we could have something which is available as early as the first half of 2021,” Singh said. In order to make the vaccine available in a time manner the entity has signed close to 3 billion dosages supply agreements across the world encompassing close to 160 countries, he noted. "On top of that due to the viral vector platform which is used to produce our vaccine, it can be manufactured on a relatively large scale and we are fortunate to partner with Serum which has one of the largest manufacturing capacities," Singh said. More importantly, this vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at comfortable refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 degrees) which is very comfortable to handle, meaning it can be administered very rapidly across the country, he added. “That's what we are hoping to do when we get approval from the authorities in India,” he added. Pfizer, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute have currently applied with the DCGI for emergency authorization of their vaccines in the country. Speaking at the event, Cadila Healthcare Chairman Pankaj R Patel said the phase two trial of the company's vaccine has begun and the results have been encouraging. He said that the vaccine is stable and may not require very cold temperatures. Patel also said that the company would like to complete phase three trials before applying for the emergency authorisation. He noted that the company's vaccine has been developed on a DNA platform so if the virus mutates, it should be able to come out with a new vaccine in a very short period of time. Bharat Biotech CMD Krishna Ella said that it has been crucial for the companies to protect the volunteers. He further said that the trials are completely transparent, and all data are enclosed. Ella noted that the company is conducting first kind of efficacy trial on its vaccine in the developing world. "We have long experience in vaccines. Covaxin can be given to a six-month baby as well to someone who is 65 years old. Safety profile of the vaccine will be extremely good and we have filed for an emergency authorisation and left it to the government to review all those things. We are giving whatever data they want. We have done everything according to international standards.” Earlier speaking at the same event, NITI Aayog Member VK Paul said there will be no pressure on the drug regulator on the Covid-19 vaccine approval and the final call on allowing its emergency use approval will be made on scientific principles. He also urged FICCI to work with the state governments to increase healthcare spending, enhance the human resources in healthcare by optimising the training in the private sector. He also asked the industry body to work towards building mental health capacities in the country and called for higher private sector participation in ramping up health infrastructure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/oxford-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-can-be-available-in-first-half-of-next-year-official-926676.html

The ministry said substantial improvement in maternal and child health indicators over NFHS-4 (2015-16) was recorded in the present survey. The fertility rate has further declined, contraceptive use has increased and unmet need has been reduced in most Phase I states, it said. The survey found considerable improvement in vaccination coverage among children aged 12-23 months across all states/UTs. Women's empowerment indicators, including women with bank account, also portray considerable progress, the Health Ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/infant-under-five-mortality-rates-dip-in-18-states-uts-survey-926679.html

His comments came a day after the Centre asked the protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some "anti-social" as well as "Leftist and Maoist" elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation. Tikait accused the government of trying to "malign" their protests against the new agriculture laws. "We do not know about the presence of anti-social elements in our agitation. The government is trying to distract the farmers. By saying all this, it is trying to malign our movement. And if it thinks there are any such elements in our protests, it should catch them. We have not stopped the government," he told PTI. On Human Rights Day on Thursday, photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border holding posters and demanding the release of several activists arrested under various charges had gone viral on social media, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these "anti-social elements" are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers. Earlier in the day, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu alleged at a press conference that the government tried to weaken their agitation, but the protesting farmers did not let that happen. "The government tried to weaken our agitation by dividing us (various farmer unions). I want to say that the ongoing agitation is fully under the control of 32 farmer unions. We will fail every government attempt to divide us," he said. Pannu said they are ready to hold talks with the government but will first discuss repealing the three new farm laws and announced that representatives of their unions would sit on a hunger strike during a nationwide protest on December 14. He also said thousands of farmers will start their "Delhi Chalo' march with their tractors from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi highway at 11 am on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/if-there-are-anti-social-elements-in-farmers-protests-govt-should-catch-them-bku-leader-926680.html

The meeting was scheduled on December 14 in Delhi. The development comes after the Union Home Ministry asked the state’s Chief Secretary and director general of police Virendra to come to Delhi to explain the law and order situation in the state. The Union Home Home Ministry’s decision came following West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s report over the attack on BJP president J P Nadda’s convoy at Diamond Harbour on Thursday. “I request you to kindly dispense with the presence of the State Officials in the meeting, considering that the State Government is addressing this issue with utmost seriousness,” stated Bandyopadhyay. The Chief Secretary wrote that “elaborate arrangements” were made, including providing a bulletproof vehicle and a pilot to Nadda. He said tagging of many vehicles with the convoy made the “situation unwieldy”. TMC MP Kalyan Bandopadyay said the Centre had no legal authority to summon the Chief Secretary and DGP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-west-bengal-on-collision-course-over-naddas-convoy-attack-926412.html

Rahul Gandhi slams Modi govt over farm laws||The Congress on Saturday cited a media report to claim that 11 farmers had died in the last 17 days while protesting against the new agriculture laws, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi asking how many more sacrifices will farmers have to make to get the legislations repealed. At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting on various borders of the national capital for over two weeks, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws. "How many more sacrifices will the farmers have to make to get the agri laws repealed?" Gandhi asked in a tweet in Hindi, tagging a media report which claimed that 11 protesting farmers had lost their lives in the last 17 days due to various reasons such as ill health or a mishap. Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that despite the "martyrdom of 11 farmer brothers in the last 17 days, the Modi government is not relenting". "They (government) are still standing with their 'money providers' not with 'annadaatas' (food providers)," he alleged in a tweet in Hindi. "The country wants to know -- 'Is Rajdharma (constitutional responsibility) bigger or Rajhat' (stubbornness)?" Surjewala asked, tagging the media report that Gandhi also cited. Farmers are protesting the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/how-many-sacrifices-must-farmers-make-rahul-gandhi-slams-modi-govt-over-farm-laws-926481.html

The Director-General of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) in New Delhi wrote to the field offices asking them to take assistance from state intelligence services, local police and other local agencies to protect railway assets. The letter also mentioned the threat of a rail blockade made by farmers' leaders, although no date for the same has been announced. ".... Leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha threatened to further intensify their agitation by blocking railway tracks nationwide on the lines of earlier such protests in Punjab. Meanwhile, protesting farmer unions continue to get solidarity support from non-farming organisations, Left pressure groups and the Opposition,” the letter says. The letter also noted that farmers' commitment to continue their protest till the government withdraws the three farm bills.

He joined the BJP at an event held at the party headquarters here. State party president Satish Poonia was also present at the event. "After a long time, I am getting a chance to speak from this platform. I thank the party leadership which considered my letter to join the party," Tiwari told reporters. He said he is completely committed to the BJP's ideology and though he had shared the stage with the Congress once, he never accepted its membership. He added that earlier, he was with the BJP with his heart and soul but formed a new party due to certain circumstances. Before resigning from the BJP in June 2018, Tiwari had been at loggerheads with the then chief minister Vasundhara Raje-led state dispensation over a number of issues including farmers' plight and corruption. Tiwari had floated Bharat Vahini Party ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly elections in 2018. He contested the election from Sanganer seat but lost. Earlier, Poonia said Tiwari returning to the BJP is not an exception. Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh, Babu Lal Marandi had also returned to the party, he said. Poonia also targeted the Congress over its defeat in the recently concluded panchayat elections in the state, saying despite people's mandate being against it, the ruling party is claiming its vote share increased this time. Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi are running the state government through social media while youths are waiting to get jobs, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rajasthan-ghanshyam-tiwari-returns-to-bjp-after-two-years-926517.html
12-12-2020||National Politics||What should be poll expenditure limit for candidates in LS, assembly polls: EC panel asks political parties||The Election Commission has sought views of recognised national and state parties on what should be the limit of expenditure for candidates contesting Lok Sabha and assembly polls. In a letter sent out on December 7, the commission asked parties to send their "views and suggestions" on as to what should be the ceiling limit of election expenditure for candidates for Lok Sabha and assembly elections in the future. The parties have been asked to send their views to the nodal officer of the committee that was set up in October to revise the expenditure limit. While there is a limit on candidates to spend on their election campaign, there is no such cap on political parties. The committee was tasked to examine the issue of revising the expenditure limit for candidates for Lok Sabha and assembly polls in view of the increase in a number of electors and the rise in the Cost Inflation Index.    The expenditure limit for candidates was last revised in 2014. For Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the limit was enhanced in 2018.  "In the last six years, the limit was not increased despite an increase in the electorate from 834 million to 910 million in 2019 to 921 million now. Further, the Cost Inflation Index during this period has increased from 220 to 280 in 2019 to 301 now," the commission had said in October while announcing the constitution of the panel. The committee will assess the change in number of electors across states and union territories and its bearing on expenditure. It has also been mandated to assess the change in the Cost Inflation Index and its bearing on the pattern of expenditure incurred by candidates in recent elections. The committee is likely to submit its report early next year to the poll panel. Considering the difficulties candidates could face in campaigning amid Covid-19, based on the recommendations of the EC, the government had in October enhanced the existing expenditure limit by 10 per cent. The 10 per cent hike was applicable in the Bihar assembly polls and various bypolls. The maximum limit for candidates differs from state to state. While it is more in larger states it is different for smaller states. After the Law Ministry notification of October, in bigger states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar and Haryana, the maximum expenditure a candidate can incur for campaigning in Lok Sabha polls is now Rs 77 lakh. So far it was Rs 70 lakh. For assembly polls, it has been hiked from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 30.8 lakh. For Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Telangana and Delhi, the expenditure limit for candidates for Lok Sabha polls is now Rs 77 lakh and for assembly elections, it is Rs 30.8 lakh. In Manipur,  Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura, the new limit is Rs 77 lakh for Lok Sabha elections and Rs 22 lakh for assembly polls. For Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Sikkim, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, Puducherry and Ladakh, it is Rs 59.4 lakh for Lok Sabha elections and Rs 22 lakh for assembly polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/what-should-be-poll-expenditure-limit-for-candidates-in-ls-assembly-polls-ec-panel-asks-political-parties-926549.html

This, he said, was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government. Goyal, however, did not say if the government had or is planning to take any action against any person belonging to banned outfits seen at the protests. "We now realise that the so-called farmer agitation hardly remains a farmers' agitation. It has almost got infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements, a flavour of which we saw over the last two days when there were extraneous demands to release people who have been put behind bars for anti-national (and) who have been put behind bars for illegal activities," Goyal, the Minister for Railways, Commerce and Industry and Food and Consumers Affairs, said at FICCI's annual meeting. The demands being raised on a farmers' platform to release so-called intellectuals and poets clearly demonstrate that the effort to derail farm law improvements is probably in the hands of certain elements who are not good for India, he said. "I would urge all well-meaning business leaders and all well-meaning intellectuals who are involved with Ficci, who are on this webcast, to talk about the benefits of these farm laws, to understand the law. Should you have any apprehension, please talk to us," Goyal said. The minister assured that these laws are for the benefit of nearly 100 million farmers across the country. He said this is a government that has been committed to farmer welfare, which has almost doubled procurement under minimum support price or MSP, which is "wrongly sought to be portrayed as being under danger". "This is a government that has ensured that farmers get 50 per cent over their cost of production. "This is a government that has increased the agricultural budget nearly six times, never before increased to today nearly USD 20 billion, Rs 1.34 lakh crore invested in the agricultural sector," said the minister. Goyal urged industry leaders to educate the farmers in their sphere of influence. He urged them to "explain the benefits, explain how these laws without...in any way touching the past systems, open up new opportunities to do trade and commerce and business for our farmers so that they can go in for more investment". Explain them how these reforms will spur investment in rural India, there will be R&D, more opportunities for value addition and, therefore, farmers can increase their income, Goyal urged industry leaders. Responding to Goyal's comments, Former Ficci president and Vice-Chairman of Bharti Enterprises Rajan Bharti Mittal said, "Clearly, you can see when you do the tough reforms like the farm bills, please don't step back. The industry will back you up." Besides, talking about reducing compliance burdens, Goyal said efforts were on to create the first genuine single-window system in terms of compliances, ease of approval process. "We intend to come up with a much easier process to meet with compliances, while simultaneously working across ministries to see if we can reduce the burden of compliances," he added. Speaking about the proposed Brand India initiative, the minister said it is an idea where the government and the industry will partner with each other and develop both on the Make in India side and overall Brand India side. "We are also looking at branding India. It is time now that India demonstrates to the world its leadership position and commitment of quality," said the minister. He observed that under the Brand India initiative, consumers both in India and internationally will be educated about products which are made in India. "We are pushing all industries to certify the Make in India products," Goyal added. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked tirelessly and inspired the nation with his vision, simplicity and courage to think beyond the past limitations and willingness to embrace change. The minister said the government will identify areas where the country has competitive and comparative advantages, where we can become global players and contribute to global trade in a bigger way. Observing that the tyre and rubber industry can become a great business leader in the years to come, he said the Centre will encourage rubber plantation through the support of private investment and give adequate support to the tyre industry so that it can grow and flourish. "We have identified another 24 sectors on which work is going on by industry leaders who are working together to come up with actionable agenda to add nearly 200 lakh crores worth of manufacturing in India in the next 10 years," Goyal said. Describing start-ups as the backbone of the New India, Goyal said start-ups and their ecosystem are encouraging innovation and promoting young entrepreneurs. He urged the industry to support start-ups by providing them financial support, hand-holding, opportunities and mentorship. Referring to Aatmanirbhar Bharat, he emphasised that "we are not at all suggesting that we are anti-imports", and that it is about India improving its quality and scale of production.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farmers-movement-infiltrated-by-leftist-maoist-elements-piyush-goyal-926556.html

Pawar, a former Congressman who rebelled against the party leadership and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 1999, is celebrating his 80th birthday. "Pawar's capabilities and merit became a roadblock in his political journey," Raut said, speaking to reporters in Nashik. He was asked for a reaction to NCP leader Praful Patel's claim that Pawar was cut out for the prime minister's post, but the "Durbar (court) culture" in Delhi undermined him. "Less meritorious people feared him and ensured he did not rise to the top," Raut said. If there had been elections in the Congress then, 80 per cent of votes would have gone to Pawar, he claimed. "Pawar should have got the opportunity to become prime minister long back. Today he is 80. But he is someone for whom age is no barrier," the Sena leader said. The NCP is sharing power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra as part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). Asked about the Congress' future, Raut said political parties cannot be wiped out, and noted that the BJP at one time had only two MPs. On speculation that Pawar may take over as UPA chairman -- Pawar has denied this -- Raut said if a leader from Maharashtra became the head of the Congress-led alliance, "we would be happy". Raut also said that MVA leaders favoured contesting elections to municipal corporations and other civic bodies together, as their solidarity paid dividends in the recently held Legislative Council elections in Maharashtra. On farmer protests against the new agriculture laws on Delhi's borders, Raut said if the Union government were to "move two steps backwards", it would not affect its prestige. "Bring the laws back to the discussion table in Parliament. Understand why the farmers are asking that the laws be repealed," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/inferior-leaders-stopped-sharad-pawar-from-rising-to-top-sanjay-raut-926567.html

Speaking on the occasion of his birthday, his close aide Praful Patel accused Congress’ coterie of preventing the veteran and experienced politician from becoming the Prime Minister and also from taking over the reins of the grand old party. “What I said was what we saw when we were with the Congress,” said NCP General Secretary and former Civil Aviation Minister Patel. "What I said was what had happened within the Congress...it is not an outsider's perspective," he added. Patel’s comments came when his attention was drawn to an article penned by him that appeared as an advertorial in different newspapers in English, Hindi, Marathi and Gujrati. Patel also referred to this issue in his address at the felicitation function of Pawar on Saturday. “We have always wanted to occupy that (PM’s) position…but that could not happen…why?...we have 48 seats, if people of Maharashtra wants Pawar saheb can be there…we have to ensure that the dream is realised,” he said. The development comes barely two days after reports emanated from the national capital of New Delhi that Pawar could be made the UPA Chairperson in a bid to consolidate the opposition against the BJP-led NDA. In the article, Patel referred to two chains of events of 1991 and 1996 when his mentor missed the opportunity to get into the top job. Referring to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the 1991 polls, he said: “…The election results were out and the Congress was very close to a majority. There was a big group in the party that believed that the Prime Ministerial candidate should be a young, dynamic person like Pawar who also had a good grip of the administration. Even Congress party leadership in various states were of the same opinion. However, the scheming coterie of the Congress again united and used or rather misused  Sonia Gandhi’s name to anoint PV Narsimha Rao as the Prime Minister and Pawar saheb was entrusted with the important responsibility as Defence Minister…” On the 1996 episode, he said: “In the 1996 Lok Sabha polls, 145 MPs of Congress won the elections.  HD Deve Gowda, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Left leaders agreed to a single point agenda that ‘Sharad Pawar should take lead and ask Rao to step aside. If this happens, we are willing to support a Congress government led by a Congress party’. However, Narsimha Rao didn’t flinch at all and Congress was forced to support the Deve Gowda government from outside. I can talk about these developments with conviction as most of them were happening from my house.” He also touched upon the inter-party elections. “In the elections, I, Bhupinder Hudda, PC Chacko, Girija Vyas and others came together and defeated the panel that was supported by Narsimha Rao. He resigned from the Presidency of Congress party. However, he forwarded the name of Sitaram Kesari to ensure that Pawar was not selected for the President’s post. Sitaram Kesari became the President of the Congress party.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-coterie-prevented-sharad-pawar-from-becoming-pm-and-party-chief-claims-praful-patel-926579.html
12-12-2020||National Politics||Article 370 allowed rampant corruption in Jammu and Kashmir: Minister Jitendra Singh||Union minister Jitendra Singh Saturday said the now-scrapped Article 370 had paved the way for rampant corruption in Jammu and Kashmir as successive state governments used it to make their own anti-graft laws, customised allegedly for convenience. He said the setting up of the District Development Councils (DDC) will bring further accountability, transparency and outcome-oriented approach in the working of the administration in Jammu and Kashmir. "The Article 370 had paved the way for rampant corruption in Jammu and Kashmir because it gave the successive governments in the state the right to enact their own anti-graft laws which were inadequate and tailor-made for convenience," he told an election rally in support of BJP candidates in the DDC polls. At the same time, Article 370 also gave the state rulers the prerogative not to allow the Centre's Prevention of Corruption Act to be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir like the rest of the country, he said. Singh, the Union Minister for the Prime Minister's Office, said the Prevention of Corruption Act was implemented in Jammu and Kashmir only after the abrogation of Article 370 and the state having turned into a Union Territory. The Article 370 was abrogated on August 5, 2019, and subsequently, the erstwhile state was divided into two UTs -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Singh, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, said there was no effective curb on corruption in the past because the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir had its own anti-corruption law and probes into corruption cases carried on indefinitely, allowing the officials concerned to get superannuated, or making too late to bring them to book. "As a result, corruption in Jammu and Kashmir, both in lower as well as in higher offices, became a norm rather than an exception and the common impression was that anybody who was smart enough to get away with it, could also manage to go scot-free," he said. With the implementation of the Prevention of Corruption Act in Jammu and Kashmir now, the minister said, now there are timelines fixed to dispose corruption cases and at the same time, not only the bribe-taker but also the bribe-giver is held guilty. Singh said that in the last one year, there is a visible change in governance and the good governance practices followed by the Centre are also being gradually implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, one after the other. "This has also led to a conspicuous change in the work culture in the government setup which was grossly lacking in the past," he said. The minister said the setting up of DDCs will bring further accountability, transparency and outcome-oriented approach in the working of the government. "When the District Councillors and the District Council Chairman work in coordination with the District Deputy Commissioner and his administration, they will not only supplement each other's efforts and initiatives, but also exercise the necessary checks and balances," he said. Singh said DDCs will herald a new era of democratisation with accountability in the administration and, therefore, it is everyone's responsibility to make this initiative successful.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/article-370-allowed-rampant-corruption-in-jammu-and-kashmir-minister-jitendra-singh-926628.html

Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various areas on Delhi’s borders for the last 16 days and demanding that the laws be withdrawn. The police have made adequate arrangements and these include multi-layered barricading and deployment of personnel. Measures have also been taken to ensure commuters do not face inconvenience at places were protest are being staged, a senior police officer said. The Delhi Traffic Police has deployed its personnel across important border points to ensure commuters do not face difficulties and is constantly updating people about open and closed routes on its Twitter handle. The developments come after farmer leaders on Wednesday rejected a government proposal to amend the new agri laws and announced they would intensify their agitation by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Yamuna expressway by Saturday. In a tweet, the traffic police on Saturday informed commuters about the closure of the Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari and Mangesh borders. Since these borders are closed, it suggested that motorists take alternative routes via Lampur, Safiabad,Saboli and Singhu School toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK Road. So, commuters have been advised to avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road and National Highway-44, the traffic police said. Due to the ongoing farmers' protests, it said that both the Chilla and the Ghazipur borders are also closed for traffic from Noida and Ghaziabad. "The Chilla & Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi due to farmers protests.People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara & bhopra borders," it tweeted. The Tikri and the Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement but the Jhatikara border is open only for two wheelers and pedestrian movement, the traffic police said in a tweet. Those going towards Haryana, can take Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders as they are open, the traffic police said. The government had asked farmer groups to consider its proposals for amending the laws to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want. Farmers leaders on Thursday also announced they would block railway tracks across the country if their demands were not met by the government and would announce a date for that soon. At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting on various borders of the national capital for over two weeks, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was cancelled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-to-intensify-protests-security-at-delhi-borders-tightened-926457.html

They also distributed packets of rice and lentils to commuters, urging them to support the farmers' demand. According to Noida Traffic Police officials, one carriageway of the Noida-Delhi Link Road at the Chilla border where a group of farmers is camping since December 1 is closed for movement while the other side (Delhi to Noida) is open. "Commuters can take the DND or the Kalindi Kunj routes to travel to and fro Delhi," an official said. Protestors under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) stayed put at the Chilla border, while those of BKU (Lok Shakti) continued to camp at the Dalit Prerna Sthal. Carpets spread on the road for the sit-in got wet in the morning rain and the temperature also dropped a few notches, but the demonstration continued amid heavy deployment of police and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel at the protest sites. In the afternoon, over 150 protesters marched to Kailash Hospital in Noida which is owned by BJP leader and Gautam Buddh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma. According to a local police official, no untoward incident was reported during the incident. The protesting farmers lit bonfires at the Chilla border to keep themselves warm, but said they won't call off their stir until their demands are met by the Centre. The protestors gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/around-150-protesting-farmers-march-to-bjp-mp-mahesh-sharmas-hospital-in-noida-926589.html

After meeting Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar here, Chautala said the crop procurement at the government-decided MSP (minimum support price) would be ensured for each farmer till the time he was part of the state government. Chautala, who also met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Food, Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal earlier in the day, also said the Haryana government is stable as of now and his party has a strong position on the MSP issue. Chautala, who has been facing pressure from the opposition and some Haryana farmers to withdraw from the BJP-led government in the state, had earlier said he will resign if the MSP system is threatened.   Asked whether the alliance government in Haryana was stable, Chautala said on Saturday, "Yes. ..Till we ensure MSP, we will be stable."   "I am hopeful that in the next 24-40 hours, there will be another round of talks and some conclusive statement can come out of that," the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader said. Farmer unions, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system under which government agencies buy their crop at an assured price. In its proposal to farmers on Wednesday, the Centre had said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation. "We all need to sit and finalise...  I am hopeful the way the Centre is engaging with protesting farmers and has given a 24-page reply to the demands of the farmers union, the situation at borders will normalise with a mutual agreement and there would be a conclusion to this issue with mutual consent," he said. "The solution will be found only through dialogue. Umeed pe duniya kayam hai (Live revolves around hope)," he said. Chautala said he is hopeful that the next round of talks will be held early and some positive outcome will follow from both the sides. When asked when the government will give statutory recognition to MSP for this written assurance, the deputy chief minister said, "Whatever they demand." On opposition parties in Haryana threatening to move a no-confidence motion, Chautala said it is the Congress party which is making such statements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hopeful-about-next-round-of-talks-between-centre-protesting-farmers-soon-dushyant-chautala-926590.html

According to the police sources here the woman had married the youth, identified as Arjun Jatav, a resident of UP's Pratapgarh district, after a brief affair against the wishes of her family a few months back. The woman and Arjun lived in Delhi and were neighbours.  Furious over their marriage, the woman's two brothers hatched a conspiracy to kill her and as per the plan they started visiting her home to give an impression that they had accepted their relations, sources said. The brothers, identified as Sudheer Kashyap and Sunil Kashyap, asked their sister to visit their native village in Mainpuri to meet other family members. Apparently not suspecting any foul play, the woman accompanied them to the village last month. A few days later she disappeared mysteriously. Her husband tried to communicate with her without success. He was told that his wife had returned to Delhi without informing them.  Suspecting foul play, Arjun lodged a report with the police, which interrogated the two brothers. They revealed that they had killed their sister and buried her body in the fields near the village. On Friday a police team got the place dug up and recovered the remains of the body of the woman, sources said. A case was registered and the two brothers and their mother were arrested on charges of murder, police said. Earlier also several women had been killed in different parts in UP by their family members for marrying outside their caste for the sake of family honour.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/woman-allegedly-killed-by-brothers-for-marrying-dalit-926597.html

Khan was detained under the stringent law after he was granted bail by Aligarh court on February 10 in connection with his alleged inflammatory speech during anti CAA-NPR-NRC protest. In its plea, the Yogi Adityanath government contended the speech delivered by Khan on December 13, 2019 in AMU campus had provoked students to march towards the city, which might have created a law and order problem and disturb the communal harmony. Justifying his detention, the state government claimed Khan had a history of committing various offences, resulting into disciplinary action and suspension from service, lodging of FIRs and imposition of the NSA. Khan was a lecturer at department of Paediatrics at B R D Medical College in Gorakhpur, where over 60 children had died within a week in August, 2017 due to Japanese encephalitis and many reportedly for want of oxygen whose supply was disrupted after bills were not paid to the vendor.

Farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu, at a press conference at the Singhu border of Delhi, has said thousands of farmers will start their 'Delhi Chalo' march from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi Highway at 11 am on Sunday. He said that farmers from other parts of the country were also on their way to join the protesters at the Delhi border and they will take the agitation to the next level in the coming days. In a tweet, the Rajasthan chief minister said, "I am happy that till now the farmer movement has been very peaceful. Violence has no place in a democracy. Even on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, farmers should put their demands democratically in front of the centre and maintain peace." "The Central government should accept the demands of the farmers without further delay," he wrote on the microblogging site. The Centre on Friday asked the protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some "anti-social" as well as "Leftist and Maoist" elements were conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation which has been going on for over two weeks now. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/central-govt-should-accept-demands-of-farmers-without-further-delay-ashok-gehlot-926640.html

Nine newborns, all of them between one and four days old, died at the J K Lon Hospital on Thursday, within a span of hours, a year after the same facility had hit national headlines over the deaths of an unusual number of infants. On Friday, three more newborns -- two born just a day ago and another a month old -- died at the hospital, its Superintendent Suresh Chand Dulara had said. The BJP panel demanded resignation of the state's Health Minister Raghu Sharma, alleging that even after the deaths of 110 infants in December last year, the J K Lon hospital is still in the same "pitiful condition". The committee comprises Daussa MP Jaskaur Meena, Deputy Leader of Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly Rajendra Singh Rathore and party MLAs Madan Dilawar and Sandeep Sharma. Rathore alleged that hospital authorities have told the panel that 13 infants died on December 10 and five others on December 11, taking the toll to 18 in two days. "The state government is responsible for the deaths and the health minister should immediately resign from his seat," he said. The BJP panel also pointed out that recommendations given by the committees formed last year to improve the condition of the hospital have not yet been taken into consideration. It claimed that 100 ventilators provided by the central government last year have not been put into use. The Rajasthan government's three member probe panel, led by Health and Education Commissioner Shivangi Swarnkar, visited the hospital on Friday night. During her visit, Swarnkar reprimanded hospital officials over the unhygienic condition of the medical facility. On Saturday, Rajasthan State Child Rights Protection Commission chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal also paid a visit to the hospital and expressed anguish over the poor condition of the facility. "A factual report on equipment and apparatus functional in the hospital would be sought as the officials of the hospital could not give a satisfactory reply on it," she told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/kota-infant-deaths-bjp-panel-expresses-anguish-over-lack-of-medical-staff-facilities-at-hospital-926671.html

The farmers have been peacefully protesting since September and have followed the highest ideals of democratic dissent,” Bajwa said. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show magnanimity and withdraw the three farm laws to de-escalate the rising tensions between the agitating farmers and the Centre. On Thursday, a group of agitating farmers had displayed posters of activists Umar Khalid, Sudha Bhardwaj, Varavara Rao, demanding their release from custody, prompting Union ministers to claim that the protests against the farm laws were being hijacked by Maoists. “Such language should have no place in our democracy. It is my hope that those attempting to malign lakhs of Punjabis and farmers would cease to do so and instead focus on creating a truly deliberative process to reform the agricultural sector in India,” Bajwa said. The senior Congress leader urged the government to go back to the beginning of the process and build a broad consensus across the nation for a long-lasting reform of agriculture in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dont-cast-aspersions-on-farmers-repeal-farm-laws-bajwa-926672.html

The site is located in Amarpur block of Banka district, about 300 kms from here, and it came to light after some antique objects were found by local villagers while they were performing rituals in the Chandan river as part of the Chhath festivities. "When I heard about the discovery of the site, I had a gut feeling that it might be of the Buddha's period. I was delighted when experts, who visited and studied the site, said it was about 2,600 years old, dating back to the period of the Enlightened One," Kumar, known for his keen interest in archaeology as well as Buddhism, told reporters. The chief minister, who was accompanied by a number of officials besides minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, had a look at the items put on display upon excavations so far, and also trudged through a steep, sandy landscape to inspect the river bed. "Chaudhary, who holds the water resources portfolio, is with me. We shall be exploring the option of diverting the river a bit, preferably along its original course nearby. This would make excavation easier," Kumar said. "I feel once the excavation is complete, the site will emerge as a place of interest for not just people of the state or the country, but the entire world. So many places of antiquity are located in Bihar, which have suffered neglect," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bihar-cm-nitish-visits-new-archaeological-site-under-river-bed-926692.html
12-12-2020||Opinion||Modi needs one more farm law to end crisis||By Andy Mukherjee Farmers’ protests are threatening to snowball into the biggest political crisis of Narendra Modi’s tenure.  To give in to demands and scrap the laws would be an uncharacteristic admission of defeat for India’s strongman prime minister, who promised they would transform agriculture. But letting the unrest linger could cause chaos in food markets, alienate urban consumers, and potentially derail the post-Covid-19 recovery.  Nobody doubts that for India to have a shot at exiting its lower-middle-income trap, farming must come out of its sub-3% growth rut. Productivity of labour, land, fertilizer and water have to improve. Massive private investments need to take place in storage and processing for the country’s 2% share of global agricultural exports to increase. The dispute is over which strategy to pursue. Markets or organisations? That’s an old dilemma, made famous by economist Ronald Coase in 1937. Modi is leaning toward markets, promising to turn the entire country into a free trade area benefiting 119 million farmers and 144 million farmhands, plus their families. A large and growing number view this move as an end to institutional state support, which they fear will allow profiteering corporations to rush into the resulting vacuum. Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping near entry points to New Delhi since November 26. They plan to block at least two highways Saturday. A compromise solution would require consultation — something woefully lacking when Modi’s government rammed the bills through a dubious voice vote in parliament in September. Even those who defend the reforms agree that both their intent and purported benefits should have been explained better. But it’s too late for public relations. A more tangible concession will have to be made: An additional law, perhaps.  To see what that might be, consider first what’s making farmers restive. A small section of India’s agriculture — most notably in Punjab — relies excessively on selling rice and wheat to the government at so-called minimum support prices. The purchase takes place in markets, known as “mandis.” One of Modi’s bills gave farmers the freedom to sell their produce outside the designated yards — and without having to pay taxes and fees to one of India’s 29 state governments. For grain cultivators, the worry that cropped up was, “If the mandi falls into disuse, will the government stop buying from us at guaranteed prices?” The fear isn’t entirely irrational. The Food Corporation of India’s granaries are overflowing. The excess stock costs the taxpayer $25 billion, money that could have other uses in the post-Covid economy. Farmers know this. One of their demands is for legal backing for minimum support prices, something that could have ugly consequences for public finances. Authorities currently announce prices for 23 commodities, but these are largely meaningless except for wheat, rice and cotton in a few states.  Punjab is the dominant beneficiary. Each of its 1 million farming households gets $1,600 a year in subsidized fertilizer and free electricity to pump groundwater, according to Ashok Gulati, a professor of agriculture at New Delhi-based think tank ICRIER. They get these privileges, plus the minimum assured price, in exchange for fulfilling a half-century-old promise of not letting the country starve. Changing this social contract is necessary. A water-guzzling rice crop isn’t suitable for Punjab. Overuse of groundwater is depleting aquifers, and the burning of paddy stubble is causing hazardous pollution in northern India. But farmers need downside protection before they can be made to believe that markets will bring them prosperity. One way may be to introduce an additional law guaranteeing a basic farm income, benchmarked to every state’s agricultural value added. Even a $500 per hectare commitment, when implemented over 190 million hectares of gross planted area, works out to $95 billion annually, or 3.5% of pre-Covid GDP. It’s true that fragmented landholdings will greatly vary the amount households receive, but in India’s hinterlands, a $1,000 payout for two hectares won’t be negligible. It could become a starting point to gradually dismantle the market-distorting support prices. That’s when the handout will pay for itself. The challenge will be to make it reach tenant farmers. That’s been a problem even for the $80-a-year income subsidy for small farmers Modi announced before the 2019 general election.  The other tweaks will involve correcting design flaws. Denying farmers the right to take disputes with private buyers to civil courts is problematic. Modi’s contract farming law won’t take off if small landholders fear they’ll be exploited. Relaxing strict rules on hoarding, the final part of the reform package, may benefit farmers’ organizations with sufficient warehousing capacity. But the big winners will be trading companies, says Indian Institute of Management Professor Sukhpal Singh. This power imbalance, too, needs a relook. Market supremacy won’t reform India’s agriculture, but a combination of markets and institutions might. Politicians have to strike fresh bargains that will make farmers lose interest in old arrangements. Modi’s presidential style of working has botched things up. But there’s still a way to turn this crisis into an opportunity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/modi-needs-one-more-farm-law-to-end-crisis-926433.html
12-12-2020||Opinion||Making democracy work with ‘active citizenship’||‘Dance of democracy’ and ‘festival of democracy’ are some of the catchphrases used for elections in India which are characterised by noisy sloganeering and a festive atmosphere. However, this enthusiasm seems to be restricted to the Parliamentary elections and to a lesser extent to the state Assembly elections. In the last few weeks, Hyderabad saw a high decibel campaign leading up to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections. The campaign was punctuated with mammoth rallies (amidst a pandemic) by several celebrity campaigners, making, among other promises, bizarre statements of ‘rooting out Nizam culture’ and changing the name of Hyderabad to ‘Bhagyanagar’. Notwithstanding the fact that this was not a positive campaign, could it have inadvertently put the spotlight on, what should perhaps be, the more important election for the common citizenry? Electoral participation, citizen protests and claim-making are the bedrock on which modern democracies stand. How do we fare on these three aspects at the local governance level? Can we introduce a fourth element, ‘active citizenship’, to ensure the State performs its contractual obligations towards its citizens? On the electoral participation front, the elections to the urban local bodies (ULBs) are boisterous on the ground, with reports of cash-for-votes and violence, too. But in terms of coverage and awareness, these miss-if-you-blink events are relegated to the fringes of national newspapers or covered mostly by regional publications. Despite the high-pitched campaign, the voter turnout at the recently concluded GHMC elections stood at about 46 per cent while the general elections of 2019 saw the highest ever turnout at 67 per cent. Consistent awareness campaigns over the years have helped improve voter turnout at this level, but we still have some distance to go. Citizen protests are a regular feature of all vibrant democracies. While there are protests on various issues ever so often, the ones that get greater traction in the press are the ones that are dominated by the elite. For instance, the steel flyover or lake encroachment agitations. But suffice to say that political mobilisation is an area which has seen reasonable success.  In a modern democracy, the State is entrusted with a monopoly over violence and tax collection in return for providing some services. While we participate in electoral democracy, our first point of contact in claim-making is through local governments. It is on this parameter that we fare the worst.  The Nobel laureate, Albert Hirschman once said when citizens find government services deteriorating, they ‘voice’ or ‘exit’ the system. This exit happens mostly when income increases and citizens can opt for private solutions. The journalist Shankar Aiyar in his book aptly named, The Gated Republic, describes in detail this phenomenon of gated communities as well as other citizens who are opting for private solutions instead of relying on the State.  Water, electricity, security, education and healthcare – areas, where the state should play a significant role, have been taken over by private solutions leaving citizens angry or apathetic. This is not to suggest that private solutions have no place in solving public problems. But ceding space to private solutions where there is a need for government interventions arising out of market failures will lead to greater inequalities which will manifest in other kinds of societal failures. Have you noticed that the lake management in Bangalore has significant citizen participation? Could this be because there are no private solutions to the lake issue and we will participate only when there are no private solutions? For claim-making to be effective, the urban local bodies need to have more teeth. While the 74th Amendment to the Constitution entrusts the local governments with funds, functions and functionaries to carry out local developmental work such as roads, land development, waste management, water supply and sewer, the reality on the ground tells a different story. The funding leaves a lot to be desired.  A combination of citizens checking out of the system and the absence of effective governance through the lack of funds and functionaries has created a vicious cycle of citizen apathy leading to non-delivery. What can be done to address this? In civic life, this would involve coming up with compelling reasons for voters to be involved in the day-to-day functioning of the ULBs. What could be the value proposition that will increase people’s involvement in laying claim to the state? If citizens internalise the fact that they are paying twice over – once in the form of taxes and secondly for the very services they pay taxes for, would it make us more demanding of the state? For example, we pay taxes yet we buy water from water tankers. Isn’t that a double whammy for citizens? A suitable narrative around this would help us be more involved in the problem, maybe? Secondly, representatives on the ground play an important role. The lake rejuvenation projects around Bangalore engage a diverse group of people from the surrounding areas. Can this be replicated to ensure a more grassroots level involvement on all civic projects – from roads to healthcare to schools? Initiatives like the ‘My city my budget’ campaign are making valuable contributions towards increasing citizen-government interactions. The Budget Bus campaign carried out just before the state budget session is indeed a laudable effort. A value proposition and representatives backed by a technology backbone for devising plans along with communication could see the foundations of a truly ground-up democratic movement. Given the low state capacity, active citizenship is our best bet to make claims on the state and more importantly to make politics work for us. Elections for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be announced soon. Are you ready to first vote and then participate? Democracy cannot be a one-day festival. It needs to be an enduring celebration!

12-12-2020||Opinion||Parenting | Why all children must play sport at school, not just the gifted||Where does the 2016 movie Dangal stand in your scheme of things? In your view, is it a movie about parental sacrifice? Or about producing champions? At one level, it is perhaps both of these as well being something of an inspiration.  In addition, there is a certain romance to the narrative of the selfless parent denying himself and going out on a limb to give his children a leg up. Years later, the children vindicate the parent’s faith by … winning! Dangal chooses to tell this oft-told tale in the context of sport. For children, indulging in sports probably signifies a release from drudgery. Reams have been written of schoolchildren fondly gazing out at the playground as the teacher droned in the classroom.  That sport is characterised by spontaneity and driven by instincts as opposed to academics which demands preparation and thought is probably its most attractive feature. And that’s why most children take to sport without a second thought.  Excelling at it of course and doing so into adulthood is another matter altogether since sport too then comes into the preparation and thought realm.  Now the larger question: where does the pursuit of sports figure in your scheme of things? Is it only an avenue to keep physically fit? Could it teach you things that academics cannot? Is it perhaps a possible career option?  The age of the professional  The gradual advent of the professional sportsperson and their complete takeover of sports at the highest levels has been an important development since the end of World War II. More so in the last half-a-century. In the early 1950s, Roger Bannister balanced medical studies and his pursuit of athletics, the highpoint of which was him becoming the first person to run a mile in less than four minutes in 1954. He soon gave up athletics, choosing to focus on medicine.  In the early 1960s, the legendary off-spinner, EAS Prasanna took a hiatus from playing Test cricket since he believed that qualifying as an engineer was of more consequence, more so after the death of his father. Degree earned, he returned to cricket and reached its top echelons. He pursued a regular engineering career alongside, often faced with the unenviable option of having to choose one over the other.  That sports have had to be professionalised is, therefore, a positive development. Stories abound of amateur sportspersons having to drop off the radar when the more prosaic matter of earning a living entered the picture. When sports itself was able to provide a living, it was a lot easier to pursue instead of trying to balance it with a day job.  Sport in the Indian school curriculum In a different realm, there is the matter of the tortured relationship that the Indian education system has had with sport. The memo about the ancient Greek view of sport being a key component of education never reached most Indian schools. Sport in most schools therefore exists on the fringes and the regular sports periods are akin to free time and not taken very seriously. And yet, schools are not blind to the snob value of sport. Winning trophies and medals is almost always a big deal and resources are devoted to the pursuit of those shiny metal things.  But the pursuit of medals through team-based sports or individual sports is usually after school hours where those who can make it to the teams or the athlete with talent gets special attention and coaching with a view towards bringing glory to the school. This arena is largely the domain of the gifted with little place for the mediocre or the laggards.  The strange place that sport occupies in the Indian educational system now co-exists with the larger societal narrative of the professional sportsperson as a role model to be emulated. With the regular educational system blind to the idea of treating sport in the same vein as Science or Math, a new model has therefore become immensely popular throughout the nation: the private sports academy.   The rise of the sports academy Across the length and breadth of the land, sportspersons with or without coaching credentials impart skills in a variety of sports with the enthusiastic support of parents keen on seeing their children pursue sport and perhaps even become professional sportspersons. Children have taken to these academies with a great deal of enthusiasm.  At the school, teachers look askance at sport goading students to focus on academics. At the academy, many parents vicariously seek to live out their thwarted dreams through their children, the emphasis being on winning. At both places, the role of sport in helping the student learn teamwork, concentration, focus et al through sport, is forgotten.  The net result is that the inherent value of sport is devalued as a result. Since sports is not integrated into the school curriculum, the emphasis in school remains on identifying the naturally talented individual and getting him or her to win. And the same state of affairs more or less prevails at the level of the academy.  Without demeaning the contribution of these academies, it must be borne in mind that the sports academy is a business venture that will flourish when it delivers on its promise of producing winners. Hence, while they may number many enthusiastic children among their ranks, the model demands that it focus on a few likely winners who will then become the flag-bearers of the academy.  The value of sport for the not-so-talented or the hard worker who is perhaps not so blessed with natural skills has been forgotten.  If this same yardstick were applied to Science or Math and teachers only focussed on the gifted with a view to making them mathematicians or scientists, would that be acceptable? Definitely not. Society believes that Science and Math should be a part of everyone's educational foundation. But not so with sport, even though sports can contribute in many ways to an individual's well-being and mental make-up.  Medal-winning is all very well, but a place for sports in the educational system that focuses on the softer skills that sports can impart is perhaps the greater need.  The need for a sporting culture The professional sportsperson is an ideal who cannot but inspire. But the combination of talent, determination and hard work that goes into the making of the professional will necessarily be a rare occurrence.  But if the sport were integrated into the curriculum in the same vein as Science or Math, the benefits are likely to be manifold.  A true sporting culture will, in addition to throwing up the occasional high-level sportsperson, also produce a legion of knowledgeable fans who will be in a better position to understand the sport and its pursuit. As it stands today, the average fan is a fickle individual hell-bent on his or her team winning. Appreciation of the nuances of sport is largely absent. This attitude is the outcome of the lack of understanding of the place and value of sport in the life of the individual and in a healthy society’s composition.  It is the creation of a healthy sporting culture that should be the aspiration. It will unlock the value of sport for everyone instead of restricting it to the talented few.  (Karthik Venkatesh is a Bengaluru-based editor and writer)  Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author’s own.

12-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Dear Santa Claus||Who says only kids can write to dear old Santa Claus ahead of Christmas? The times have changed and even grown-ups have needs and wishes given the challenging situation we live in. Some of my friends have written to the portly resident of the North Pole, who they believe is the epitome of kindness and the hope that anything is possible. Here is a small selection. Dear Father Christmas, I am not a materialistic person and have never asked anyone for gifts.  But this time, as you know, this coronavirus is so deadly that I fear for my life. All I want is a reliable Covid vaccine, whichever is ready that you can get. Is this asking for much from a septuagenarian suffering from perennial cold and cough and living by herself? I know you can satisfy my desire. Dear Jolly Old Santa, all my adult life, I’ve been giving Christmas presents but for the first time I am unable to do so as my bank balance has hit a new low. Would you mind dear Santa if I could have a few masks, visors, sanitisers, sprays, soaps, straws and sippers? These could be very useful as gifts in present times.  Dear Mr. Claus! I trust you are fit and fine in these strange times and hope it is not too cold out there. How are the reindeers?  As you know, I have been working from home for the last eight months and will likely continue for some more months.  To work competently, I need a regular power supply and Wi-Fi as well as a noise cancellation headphone, webcam, a mike and a Bluetooth speaker. Can you work your magic, please? Beloved St. Nick! Please be sympathetic towards me and heed my request. First I lost my job, then my wife lost her job, my son is on half salary and we are struggling to keep the wolf from the door. Life has become very stressful. As a powerful figure on this planet and close to Jesus, can you please help us get our jobs back to put an end to our misery? O Giver of Glad Tidings! You have always kindly fulfilled my wishes during my childhood and I’m returning to you after many years. All I am asking for is a joyous and peaceful 2021. And yes, can you put an end to violence, anger, hatred, insults, mistrust, intolerance, divisions, fanaticism and all such distasteful things happening around us? This would be the best gift ever and I need this from you please to continue to believe in you.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/dear-santa-claus-926317.html
12-12-2020||Second Edit||Climate: India needs to do much more||There is something to cheer for India in the report that the country is among the top 10 countries for the second successive year in the Climate Change Performance Index, released in Germany this week. Another report of G-20, which will go into the records of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, also says India might meet its emission reduction targets. But India’s  performance may not mean much in the context of the poor performance of most other countries. The first three ranks in the index are unoccupied. The largest polluter, China, ranks 33rd and the US ranks last. The message from the index and the report is not that India is doing better but is only relatively doing so, and that, more importantly, other countries are doing badly. Most countries are not doing enough to meet the Paris Agreement commitments. This may be because the climate change strategies of all countries are hampered by the need to fight Covid-19. Many countries have actually been forced to go in for strategies to revive their economies with plans that go against their commitments under the Paris Agreement and do harm to the environment.  But the need for urgent action on climate is highlighted by the fact that this November was the warmest month on record. The target of containing the rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, set in Paris, will most likely be missed. The World Meteorological Organisation has said that the world mean temperature has already risen by 1.2 degrees Celsius and the cap of 1.5 degrees set for the end of the century may be touched in the near future. There are projections which show that by the end of the century the global temperature might rise by 3 degrees Celsius, and that can lead to catastrophes of the kind that has not been seen before.  That makes it important that the entire world pulls together in fighting the challenge of climate change, which is the biggest threat humanity has faced in its history. It is good news that the incoming US administration under President Joe Biden may join the Paris Agreement again and implement policies that align with its aims. China has to translate into actions what it has preached and advocated on the world climate forums. Developed countries will have to financially support other countries in their initiatives to phase out present practices that contribute to climate change and facilitate adoption of green technologies. India has itself got to do much more, like increasing the output of green energy and reducing the use of fossil fuels, in spite of the ranking it has got in the index.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/climate-india-needs-to-do-much-more-926312.html

However, the doctors continued to attend to emergency and Covid-19 related cases. They demanded the scrapping of the Central Council of Indian Medicines (CCIM) November 20 notification allowing the ayurveda practitioners to take up surgeries. The protest was also against the National Education Policy 2020 and four committees set up by Niti Aayog for integration of healthcare systems, according to secretary of IMA (Tamil Nadu) Dr A K Ravikumar. The gazette notification issued by the CCIM, a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry, stated that postgraduate ayurveda medical students must be practically trained to acquaint with as well as to independently perform a list of 58 surgeries. Private hospitals and clinics were closed for 12 hours as the some of the doctors were IMA members who participated in the strike, Ravikumar said. Government doctors expressed their solidarity with the IMA by wearing black badges while on work.

Sadashiva Kuppepadavu is a banker-turned-farmer. Having worked in a private bank for 14 years, he realised that his true calling was farming. Sadashiva realised that government schemes were meant for uplifting the livelihood in rural areas, so he constructed a poultry shed utilising funds under the MGNREGS. Sadashiva now rears 3,200 chicken on the poultry farm. The chicks supplied by the poultry industry are reared for 45 days before being supplied back to the firm, explains Sadashiva. He next constructed a goat shed by making use of facilities under the MGNREGS. At present, there are eight goats of Rajasthan Sirohi and Punjabi Beetal breed. The young Punjabi Beetal fetches a good price. There is a good demand for goats. “I’m planning to rear Jamnapari species of goat. The goat shed can accommodate 50 goats,” he said.  Below the goat shed, he is planning to rear ‘Naati Koli’ (a traditional breed of chicken). Traditional breed Under the MGNREGS, he planted 100 ‘Gendali’ varieties of coconuts this year. In the space between the coconut saplings, he planted banana, papaya, brinjal, ridge gourd, ivy gourd and bottle gourd. “Youth should engage in farming as it helps lead a life of contentment. After I developed a poultry farm and started rearing goats, many youths visited my farm to collect details about the scheme. MGNREGS is a good scheme to supplement the income of the farmers,” he said. As he stays in a joint family, a majority of the work related to farming is carried out by family members, while the rest is undertaken by three labourers. The much-needed organic manure comes from the rearing of chicken, cows and goats. He has also planted the Napier variety of grass. Now, Sadashiva is planning to construct a cowshed and a soak pit for the new house under construction. He aims to expand apiculture, and plant areca nuts on a portion of the land using the MGNREGS facilities. Further, he is also planning to engage in pisciculture by making use of an available pond. The farmer also had dug two farm ponds under the MGNREGA scheme. He utilised the lockdown period to clean the areca nut garden and add manure with the help of labourers from Jharkhand. “We never realised that there was a lockdown as we were busy on our farm,” Sadashiva said. He also engages himself in paddy cultivation spread over an acre of land. Further, he has recharged a defunct borewell in his farm using rainwater.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/a-mangaluru-farmer-scripts-success-story-under-mgnregs-926506.html

The Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple at Thrissur district was closed for pilgrims after 22 employees tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Earlier, around 25 other temple staff had reported to be Covid-positive. The nearby areas of the temple were also declared as containment zones by the district administration. Only essential rituals would be performed by priests in the temple during these days. Meanwhile, at Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, the total number of Covid-positive cases tested so far during the ongoing pilgrimage reached 183. According to a recent report of the health department as on December 7 test positivity rate (TPR) among pilgrims was only 0.32 per cent, while among others, which include staff and police personnel, it was 4.3 per cent. Total TPR for Sabarimala was 0.96 per cent. A Covid test drive was carried out among all persons at Sannidhanam (temple premises), including temple staff, police personnel and traders, on Saturday. A health department official said that so far no large clusters were spotted at the temple premises. In case of large cluster formation, stringent measures would be required. The test positivity of Sabarimala is very low compared to the state average of nearly 10 per cent, said the official. N Vasu, president of the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages the hill shrine, said that so far there was no need to panic as all those being tested positive were being shifted swiftly and those who came in contact with the infected being quarantined. Meanwhile, an individual had filed a petition at the High Court urging that at least 15,000 to 20,000 pilgrims should be allowed daily at Sabarimala. At present only 2,000 pilgrims are allowed. Devaswom board president said that the board was also of the opinion that the number of pilgrims shall be increased, but was not insisting on increasing the numbers as it was for the health authorities to take a call on the matter considering the situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/as-guruvayur-temple-closed-due-to-covid-19-sabarimala-keeps-fingers-crossed-926578.html

Rao, who is in the national capital on a three-day visit, had on Friday met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and raised various pending issues with them. According to official sources, the Telangana chief minister has plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi besides other Union ministers. In a meeting with Puri, he made a representation informing the civil aviation minister that currently Telangana has one airport at Hyderabad and he had requested the prime minister to establish additional airports in 2014 when Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. A proposal in this regard, Rao said, was sent to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in 2018 seeking its feasibility reports. The AAI had indicated that to begin with only no-frills airports for small aircrafts will be developed, which may be expanded in the future for commercial operations based on demand. The airport sites were proposed at districts of Peddapalli (Basantnagar), Warangal Urban (Mamnoor), Adilabad, Nizamabad (Jakranpally), Mahabubnagar (Devarkadre) and Badradri Kothagudem. The chief minister said though the AAI has already taken up obstacle limitation surface survey, soil testing and other investigations at the sites and some draft reports have recently come, the final reports are yet to be given. "In this connection, I request the Ministry of Civil Aviation to kindly expedite the process and do the required hand-holding with the state government in finalising the sites and getting all statutory clearances on a single-window basis so that the state government can commence the infrastructure work at the earliest for starting the non-scheduled operator's permit operations with its own funds," Rao added. According to sources, the chief minister thanked Puri, who also holds charge of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, for allocating land in the national capital for building his party office. Telangana's ruling political party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been given 1,100 square metre of land in New Delhi's Vasant Vihar for construction of the office building. This is Rao's first visit to the national capital after the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections which witnessed a bitter war of words between the ruling TRS and BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/expedite-process-to-set-up-additional-airports-telangana-cm-to-centre-926591.html

Chennithala's move came close on the heels of the speaker giving a nod to the vigilance to initiate a probe against him. A request of the vigilance to initiate a probe against two former ministers and Congress leaders are also pending with the Governor now. Chennithala had alleged corruption in awarding renovation and development work in the Assembly complex for nearly Rs.20 crore to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society without following tenders. Construction and development activities to the tune of Rs. 100 crore in the Assembly over the last five years. Sreeramakrishnan had denied the allegations. The state vigilance recently initiated a preliminary probe against Chennithala as well as former health minister V S Sivakumar and former excise minister K Babu based on a recent statement of a bar hotel owner in Kerala, Biju Ramesh, that they were paid a bribe in 2014 for giving relaxations in then Congress-led United Democratic Front government's liquor policy. Chennithala was then Kerala PCC president.

"No one will be charged for the vaccine. This is the stand of the government," he told reporters at Kannur. Kerala is the latest to announce free of cost Covid-19 vaccine for its people. States, including Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have already made a similar announcement. The Centre on Tuesday said three Covid-19 vaccines, developed by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer, are under active consideration of India's drug regulator and there is hope that early licensure is possible for all or any of them. Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in the country. Vijayan said the quantity of the vaccine that would be allotted to the state by the Centre was not yet known. "The fact is that the number of Covid-19 cases are decreasing, which is a matter of relief. However, it needs to be seen if the local body polls, two phases of which are over, would contribute to increase in cases. That will be known only in the days to come," he said. If the cases do not increase,this trend (of cases declining) will continue, the chief minister added. Kerala on Saturday recorded 5,949 Covid-19 cases and 32 deaths, taking the caseload to 6.64 lakh and the toll to 2,594.

And with workers deciding to continue with the agitation, services are expected to be crippled on Saturday as well. Lakhs of commuters, who depend on buses for their daily commute, were hit hard, with thousands of them stuck at bus stations and bus stops for hours. Those who travelled long distances were forced to brave the winter chill at stations. Most of the workers at the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation(KSRTC), Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), North East Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) and North West Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) have been typically associated with either AITUC or CITU trade unions.  However, over the last few months, pent-up frustration over the “arbitrary pay cuts, punishment transfers, unpaid leave and pressure to work for 12 hours” brought to the fore last year’s demand for making RTC workers government employees.  The detention of the some workers protesting at Freedom Park demanding the presence of Transport Minister Laxman Savadi came as a last straw. On Friday, the anger boiled over. A decision to go on strike was taken at the last minute but no announcement was made. The BMTC, which has been running 5,000 buses everyday, could not operate more than 108 buses. The KSRTC could operate only 32% of the 5,500 schedules. Districts in north Karnataka fared better as NEKRTC operated about 1,539 (62%) of the 2434 buses. Officials from NWKRTC did not provide information. “Friday’s strike was a success not because of one person,” Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, who suddenly became the face of the workers, told DH. “Workers from four corporations spread across the state decided that they had enough. It will continue to be a success on Saturday too, because they are not going to accept the arm-twisting tactics of the government.”  Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Savadi appealed for an end to the strike. “I request transport workers to understand the ground reality. They shouldn’t do this with the prevailing Covid-19 situation and its attendant financial distress. Please, let them go back and do their work. Already, the minister concerned has reached out to them. As CM, once again I request them to cooperate,” said Yediyurappa. Meeting today morning Sources told DH that the government will try to restore the bus services by afternoon by holding a meeting with Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, the Raitha Sangha leader.  “On Thursday and Friday, there was reluctance on the part of the government to speak to Kodihalli Chandrashekhar. In fact, BMTC chairman Nandiesha Reddy had already tried to meet him but could not succeed. The transport minister is likely to hold a meeting with him on Saturday to end the strike,” the source added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/lakhs-suffer-due-to-sudden-transport-strike-in-karnataka-926341.html

DH has accessed the audit’s findings.  Karnataka has 18,937 water purification plants of which the audit found 12,691 -- or 67% -- to be operational. But in official records, the number of operational plants was 14,172.  The reverse osmosis (RO) plants charge Rs 5 for 20 litres. Gram panchayats or private operators in charge of maintenance can fix the rate as long as it is below Rs 5.  The plants are popular in some districts going by the amount of water citizens draw from them. In Ballari, where 76% of the 562 plants are operational, the average daily sale is 1,773 litres. The least is 333 litres in Yadgir, a drought-hit region where only 46% of the 403 plants are operational.  The audit also showed that there was no demand for plants in some districts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/water-scam-karnataka-govt-audit-reveals-maintenance-mess-926343.html

12-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Legislative council sitting convened on December 15||A sitting of the current session of the Karnataka Legislative Council has been convened on December 15, days after the House was adjourned sine die by Chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty. The council secretariat issued the order convening the sitting a day after the ruling BJP MLCs submitted a representation to Governor Vajubhai Vala appealing him to direct the Chairman to conduct the House for taking up the no-confidence motion against him. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Friday said the government has decided to convene the Council sitting on December 15. Besides the no-confidence motion, legislative business such as the anti-cow slaughter bill could not be taken up due to the adjournment. Shetty had on Wednesday set aside the BJP's attempt to move the no-confidence motion against him stating that he was taking legal opinion and refused to include it in the agenda citing rules that the subject could be taken up only after 14 days after submission of the notice. The legislators in their joint letter to Vala had termed as unconstitutional the abrupt adjournment of the Council. "In our view Chairman does not enjoy the majority of the house and it is unacceptable that without the majority he wants to continue as Chairman till next session," they said in the letter. They said certain members of the Council had given a notice of no-confidence motion against the Chairman on November 11. Accordingly 14 days after the receipt of notice, the Chairman was supposed to allow the resolution. Shetty, a Congress MLC, was elected as the Chairman during the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition government in 2018.
