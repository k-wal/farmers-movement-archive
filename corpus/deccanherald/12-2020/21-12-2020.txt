21-12-2020||Comment||PM Narendra Modi’s toughest political test to date||The on-going agitation over the agricultural reforms passed by the Modi government is the second mass protest to happen in a year without a direct backing from any political party. Now in its fifth week, farmers largely from Punjab and Haryana continue to protest at Delhi borders in large numbers to ask for the three recent laws, allowing more market intervention in the agriculture sector, to be rolled back. The Central government has stood firm, willing to consider amendments but not repeal the laws. The two sides are locked in a stalemate-like situation that does not seem to have an easy solution.  The previous protest, over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), much like this one was also led by groups and citizens who came out to voice their anger and force course-correction by holding street protests. But while that one petered out due to a variety of reasons, including the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, this one is unlikely to fizzle out. Before we look at the reasons for this, it’s worth asking why we are seeing these kinds of protests — on specific issues and restricted to relatively small groups of people — and what they tell us about how politics has shaped over the last six years.  The answer to this might lie in looking at what has happened to political discourse, the traditional space through which different positions in a democracy are debated and reconciled. Shrinking space for political discussion Since the Modi government came to power in 2014, we have seen a kind of de-legitimising of the political opposition that has so far not been witnessed in India. We have been presented over and over with a situation where there is just one true voice and representation in the political sphere —that of the ruling dispensation, its ideology and its leader, Narendra Modi. All others have been affixed with labels that discredit and more fundamentally devalue their very existence. The line of those impacted is long, but suffice to say that leading the formation are members of the Congress' first family, the Gandhis. For a government that reflexively fends off criticism and dissent through diminution rather than discussion, the farmers’ protest is a googly it just doesn't know how to play. Some in the government have tried waving labels, such as “Khalistani”, “Maoist”, “tukde, tukde”, perhaps out of sheer habit. But clearly, politics of this kind has its limits. Even the prime minister has had to cast the farmers as “misled" by opposition parties, rather than paint them as villains.  As far as the opposition parties go, chief among them the Congress, they are tying themselves up in knots trying to discredit (swapping places with the government) what seems to be a progressive policy initiative as something that will inherently destabilise the agriculture sector and undermine farmers' interests. In the absence of a widespread acceptance of this position even within the farming community, the Opposition's position seems lacking both in merit as well as ideological coherence, especially since reforms in the agriculture sector have been on the agendas of all recent governments. As far as the farmers’ groups are concerned, a determined attempt to keep political involvement out of their agitation —  the clearest reflection of how undermined the processes of Opposition politics and mobilisation are at present — have resulted in a refusal to go to the negotiating table. On one hand, they don’t trust the government and on the other hand, they are unwilling to rope in political parties — established institutions that have resources to negotiate from a position of knowledge, if not always a strength. Incidentally, a similar pattern played out during the last year’s Shaheen Bagh protests, although in that case, the government was able to belittle the protestors and get traction among its own core constituency by allowing the movement to drag on. No option but to engage with dissent Which brings us to whether there is anything that this government can actually do to resolve the current situation. Given the level of preparation among the farmers, there is a possibility that the protests could actually carry on for months. If the protests become broad-based and are able to enlist farmers from other states, the government not just stands to lose face but will also be forced to go back on a key reform initiative, one that has taken a pandemic to roll out.  What would probably be best is to find a way of convincing the farmers that their anxieties about Minimum Support Price will be met and assuaged. This requires a willingness to engage and humility to listen that this government does not possess. It is by now used to speaking a political language where its position alone is true and has meaning, while that of its opponents is not just false but downright harmful. But it cannot be business as usual in this case, and going forward in other areas as well perhaps. The government must realise it has widened the gap between itself and other political parties, not to mention dissenting citizens, to an extent where there is no middle ground. That is where the real logjam seems to be. In short, the ruling side is being taught important lessons in the art of governance and the meaning of true leadership by the current protests. How the prime minister handles the issue from here will have great import, both for the future of the reforms as well as for his own standing, In many ways, this is the first real test of whether Modi can actually do the work that a country’s top political leader is expected to do — reach out and build bridges in the face of differences in interests and outlook.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/pm-narendra-modi-s-toughest-political-test-to-date-929844.html
21-12-2020||Comment||Too much democracy, did you say?||Are economic reforms in India being slowed down by “too much democracy”? NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant seemed to say so in a seminar. Following a social media firestorm, Kant put out a piece in a newspaper that what he really meant was that India could not mirror China’s policies because we are a democracy, and professing his love for this democracy. The point of this column is not to quibble with Kant. Independent India’s single greatest achievement has been the universal suffrage guaranteeing every adult citizen the right to vote and choose their government. India’s democracy is a marvel precisely because of its size and diversity – and no other country even dared to take the leap to universal suffrage overnight. Though elections had taken place during British rule, under the 1935 Government of India Act, only about one in six Indians were even eligible to vote. Yet, the Constituent Assembly took the brave call to guarantee every adult Indian the right to vote. The move was not without its doubters. Though the Objectives Resolution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru, which laid the framework for the Indian Constitution, stated very clearly that “all power and authority of the Sovereign Independent India, its constituent parts and organs of government, are derived from the people”, this didn’t mean that all members were immediately convinced this meant universal suffrage was necessary or good. Even within the Constituent Assembly, members questioned the wisdom of the move. Two prominent voices who questioned the need for universal suffrage were Hriday Nath Kunzru and Frank Anthony. These two members, who in their other interventions in the Assembly had appealed for greater protection of civil rights and minorities and for limiting the powers of the government, seemed hesitant to sign on to the idea of universal suffrage. Both proceeded on the basis that while universal suffrage was desirable, perhaps it ought to be realised in a phased manner, as had been done in the UK. Both worried about how a population with low levels of literacy would choose their leaders and participate in policy debates to make the best choices instead of being driven by caste and communal considerations. In somewhat dense and arcane English, Anthony put it thus: “As it is, I am one of those who can only express the very sincere hope that...this electorate will not be stampeded by empty slogans by meretricious shibboleths into chasing political chimeras which will not only lead to chaos but to the very destruction of the democracy which we have chosen to give them.” In simple words, he worried that people would be swayed by the empty slogans of a demagogue and end up destroying democracy in India. The paternalism in these remarks are obvious, as also the blindness to history. White, propertied men in Britain never intended for everyone to be allowed to vote -- until women fought a long, hard and bitter battle for it. The very same illiterate and uneducated people Kunzru and Anthony disparaged had fearlessly taken part in the freedom struggle for decades prior. In the closing stages of the debate on the Constitution, P Subbarayan from Madras responded to the anxieties over universal suffrage in a short, pithy intervention: “Some people seem to have fears about adult franchise. It must not be forgotten that even today, most of the voters under the franchise that obtains today are themselves illiterate. But the Indian humanity is such that they have enough common-sense, enough horse-sense, if I may say so, which will make it possible for them to choose their rulers with discrimination, and to choose the people whom they think would be able to carry on the administration in a manner which will be for the benefit of the common man, of whom we have talked so much in this House.” At the core of the idea of universal suffrage is the belief that not just every vote is valuable but that every person is capable of making her own decisions. And that these decisions deserve respect and acceptance even if the elites may disagree with them. Seventy years is not enough to fully understand the electric effect that universal suffrage had on the minds of people living with centuries of inequality and discrimination. The polling booth was the one place where the landless was equal to the landowner, the worker with the boss, and a woman with a man. It was perhaps the first tangible brush with equality for most Indians, and one that they have come to cherish. For those who have nothing, the vote is the most valuable thing they have, and democracy the one thing they can’t have enough of.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/too-much-democracy-did-you-say-929927.html
21-12-2020||First Edit||An ominous sign for our democracy||There is no justification for the cancellation of the winter session of parliament. The reason given by the government is not even a good excuse, and the message is not that it is concerned over the Covid-19 pandemic or that it wants to secure the health of MPs. The decision only shows that it does not want to face parliament, and that it does not consider parliament important. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi has said that there is a chance of the pandemic surging in the winter months and the assemblage of MPs for many days is not advisable. But the monsoon session, though truncated, was held when the pandemic was at its peak with over 80,000 cases every day, far higher than the 25,000 or so cases being reported today. So, the pandemic is not a convincing reason for doing away with the session. The economy and social spaces are opening up and most people have returned to their workplaces, though with safeguards and precautions. Even students will soon be going to school. MPs can afford the best safeguards and the government can put any safety measures in place for them. Then why can’t the session be held? If there is to be no physical session, a virtual session can be held. When the pandemic was raging, an Assembly election and many by-elections and civic elections were held in the country. The BJP itself is holding rallies and other congregations in Bengal, Tamil Nadu and elsewhere. The government has said that it had held informal talks with floor leaders of political parties before taking a decision, but they have denied it. It now says the budget session will be held “as early as possible’’. There is no certainty that the Covid-19 situation will be better in the New Year. The session will be preoccupied with the budget and discussions about it and there will be hardly any time left for other issues. The signs are ominous for our parliamentary democracy. The monsoon session was held without the question hour. Now, the session itself has been done away with. No other country has skipped its parliament sessions during the pandemic. Parliament is the forum where the nation discusses and deliberates on its most pressing issues and problems, and now is when these discussions are needed most. Matters ranging from the pandemic to the state of the economy, the farmers’ agitation and the situation on the border in Ladakh need to be discussed. To deny the nation the opportunity to discuss these is to deny the very basis of our democracy. It is in line with the lack of regard and respect for parliament that the Modi government has shown all along.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/an-ominous-sign-for-our-democracy-930073.html
21-12-2020||In Perspective||Wistron iPhone plant violence: Global brands, local exploitation||The latest in the winter of discontent is the worker unrest at the manufacturing unit in Kolar district. The unit hired contract labour to assemble global giant Apple’s iPhones. Scenes of workers involving in arson and destruction of property and equipment predictably drew the ire of law enforcement. Despite the fact that their revolt was on the grounds of non-payment of wages, that issue has been made to seem less important by an elite alliance of local and global capital, politicians and consumers. It compels us to understand these outwardly wanton acts of destruction instead as a critique of power. The government has made a show of punishing perpetrators, anxious to retain its ‘investor friendly’ image. The incident is not the first in a state that has auctioned itself to all forms of capital. The other recent instance is that of poor working conditions and ill-treatment complaint by workers at Toyota Motors in Bidadi. Justifications such as the ‘ease of doing business’ conceal the complicity of State, local capital, and multinational companies in exploiting labour. At the root of the crisis is a familiar pattern of exploitation of cheap and surplus labour through partnerships between multinational brands and contractors, whether an international giant as in the case of Wistron Corporation or local contractors as in the case of textile factories. Merchandise, garment brands and retail chains like Adidas, H&M, Lacoste, Zara, Nike, Gap, Walmart and Tesco –to name only a few here -- have an egregious history of labour exploitation in South Asian and East Asian countries. Workers’ complaints have ranged from denial of bonuses, salaries and overtime wages; meager wages; long work shifts; inhuman and unsafe working conditions; lack of amenities and benefits; and social exploitation of women, children and minority groups. Now, what makes this form of abuse lethal is that production is carried out by vast interconnected supply chains that are often undocumented in the long trail of intermediaries, contractors and sub-contractors. This happens by a complex division in the production system, engineered into distinctive components which are normally (and increasingly nowadays) sourced from respective suppliers from different parts of the world. As a result, since the process of production is undertaken by multiple independent establishments who, in turn, directly or indirectly engage the labour force, it exonerates the global brand from any legal responsibility. All this is mediated through the structure of labour laws and regulations that aim at balancing the interests of the worker and capital. Let us take The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, which governs a new trend of employment in factories and establishments. It casts a joint and several liability on the principal employer and the contractor to ensure the payment of wages and provision of basic facilities and amenities in the workplace. The Act aims to protect persons hired ostensibly for specific work and a fixed period of time. Section 10 of the Act lays down the prohibition of contract labour if the work is found to be necessary, perennial, can be done by regular workmen, and if it is sufficient to employ full-time workmen. However, the nature of (over) production has meant that contract workers actually perform tasks that are routinely necessary, permanent and substantial, thus, evading their regularisation as permanent employees. Politics of insubordination There is a need to situate these backlashes to understand the complex structures within which these acts are encased. Workers’ resistance demonstrates a dormant consciousness that defends its interests. Dismissing these eruptions as merely ‘spontaneous’ belie an implicit pattern of operation within their social networks. The anthropologist, James Scott, coined the term ‘hidden transcripts’ in his fieldwork that studied Malay peasant narratives of revolt. Interpreting acts of arson, looting, foot-dragging, slander, rumor, gossip, etc., as everyday forms of disguised resistance against power, he argued that peasants adopt anonymous tactics of defiance behind the backs of the dominant which fall short of an outright revolt. Legal reforms affirm a parasitic structure that simply seeks to manage the extent of exploitation, thereby making it more uniform and dangerous. Earlier this year, the Government of Karnataka amended its labour laws by further liberalising exemptions in labour-related provisions that apply to establishments. Not only has it relaxed government permissions required by employers, it facilitated easier termination of employment. The labour minister bizarrely justified increasing the limit of maximum overtime hours as a way to “provide opportunities for those who want to work overtime.” In the larger current scenario, the ‘Make in India’ initiative appears as an invitation to extract labour and resources for the collective enrichment of a system that perpetuates itself.

21-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||New land grant rules draw ire of activists, farmer groups||The controversial Karnataka Land Grant (Amendment) Rules, 2020, has attracted the wrath of activists and farmer groups. While activists contend that the new amendments only appeal to land mafia and infringe on the responsibilities of some statutory bodies, farmer groups view the amendments to be against their interest. The Rules, notified last week, allows the government to “dispose of” leased government lands at the prevailing guidance value, and fixed uniform market value while granting or leasing government land. Lands leased for over 15 years “to societies, charitable or religious institutions, or educational institutions or agriculture or for other purpose prior to the date of commencement of the Karnataka Land Revenue (Second Amendment) Act, 2020, shall be disposed off,” the notification said. The institutions can buy the land at the prevailing guidance value provided the land is used for the same purpose as it was leased, and at twice the guidance value if the land is for other purpose. V S Balasubramanian, former additional chief secretary who had chaired a task force for protection of public lands, criticised the new Rules. “The purpose of these amendments is to help the real estate lobby to create land banks,” hesaid. There was no provision in the past to lease land for industry under Land Grant Rules. The Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board used to acquire land and lease it to industries, he noted, adding that new Rules would allow companies to buy or lease land directly from distressed landowners. Commenting on the low price fixed for granting or leasing land, he said that it was clear that the amendments purpose was to grab government land. “Once the land is leased, it never comes back,” Balasubramanian added. Badagalpura Nagendra, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha said that it was a ploy by the government to “lure farmers into selling or leasing their lands. They are already rendered helpless by low prices for crops,” he said. This is a pro-corporate ploy to acquire land, which will have ramifications on food security in the long run, he added. It can be recalled that the government had floated the move as a revenue generation measure to ease the fiscal constraints caused by Covid-19 lockdown. Initial projections estimated that the measure would generate around Rs 2,250 crore in Bengaluru Urban districtalone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/new-land-grant-rules-draw-ire-of-activists-farmer-groups-929686.html

Noting Apple’s response of acknowledging managerial lapses for the violence at Wistron plant at Kolar, the former CM urged Toyota to introspect in the wake of the stand by Apple. Noting that protests are being held from the past two months, he said that there was a dire need to end the impasse in the interest of state’s industrial development. Accusing the company of pushing its 3,000 workers into the street, he advised the heads of the company to set aside their prestige and act in ahumane way. It is clear that “the managers who stand in between the management and the workers are trying to create confusion as well as problems. It is important to note that these managerial personnel are not from either this region or the state, he said, noting that Apple company has acknowledged that managerial lapses were responsible for the violence at the Wistron’s Kolar plant. “The Toyota company too should conduct an introspection in the wake of the stand taken by Apple,” the former CM said. The government should ensure direct communication between the staff and the heads of the company by bringing them to the negotiating table. The government should behave like a communication bridge, he added. Workers’ plight Opposition leader Siddaramaiah also wrote to Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday to ensure that the dispute at the Bidadi unit is resolved. In his letter, the Congress leader noted that a firm named Arvind Fashions had shut shop at Ramanagara citing dip in international demand for readymade clothes. Employees who had served the company for over 12 years are left high and dry, Siddaramaiah said, adding that company had not even paid its dues to labourers before shuttingshop. “Neither the government, nor ministers or the labour department is responding to their plight,” he said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/take-a-leaf-out-of-apple-s-book-kumaraswamy-tells-toyota-929689.html

The tiger census gains importance as the M M Hill Wildlife sanctuary is awaiting to be announced as the Tiger Reserve. Out of seven wildlife ranges in the sanctuary, cameras are being installed at P G Palya range in the first phase. Around 120 cameras will be installed at 60 places. Speaking to DH, Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) V Yedukondalu said, “The last tiger census was conducted in 2018. The forest guards and watchers have informed of spotting wild animals like tigers with cubs at new places. The CCTV cameras would be of great help to confirm the same. Cameras would be installed at all the six ranges soon, he said. Forest officials say that there is a considerable increase in the number of wild animals, at M M Hill Wildlife sanctuary, that is situated amid two Tiger Reserves and one reserve forest. A large number of honey badgers were also captured in the camera traps during the 2018 census, he said. It is estimated that there might be around 18 to 20 tigers in the sanctuary. But, according to the information gathered from the ground level employees, the habitats of tigers are extensive and there is a possibility of more tigers in the range. Black panther A black panther was captured in a camera trap at Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy Temple Tiger reserve recently. There are possibilities of this black panther moved into M M Hill sanctuary, as it’s movement was spotted by the locals at Bailuru wildlife range.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/tiger-census-cameras-installed-at-m-m-hill-sanctuary-930015.html

Sagar Kulkarni: Why this book Jugalbandi? Vinay Sitapati: Well I felt that India has changed and Indian politics has changed very rapidly for a lot of people and Modi's India seems so dominant. Really, the argument of the book is that it's taken 100 years to create Narendra Modi. To understand politics, today's changing India and society is a 100-year project that begins in the 1920s, when Savarkar writes his famous essay 'the essence of Hindutva'...

He also said that rules for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are yet to be framed because of the pandemic situation and the matter will be considered once the Covid-19 vaccination starts and the corona chain breaks. Addressing a press conference here, Shah claimed that Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress raked up the "outsider- insider" issue to divert public attention from the failures of the state government and said that a "son of the soil" would lead the state if the BJP is voted to power. "The rules of the CAA are yet to be framed as such a massive process could not be carried out because of the corona. As soon as (Covid) vaccination starts and corona cycle breaks, we will consider it," he said. Asked about the summoning of IPS officers of West Bengal cadre by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Shah said that the Centre has sent the letter to state government as per the Constitution and the law. "It is according to the federal structure (of the country). They (TMC government) should first go through the rules and then talk to the Centre and the public." The Centre had on Thursday shot off a fresh letter to the West Bengal government to immediately relieve its three IPS officers for central deputation, following which the chief minister branded the move as "unconstitutional and unacceptable". On the attack on Nadda's convoy by alleged TMC activists during his visit to Diamond Harbour on December 10, Shah alleged that political violence and corruption are at peak in the state. "The BJP condemns it, and I too condemn it. The BJP believes that in a democracy, everyone should have the right to voice their views. And it is the responsibility of the ruling party to ensure that all parties can have their voice heard. "The attack on the BJP chief is not only an attack on him. It is an attack on democracy in West Bengal and the Trinamool Congress is completely responsible for this," Shah said. It was more alarming that after the attack, TMC leaders' statements, in a way, supported it, the senior BJP leader claimed. They must not be under the impression that the BJP will be cowed down by such attacks, he said adding that the party will continue to work to defeat the TMC. On the "insider-outsider" debate, Shah said, "I think Mamata di has forgotten a few things. Did she call Indira Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, Narasimha Rao outsiders when they used to come to West Bengal, and she was with the Congress? Does she want a country where people from one state will not visit another?" "Someone from Bengal, a bhumiputra (son of the soil), will defeat her and become the next CM of the state." He said. Shah, however, rejected any link between his 'bhumiputra' comment and Suvendu Adhikari, a TMC heavyweight who joined the saffron camp on Saturday. "The decision in this regard is taken by the parliamentary board. If we take any such decision, before election we will let you know," he said. Assembly polls are due in the state in April-May next year. Shah also attacked the Mamata Banerjee government over infiltration from Bangladesh. "The TMC can never stop infiltration as it believes in the politics of appeasement. Only the BJP can stop it," he said. The Union home minister claimed that the state government was opposing a CAG audit ordered by the Calcutta High Court into the distribution of relief materials after Cyclone Amphan because there was theft of ration after the disaster. He said that the TMC is lending support to the ongoing farmers' protest but it is not ready to provide them with Rs 6,000 available from the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi scheme. "Twenty-three lakh farmers of Bengal have requested online for PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi. Mamata di prevents them from getting it by not giving them actual certification. She is not even sending a list of farmers to the Centre," Shah said. The senior BJP leader also slammed the TMC for the low economic growth in the state. "Bengal had a chunk of one-third of India's entire GDP when the country got independence. Today, it has reduced to minimalistic levels after three decades of Communist rule and one decade of TMC rule," he said. "Bengal's per-person income was nearly double of Maharashtra's in 1960, but now it is not even half of India's business capital. Who's responsible for this?" Shah said. The TMC is only worried about its nephew, Shah said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/caa-rules-to-be-considered-after-covid-19-vaccination-starts-says-amit-shah-929750.html
21-12-2020||National||Discussions on global growth cannot happen among few, table must be bigger: PM Modi||Asserting that growth patterns must follow a human-centric approach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said discussions on global growth cannot happen only among a few as the "table must be bigger" and the agenda broader. The prime minister's remarks at the the 6th Indo-Japan Samwad Conference assume significance as they come at a time when India has been pushing for reformed multilateralism at the UN and other global fora, calling for representation reflecting contemporary realities. Modi, in his message at the conference via video link, said hostility will never achieve peace, and in the past, humanity took the path of confrontation instead of collaboration. "From Imperialism to the world wars. From the arms race to the space race. We had dialogues but they were aimed at pulling others down. Now, let us rise together," Modi said. Lord Buddha's teachings command the strength to turn the discourse from enmity to empowerment and his teachings also make us large-hearted, Modi said. "They (Buddha's teachings) tell us: learn from the past and work towards a better future. This is the best service we can do for our future generations," he said. Noting that this is the first Samwad of a new decade which is happening at a critical moment of human history, Modi said, "Our actions today will shape the discourse in the coming times. This decade and beyond will belong to those societies that place a premium on learning and innovating together." It will be about nurturing bright young minds who will add value to the humanity in the times to come, he said. Learning should be such that it furthers innovation, which is the cornerstone to human empowerment, he said. Underlining that societies that are open minded, democratic and transparent are better suited to innovate, Modi said now is the time, more than ever before, to change the paradigm on what we see as growth. "Discussions on global growth cannot happen only between a few. The table must be bigger. The agenda must be broader. Growth patterns must follow a human-centric approach. And, be in harmony with our surroundings," he said. Modi also called for keeping humanism at the core of policies. "We must make harmonious co-existence with nature as the central pillar of our existence," he said. In his address at the conference, the prime minister also proposed the creation of a library dedicated to traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures. "We will be happy to create such a facility in India and will provide appropriate resources for it," he said. The library will collect digital copies of all such Buddhist literature from different countries, he said. It will aim to translate them, and make them freely available for all monks and scholars of Buddhism, Modi added. "The library will not only be a depository of literature. It will also be a platform for research and dialogue - a true Samwad between human beings, between societies, and between humans and nature," he said. Its research mandate will also include examining how Buddha's message can guide our modern world against contemporary challenges, Modi said. The prime minister noted that "we began this series of conferences with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe" and since then, the 'Samwad' has travelled from New Delhi to Tokyo, from Yangon to Ulaanbaatar. "In this journey, it has remained true to its fundamental objectives: To encourage dialogue and debate; to highlight our shared values of democracy, humanism, Ahimsa, freedom and tolerance; and, to carry forward our ancient tradition of spiritual and scholarly exchanges," Modi said, thanking the Japanese government for their constant support to 'Samwad'. "About three weeks ago, I was at Sarnath. Sarnath is where Lord Buddha gave his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. This Jyoti Punj emerged from Sarnath spread across the world embracing the values of compassion, nobility and above all, 'Manav Kalyan', the good of entire humanity. And gently, peacefully, it changed the course of world history," Modi said. It was in Sarnath that Lord Buddha spoke in detail about his ideal of Dhamma which for him was more than prayer and rituals, the prime minister noted. "At the centre of Dhamma are humans, and their relation with fellow humans. Thus, it is most important to be a positive force in the lives of others. Samwad should be one that will spread this spirit of positivity, unity and compassion across our planet. That too at a time when we need it the most," he said. The essence of Samwad remains togetherness, he said, noting that Samwad brings out the best in us. "This is the time to draw upon our ancient values and prepare for the times to come. We must keep humanism at the core of our policies. We must make harmonious co-existence with nature as the central pillar of our existence. Samwad, a dialogue with ourselves, with fellow human beings, and with nature can light our way on this path," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/discussions-on-global-growth-cannot-happen-among-few-table-must-be-bigger-pm-modi-929763.html

Protesting farmers will participate in the hunger strike in batches and the first has 11 members, according to farmer leaders. Thousands of agriculturists, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the laws for the last over four weeks at various border points of Delhi and demanding that the legislation be repealed. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav had on Sunday said, "Farmers will begin a day-long relay hunger strike on Monday at all sites of protest against the new agri laws. It will be started by a team of 11 members at protests sites here, including the Singhu border." He also urged "everyone at all protest sites across the nation to participate in the same". Several roads have been shut due to the agitation and the Delhi Traffic Police has been updating commuters on open and closed routes. Taking to Twitter on Monday, the traffic police said that the Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, and Mangesh borders are closed. It has advised commuters to take alternative routes through the Lampur, Safiabad Saboli and Singhu School Toll-Tax borders. Police said as traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and the GTK Road, people are suggested to avoid Outer Ring Road, the GTK Road and National Highway (NH) 44. Those travelling to Haryana can go through the Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan-Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders. "Tikri, Dhansa borders are closed for any traffic movement. Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrian movement," the traffic police tweeted. "Chilla border one carriageway from Delhi to Noida is open for traffic, however, other carriageway from Noida to Delhi is closed," it added. Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-start-day-long-relay-hunger-strike-929764.html

21-12-2020||National||Delhi High Court declines plea to restrain Amazon from interfering in RIL-Future Retail deal||The Delhi High Court on Monday refused a plea by Future Retail company to stop Amazon from interfering into its Rs 27,513-crore deal with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. The HC also declined to grant an interim injunction against Amazon from writing to the SEBI, Competition Commission of India and other authorities about the arbitral order against its asset sale. Justice Mukta Gupta passed the order as the FRL claimed that Amazon writing to authorities about the emergency arbitrator's award amounts to interfering with the Rs 24,713 crore Reliance-Future deal.  "The present application is disposed off. However, the statutory authorities/regulators are directed to take the decision on the applications /objections in accordance with the law," the court said.  It said that while FRL had made out a prima facie case for grant of interim injunction, the balance of convenience lies in favour of both Future Retail and Amazon, and whether any irreparable loss would be caused to either side, has to be determined during trial of the suit or by a competent forum.  The court said another reason why it did not grant an interim injunction was that both FRL and Amazon have already made their representations and counter representations to the statutory authorities or regulators. "Now, it is for the statutory authorities/regulators to take a decision thereon," it said. In its 132-page judgement, the court said the FRL's suit to permanently restrain Amazon from interfering with the deal was maintainable, while the emergency arbitrator award was not without legal jurisdiction and Future Retail's August 29 board resolution approving the deal with Reliance was not void.  It further held that Amazon's representations to statutory authorities were "based on incorrect assertions" which meant that its action was based on "unlawful means" and therefore, FRL has made out a prima facie case of tortious interference, intentionally damaging someone's contractual or business relationships with a third party.  The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) on October 25 had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.  Amazon, afterwards, wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and the Competition Commission of India, urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator's interim decision as it is a binding order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-high-court-declines-plea-to-restrain-amazon-from-interfering-in-ril-future-retail-deal-929770.html

After several rejections, the Allahabad High Court had in April this year ordered his release on bail. Vinod, however, was not released from the jail as there was a minor mistake in his name. The bail order simply mentioned his name as ''Vinod Baruar'' instead of  'Vinod Kumar Baruar' as stated in his remand order, the reports said. The superintendent of the jail Rakesh Singh refused to release Vinod on bail owing to the mistake. The minor mistake, however, forced Vinod to spend eight more months in the district jail. The accused then moved the court again for another order amending the name. He was finally released a few days back. The court directed the jail superintendent to file an affidavit in this regard. It did not punish the jail superintendent but warned him of action if he was not careful in future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/man-spent-8-months-in-uttar-pradesh-jail-due-to-wrong-name-in-bail-order-929772.html

It is around the middle of the next year, that one would plan to start clinical trials for children,” an expert told the publication. Six vaccines — by Bharat Biotech, Zydus Cadila, Gennova, Oxford, Sputnik V, and Biological E Ltd — are undergoing clinical trials in India out of which four are being developed in the country. The US recently cleared the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and is set to roll out thousands of doses soon alongside the Pfizer vaccine authorised for people aged 16 and older. Meanwhile, Moderna began enrolling study participants aged 12 to 17 this month and will track them for a year. Testing in children younger than 12 is expected to start in early 2021. A paediatric vaccine may be ready by the end of 2021, an industry expert told the publication. “Work on paediatric vaccine candidates should start around July or so. Global majors like Pfizer-BioNTech have started trials on subjects aged 12 years and above already,” he said. Moderna’s vaccine has not yet been studied in children or pregnant women. No vaccine can be widely given to children until it has been tested in them. Vaccines meant for both adults and children are generally tested first in adults to help make sure they are safe for pediatric trials. Even though children usually don't get very sick from Covid-19, they can spread the virus to others, said Dr Robert Frenck, who is the lead researcher for Pfizer's study in kids at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

"Today, I would like to propose the creation of a library of all such traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures. We will be happy to create such a facility in India and will provide appropriate resources for it," he said.

In his remarks at the conference, Modi noted that the light of Buddha's message spread out from India to many parts of the world. "However, this light did not remain static. In each new place it reached, Buddhist thought continued to evolve further over the centuries. Because of this, great treasures of Buddhist literature and philosophy can be found in many different monasteries today, across many different countries and languages," he said.

The 29.2 km-long seaside road project has been undertaken by the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to connect Marine Drive in south Mumbai to Borivali in north Mumbai. Sharing the status of the Rs 12,721-crore project with reporters here, Chahal said the coastal road will be "functional in July 2023". Started in October 2018, the coastal road project was earlier targeted to be completed by 2022, but it got delayed due to the litigations. "Substantial work has been done in the last couple of months with an expenditure of Rs 1,281 crore till November. Nearly 17 per cent work of the project work has been completed till now," Chahal said. About 175 acres of land has so far been reclaimed from the Arabian Sea for the project and another 102 acres is being reclaimed, the civic chief said. A 400-metre-long tunnel boring machine of 39.6 feet diameter, which is the largest in India now, has been fully assembled on the reclaimed land and tunnel boring will commence from January 7, 2021, he said. The boring machine, named Mavala, is going to build twin tunnels of 1,920-metre length between Marine Lines and Priyadarshini Park in south Mumbai. The project work was stopped after the Bombay High Court in July 2019 quashed the Coastal Road Zone (CRZ) clearances granted to the project. The work restarted after the Supreme Court in December last year stayed the HC's order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/17-work-of-mumbai-coastal-road-completed-so-far-bmc-chief-929780.html

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday had filed a chargesheet against the four men accused of the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in a village in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district. The findings submitted by the CBI left top Uttar Pradesh Police officials red-faced as they had claimed that no evidence of rape was found in forensic tests. In a tweet, Yadav said, "The way the lies of the BJP government have been exposed in the Hathras incident, the process of exposure of false cases in UP has started." "Believing in the judiciary and democracy, we are confident that the government will also lose the false cases against Azam Khan and he will get justice very soon," the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister tweeted. Khan, who represents Rampur in the Lok Sabha, is currently lodged at the Sitapur jail after he surrendered at a Rampur court in a case pertaining to fake birth certificate produced by his son Abdullah for the last assembly elections. The Samajwadi Party MP, among many other cases, faces charges of encroachment of land around Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, where he is the chancellor.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/up-govt-exposed-in-hathras-rape-murder-case-akhilesh-yadav-929803.html

The Union Health Ministry has called an urgent meeting of its Joint Monitoring Group on Monday to discuss the new strain, which has led to a surge in the infection rate in the UK. Responding to a question on the panic and a demand to ban flights from the UK, Vardhan told reporters, "I would say this to all that all these imaginary situations, imaginary talks, imaginary panic... don't involve yourself in this." "The government is fully alert about everything. If you ask me, there is no reason to panic the way we are seeing in this press conference," the minister said. He said the government had done everything that was important to handle the Covid-19 situation in the last one year. The scientific community, he added, had very ably risen to the occasion, continuously striving and contributing to whatever was needed to combat and understand any aspect of Covid-19. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded that the Centre ban all flights from the UK immediately in view of the emergence of a mutated variant of the coronavirus there. Several European countries -- France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Italy -- have banned flights from the UK with the British government warning that the potent new strain of the virus was "out of control" and imposing a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown from Sunday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week said a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70 per cent more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England in recent weeks. But he stressed "there's no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness," or that vaccines will be less effective against it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-alert-no-need-to-panic-says-harsh-vardhan-on-new-coronavirus-strain-scare-929804.html

The farmers marched on the capital in late November to protest at new farm laws they fear will destroy their livelihoods, but police firing tear gas and water cannon stopped them in their tracks. So now, numbering tens of thousands, they are digging in at several entry points into the city, braving the bitter night-time cold with tents, blankets and fires, as well as hot samosas and sweet chai. With music blaring from large speakers fitted to tractors, the largest such site at the Singhu border crossing north of Delhi now resembles a lively — and highly organised — festival. Sunny Ahluwalia, a dentist, drove his van fitted with two dental chairs and an X-ray machine, all powered by a generator, from his home 250 kilometres away to help. "We may have become doctors but we are sons of farmers," Ahluwalia told AFP after scraping one farmer's yellowing teeth, one of around 100 patients he treats for free per day. "It is very unfortunate that our government isn't ready to accept the farmers' demands. How can the laws be good if they don't like them?" The main camp snakes back almost a kilometre (half a mile). Tractor trailers are stuffed with bedding, while tents are set up around makeshift stalls offering anything from toothpaste to free medicine. The makeshift settlement is a hive of activity throughout the day, as the farmers — mostly without covid masks — weave in and out of the bustling area, chatting and getting free food from community kitchens. In one tent, volunteers have set up two neat rows of about 20 foot-massage machines to put a fresh spring in the step of the many grey-bearded, multicolour-turbaned farmers. "Since many of the protesters are elderly farmers, they used to ask us for massages because of pain in (their) knees and feet," volunteer Bhupinder Singh told AFP. "We felt that we could serve more people and do it better by purchasing these cheap machines." "I told them how it feels good and they are doing a very good job," said satisfied customer Harbans Singh. A team of 50 volunteers wielding brooms and dustpans have split themselves into two teams keep the bustling place clean. "While everything else is in good supply, we felt that we could clean it better since we may be here for long," Sukhwinder Singh told AFP. The government has said the new laws will mean farmers do not just have to sell their produce at state-run bodies that guarantee a minimum price. But the protesters, who are mostly from northern states, fear that with the minimum price taken away, they will be squeezed dry by large corporations. To spread their message across India and abroad — there have been solidarity demos in Canada and Britain — a common social media platform is managed by a 36-member IT cell. The farmers have reportedly also set up their own weekly free newspaper to be distributed at the protest site. Any farmers wanting to make a lasting impression can also get tattoos of protest slogans, ploughs pulled by bullocks, or ferocious lions. "This is our way of supporting the farmers. We have designs related to the Punjabi culture," Chetan Sood, one of the tattoo artists, told the Times of India. When night falls and the temperature plunges, many of the protesters end their long days inside tractor trolleys with six to eight other men sleeping on cotton bedding. "We dim the lights and sleep cosy. The young boys sleep outside (in the open) with blankets," farmer Kashmir Singh told AFP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/foot-massages-tattoo-palours-dentists-hint-protesting-farmers-are-not-going-anywhere-929818.html

In a tweet, Gehlot said India was late in banning international flights when Covid-19 had started spreading, leading to a drastic spike in cases in the country. "The new strain of novel coronavirus emerging in the UK is a matter of great concern. GoI must take prompt action, prepare a contingency plan to contain the same & also immediately ban all flights from the UK & other European countries," he tweeted. "India needs both a preparedness plan as well as steps to restrict any movement from affected countries.

It said the suspension of flights will come into effect from 23:59 hours on December 22, 2020, the ministry said. The ministry said as a measure of abundant precaution, passengers arriving from the UK in all transit flights – that have taken off or reaching India before December 22, 23.59 hrs – should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned. Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had demanded a ban on all flights from the UK immediately amid concerns of a mutated variant of coronavirus there.

Vora, a former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and former Governor of Uttar Pradesh, was the AICC Treasurer from 2000 till 2018. Vora was admitted to a private hospital last week following age-related illness. The nonagenarian leader was known to spend a few hours daily at the AICC and was fondly described as the “the most youthful person” in the Congress by a cross-section of leaders. He was appointed AICC General Secretary in-charge of administration in 2018 before the recent reshuffle of the office bearers by Congress President Sonia Gandhi in September. “Vora ji was a true congressman and a wonderful human being. We will miss him very much. My love and condolences to his family and friends,” former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh described Vora as “evergreen and ever-active” and one of the most decent men who left his mark in public life in MP, Chhattisgarh, UP and in the Parliament. “He was very amused when I once told him that the seat he occupied in Rajya Sabha had once been occupied by C N Annadurai and J Jayalalitha. Even in his late 80s and early 90s, he was a fully involved MP and a role model,” Ramesh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-leader-motilal-vora-passes-away-929868.html

The destinations along with six international routes have been identified under the Sagarmala project, a flagship programme of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW). The programme aims to promote port-led development in the country through harnessing India's 7,500 km long coastline and potentially navigable waterways. "MoPSW has identified domestic locations namely Hazira, Okha, Somnath Temple, DIU, PIPAVAV, Dahej, Mumbai/JNPT, Jamnagar, Kochi, Ghogha, Goa, Mundra and Mandvi...for the commencement of ferry services through inland waterways," the ministry said in a statement. Besides, six international routes, connecting 4 international destinations namely Chattogram (Bangladesh), Seychelles (East Africa) Madagascar (East Africa) and Jaffna (Sri Lanka) from major Indian coastal port towns have been identified for these services. The ministry said it has been working continuously for the promotion of coastal shipping under Sagarmala programme. MoPSW has recently implemented one of such services by deploying Ro-Pax vessel ferry service between Hazira and Ghogha. This ferry service has reduced the distance between Ghogha and Hazira from 370 km to 90 km and travel time from 10-12 hours to about 5 hours. This will result in huge savings of fuel to the tune of about 9,000 litres per day, it said. "To replicate the success of the above business model, MoPSW now encourages private operators to identify the routes which offer potential to commence the Ro-Ro, Ro-Pax ferry service based on the localised demand to promote the supplementary and sustainable mode of transportation through coastal/inland waterways," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-identifies-new-routes-for-ferry-services-through-inland-waterways-929870.html

"Officials from the Indian Embassy in Washington DC witnessed the test," said Ankur Kanaglekar, an official of the aircraft manufacturer, at a virtual press briefing. In 2018, the Indian Navy kick-started the process to procure 57 multi-role combat aircraft for its carriers, which use the ski-jump take off mechanism. At present, six planes are compatible for the aircraft carriers -- Rafale (Dassault, France), F/A-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden). "The conclusion of the successful ski-jump trial presents a key milestone in the validation process of carrier compatibility of F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Kanaglekar, Head India Fighters Sales, Boeing Defense, Space and Security. "We understand that the aircraft has to maneuver and it has to fit. From that regard, we have a solution and it is safe and it takes care of the Indian Navy's requirements of fully operating the aircraft on the carrier," he stated. Currently, the Indian navy has only one aircraft carrier -- the INS Vikramaditya -- which is a Russian origin ship. India's first indigenous carrier INS Vikrant is likely to be inducted into the Indian Navy by 2022. The trials were held at a US naval air station at Patuxent River in Maryland and they showed that the Super Hornet would do well with the Indian Navy's Short Takeoff but Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) system, the aircraft manufacturer said, adding that the trials validated its earlier simulation studies. Kanaglekar said at the press briefing: "The multi role frontline US fighter jet's latest variant Block III, which is on offer, will provide several unique advantages to the Indian Navy. First, our offer of two-seater and single-seater variants, both of which are carrier compatible, will allow the Indian Navy to execute missions from the carrier that benefits from having a second crew." Second, Super Hornet can act as a lynchpin of the naval aviation collaboration between the US Navy and the Indian Navy that will improve interoperability between the two navies, he said. Third, it will interface with P-8I aircraft and other assets of US origin to act as a force multiplier for the Indian Navy, he mentioned. As part of Boeing's proposed “By India, for India” sustainment program, Block III Super Hornet aircraft can be serviced in partnership with the Indian Navy as well as India and U.S. based partners throughout the lifecycle of the aircraft. The Super Hornet will offer the Indian Navy value in the form of advanced warfighter technologies at a low acquisition cost and affordable cost per flight hour because of its ease of maintainability design and durability, Kanaglekar mentioned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/super-hornet-fighter-jet-performs-ski-jump-launch-in-us-indian-embassy-officials-witness-boeing-929876.html

The multi-party Parliamentary Standing Committee, headed by senior Congress MP Anand Sharma, also said that the sudden imposition of lockdown resulted in "unprecedented disruptions” but acknowledged that the GDP has shown signs of recovery in Q2 after contraction of 23.9 per cent in Q1. The panel also appeared to question the screening strategy adopted by the Centre in the beginning saying people who were flying into India from abroad were screened only for high temperature throughout March and no Covid-19 tests were done at airports. It said asymptomatic patients as well as those who took medicines for controlling temperature and flew in could not be diagnosed at a time "when they could practically be the only source of infections" of Covid-19 in the country. In its report on 'Management of Covid-19 Pandemic and Coordination with State Governments', the panel also emphasised the need for having proper data on migrant labourers and said the task of identifying the location and disbursing relief measures to them became "very difficult" as the Centre did not have any statistics at its disposal. The panel was also of the view that a national plan should be drawn up for coordination between the Centre and states for quick response to such a crisis in future and to avoid situations like the exodus of migrant workers. Taking note of complaints against private hospitals, it advocated the need for a "comprehensive Public Health Act" at national level with provisions to keep "checks and controls" over private hospitals.  It said that there were even reports of private hospitals selling beds. "The (proposed) Act should also keep a check on the black marketing of medicines and product standardisation,” it said adding that people should be made aware of cheaper medicines so that they do not panic and spend a huge amount of money on expensive drugs. Observing the disproportionate availability of ICU beds in private and public hospitals, it said the largest share of the burden of extending comprehensive healthcare has been borne by the Government hospitals as private hospitals were either "inaccessible or not affordable". Emphasising that the pandemic "may stay for a longer period", the panel said that a pandemic differed from a disaster and the Disaster Management Act is not the best suitable law to deal with the situation, though its provision "helped in timely interventions and response" during the Covid-19 pandemic. The panel said it is "difficult to predict" the characteristics of the new agents that may cause "future pandemics of this size or even worse than before". Though the Epidemic Diseases Act has helped in managing Covid-19, the panel said that it is an "outdated" law framed in the colonial-era even before the Spanish Flu of 1918. The Act should be “revisited, updated and amended so that it is fully equipped to respond to the challenges posed by the unanticipated onset of pandemic/epidemic in the future," it said. Good quality and affordable medicines should be provided to everyone, especially at a cheaper or subsidised rate to the marginalised sections of the society, especially at the time of pandemic like Covid-19, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/update-epidemic-act-bring-law-to-control-private-hospitals-parliamentary-panel-on-covid-19-management-929880.html

Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said that the government, in its letter, mentioned that it wants to hold talks over its earlier proposal of amendments in the new agri laws. "On this issue (government's proposal), we did not talk to them earlier. We are currently discussing how to respond to the government letter," Tikait told PTI. The sixth round of talks on December 9 was cancelled. In the letter to 40 union leaders, the Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal on Sunday asked them to specify their concerns over its earlier proposal of amendments in the laws and choose a convenient date for the next round of talks so that the ongoing agitation could end at the earliest. "There is nothing new in their letter. We have already rejected the government's proposal to amend the new farm laws. In its letter, the government has asked us to discuss its proposal and convey a date to it for another round of talks. "Don't they know our demand? We just want a complete repeal of the new agriculture laws," another farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said. In the letter, the Union agriculture joint secretary said the Centre is making all efforts with "an open heart" to find an appropriate solution to resolve all concerns raised by farmers. The officer said that in its draft proposal sent on December 9, the government had proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including providing a "written assurance" to the farmers that the existing minimum support price (MSP) system would continue. Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points against the new farm laws for the last 24 days. "It doesn’t make sense that the government is asking us for a date. We are basically sitting here all day long waiting for the government to hear us. They are the ones who have busy schedules. "They should give us a date, or they can simply come to our tents here, see how we are living and talk to us,” said farmer leader Kashmir Singh, who is an assistant secretary of the All India Kisan Samiti (Punjab) said. Amarjeet Singh Rarra, general secretary of Dwaba Kisan Committee, said that farmers are always ready to meet the government but it has to come to them with a concrete solution. "We have studied their proposals clause by clause, and we have repeatedly told them that we want the laws to be repealed,” Rarra said The farmer leaders are expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss the next plan of action, said Gurmeet Singh of Krantikari Kisan Union. "We have already sent them our proposals, and pointed out the issues we had with the government’s proposal. They need to respond to what we have already told them. "Tomorrow, there will be a Sanyukt Morcha meeting to decide how and when to respond to the government. We will evaluate the government’s letter and then decide," Gurmeet Singh said. Asked why the talks with the government have failed to yield any result, he alleged that the three laws were “anti-farmer” and the government was "favouring the corporates" over the farmers and the common man. “We will meet tomorrow, deliberate and then see what has to be done, but our demand remains the same — we want the laws to be repealed or we won’t move,” said Ram Singh, Haryana State President of Ambedkar Sangharsh Morcha. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmer-leaders-say-nothing-new-in-govts-letter-always-ready-for-talks-but-centre-must-offer-concrete-solution-929882.html

Farmers from the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and the desert state of Rajasthan have camped on key national highways for weeks demanding a repeal of the laws, withstanding temperatures dropping to 2-3 degree Celsius (35.6-37.4 Fahrenheit). The farmers, including a large number of older people, said they would endure the bitter winter sweeping northern India, including the capital New Delhi, to force Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration to rescind the laws introduced in September. "It's very difficult to camp out in this weather, but we aren't scared," said Balbir Singh, an octogenarian from the Patiala district of Punjab. "We won't go back until our demands are met. Even if we have to die here, we will." Since late November, when thousands of farmers arrived in trucks and tractors to camp out on the borders of New Delhi, nearly 30 people have died, several of them as a result of freezing weather, farmers said. About ten people have been killed in road accidents near the protest sites, they said. "We don't want more people to die in this protest, and I hope Modi and his government take back the laws soon," Paagh Singh, 76, said, wrapped in a blue blanket. "It's a democracy, and he (Modi) has to listen to us." As temperatures dropped, one of the main protest sites turned into a sea of small tents and tarpaulin-covered tractor trolleys. But some demonstrators have to spend the night sleeping in the open air. "I don't care how cold it gets," said farmer Surminder Singh. "I'm neither scared of the cold nor of Modi. Our struggle will continue until the laws are withdrawn."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-vow-to-carry-on-protests-despite-cold-deaths-929886.html

Talking to reporters here, Athawale, whose Republican Party of India (A) is a constituent of the NDA, also expressed confidence that the BJP will win more than 200 seats in the forthcoming West Bengal Assembly elections and form the next government in that state. To a question on the ongoing farmers' protest at Delhi borders over their demand for a repeal of the Centre's three new farm laws, Athawale said the demand is "illegitimate". "The law has been passed by majority in Parliament. If such laws are withdrawn because there are protests against it, then it would be a precedent for every law passed on the floor of the House, which will put the Constitution and parliamentary democracy in danger," he said. Athawale said farmers should accept the compromise formula suggested by the central government. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently, said there will be no impact on the Minimum Support Price and Agricultural Produce Market Committees due to the new laws," he said. The PM has also ruled out any coercive measures to take away land of farmers, as is being projected by the protesters, he said. The minister said farmers have the right to seek clarification over the farm laws from the central government. "But, in this case (current agitation), I feel the farmers have been misled and instigated," he claimed. "The farmers are on roads bearing the cold winter for 25 days. They should withdraw the protest and accept the compromise formula. The government is ready for discussion," he added. Athawale also said that the BJP will win more than 200 seats in the forthcoming West Bengal Assembly polls. "The party will form the next government there," he claimed. The Union Minister of State for Social Justice was speaking after meeting Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant. Both the leaders discussed issues related to the Scheduled Caste (SC) population in the coastal state. "The RPI(A) has a good presence in West Bengal. There is 36 per cent SC population in the state. We would be asking for four to five seats in West Bengal polls with the BJP. I will discuss the issue with BJP president J P Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah," Athawale said. He claimed Amit Shah's recent visit to West Bengal has proved that the days of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government are numbered. Mamata Benerjee is "getting baffled", which reflects in acts like the recent attack on Nadda's convoy in West Bengal, the Union minister said. Athawale also claimed that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, "will collapse on its own and will not complete two years of its tenure, in the wake of the internal differences within the coalition". "We are not interested in destabilising the Maharashtra government. But, if the government collapses on its own, we (NDA) will form the government as we have 117 MLAs in the state," the RPI(A) leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/scrapping-laws-after-protests-will-hurt-democracy-athawale-929893.html

Right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 cannot be secured and the golden goals of Preamble cannot be achieved without curbing corruption," his plea claimed. The Centre and state governments have also not taken appropriate steps in this regard, the petition said. None of the welfare schemes and government departments are corruption-free, it said. "Due to long pendency and ineffective anti-corruption laws, even after 73 years of independence and 70 years after becoming a socialist secular democratic republic, none of our districts are free from cases related to black money, benami property, disproportionate assets, bribery, money laundering, tax evasion and similar other economic offences," the petition said. India's anti-corruption laws are very weak and ineffective and fail to control corruption, and even the Benami Transactions Act, passed in 1988, is gathering dust without action, it said. "Every family has debit card and Aadhaar card, therefore, restricting cash transaction above Rs 5,000 and linking property with Aadhaar is feasible," it suggested.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-filed-in-sc-for-setting-up-special-anti-corruption-courts-929906.html

Here is the top news of December 21, 2020:   A five-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed by a man living in her neighbourhood in Haryana's Jhajjar city, police said on Monday. The 30-year-old man, who has a criminal background, kidnapped the girl from her house at night and took her to his residence where he allegedly raped and then killed her, a police official in Jhajjar said The body was recovered from the house of the man and he has been arrested, police said. The official said that a case has been registered against him under relevant provisions of the law.   The United Kingdom has gone back into strict lockdown due to the discovery of the new strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, weeks after it started vaccinating against the virus. The UK government said the highly contagious infection was “out of control” which has led to many countries including France, Italy, Germany, Belgium and Austria, banning flights to and from the country. Experts have deemed this new virus at least 70 per cent more infectious than the other strains of the virus. Most new positive cases that have surfaced in the UK, especially in London, have been because of the new strain.   India on Monday announced suspension of all flights originating from the United Kingdom from Tuesday midnight till December 31 amid concerns of emergence of a new coronavirus strain in that country. “Considering the prevailing situation in the UK, the Government of India has decided that all flights originating from the UK to India will be suspended till 31st December 2020 (23.59 hours),” the ministry of Civil Aviation said. It said the suspension of flights will come into effect from 23:59 hours on December 22, 2020, the ministry said.   The government is fully alert and there is no need to panic, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Monday amid concerns over the emergence of a new coronavirus strain in the UK. The Union Health Ministry has called an urgent meeting of its Joint Monitoring Group on Monday to discuss the new strain, which has led to a surge in the infection rate in the UK. Responding to a question on the panic and a demand to ban flights from the UK, Vardhan told reporters, "I would say this to all that all these imaginary situations, imaginary talks, imaginary panic... don't involve yourself in this."   Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple Inc., Wistron Corp. has said that the recent violence at its facility in Karnataka will not cause significant impact to the company. Workers at the Wistron's iPhone manufacturing plant at Narsapura in Kolar district had gone on the rampage on December 12 over the alleged delay in payment of salary and overtime wages. "Regarding the event at our Narsapura facility in India, the investigation which includes collaboration with related government authorities is ongoing, as well as related insurance claims. The company will work with our customer in terms of correcting issues and operation recovery," the firm has informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange.   Source: DHNS/ PTI||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-india-suspends-all-flights-from-uk-due-to-new-coronavirus-strain-929907.html
21-12-2020||National||New strain spreads 1.7 times faster but India must focus on long-haul Covid: OMAG||The new strain of coronavirus spreads 1.7 times faster than Covid-19 but India’s focus at this stage needs to remain on combating the pandemic and tackling Long-Covid, according to the Organized Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG). “A subset of people who recovered from Covid-19, but experience lingering symptoms are described as post-Covid syndrome, Long-haul Covid or Long-Covid. This can last for several weeks to several months. Often physiological suffering is downplayed as a psychological problem and the patient gets scuttled,” said OMAG’s President S Natrajan and Secretary General Dr IS Gilada. “Viruses mutate on their own in natural course…this is bound to happen…we must ensure that the vulnerable population is vaccinated and this has to be coupled by containment strategies. This would take care of the new strain,” he said, adding that the focus needs to be more on post-Covid-19 syndrome, which is a new phenomenon and the world is at a learning stage. “We must not panic,” they said. Dr Gilada said that Covid-19 pandemic can have huge downstream effects on a person's quality of life, impacting family and social life, as well as productivity. This is also seen in those who had mild symptoms, which is all the more reason to fortify the steps towards prevention of Covid, requiring holistic care with multidisciplinary approach, patience, and reassurance in addition to physical therapy. We cannot fight what we do not measure. Death is not the only thing that counts. We must also count lives changed,” he said. Talking to DH, Dr Gilada said proper planning and implementation of Covid vaccination and post-Covid-19 clinics is required, which itself may consume the entirety of 2021. OMAG is duty-bound to provide free consultancy services to the country, he assured. Talking about who could be affected by Long-Haul Covid, he said: “Elderly, those with co-morbidities and Covid-19 illnesses are more prone. However, even young and healthy people, who are found Covid antibodies positive later, can feel unwell for weeks to months after infection. Any part of the body can be involved causing Post-Covid Neurological Syndrome (PCNS), Pulmonary syndrome, cardiovascular syndrome that includes potentially life-limiting complications like pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary vascular disease and hormonal imbalance.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-strain-spreads-17-times-faster-but-india-must-focus-on-long-haul-covid-omag-929908.html

Modi and Phuc had a virtual summit and agreed to explore practical cooperation based on convergences between India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative and the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific subscribed by Vietnam. The summit took place amid growing belligerence of China, not only along its disputed boundary with India but also in the South China Sea, where Vietnam and several other nations are embroiled in territorial disputes with Xi Jingping’s ‘Middle Kingdom’. New Delhi and Hanoi signed seven pacts on the sideline of the summit, including an implementing arrangement for defence industry cooperation and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India’s Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) and Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear Safety (VARANS) to promote mutual cooperation between the regulatory bodies of the two countries in the fields of radiation protection and nuclear safety. The two nations also inked an agreement for $5 million grant from India to Vietnam to facilitate setting up of an Information Technology infrastructure at the Army Software Park at the Telecommunications University in Nha Trang in the South Asian nation, with provision for training and services in the field of software applications. Modi and Phuc sent out a message to Beijing, reaffirming “importance of maintaining peace, stability, security and freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, while pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), without resorting to threat or use of force”, according to a joint statement issued after the summit. Modi not only formally handed over to Phuc one High Speed Guard Boat, but the two leaders also launched of two other vessels being manufactured in India for Vietnam. They also remotely attended the keel-laying ceremony or the start of manufacturing of seven other similar vessels being manufactured in Vietnam with support from India. New Delhi is providing the patrol boats to Vietnam under a $100 million Defence Line of Credit it earlier extended to the South East Asian nations. India agreed to raise the number of Quick Impact Projects it finances in Vietnam from currently five per year to 10 per year commencing from 2021-2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vietnam-important-partner-in-indias-indo-pacific-vision-pm-narendra-modi-929909.html

Deputy Chief of the Russian mission Roman Babushkin said Russia's ties with Pakistan are "independent" in nature and that his government is mindful of respecting sensitivities of other countries. "We do not think India should be worried," he said at a media briefing when asked about Russia's military drills with Pakistan as well as trade cooperation. "Russia is very cautious when it comes to respecting the sensitivities. But at the same time we regard our relationship with Pakistan as independent in nature and we also have bilateral trade and economic agenda. We are quite committed to develop this relationship further including from the point of view of Pakistan being a partner country in the framework of the SCO," Babushkin said. He said the basic principle of Russian foreign policy is to have bilateral relations that are not aimed against any other country. "This is the very important principle we are following when it comes to cooperation with every country in the world including Pakistan and many others," he said. The Russian diplomat also mentioned increasing defence and security ties between India and Russia and even referred to the extensive military exercises between the two countries and the cooperation between them which are contributing to regional stability. Babushkin said the military drills with Pakistan were part of the counter-terror framework and such collaborations including experience sharing and capacity building is natural for all the SCO member states. The SCO is an eight-nation bloc which is largely dominated by Russia and China, and is being increasingly seen as a counterweight to NATO. India and Pakistan became permanent members of the SCO in 2017. In the briefing, Russian Ambassador Nikolay Kudashev mentioned the various facets of India-Russia ties and noted that the special and privileged strategic partnership meant that relations between the two countries are "limitless, and they remain trusted, strong and coherent despite the current global turbulence". On Russia's ties with Pakistan, Kudashev said its substance corresponds to issues like regional stability, fighting terrorism and the menace of drugs. "Naturally, economic cooperation is a key to the progress and predictability here," he said in the joint media briefing with Babushkin. Pakistan and Russia have been holding military drills for last few years in the counter terrorism domain. The two sides are also attempting to expand ties in the domain of trade and have finalised a gas pipeline project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-should-not-be-worried-about-our-ties-with-pakistan-russia-929919.html

These are part of the seven-point agenda that Makkal Needhi Maiam, founded by actor Kamal Haasan in February 2018, would act upon on a priority basis if it were to win the elections and come to power. The governance and economic agenda of MNM was released by Kamal Haasan on Monday in Kanchipuram as the state stares at its most crucial Assembly elections in recent times. Honest and speedy governance, e-homes, modern villages, pay for women homemakers, Green Revolution Plus, Environmental Health, and Prosperity Line are the seven agendas that Kamal Haasan outlined for a prosperous Tamil Nadu which he said would turn into a $1 trillion economy once MNM comes to power. Dr Santhosh Babu, civil servant-turned-politician who explained the contours of the seven-point agenda, said the mantra for successful governance is honesty at the top level. “If the leader is honest, people working under him will deliver the same,” he said. MNM projects itself as a “change agent” in Tamil Nadu, which has been ruled alternatively by DMK and AIADMK since 1967. The party has identified corruption as malice that has interrupted or hindered the development in the southern state. “Our aim is to ensure that people do not have to visit any government office to avail services. When politicians can meet people at their homes during elections, why cannot services be delivered to them at their doorsteps? We will provide quality services to the people,” Kamal Haasan told reporters, after releasing the agenda. Contending that the agenda was conceived by experts who have enough experience in respective fields, Kamal Haasan admitted that fulfilling the promises made by his party would be expensive financially. “Yes. I agree. But when it is necessary for people, nothing is expensive,” he justified. He also said that the 'below poverty line' (BPL) would be replaced with a Prosperity Line by raising the living standards of the people. Kamal Haasan also said women homemakers will be given a pay as a “recognition to their hard work” and promised to implement schemes aimed at womenfolk. The MNM also promised to make agriculture a “profitable business” by introducing schemes that will help farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kamal-haasans-mnm-releases-7-point-governance-and-economic-agenda-ahead-of-tamil-nadu-polls-929938.html

Niranjan Singh, who hails from Punjab’s Tarn Taran, was admitted to the Rohtak’s PGIMS and his condition is stated to be stable, the official said. Before the suicide bid, the farmer left a note behind, which is being verified by police. “We are in the process of recording his statement,” the official said when asked about the reason behind the suicide attempt. The incident comes close on the heels of a Sikh preacher, Sant Ram Singh, allegedly committing suicide near the Singhu border last week as he was “unable to bear the pain of the farmers”. On Saturday, a 22-year-old farmer had allegedly committed suicide in Punjab's Bathinda after returning from a protest site near the Delhi border. Farmers are protesting against the Centre’s three contentious laws enacted in September this year. The government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the minimum support price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjab-farmer-tries-to-kill-self-near-singhu-border-admitted-to-rohtaks-pgims-929944.html

The social media giant had Sunday evening shut down the page of ‘Kisan Ekta Morcha’ that shares “official updates” on the agitation, only to restore it three hours later following social media outrage. The Kisan Ekta Morcha’s Instagram page was also temporarily suspended. “Social media plays an important role in our movement. While all kinds of media are writing about us, social media helps us tell our truth in our own words. The ‘godi’ media will never show the reality, but on social media, we can share what is actually happening,” Himmat Singh, a farmer camping at Singhu border, said. He came to the protest site from Punjab’s Kapurthala four days ago. Before arriving here, he said his main source of information about the agitation was social media. Himmat said he used to take the help of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to stay abreast of the various developments of the protest. The farmer added that ever since he came to the protest site, he has been posting short videos of the agitation on his Facebook page. He also termed the shutting down of the Facebook page of Kisan Ekta Morcha as an “attempt to silence them”. “I think it was done by the government. It is not a big deal for them to shut down something they do not like,” the protestor rued. Facebook had on Sunday said the farmers protest community page was blocked because it violated the virtual platform’s “community standards”. The social media site, however, clarified on Monday that it was an automated action which happened because of “increased activity” on the page. Three brothers from Punjab’s Gurdaspur said social media was their go-to medium for all kinds of updates on the protest, not just at Singhu border, but also other sites like Tikri and Ghazipur. “We have been completely dependent on social media for information about the protest, whether it is about what the government is saying or what our leaders have been planning. “Likewise, we keep watching Youtube to listen to our leaders’ speeches,” Jitender Singh, a class 12 student, said. His brother Maninder Singh said they have been posting at least 50 stories on Snapchat everyday along with putting up a post on Instagram every other day. “It helps us to let the people of the country and the world know what our protest is about. It is because of social media that so much help is coming in for the farmers,” he said. The third brother, Pratap Singh, said he had logged into his Twitter account and posted details of the protest after Facebook shut down the farmers’ protest page. The three brothers have been camping at Singhu border for the past five days. Another protestor, Jagjit Singh, also underlined the importance of social media in the ongoing agitation by the farmers. “Everything is on social media only. Who watches television now, and where will we watch TV here?” he asked. Jagjit, who has been protesting at Singhu border for the last 20 days, said he has subscribed to several pages on both Facebook and YouTube to keep himself updated about the agitation. “Though I do not post much on these platforms, I regularly surf the social media for new things that may be happening here or at other sites. I know several young men here who keep making short videos about the everyday developments at the protest sites. These are very helpful,” he said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/social-media-crucial-for-our-agitation-farmers-on-facebook-shutting-down-protest-page-929946.html

He said the transmissibility of the new strain N501Y is a "bit higher" but this does not mean it is more lethal and more people are going to die due to it. "It is likely that there will be differences between certain aspects like anti-bodies but it doesn't necessarily mean that vaccines will be ineffective. Vaccines will be equally effective despite the mutation. So there is no reason to panic," Mande told PTI. Indian institutions have sequenced over 4,000 genomes of the coronavirus and submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The CSIR's Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad have alone done sequencing of over 2,200 genome sequences of coronavirus in India. Mande said, "We have not found this (particular mutation) in Indian isolates yet." He said scientists in India and all over the world are watching this variant closely. The mutation has been independently observed in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, he said. "Scientists are looking at the mutations very closely. It is too early to draw any conclusions," Mande said. He said the new variant can be diagnosed with the RT-PCR but it needs to be assessed if it can be equally effective for the Rapid Antigen tests. "But there is nothing to suggest it (RAT) does not work right now," he said. Mande said there might be differences in the monoclonal (lab-made) antibodies which recognise the particular region in a virus which is not otherwise mutated. "But in the mutated virus that monoclonal antibody may not effectively work against this changed variant," he added. Several European countries -- France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Italy -- have banned flights from the UK with the British government warning that the potent new strain of the virus was "out of control" and imposing a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown from Sunday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week said a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70 per cent more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England in recent weeks. But he stressed "there's no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness," or that vaccines will be less effective against it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-equally-effective-against-new-mutant-of-coronavirus-csir-dg-929962.html

The Crime Manual 2020 was released by Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh on Monday in the presence of CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla and the document has Standard Operating Procedures for the officials keeping in mind the changes effected by Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Sources said the revised manual reflects the changes in laws, Supreme Court judgements, legal procedures and interpretation and will be useful for investigation officers taking up cases. The manual has a separate chapter on conducting investigations abroad, which is a new addition to the manual, which was last updated in 2005. It also provides detailed instructions on dealing with the Interpol as the CBI is the nodal agency of the former in the country. The manual advocates the adoption of "team approach" while taking up "large and complex" cases. This approach is expected to prevent any lacunae in investigations. It provides for detailed information on preventive vigilance functioning of CBI so that field units can use it. A separate chapter is on the "comprehensively revised" Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for cyber crime investigations and digital evidence collection. The manual also has updated procedures of collection and analysis of digital evidence and for handling complex cyber crimes, keeping in mind the advances made in the field of Information Technology and the new methods adopted by criminals using the internet. Extensive consultation with senior retired officials and other stakeholders were conducted for updating the manual, CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said. CBI Additional Director Praveen Sinha also made special contributions in the preparation of the manual. The CBI had last year said it was in the process of updating the manual following the changes in laws like the Prevention of Corruption Act and Supreme Court judgments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-updates-crime-manual-after-15-years-929983.html

More people, who were bearing such torture till now in silence, are approaching the police for help. Some of these victims are those who lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 impact on the economy. P Sunil, 29 years, is one such victim who hung himself in his flat at Kismatpur in Hyderabad last Wednesday. Sunil, a software engineer with a private company in the IT hub Madhapur, has been jobless for the past few months. Mounting debts and the need to run his family forced Sunil to turn to these online apps for instant loans. Sunil took about Rs 2 lakh from various apps he had installed on his phone. As he failed to repay the amount, representatives of the app companies started to threaten him and even blackmailed saying they would shame him before his family and friends via social media platforms like Whatsapp. Subsequently, Sunil's father and wife received calls from these companies declaring him a defaulter and threatened them too while demanding the repayment. On coming to know the abuse faced by his family, Sunil took the extreme step. Kirni Mounika, 28 years, an Agriculture Extension Officer in Siddipet district also took her life last week facing such humiliation. Sravan Yadav, 23 years, a farmer from Narsapur ended his life for the same reason. While investigating the cases, Telangana police officials are cautioning the public from using such unrecognised apps which steal sensitive data to extort the defaulters. According to the police, there are at least 60 such loan applications on the Google Playstore. Most of them are Chinese. “These apps are run by certain names which are not registered or recognised by the RBI as a NBFC. So, their operations are completely unlawful,” officials say. “Hosting of these apps also violates certain conditions laid by Google. It can be asked to take down these apps.” Police say that these apps gather every bit of data from the user's phone in violation of user’s privacy. “Their actions of calling friends and relatives are in violation of rules,” a police official said while appealing to the public to report this kind of harassment. Under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011, all the intermediaries, ie apps in this case, are supposed to provide names of their grievance officer along with contact details. In almost all these apps, the details provided are fictitious. All such apps show an uncanny commonality in their modus operandi. They appear to be built on one Software Development Kit suspected to be provided by a foreign country, police said. Police advisory to the public Most of the loan apps available on the internet are fraudulent, not sanctioned by the RBI. Genuineness of the NBFC purportedly represented by the app, should be verified on the RBI’s website. Do not download any loan based application, as most of them are exploitative. Do not provide personal details, Aadhar, bank accounts, which are likely to be misused. Do not consent access of your phone to these loan apps. Do not accept terms and conditions of any loan app. Be aware that all your phone contacts, photos, locations and phone memory will be compromised by these apps and can be used to harass or blackmail later on. The money lender may threaten that a criminal case would be registered against you. Contact police in such cases. If you or people close to you receive abusive, threatening and harassment calls, bring them to notice of the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/humiliated-by-money-lending-apps-representatives-three-end-lives-in-telangana-929997.html

The BKU (Lok Shakti) raised the new demand over and above the farmers’ existing demand to repeal the three recent farm laws of the Centre. The BKU (Lok Shakti) activists are presently camping at the Dalit Prerna Sthal near here, while those of the BKU (Bhanu) are on an indefinite sit-in at the Delhi-Noida’s Chilla border since the first week of December in support of the demand to repeal the three farm laws. The protestors include farmers from various districts of western Uttar Pradesh like Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Firozabad, and want to move to Delhi to join the larger congregations of protesting farmers from Punjab and Haryana at various border points of Delhi. With the two groups of BKU factions holding protests at the Noida-Delhi Link Road, the traffic movement on this key road has remained obstructed. According to police officials, “The Noida to Delhi carriageway is closed but the Delhi to Noida carriageway was open for commuters. Other routes like DND and Kalindi Kunj between Delhi and Noida are open.” There was no law and order situation at the Delhi-Noida border due to the demonstrations, a senior police officer said, adding a large number of personnel remains deployed at Chilla border. “Today, more of our supporters, including office-bearers, have joined us from Bijnor at the Dalit Prerna Sthal on the call of BKU (Lok Shakti) chief Master Sheoraj Singh,” the union's spokesperson Shailesh Kumar Giri said. “We will not end our protest until the three new farm laws are repealed and the MSP is made legally-binding. Besides this, there should be a new law to ensure legal action against those who buy crops at rates below the MSP,” Giri said, addressing the scores of protestors. He said his faction's protest will continue in a peaceful and Gandhian way until the demands are met by the Centre. Meanwhile, in a separate protest, hundreds of supporters of the local Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan (BKS) gathered outside the Noida Authority office in Sector 6 here. These farmers are protesting to demand the disposal of 'aabaadi' land, 10 per cent plots and 64.7 per cent additional compensation as ordered by the Allahabad High Court for the acquisition of their land by the Noida Authority. “The protestors remained outside the Authority's office for around four hours and were dispersed after that. There was no law and order issue,” the police officer said. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. The government, however, has been maintaining that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/need-law-to-punish-those-buying-crops-below-msp-bku-lok-shakti-930000.html

People gathered to watch the phenomenon, which took place after about 400 years, on rooftops and open grounds in different parts of Kolkata and West Bengal though the winter fog partially hindered the view. Hundreds of sky gazers assembled at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in the city as the leading science museum has made an arrangement for them to view the cosmic event at the south-western part of the sky through a telescope, a BITM spokesman said. The two planets have never been so close since 1623, Director of M P Birla Planetarium, Debi Prasad Duari, said. He said, "If two celestial bodies visually appear close to each other from the Earth, it is called a conjunction. And such conjunction of the Saturn and the Jupiter is at times called a great conjunction" if it happens once in a lifetime. The planets will again appear to come as close as this from the Earth on March 15, 2080.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jupiter-saturn-merge-in-rare-cosmic-event-930017.html

The victim's mother has demanded a CBI inquiry into the case. In the first arrest in the case, a college student was booked on Sunday from Jadupur village, where the victim's family also stays, in connection with the case. SIT chief Arun Bothra said on Monday that there is sufficient evidence against the college student who is the prime accused in the case and has been interrogated by Nayagarh police. "We arrested the youth after getting required evidence against him. Sexual assault was the motive behind killing of the little girl," Bothra told reporters. The accused was produced at a POCSO court in Nayagarh Monday which allowed the SIT to take him on remand till December 24. Rejecting the claims of innocence made by the student and his family, he said the youth was interrogated a number of times in the last ten days before his arrest. "The involvement of any of his associates in the case is still under investigation, Bothra said. The youth was absconding for the past five months since the girl went missing, he said. The crime branch of Odisha Police had said in a press release on Sunday that a person had been arrested in connection with the case under sections of the IPC and the POCSO Act. The youths mother has claimed that he is innocent and the girl's parents have doubted the SIT's findings. The police arrested a village youth and not the persons who were involved as they are close to the minister. The case should be handed over to the CBI, the girls mother, who has been sitting on dharna in front of Nayagarh district collectors office along with BJP activists, said. The minor girl had gone missing while playing near her house on July 14 and her skeletal remains were found in a gunny bag in the backside of her house in Jadupur village on July 23. The incident came to light after her parents attempted self-immolation in front of the state assembly in Bhubaneswar on November 24. The state government recently ordered a high court-monitored SIT investigation after the issue rocked the assembly for several days. The opposition BJP has been demanding a CBI probe and dismissal of Agriculture Minister Arun Kumar Sahoo charging him with shielding the prime accused in the crime. The saffron party on Sunday launched a five-day-long march from Bhubaneswar to Nayagarh demanding justice for the victim''s family. Leader of Opposition Pradipta Naik of BJP Monday joined the padayatra on its second day and sought clarification from the state government on the fate of about 5,000 minor children missing from the state since two years. The opposition Congress activists also staged dharnas in front of the offices of the district police superintendents protesting against increasing crimes against children and women.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sexual-assault-was-motive-behind-murder-of-five-year-old-sit-930020.html

Modi proposed the creation of the library while participating in India-Japan Samvad conference. “Historically, the light of Buddha's message spread out from India to many parts of the world. However, this light did not remain static. In each new place it reached, Buddhist thought continued to evolve further over the centuries,” the Prime Minister said. “Because of this, great treasures of Buddhist literature and philosophy can be found in many different monasteries today, across many different countries and languages.” “This body of writing is a treasure of humankind as a whole,” he said, proposing the creation of a library of all such traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures. He said that his government would provide appropriate resources to set it up in India. “The library will collect digital copies of all such Buddhist literature from different countries. It will aim to translate them, and make them freely available for all monks and scholars of Buddhism,” said the Prime Minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-set-up-library-of-buddhist-texts-pm-modi-930028.html

After paying obeisance at Gurudwara Katalgarh Sahib on the occasion of Shaheedi Jor Mela, Badal said, “The Centre is trying to tire out farmers by starting talks from the very beginning again. This is a futile exercise when the farmer organisations have already rejected the three agriculture laws and want them repealed.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi should call an emergency Parliament session and repeal these acts, said the SAD chief, adding that people have the final say in a democracy. “People have made Narendra Modi the prime minister and it is his duty to listen to the voice of people, said Badal, whose party earlier pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance over the farm laws. He said instead of doing this, the Centre first “linked the agitation to religion and separatists and now pitting brother against brother”. “We have always fought for the rights of farmers and the downtrodden. We are also assisting the farmer agitation but are pained that the Union government is unmoved by the suffering of farmers,” said Badal. The SAD chief further accused the Centre of “misusing” the Income Tax Department to target “arhtiyas” (commission agents). “I warn the Centre that the more it tries to suppress the ongoing agitation, the more it will be strengthened,” he said. Later, Badal after his party's core committee meeting in Chandigarh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not “shirk” from holding a special session of Parliament to repeal the three laws. “Scrapping the winter session of parliament has already sent a very wrong message that the central government is running away from discussing the three Acts which were forced through in the last session. The government should hold an emergency session to resolve all grievances of farmers," he added. In the meeting, it was decided that the party’s sub-committee comprising senior leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Sikander Singh Maluka will meet like-minded parties in coming days to make a joint strategy to force the Centre to repeal the three laws. The sub-committee will also initiate discussions with other parties to ensure implementation of a federal structure in which the powers of the states were not "abrogated" by the Union government, according to a party statement. The SAD has also decided to hold “akhand paths” (continuous recitation of religious texts) from January 2 to commemorate the “sacrifice” of Sikh preacher Sant Ram Singh and others who died during the ongoing farmers' agitation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-trying-to-defame-farmers-sukhbir-badal-930040.html

In a letter to 40 union leaders, Union Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal said the Centre is making all efforts with "an open heart" to find an appropriate solution to resolve all the concerns raised by farmers. Previous five rounds of talks between the government and the unions have failed to break the deadlock with the farmers insisting on the repeal of the three laws and camping at various border points of Delhi for over three weeks now. Aggarwal said that in its draft proposal sent on December 9, the government had proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including providing a "written assurance" to the farmers that the existing minimum support price (MSP) system would continue. But the unions had rejected the proposal in an email sent by Krantikari Kisan Union state president Darshan Pal on December 16. In the latest letter which was also sent to Pal, Aggarwal said the farmer unions' response to the government's draft proposal was "very brief". It does not specify the reason for rejecting the draft proposal. "It is not clear if the views are yours (Pal) or of all unions," he said in the letter in Hindi. Aggarwal requested that the union leaders who have been in talks with the government provide details of their remaining concerns and doubts over its draft proposal, and "suggest a date as per convenience for the next round of talks". The government intends to convene the next meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi for resolving the issue so that the ongoing protests end at the earliest, he added. The letter also mentioned that the government-held meetings with several other farmers' organisations and sought their suggestions on the matter. Earlier in the day, Home Minister Amit Shah said it is likely that Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar will in a day or two meet the union leaders. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and some other states are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/govt-writes-to-farmer-unions-inviting-them-for-next-round-of-talks-asks-them-to-choose-date-929707.html

21-12-2020||National Politics||Shiv Sena links Ram temple fund drive to 2024 Lok Sabha polls; BJP refutes||The Shiv Sena on Monday alleged that the mass contact initiative to collect funds from the public for the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya is akin to "canvassing" for the 2024 general elections in the name of Lord Ram. The BJP, however, dismissed the charge, saying it is not a political issue for the party, and accused the Shiv Sena of laying roadblocks earlier in the 'bhoomi pujan' of Ram temple construction and now by creating hurdles in the donation initiative "in which people are participating voluntarily". An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said it was never decided that the grand temple will be constructed through public donations, and political campaigning in the name of Lord Ram has to be stopped at some point of time. "But the issue of public donations is not simple. It is political," it alleged. Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust's general secretary Champat Rai last week said the trust is going to start a mass contact and contribution campaign across the country for the construction of the temple. The temple will be built using domestic funds collected from the general public through the mass contact programme as the trust doesn't have required approvals for accepting donations from abroad, Rai had said. The Marathi daily, without naming any party or organisation, said, "The temple, basically, is not being built for political gains of a political party, but for unfurling the pennants of Hindu pride of the country." It claimed four lakh volunteers will implement the contact initiative. "This mass contact programme is campaigning for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls in the name of Lord Ram. The political campaigning of Lord Ram's name has to be stopped at some point in time. But it cannot be seen (as happening)," it said. The editorial asked who the volunteers (for the mass contact drive) exactly are and sought clarity about their parent organisation. It said hundreds of "kar sevaks shed their blood and made sacrifices" during the temple construction campaign, and asked whether it should be built seeking donations.   "It will be an insult of each soul that shed blood for the temple (construction purpose) if the volunteers are going to campaign for a political party in the name of seeking donations," the Shiv Sena said. "The fight for the temple was not political, but an outbreak of Hindu emotions," it added. VHP leader Ashok Singhal, Vinay Katiyar and others had camped in Ayodhya during the early days of the temple construction campaign, it noted. BJP veteran L K Advani launched Rath Yatra taking the campaign across the country, while "hammers came down" on the tomb of Babri Mosque through the inspiration of Shiv Sena's founder late Bal Thackeray, the editorial said. "This is the history. But today Ayodhya's Ram temple is becoming a subject of ownership rights, it alleged. Reacting to the editorial, BJP MLA and former Maharashtra minister Ashish Shelar said, "Why are they afraid? Why is Sanjay Raut (executive editor of Saamana) publicly laying the foundation of their defeat in the 2024 polls?" "For the BJP, it (temple construction) was not a political issue and is not a political issue," he asserted. Shelar accused the Shiv Sena of taking "Ram virodhi (anti-Ram)" positions by earlier laying roadblocks in the 'bhoomi pujan' of Ram temple construction and now by creating hurdles in the donation initiative "in which common people are participating voluntarily". He noted the "battles and sacrifices" made during the temple campaign by the RSS, Bajrang Dal and VHP, and leaders like Ashok Singhal, Uma Bharati and others. "Those who only politically intruded into the campaign felt a stomachache at the time of Ram temple construction 'bhoomi pujan' and now the 'Ram (temple construction) donation" is rankling their eyes," he alleged. The BJP leader also asked where do those "who run the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as per the will of contractors" have the habit of making donations through their own pockets. The BMC, which the richest civic body in the country, is ruled by the Shiv Sena.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-links-ram-temple-fund-drive-to-2024-lok-sabha-polls-bjp-refutes-929793.html

The PIL filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has also sought directions to high courts to take appropriate steps to decide cases related to economic offences. The petition has made the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and various states and Union territories parties in the case. The PIL, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, contended that due to long pendency and ineffective anti-corruption laws, India has never been ranked among the top 50 in the Corruption Perception Index. The Centre and state governments have also not taken appropriate steps in this regard, the petition said. None of the welfare schemes and government departments is corruption-free, it said. "Due to long pendency and ineffective anti-corruption laws, even after 73 years of independence and 70 years after becoming a socialist secular democratic republic, none of our districts is free from cases related to black money, benami property, disproportionate assets, bribery, money laundering, tax evasion and similar other economic offences," the petition said. India's anti-corruption laws are very weak and ineffective and fail to control corruption, and even the Benami Transactions Act, passed in 1988, is gathering dust without action, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pil-filed-in-sc-to-establish-special-anti-corruption-courts-in-every-district-929795.html
21-12-2020||National Politics||Pandemic, lockdowns and a vaccine tie-up boost for India-UK ties||The Covid-19 pandemic, a cycle of lockdowns to control the spread of a deadly virus and the havoc it wreaked on global health and economy is the inescapable defining feature of the year 2020. However, a glimmer of hope that 2021 could be healthier came in the form of "safe and effective" vaccines in human trials, with one of them symbolising a real boost to India-UK relations. "The Serum Institute and Oxford University partnership demonstrates the UK-India relationship at its best: a vaccine developed in the UK and made in India; drawing our brightest minds together to save lives as a global force for good," declared UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, during his official visit to India in December – a rarity in a year of largely virtual visits. While the Oxford vaccine awaits regulatory clearance for mass vaccination, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine began its rollout in the UK on Vaccine Day (V-Day) December 8, when 87-year-old Dr Hari Shukla and his wife Ranjan, 83, became the world’s first Indian-origin recipients of a jab against Covid-19. The moment signalled the beginning of the end of a crisis-ridden year which even led the ‘Oxford English Dictionary’ to transform its Word of the Year into ‘Words of an Unprecedented Year’ to incorporate all the pandemic-induced vocabulary – lockdown, WFH (work from home), support bubbles, key workers, furlough, circuit-breaker and more. Furlough was the life raft thrown by the UK’s first-ever Indian-origin Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, who delivered serial budgets as he led the UK’s economic response to the lockdowns. The offer for businesses to put staff on government-backed enforced leave instead of mass redundancies and several support schemes have been widely hailed a success story of a difficult year, sending Sunak’s popularity ratings soaring. "No, definitely not. Seeing what the Prime Minister has to deal with, this is a job hard enough for me to do," he said, in response to a question about whether he is ready to move next door to No. 10 from No. 11 Downing Street – where the 40-year-old minister also made history by lighting Diwali diyas on one of London’s most famous streets. And, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson did have a lot to deal with, what with his pursuit of an "oven-ready" Brexit deal which has proved anything but ready, to his engagement with partner Carrie Symonds in February and then becoming a father to their baby boy Wilfred in May. However, the pandemic disrupted any celebrations as Johnson tested positive for Covid-19 just weeks after the engagement announcement and then had to be rushed to the intensive care unit until his recovery a week later in April. It was during these early weeks of the pandemic in the UK when the panic was its worst as several high-profile figures went into self-isolation after testing positive, including Prince Charles. In other royal news, 2020 began with his younger son and Queen Elizabeth II’s grandson, Prince Harry, and his ex-actress wife Meghan Markle stepping down as frontline royals and relocating to the US with their baby son Archie. It triggered much media speculation around the rift it had caused with older brother Prince William, who also tested positive for COVID-19 during the first wave but kept it under wraps until much later in the year. Several studies also pointed to a particularly adverse impact of coronavirus on people from ethnic minorities, including Indians. An official review was set up, which indicated that higher levels of comorbidities in this section of the population, such as diabetes, was the likely factor. On the National Health Service frontlines, an Indian-origin doctor couple - Nishant Joshi and Meenal Viz - took the government to court over safety issues around personal protective equipment for doctors and healthcare workers, also in the high-risk category. Their case will come up in the New Year, as will some of the high-profile Indian extradition cases, including a ruling expected in the case of Nirav Modi, wanted in the Punjab National Bank scam case. While wanted cricket bookie Sanjeev Chawla marked the first high-profile extradition of its kind under the India-UK Extradition Treaty when he was sent back to India in February, the case of former Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya, wanted on fraud and money laundering charges in India, remains stuck in a "confidential" legal wrangle after he exhausted all his UK court appeals against extradition in May. The pandemic may have had the impact of pushing all other developments and news to the periphery but one development that remains in focus is Brexit and Britain’s future as a non-member of the European Union (EU). With the transition phase agreed under the UK-EU divorce pact coming to an end on December 31, major divergences remain in the path to a post-Brexit trade pact. Deal or no deal, the early months of 2021 will be ones to watch for the impact it would have on an already bruised and battered economy. While that remains a big unknown as the year comes to a close, one of the few knowns is that 2021 is expected to be a significant one for India-UK relations with Johnson accepting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade. His first major bilateral visit since assuming office as UK Prime Minister and Brexit is a symbolism that is not lost – as the UK exits the 27-member economic, India is the first stop on the new Global Britain agenda.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pandemic-lockdowns-and-a-vaccine-tie-up-boost-for-india-uk-ties-929801.html

The polls in West Bengal are scheduled to be held in 2021 and BJP has already launched an aggressive campaign in a bid to oust Banerjee, the two-time Chief Minister. “The BJP is trying to destabilise the government in West Bengal, the BJP is trying to encroach the rights of the state,” Maharashtra’s minority affairs minister and NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said on Monday. A conspiracy has been hatched to overthrow the government in West Bengal, he said. “Although law and order is a state matter, the Centre is interfering by changing the officials. This is a very grave matter,” he said referring to the development after last week’s attack on BJP President JP Nadda. Pawar has already discussed issues with Banerjee and will try to unite all the other national Opposition parties on the same. “Pawar will also meet Banerjee in New Delhi soon, and if necessary, he will travel to West Bengal and meet her there,” Malik added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sharad-pawar-to-visit-west-bengal-meet-mamata-banerjee-929965.html

Surjewala’s remarks come amid differences between Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar and former chief minister Siddaramaiah, who had blamed a section within the party for his defeat from Chamundeshwari seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “I have unequivocally stated that we will accept no difference of opinion which tramples upon the interest of the party. Individual aspirations are good to have, but they have to yield to larger public good and discipline and unification of the party and we shall enforce it,” Surjewala told DH. However, he asserted that there was no disagreement between the state unit chief and the CLP leader or between other leaders of the party. “There is only one faction, that is the Congress faction,” Surjewala said adding that the party would fight the upcoming Lok Sabha bypolls to Belagavi seat unitedly. “Our senior leaders, including M B Patil and others have held deliberations on the best candidate for the seat. Very soon all state leaders will meet and arrive at a consensus,” he said. Surjewala hit out at the BJP government in the state, accusing it of showing complete disregard to the mandate of the people. “Rampant corruption, the anti-farmer land reform law and the corruption involving the family of the chief minister is writ large. BJP is a House divided into thousand parts in Karnataka…. The Yeddiurappa government will crumble under its own weight,”(sic) he said. The Congress leader rejected suggestions that the party was shrinking in Karnataka. “Victory and losses are part of any party’s evolution,” Surjewala said when asked about the Congress’ defeat in the recent assembly bypolls in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/individual-aspirations-should-yield-to-party-discipline-says-randeep-surjewala-929985.html
21-12-2020||National Politics||RIP Motilal Vora: An 'evergreen, ever active' Congress veteran||Between cups of lemon tea, veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora, who passed away on Monday, kept a hawk-eye watch on the affairs of the grand old party. Vora, a former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and former Uttar Pradesh Governor, breathed his last at a private hospital in New Delhi, a day after he turned 93. Vora, who had recovered from Covid-19, was admitted to the hospital for treatment of urinary infection. He had been on ventilator support after developing a severe lung infection. The last rites would be held in Chhattisgarh, where he stayed most of his life. The nonagenarian leader had been a regular at the AICC headquarters, which wore a deserted look since the Congress electoral defeat in 2014, giving a patient hearing to everyone who cared to drop by – from chief ministers of party-ruled states to the ordinary worker. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh described Vora as “evergreen and ever-active” and one of the most decent of men who left his mark in public life in MP, Chhattisgarh, UP and in Parliament. Vora held the purse strings of the Congress for 18 years as the AICC Treasurer, a post he relinquished in 2018 before being appointed as the AICC General Secretary (Administration). A staunch Gandhi family loyalist, Vora also was the Managing Director of the Associated Journals Limited – the publishers of the National Herald, Navjivan, and Quami Awaz newspapers in English, Hindi and Urdu respectively. Born on December 20, 1927 in Nimbi Jodha in the erstwhile Jodhpur state, Vora worked as a journalist before making a foray into politics – the first stop being the Socialist Party and later the Congress. He started his political innings as an MLA in 1972 and remained a member of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly till 1992. He was the chief minister of the state from 1985 to 1988 and elected to the office again in 1989. He was a four-term Rajya Sabha member and elected to the Lok Sabha in 1998. President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several political leaders including former Congress president Rahul Gandhi paid tributes to the departed leader. “Sad to hear that veteran Congress leader Shri Motilal Vora is no more. He was humility personified and belonged to a generation of leaders who carried their politics with unflinching conviction till end. My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends,” the President said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rip-motilal-vora-an-evergreen-ever-active-congress-veteran-929995.html

DH could not independently verify the report. The CBI has filed a charge sheet against the four men accused of the gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in a village in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh.  After nearly two months of the probe, the agency concluded in its final report that the accused — Sandeep, Ravi, Luv Kush and Ramu — allegedly gang-raped and murdered the woman when she had gone to the fields to collect fodder on September 14, they said. The Dalit woman, allegedly raped by four upper-caste men, died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her body was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".

Every senior police officer here is clueless as it is ‘upar say order’. No rule of law in J&K anymore. It is out & out Gunda Raj (sic),” she tweeted. Last month, the PDP youth president Waheed Parra was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly seeking support from the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit in the 2019 Parliamentary elections in which Mehbooba was the PDP candidate.  Reports said Madni, who happens to be maternal uncle of Mehbooba, and Hussain were shifted to a police station in Anantnag’s Bijbehara town, also the hometown of the PDP president. Both are former MLAs and loyalists of Mehbooba. The police did not disclose the details of the case in which the arrests have been made. Madni and Hussain were detained along with Mehbooba and dozens of other high profile politicians in Kashmir last August after the Center revoked the erstwhile state’s special status under Article 370.

21-12-2020||Oasis||Christmas comfort and consolation||Christmas, traditionally a joyous season, can be depressing for those who have suffered a bereavement. A beautiful poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born of his struggle to cope with personal loss and also the horrors of the American Civil War. On July 9, 1861, Longfellow’s wife, Fanny, was involved in an accident. After trimming her daughter’s curls, Fanny placed the clippings in an envelope. As she was sealing it with wax and a lighted candle her dress caught fire. Fanny was engulfed in flames and, despite Longfellow’s desperate attempts to save her, she died the following morning. Her husband was devastated. The first Christmas after Fanny’s passing, Longfellow exclaimed, ‘How inexpressibly sad are all holidays!’ In his journal entry for December 25th, 1862, he stated that Christmas would never be merry again. The following year, when his son Charles (a lieutenant in the Union Army) was severely wounded in battle, Longfellow confided his anxiety in a letter to a friend. On Christmas Day, 1863, Longfellow wrote ‘Christmas Bells’. America was still eighteen months away from the end of the conflict that had ripped the nation apart. At one point in the poem, Longfellow says gloomily, ‘There is no peace on earth, for hate is strong.’ He describes cannons drowning the bells proclaiming hope. In the last stanza, however, he affirms his belief in the age-old promise of Christmas: ‘God is not dead; nor doth He sleep!/ The Wrong shall fail/ The Right prevail/ With peace on earth, goodwill to men.’  That declaration is remarkable considering all that Longfellow had endured. ‘Let us then be up and doing, with a heart for any fate,’ he had urged in ‘A Psalm of Life’, composed a quarter of a century earlier. Confronted with calamity, Longfellow proved to be, in his words, ‘a hero in the strife’.  Such hard-won triumph over tragedy stemmed from Longfellow’s courage and convictions. Holding fast to faith, this people’spoet found both refuge and renewal in the comfort and consolation of Christmas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/christmas-comfort-and-consolation-930081.html
21-12-2020||Opinion||Why India wants a V-shaped recovery at any cost||By Andy Mukherjee A collapse in imports during the coronavirus lockdown has left India awash with dollars. Now a further influx of greenbacks is expected as an embryonic economic recovery draws investors back. To banks, this means one thing: The local currency is a sitting duck for appreciation against a weakening dollar. Policymakers won’t want a stronger rupee to become a one-way bet, but the market doesn’t believe them to have many other options. What the authorities have done so far — scoop up the dollars by giving banks rupees — has left the financial system swimming in money and threatens to fuel inflation that’s already above the central bank’s target. It’s a mirror image of China, where a spate of corporate defaults has squeezed interbank liquidity. While China’s recovery from the pandemic has made it the first major economy to consider exiting emergency economic measures, in India, monetary stimulus is still very much the only game in town. If the Reserve Bank doubles down on its generosity in 2021, the country’s red-hot equity markets could get dangerously overvalued. Conversely, if the Reserve Bank of India pulls back on liquidity — before the complicated task of distributing vaccines to 1.3 billion people is meaningfully under way — confidence could be undermined by falling stock prices. What will the central bank do? My hunch is, it won’t want to be seen as anti-growth at such a critical juncture. That won’t be politically acceptable, which is why there’s talk of giving the RBI a more flexible inflation target — so it doesn’t have an excuse to prematurely hit the brakes. The deluge The authorities are in a bind. They have flooded banks with rupees in exchange for surplus dollars, hoping easy liquidity will not only stem the deterioration in corporate solvency but also restore missing animal spirits in the broader economy. Thanks to $58 billion of RBI dollar purchases in the first nine months, the rupee is the worst-performing Asian currency this year. While inflation last month was a slower-than-expected 6.9%, it has exceeded the central bank’s 2% to 6% range for eight straight months. A stronger rupee might help the central bank tame inflation; a liquidity glut will make it worse. Or at least that’s the reasoning behind the near-consensus bet on the Indian currency. Traders are putting their money on the rupee being Asia’s best performer in 2021. Everyone’s looking at the record $20 billion current account surplus in the June quarter — when domestic demand cratered because of the Covid-19 lockdown — and calculating that a rupee-crushing trade deficit is still a ways off. In the meantime, foreign money will keep coming, into a $65 billion pipeline of mergers and acquisitions and government privatization deals, according to Nomura Holdings Inc., as well as into stocks, bonds and real estate. This year’s worst, next year’s best? By creating a rupee glut, the central bank has delivered the equivalent of an additional 1.25 percentage points in rate cuts — by stealth. That extends a 2.5-percentage-point reduction since February 2019, with 1.15 points coming after the pandemic hit. The Reserve Bank had to do this heavy lifting because the Indian government didn’t want its rickety finances to take too much of the strain. Bolder fiscal easing was possible only with the monetary authority directly buying the government’s bonds, something the RBI was hesitant to do lest monetisation of deficits become a habit with politicians. Hence, the central bank opened the liquidity spigots instead by buying dollars. An odd result of this strategy is that “while the government has limited its support to the domestic economy, it has, via the RBI, invested almost 3% of GDP in foreign assets” between April and September, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. economist Jahangir Aziz. What will the RBI do in 2021? If demand revives, it can slowly turn off the taps. Corporate earnings, once they’re rising because of sales growth rather than layoffs and wage reductions, can attract investors even without the prop of artificially cheap money. But dislocations in India’s real economy — especially in smaller firms and the labor market — have been way too deep. Chances are politicians won’t want the central bank chief to remove the punch bowl in a hurry. Governor Shaktikanta Das’s strategy may be to mop up some of the excess liquidity created by dollar purchases by issuing special bonds to banks. That would have a cost, but overall this approach would keep the rupee competitive for Indian exporters and prevent an inflation spiral. It would also keep the stock market buoyant and the finance ministry happy. After the mid-2013 “taper tantrum,” Das’s predecessors perhaps kept interest rates too high for too long. They also kept liquidity tight. Growth began to slow sharply long before Covid. Hence, there’s pressure on the governor to accept a more flexible inflation target: Politicians will want their V-shaped recovery at any cost. How Das manages their demands against threats to financial stability from cheap money may be a more important story for India investors in 2021 than the standard growth versus inflation trade-off.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/why-india-wants-a-v-shaped-recovery-at-any-cost-929708.html
21-12-2020||Opinion||China and India are watching Nepal's political turmoil||Nepal’s top leader dissolved parliament Sunday amid infighting among members of the governing party, throwing into doubt the political future of a strategically important Himalayan country where China and India have long jockeyed for influence. The prime minister, K.P. Sharma Oli, called for the dissolution of the lower house of parliament despite protests from his own Nepal Communist Party and opposition groups, including the largest, Nepali Congress. Nepal is now set to hold elections starting in late April, more than a year earlier than the expected vote in November 2022. Oli made his move in the face of rising dissatisfaction with his job performance even within the ranks of his own party. He was elected to a second stint as prime minister in 2017 on promises of tamping down corruption and forging stronger ties with China and its economic growth machine. But Oli’s administration has been plagued with its own corruption allegations as well as criticism of his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated an economy that has long depended on tourism and remittances from its citizens abroad. Divisions also lingered within his party, which was created by the alliance of two smaller communist parties in 2017. By dissolving the lower house of parliament, Oli might avoid a potential no-confidence vote from lawmakers. But experts said that he lacked the power to dissolve parliament and that the move could be challenged in Nepal’s highest court. “Under existing constitutional provisions, dissolution of parliament can’t be the prime minister’s prerogative when there are many other options to form a new government,” said Bipin Adhikari, former dean of Kathmandu University Law School and a constitutional expert. “It’s an unconstitutional step.” The political turbulence in Nepal is taking place amid rising tensions between China and India, its two powerful and increasingly bellicose neighbors. Their rivalry has intensified as China has made increasingly forceful claims toward disputed land along their rugged border in the Himalayas. Those tensions came to a boil in June, when unarmed troops from both countries clashed in violence that killed 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number on the Chinese side. Although the two sides have pledged to ease tensions, the rivalry could provide an opportunity for the United States to build stronger ties with India once Joe Biden assumes the presidency, possibly giving it a greater role in U.S. efforts to check China’s moves to increase its sway in the region. Nepal has long swung between favoring one country or the other. It has extensive economic ties with India, where many of its people work, and like India has a majority Hindu population. But relations have soured in recent years. In 2015, India imposed a monthslong unofficial blockade against Nepal over a new constitution adopted after a bloody Maoist insurgency, and many in Nepal believed the move stemmed from New Delhi’s feeling that it should have been more involved in the drafting. Last year, some people in Nepal blamed India for building embankments that worsened flooding on the Nepal side of the border. As tensions with New Delhi rose, Beijing moved in. China has pumped money into Nepal, which it sees as crucial to its efforts to build influence in the region. That campaign got a boost in 2017, when the communists won election. The current turmoil throws those gains into doubt. Oli on Sunday urged Bidya Devi Bhandari, Nepal’s president and ceremonial head of state, to dissolve the House of Representatives. Bhandari granted the request and called for elections in May. Oli’s move effectively blocked his former political partner, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, from threatening his position. Dahal, a former prime minister known as Prachanda, is chair of the Communist Party and was instrumental in forming the alliance that carried the group to victory in 2017. The two parties later merged, and party officials agreed that Dahal would eventually share power, according to an agreement disclosed when Oli was about to complete two years in office. Lawmakers had proposed a motion to hold a vote of no confidence that would call on Dahal to become prime minister. On Sunday, seven of the government’s 25 ministers resigned from parliament in protest. Nepal, one of the poorest countries in South Asia, is still struggling with the pandemic. Official figures suggest the coronavirus is under control. But testing remains spotty, global mountain climbers are staying home and Nepal’s migrant workers are jobless in many places around the world. Oli’s administration was further shaken by a lack of progress in fulfilling its campaign goals. Despite promises to link Nepal’s rail system with China’s, they remain unconnected. It has also been rocked by corruption allegations against the communications and information technology minister and the health minister. An opposition leader, Ramesh Paudyal of the party Bibeksheel Nepali, accused the health minister, Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal, of being involved in corruption while procuring medical equipment from China to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Activists and local news outlets said the price of some medical equipment procured from China was much higher than market prices. Nepal’s anti-corruption agency has been investigating the matter. The government has disputed the allegations. Should Oli fall, China would lose a friend. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, paid a high-profile visit last year. Oli has made an effort to show his sympathy to Beijing by organizing training on Xi Jinping Thought, as the Chinese leader’s instructions are called, and jointly announcing a new height for Mount Everest. “Oli wasn’t an acceptable prime minister for India,” said Adhikari, the constitutional expert, who added, “The next prime minister could be more India-friendly than Oli.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/china-and-india-are-watching-nepals-political-turmoil-929711.html
21-12-2020||Opinion||BJP on a mission to deflate TMC before West Bengal polls||Unlike in sports, in politics the difference between a champion and a challenger is huge. As a challenger, Mamata Banerjee got accolades all around, after the Nandigram movement succeeded in uprooting the 34-year-long rule of the Left Front. Ten years down the line, the ‘agnikanya’ is facing the toughest challenge as the chief minister of West Bengal as this time round it is the BJP which is playing challenger to her. Unfortunately for her, it is not her or her image that has brought her to this point. The blame lies at the doorstep of her associates and party workers. Thanks to them, allegations of siphoning of rice for the poor during these Covid months or relief materials after Cyclone Amphan have been voiced from all across the state. The BJP is using it to the hilt, raising slogans like “tolabaaj bhaipo hatao” (dislodge the extortionist nephew) a reference to Mamata’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. That said, BJP leaders know too well that their erstwhile ally has a tremendous ability to fight back. So, they have chalked out an elaborate strategy aiming to create an impression that their victory in the elections to be held in April-May is a foregone conclusion. They know the Trinamool Congress (TMC) does not have any heavyweight leader except Didi to counter the campaign that it is a sinking ship. That is why they have started a high voltage campaign from now. They also know a state government has limited resources to fight the administrative onslaught by the Centre, particularly in the last 90 days before the elections. So apart from politically weakening the TMC, the BJP, according to those in the know, also has decided to ensure that TMC does not enjoy the incumbents’ advantage over the system when going into the election. In other words, the Saffron camp wants to deflate the TMC so much before the election that it loses its ability to sting. The angry reactions of TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee and some others of the party immediately after Suvendu’s exit shows that the party has been hit hard by the young leader's move to switch sides. Now, the rumour mill has more than 30 MLAs and a couple of MPs are waiting to join the BJP. The plan is to induct them in phases over the next two months. This scheme of things has been drawn aiming to send a strong signal that the TMC is being decimated. Apart from Amit Shah and J P Nadda, a plethora of national leaders will start campaigning in Bengal to strengthen this impression, and then Narendra Modi will join the onslaught. The BJP also has an effective weapon to neutralise the pro-government tilt of the Bengal administration and police force. The weapon is simply issuing threats of punitive actions by the Central government. As a precursor to it, three IPS officers in charge of BJP President J P Nadda’s security have been unilaterally called off from Bengal with orders to join the Central forces following a serious breach of security. This is to send a strong signal to the IAS and IPS communities that they would be duly penalised if they work in a partisan way. It was being assumed that imposition of President’s rule (Article 356) a couple of months before the election is another option for the BJP, but the possibility has been discarded by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. However, ther than that, there is also Article 355, which has been seldom used. It enables the Centre to take charge of law and order of a state or some of its districts if it feels the state government has failed to protect the state (or designated areas) from ‘internal disturbance’. It seems like this time around, the firebrand ‘Didi’ has a real uphill task ahead of her.

21-12-2020||Opinion||Farm laws: Interference in internal affairs, keeping 'foreign hand' at bay||Opinions on the internal affairs of another country can be either ideologically or politically motivated. Sometime back, Britain’s Labour Party and the Democratic Party in the US had ruffled the Indian government’s feathers with their purported ‘interference in our internal affairs’ when they expressed concerns on the developments in Jammu & Kashmir. The Indian government responded to the Labour Party by slamming it for ‘pandering to vote-bank interests’ and to the US Democrats by the External Affairs Minister publicly refusing to meet a Democrat Congresswoman who had a role in drafting the resolution perceived to be inimical to the Indian government. There were clarifications and reassurances from Labour and Democrats that their stated concerns did not amount to questioning the all-important Indian sovereignty, but only posited the issues of human rights and liberties. It is true that both the US Democrats and British Labour are more ideologically driven by internationalism, human rights and minority rights than their respective rival parties, the Republicans and the Conservatives. New Delhi’s reciprocal displeasure over ‘interference’ had got excitedly extrapolated to suggest ‘anti-India’ (therefore, pro-enemy) implications. In the process, the starkly more damning position taken by both those parties on the Uyghur issue in China was given a complete miss in the Indian press. US President-elect Joe Biden used the word ‘genocide’ against China; the Labour Party called for ‘sanctions’ against Beijing, which also conversely does not necessarily make them, ‘pro-India’! So, while the Democrats or Labour may have occasional ideological dissonances with us, it is important to differentiate them from overtly politically motivated postures (though some of their individual members may hold such position). However, no such lenient context can be attributed to the unmistakable enthusiasm on India’s ‘internal matters’ of Pakistan PM Imran Khan who, when asked about parallel concerns on the Uyghur issue, displayed transactional morality by refusing to criticise China because “they helped us (Pakistan) when we were rock bottom!” India is a proudly vibrant democracy whose Constitution guarantees equal rights to all its citizens. The spirit of its ‘constitutional morality’ does come into question occasionally, and concerned citizens take it upon themselves to undo a perceived ‘wrong’ to any section. But it warrants no international ‘interference’, especially if it is politically motivated, and not ideological. Many of the recent internal issues have divided opinion among citizens -- CAA/NRC, bifurcation of J&K or the ongoing farmers’ protest. This is natural, healthy and, indeed, required in a thriving democracy. Other countries should restrict their opinions to purely ideological/humanitarian concerns, if any, and not cross the fine line into ‘interfering’ by unnecessary volubility and intransigence. Doing so would render their stand from the ostensibly ideological to the clearly political. The obdurately enthusiastic support of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the farmers’ protest in India is one of avoidable ‘interference’ and politicisation. As the leader of Canada’s Liberal Party with centre-left moorings, the ideological position is understandable, but his deliberate reiteration of his stand -- despite New Delhi’s warning -- that he would “always stand up for the right of peaceful protest,” was political grandstanding. Clearly, the fact that the Canadian House of Commons has 18 Sikh MPs and a predominantly ‘Punjabi’ base of the total Indo-Canadians, composing 4% of the total Canadian population, explains his political motivation. No stranger to theatrical appropriation of ‘Indianness’, his comical state visit to India in 2018 had turned out to be embarrassingly ‘bollywoodised’, and disastrous diplomatically. As if Trudeau’s earlier political dalliances with known India-baiters were not enough, his official entourage had included a controversial and convicted assassin, and the faux pas was committed due to his overenthusiasm, naïve arrogance and, possibly, political calculations. The concern of the Indo-Canadians themselves, who would have a part of their families impacted by the ongoing stir, is understandable, but Trudeau’s sense of timing, i.e., on the auspicious day of Gurupurab, had all the hallmarks of a wily politician who sought the perfect timing and platform for maximum impact (especially since the rival political parties NDP and the Conservatives had already expressed their concerns). There is a complicated and wounded history that is internalised by a portion of Indo-Canadians, whose definitive image of Punjab remains from the 1980s. The fact that much has changed and healed remains unknown, and the imagined wounds get magnified by distance, vested interests and also by the support of political parties. Earlier, due to these undercurrents, the Punjab Chief Minister had expressed his discomfort about entertaining Trudeau and his Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan during their visit to India. Indeed, a vast number of Indian citizens have reservations about the Modi government’s move to pass the farm laws, and they have raised their voices or joined the protest. But as the sagacious, dignified and determined farmers themselves have demonstrated, they need no outside support to voice themselves. Our internal issues are our issues, and voices of international support, if driven by political motivations, need to be filtered and shunned, irrespective of the support. Equally, it is incumbent on the Modi government to refrain from partaking in events that suggest our political preference in some other country. The ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ events had reverberated with ‘Abki baar Trump Sarkar’. The importance of maintaining ‘distance’ from foreign powers is especially mandated if it emanates from countries like Pakistan or China, as besides being ‘enemy nations’, these dispensations hardly have the socio-political record to justify opining on others. At the same time, our own government and ruling party must ensure dignity to protesters and avoid attributing ‘anti-national/seditious/Khali stani’ motives and accusations at the drop of a hat to counter dissent. If the government demonstrates empathy, inclusivity and magnanimity towards the contrarian views of its own citizens, then foreign powers will themselves become wary of ‘interfering’ in our affairs.

21-12-2020||Panorama||‘National gains’: What does it mean?||In public policy discussions, often the debate centres on the question: Would the proposed policy change benefit the nation? But a nation consists of millions of people. Almost always, any new policy would benefit some while hurting others. For example, if farm prices go up, farmers gain but the consumers lose. With lower import duties, domestic prices of imported products fall which hurts the domestic producers of import substitutes benefits domestic consumers of such products while the government loses the tax revenue. In such cases, economists would typically check whether the gains of the gainers would be more than the loss of the losers. If yes, then in economists’ calculation, the policy is in overall national interest. However, there are several problems with this approach. First, the identification of gainers and losers. Taking the example of raising MSP, all farmers do not necessarily benefit. At present, only about 6% of farmers are able to get MSP, the rest are forced to sell their produce to local agents at prices far below MSP, either because the APMC mandis are far away or artificial hurdles are created by middlemen to prevent farmers from getting access to such mandis. Marginal farmers who are net buyers of foodgrains actually lose when MSP is hiked. So, the major gainers are the bigger farmers (concentrated in a few states like Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka) having access to APMC mandis while the clear losers are the net buyers of the products and the government which has to first subsidise the producers and then the consumers. The gains to small farmers are much less. Similarly, if the import duty on, say, steel is hiked, the domestic producers of steel (like Tata Steel) benefit while the users of steel as an input (like Tata Motors, LG) would lose. That is why liberalisation of imports is supported by some industrialists while opposed by others. There is no doubt that apart from having lower prices after import liberalisation, consumers have gained as a result of greater product variety and better quality due to competition from imported products. Second, how to measure the gains and losses in monetary terms? We need to have reliable data on the consequent changes in prices and quantities of outputs and inputs (ex-post) which are not easily available or estimable (ex-ante). The gains from increased product variety and quality improvements over time are even harder to measure. Third, there are non-market consequences like environmental damages as a result of more land getting diverted to water-intensive crops like rice and sugar cane (that get the benefit of MSP) which, along with subsidised electricity to run pumps, is lowering the water table to dangerous levels. Such environmental losses are far more difficult to quantify in money terms. Fourth, should we simply assume that a rupee is a rupee, irrespective of who (a billionaire or a destitute) gets or loses it? Or, should we assign different social weights (which would reflect our subjective value judgement) to gains and losses accruing to different sections like poor vs rich or private sector vs government while aggregating the monetary gains and losses to arrive at an estimate of net national gain? If yes, then a policy which mostly benefits relatively affluent people while hurting the relatively poor may not be in national interest even if the (unweighted) monetary gains of the ‘rich’ are more than the losses of the ‘poor’. Changing views Fifth, even when the gains of gainers are more than the loss of losers, it does not mean that everyone actually benefits. It only implies that, potentially, everyone can be made better off by suitably taxing the gainers and transferring the proceeds to the losers. But, unless that kind of redistribution is actually carried out (which may not be politically feasible), some people would end up being losers. In that case, the losers would continue to oppose the policy even though it is supposed to be in overall ‘national interest’. The views of losers may also change over time. For example, Rahul Bajaj of Bajaj Scooters (forming the so-called ‘Bombay Club’) was once a major opponent of import liberalisation as they feared to lose from stiffer competition from Hero-Honda. But after Bajaj arranged a foreign collaboration with Kawasaki to form Kawasaki-Bajaj, the views of Bajaj changed. In other words, the initial losers from a policy may, over time, learn to cope with the new reality and make use of the opportunities opened up by the new policy. That is why sometimes an ‘unpopular’ policy needs to be pushed by the policymakers which may find greater acceptability as time passes. Sixth, the timing and the speed of implementation of a new policy does matter. The economic liberalisation of 1991 was reluctantly accepted by many people as India was facing an unprecedented economic crisis when it was forced to borrow from IMF (and accept the IMF-World bank ‘stabilisation-cum-structural adjustment’ package) to pay for essential imports. Similarly, a policy of import liberalisation with gradual lowering of tariffs on industrial products over time (not a ‘big bang’ approach), while maintaining high tariffs on ‘sensitive’ agricultural goods (where domestic production is carried out mostly by millions of small poor farmers) helped its political acceptance. A new policy, which is feared to cause loss of jobs and incomes for some people even when it is in overall ‘national interest’, is far more difficult to implement in an atmosphere of general economic recession, as opposed to a situation of high growth of GDP. Finally, it is a sad fact of democracy that ‘reformist’ policies supported in ‘national interest’ by political parties forming government are invariably opposed by the same entities when sitting on the other side of the aisle.

21-12-2020||Panorama||‘Why is PM Modi not listening to CM Modi?’||Congress General Secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala tells DH’s Sagar Kulkarni that minimum support price (MSP) should be made the sole criterion for sale of crops. Excerpts from an interview: Why are public movements increasingly keeping political parties away? First, it was the anti-CAA protesters, and now farmers? The three anti-farmer black laws were approved in secrecy by the Union cabinet and were drafted in the boardrooms of the four crony capitalist friends of Prime Minister Modi and BJP. They were pushed through by a voice vote in the Rajya Sabha after suspending Congress and other Opposition members. These laws were brought in without a demand for them from a single farmers’ union or a political party. Rahul Gandhi and Congress have been at the forefront of this opposition. Rahul Gandhi undertook Kisan Tractor Yatras in Punjab and Haryana. It was their sincere desire that political parties should not join them on the site of the dharna because the BJP has maligned every genuine protest by politicising it. Rahul Gandhi, Congress and other Opposition parties have respected the wishes of the farmers’ unions in not joining the dharna. But the farmers have our complete moral and political support. Why do you think BJP is targeting Opposition parties in its campaign to highlight the farm laws? Firstly, the Modi government is insulting India’s farmers and farm labourers, many of whose sons and daughters serve even in our Armed Forces, by calling them Khalistanis, tukde-tukde gang, urban naxals, separtists, terrorists, Chinese and Pakistani agents. Farmers are only fighting for their livelihood. The BJP and Modi government want to hand over the Rs 25 lakh crore agrarian commodity trade to their four capitalist friends. Congress and other political parties have resolutely stood with the farmers. That’s why they attack us. Please attack Rahul Gandhi, please attack Congress, please send all of us to jail, but for heaven’s sake, save farmers’ livelihoods and India’s food security by abolishing and repealing these black laws. Congress had proposed similar reforms in its 2019 manifesto. So, why the opposition to them now? This is a myth perpetuated by the BJP. Congress wanted the APMC to be renamed as farmer markets. We also were keen to ensure that every cluster of villages has a farmer’s market. We wanted to increase the number of grain markets from the current 42,000 to two lakh markets. The Modi government is abolishing APMCs altogether. That is the basic and primary distinction. Secondly, when public procurement ends, the entire Public Distribution System will collapse. Thirdly, once the farmers’ produce is not procured by APMCs, then the four crony capitalist friends of Modiji will buy it cheap from the farmer and sell to the ordinary consumer at an exorbitant price. The budget of every household will crumble. These are the principal objections to these laws. But the government claims that the APMCs will not be shut down, MSP will continue, and accuses the Opposition of misleading farmers on these. These are the falsehoods that the BJP continues to perpetuate. The first falsehood is that MSP will continue. It will get abolished the moment APMCs go away. Secondly, the PM’s claim that the farmer will be able to sell anywhere is a myth. Thirdly, that private industrialists would give better price to the farmer is also a falsehood. Even today, private players can come and buy at MSP from the grain markets. So, why do you want the farmer to go to the private player’s storehouse, to his silo, to his rice sheller, where the farmer will not have the benefit of the APMC, where everybody bids together? Is MSP guarantee enough to end these protests? Our simple question to Prime Minister Modi is, why is he not listening to chief minister Modi. Modi, as chief minister, gave a report in which he categorically said that “no farmer-trader transaction should be below MSP, wherever prescribed.” Let him come forward, give a written guarantee that MSP will be the sole criterion for sale of crops and anybody buying below MSP will be punished, and farmers will be satisfied. If PM has no value for his own written word, why should the country’s farmers believe him? What do you make of Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar’s meetings with farmers’ groups supporting the farm laws? The tragedy is that the farmer is being preached to by people who do not understand agriculture. Narendra Singh Tomar does not own any agricultural land; the other minister who is negotiating, Piyush Goyal, has never tilled or cultivated any land. So, people who have no idea about the difficulties, anguish, pain and suffering of the farmers are preaching to them on the best agricultural practices. The conversation so far has been ‘my way or the highway’. Accept that the three black laws are good and go away. Hence farmers had to say, please repeal the black laws, then we will have a conversation. Is this obstructionist approach of the farmers the right way to join negotiations? The obstructionists here are the BJP and the Modi government. Farmers had notified that they wanted to go to Delhi in a peaceful march to put across their viewpoints against the three black laws. For the first time since Independence, Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala, at the instance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, dug up the national highway to stop the farmers from reaching Delhi. Farmers have not put up the blockade, the barriers were raised by the BJP government. The Prime Minister keeps reminding us that he has the mandate of 303 MPs. Rajiv Gandhi had a mandate of 402 MPs in 1988. But he permitted farmers to come to Rajpath. They were there for a month – lakhs of farmers. There was no obstruction. A cabinet group met them and sorted out their problems. Why can’t farmers come to their own capital today? Are they militants or terrorists?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/why-is-pm-modi-not-listening-to-cm-modi-930078.html
21-12-2020||Panorama||Christmas in the time of Covid-19||It is not for nothing that the Christmas season is referred to as the most wonderful time of the year. Coming as it does towards the end of the year, it is traditionally the time for family get-togethers and fellowship, to share food and frolics.  But Christmas 2020 will not be like past Christmases. Travel restrictions and quarantines in place would mean quiet celebrations without some or most family members.  This year was not a normal year and with the ongoing pandemic it would be foolhardy to expect a normal Christmas. It would be the first time in the six decades of my life that I will not be attending midnight Mass in church on Christmas eve. The midnight Mass has always been the highpoint of Christmas celebrations beginning with carols and ending with the festive blessings before we walked home every wintry December night. Usually, the run up to Christmas begins in early December with shopping, Christmas bazaars, carol singing. This time, it appears the pandemic has dampened the mood as people are cognizant of the fact that Christmas will be subdued.  Shoppers are few and far between with retailers reporting reduced footfall; carol singers cannot go singing house-to-house. Most Christians will be listening to the Holy Mass online at home, the Christmas lunch will be a family affair and visiting friends or relatives to exchange festive greetings is likely to be limited. Many will be connecting with each other online via Zoom or Skype. Yuletide dances and parties are not happening.  Nor can we take the festive spirit of goodwill and cheer to the lonely and sick at aged homes, orphanages, hospitals and elsewhere. But let’s count ourselves lucky.  At least we can celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ even if it is on a small scale, perhaps a solemn and reflective Christmas within our homes.  The fact is we can simply celebrate and we must be grateful for that.  There are so many – young and old - who did not live to celebrate, who passed away this year due to the deadly coronavirus.     There are many others who have lost jobs and with reduced incomes who are struggling to pay their bills; there are the ones who have lost loved ones to the virus and are still in mourning; others are battling sickness, stress or depression not to speak of the homeless, the lonely, the separated and the outcast. So, let’s not forget how fortunate we are to celebrate this universal festival because there was a time when Christmas was banned. Believe it or not, there was a ruler who, like the famous Charles Dickens’ character Uncle Scrooge, was not moved by the Christmas spirit.  Oliver Cromwell, the tyrant ruler who established a reign of terror in England in the sixteenth century issued a royal edict that there would be no Christmas during his reign. And the killjoy that he was, he not only turned his back on this great festival of joy, but also deprived an entire nation of its fun and frolic. Worse, Oliver Cromwell even forced shopkeepers and traders to work on Christmas day.  Even worse, the hard-hearted dictator declared Christmas would be, not a day of feasting but a day of fasting.  The jingle of Christmas bells was heard again with redoubled fervour and Christmas trees were illuminated in every town and village. Joy and laughter ran throughout the country as Christmas was back again. Let’s be thankful for small mercies and celebrate Christmas in whatever way each of us can in these challenging times. More importantly, the spirit of Christmas with its message of peace, love and goodwill to all men is what makes it a universal feast celebrated worldwide irrespective of caste, creed or religion. In this very different Christmas, let’s look at it in a new way and reflect on the true meaning and message of Christmas which is peace, love and goodwill, so vital to all of us. We all want a world without pain, without fear, a world without war and hatred. And indeed a world without that minuscule virus which put paid to all plans and celebrations this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/christmas-in-the-time-of-covid-19-930079.html
21-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Mrs Davis and her bodyguard||A long time back, when Raj Kapoor’s Indo-Russian venture Mera Naam Joker was released, we went to see the first show on the first day with our son, a grade one student, and daughter, in kindergarten. The next day, I noticed my children talking conspiratorially. My son was nudging his sister to tell me something he seemed hesitant to say. When asked, he simply shook his head, while his sister merrily blurted out, ’Bhai ko pyar ho gaya’! I was stunned and equally amused at this confession. Upon being coaxed, he told me very earnestly that like Rishi Kapoor in the film, he too was in love with his teacher. This teacher of his happened to be a dear friend of mine and a colleague. Parents used to line up early in the morning during Admission every year vying for her section. She was the epitome of grace, affection, patience and a very popular teacher. She had a fitting name too― Grace Davis! One day as I was teaching in my class, I was thoroughly perplexed to see Mrs Davis heading to the principal’s chamber with a big register in hand and my son in tow. He was a teacher’s pet, so a visit to the principal seemed quite strange. I waited eagerly that evening for my son to return. When quizzed, he revealed that his teacher was scared of going alone to the principal, so she was taking him as her bodyguard! Not long after, all we teachers learnt the truth behind this― the naughtiest in class used to be her bodyguard always. Her company would ensure the unmanageable antics of the naughty ones were effectively put an end to. We couldn’t help but salute her cleverness! Mrs Davis was one teacher whose scale never touched a child. It was her disappointment that was considered the greatest punishment by her pupils. Their love for her extended to her outfits too, which though simple, were elegant and impressive. Even when my daughter became her student the same kind of adoration and hero-worship continued. During Christmas, the tiny-tots would give their teacher hand-made greeting cards and would yearn for their favourite time of the year, where she unfailingly directed them in a merry performance on the Annual Day. One could see a flower from them on her desk every single day. Today though, those flowers line her grave, where she rests in peace. In heaven too, I think she must be a teacher. To all those little angels, including my son--her ardent fan, her favourite bodyguard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/mrs-davis-and-her-bodyguard-930077.html
21-12-2020||Second Edit||India’s stunted, wasted years||The results of the first phase of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-V) should cause serious concern over the state of health of the country’s children. They show that cases of stunting (low height), wasting (underweight) and anaemia (emaciation), which are the most important indicators of children’s health, have increased during the period 2015-16 to 2018-19. The proportion of children suffering from stunting has increased in 11 states, severe wasting in 14 states and anaemia in 17, out of the 18 states for which data is now available. One out of five children is underweight. Anaemia cases have increased by 33% in Assam and 80% in Gujarat. The performance of even states like Kerala and Maharashtra has suffered during this period. The country had seen good improvement in these parameters from 2005-06 to 2015-16. Stunting had decreased from 48% to 38.4% during that period. These gains have now been erased. It is not common for social sector gains made over the years to get suddenly reversed. But it should be noted that the years from 2015 have seen economic growth and other important indicators like jobs falling. But this period also saw some initiatives like the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which should have had a bearing on children’s health. The National Food Security Act covered most parts of the country. An important nutrition-oriented programme, the National Nutrition Mission, was launched in early 2018. Schools had mid-day meal schemes. The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) continues. Despite all this, the health of India’s children has deteriorated. There are many other factors that influence it, like maternal health, education and awareness, women’s position in the family and society, the number of children in the family and other factors. The distinction between food and nutrition is also important. The need to serve a balanced and nutritious diet is not always kept in mind even when food is delivered under government schemes. The decision to drop eggs from mid-day meals is an example. The concern over the deterioration of children’s health becomes even more serious when it is noted that the survey is yet to cover states like Uttar Pradesh and that it shows how bad the situation was before the pandemic. The situation has clearly worsened since then. Inequalities have widened and the weakest sections of society like women and children have been hit the most. All social welfare schemes of governments and private initiatives have flagged and the impact on children and their health can be imagined. Malnutrition debilitates children for their entire life. It is the nation’s responsibility to reverse the negative trend.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/india-s-stunted-wasted-years-930071.html

The youths, identified as Ramshad and Adil, had earlier posted a video in which they maintained that the allegation of sexual assault was baseless. They said that they only enquired with a lady accompanying the actress about the films she acted and since the lady replied in an unfriendly manner, they did not talk further.  They also apologised for any unintentional adverse behaviour from their side.  The actress said in a social media post on Thursday that one guy groped and stalked her at a hypermarket at the mall. Subsequently, the police verified CCTV footage and found the allegations prima facie true and launched a probe. The images of the two were also published. The actress said in a viral social media post that "Being a woman has been very tiring, to be on guard every minute as you step out of your house. To watch my clothes when I bend and turn. To guard my chest with my arms in a crowd… And on the days I’m home, I worry about my mother, my sister, my friends who have to do the same things. It is all because of these sick men. You take away our safety. You take away our comfort and the joy of our womanhood. I despise you,” the actor wrote.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/two-held-for-sexual-assault-on-actress-in-mall-at-kochi-929671.html

The total project cost is Rs 200 crore of which the World Bank will fund Rs 140 crore. The state government will spend Rs 60 crore. The state Cabinet, at its meeting here last week, cleared the project to be implemented in the four Rayalaseema districts of Anantapuramu, Chittoor, Kadapa and Kurnool besides Prakasam in south coastal AP. The tribal belt in Visakhapatnam district will also be covered under the project. The REWARD project will be implemented in Karnataka and Odisha apart from AP, with the World Bank lending a sum of USD 178 million for the three states. The total project cost in the three states is estimated to be USD 350 million. Efficient water management, soil fertility improvement, adoption of standard agricultural practices and enhancement of cultivation are some of the salient features of the proposed project. Protection of water resources in areas of scarcity and optimum utilisation of water using proper management techniques will be the key features of the project. Watersheds will be developed in a scientific manner using remote sensing and GIS technology, which will benefit the farmers, according to Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Commissioner M Girija Shankar. The project would be implemented on a convergence mode involving different departments and also the MGNREGP, he said. AP Space Applications Centre, Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University, IIT-Tirupati and the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning would partner with the state government in implementing the project, he said. The Commissioner said land resources index (LRI), hydrological assessment and groundwater management database pertaining to two lakh hectares in the selected districts would be created as part of the REWARD project. "We will create 14 model watersheds for 50,000 hectares of land on a pilot basis and also 52 micro watersheds based on LRI and hydrological data. We will distribute LRI cards and weather-based agricultural advisories to one lakh small farmers," Girija Shankar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-govt-to-launch-watershed-projects-in-five-districts-929782.html

These projects are for a total length of 765.66 km of highways. "Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated and laid the foundation of 14 NH projects in Telangana today through virtual mode. These projects include 765.663 km long roads worth Rs 13,169 crore," Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement. The virtual event was attended by Union Ministers G Kishan Reddy and VK Singh besides Telangana Minister for Roads & Buildings, Legislative Affairs and Housing Vemula Prashanth Reddy, Speaker of Teleangana Assembly Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, MPS and MLAs, in addition to senior officers from the Centre and the State. Speaking on the occasion, Gadkari informed that a total of 59 road works with approved length of 1,918 km and a cost of Rs 17,617 crore have been sanctioned in Telangana in the last six years. Of this, 1,782 km length has already been sanctioned with a cost of 15,689 crore. He said, almost all of the 33 districts in the State have connectivity with National Highways. The remaining district Peddapally will also be connected to the network soon. The minister said, there has been a phenomenal growth of 55.71 per cent NH length in last six years in the state. Nearly 1400 km NH length has been added during this period in the state, he said. Gadkari informed that while construction of 841 km roads worth Rs 4,793 crore has been completed since 2014-15 in Telangana, work is going on for construction of another 809 km at a cost of Rs 13,012 crore. He added that during the current financial year, 13 major projects costing Rs. 8,957 crore of length 328 km are proposed to be awarded in the State. Three major projects for 192 km worth Rs 2,339 crore are under bidding, he said. Another 21 NH works with total length of 1422 km and total cost of Rs 27,116 crore are under various stages of DPR (detailed project report) preparation. These works are likely to be completed by FY 2024-25. The minister said that in line with the Prime Minister’s vision for a New India, development of world-class transport infrastructure has been prioritized, through initiatives such as the Bharatmala Pariyojana, India’s largest ever infrastructure development programme. The Pariyojana was conceptualized through a scientific study of freight traffic movement between key origin-destination pairs to enable efficient freight and passenger movement. Projects with length 1,730 km have been identified for development under Bharatmala Pariyojana in the state of Telangana. Out of these 14 projects, 9 projects with length 423 km have already been awarded at a cost of Rs 7,400 crore. Development of greenfield and access-controlled corridor has also been planned in Telangana to ease-out traffic on existing corridors, reduce travel time and costs and also provide a boost to the economy, he said. These include Surat, Ahmadnagar, Solapur, Kurnool, Chennai (75 km length in Telangana), Suryapet - Khammam - Devarapalle (164 km length in Telangana) and Indore - Hyderabad (136 km length in Telangana). While development of these corridors will ease the traffic on existing routes, it will also lead to improved savings, due to reduced travel time and fuel consumption thereby also reducing the carbon footprint, the statement said. Development of multiple wayside amenities are also being planned across the corridors to improve rider comfort. The corridors have been planned as fully access controlled leading to enhanced rider mobility and safety. Development of these corridors would also generate both white-collar and blue-collar jobs thereby also providing the much-needed boost to the economy, it added. Gadkari also called upon the State to take up diversification of agriculture into economic productivity. He said the country is already over-producing sugar and rice, and sufficient stock are available with the government. The surplus may be converted to ethanol, which can be used as an alternative fuel for vehicles. He said, this will not only improve farmers' income, but will also be an indigenous source of fuels for the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gadkari-inaugurates-lays-foundation-stone-for-over-rs-13000-crore-highway-projects-in-telangana-929871.html

Unveiling his party's seven-point "Governance and Economic Agenda", he also said people below the poverty line would be taken to "prosperity line". "Homemakers will get their due recognition through payment for their work at home which hitherto has been unrecognised and unmonetised, thus raising the dignity of our womenfolk," the agenda said. It was released by Haasan in the presence of former IAS officer Santhosh Babu, who recently joined the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), in this temple town, close to Chennai. On his campaign trail in northern Tamil Nadu for the second day on Monday, the 66-year old MNM founder leader asserted that remittance to women at home was possible. "It is definitely possible," he said, when reporters asked him about the assurance for 'payment' to the womenfolk in the agenda, virtually a mini manifesto of the party. By avoiding corruption, the state could be made prosperous, he added. To a question, Haasan ruled out joining hands with the Dravidian majors -- the ruling AIADMK and the DMK. Though the assembly elections were expected during April-May, the MNM, the AIADMK and DMK have already launched their campaign to woo the electorate. The MNM said, if voted to power, its government would take steps to realise revolutionary poet Bharati's dream of women empowerment through education, employment and opportunities towards entrepreneurship. "Women will break through established glass ceilings by the equal opportunities provided to them by our MNM government." Promising what the party called 'online homes,' the agenda said its government would provide a computer along with high speed internet (100 Mbps and above) through optical fibre cable to each and every home, as a common property resource by implementing the BharatNet and TamilNet projects. The plan could bring far-reaching transformation and the "internet will be declared as a basic human right," the party added. Outlining 'Green plus revolution,' the party said farmers would be transformed to agriculture entrepreneurs. It assured world class infrastructural amenities like cold chain from the level of villages, investments for value added farming and giving a fillip to organic farming as part of its agenda. MNM would take people below the poverty line to the 'prosperity line', the document said. Promising a 'green channel' government, MNM said all certificates and documents would be issued without the citizen applying for it and these shall be delivered to people on their smartphone. A new law, the Right to Government Services Act and predictive governance shall be part and parcel of its green channel government. "All services to citizens, including grievance redressal, shall be delivered in a time bound manner." Paperless government offices, a new department of digital governance, promotion of green industries, technologies and providing urban opportunities in rural areas were among the other aspects of the agenda. Haasan visited Dravidian icon and late Chief Minister C N Annadurai's memorial and interacted with weavers in this town, known for its unique and popular Kancheepuram silk sarees. The MNM, launched in February, 2018, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and garnered 3.77 per cent votes is seeking to offer an alternative to the Dravidian majors in the state polls, the first after the demise of DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi and AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-promises-payment-to-women-for-their-work-at-home-929912.html

With many witnesses passing away and many turning hostile, it was the witness statement of a small-time robber that became crucial in the case. The nun accused in the case even allegedly undergoing hymenorrhaphy to scuttle the investigation. The relentless fight of human rights activist Jomon Puthenpurackal was also instrumental in taking forward the case. 21-year-old Sister Abhaya was found dead in the well of the Pius X convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992. Knanaya Catholic priest Thomas M Kottoor, who is the first accused, and Sister Sephy, who is the third accused, are facing trial. Second accused father Jose Poothrikkayil was discharged earlier and CBI would be filing an appeal against it. Sister Abhaya was allegedly murdered after she witnessed the illicit affairs of the accused. Abhaya's parents died a few years ago. Investigation teams of the Kerala Police initially concluded that Sister Abhaya died by suicide. Though the CBI took over the probe in 1994 found that it was murder, the initial investigation teams could not trace the accused and tried to close the investigation at least three times. But the court insisted on a further probe. The present CBI team took over the probe about 15 years ago. Catholic priests and a nun were even subjected to a narco analysis test to unearth the facts. They were arrested in November 2008. The CBI filed a charge sheet in July 2009. CBI's finding was that Abhaya happened to witness the accused in a compromising position in the wee hours of the day she was found dead. Subsequently, she was murdered by being hit by an axe and her body was dumped in the well of the convent. Sephy has even allegedly undergone hymenorrhaphy as part of efforts to scuttle the probe. While many key accused in the case died, a small-time robber Raju alias 'Adayka' Raju stated before the court that he witnessed two priests in the convent in the early hours of the day Abhaya was found dead. Raju entered the convent premises with the purpose of robbery. Jomon said that though there were 133 prosecution witnesses in the case initially, only 49 could be examined before the court as many died and several were too aged as the case was prolonged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/abhaya-murder-case-verdict-to-come-after-nearly-three-decades-929930.html

Without collecting any charges from the landowners, the state is spending about Rs 1,000 crore on the survey for which it has roped in the Survey of India. Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister said that such an exercise has been taken up after a century. “This is a historic event as the survey will put checks to land grabbing and ease the registration, sale-resale, transfer and other transactions which will hereafter be executed at the village secretariat level. A clear deed will be provided to the rightful owner after the survey and a social audit,” Reddy said while inaugurating the pilot project at Jaggayyapeta on his birthday. The survey avoids prolonged litigation, land grabbers created disputes and manipulation of land records. Such records are presently involving four different departments. The survey will be in three phases in a fool-proof manner, for which over 16,000 surveyors are employed. These surveyors are trained to use advanced technology like continuous operating reference stations (CORs) connected to GPS; drones and rovers. The survey will ensure transparency, by providing a Unique Identity Number to the lands and award a permanent property title with an assurance from the state government. In addition to this, a revenue village map, land parcel map will be provided and the land piece is secured by placing boundary stones. About 4,500 survey teams will be involved in the three-phased project, first of which is from December 2020- July 2021, the second phase between October 2021 to April 2022 and the third between July 2022 and January 2023. The process covering 17,600 revenue villages should be completed by August 2023, the Chief Minister said. “In case the landowner faces any difficulty after securing the land title, the government shall compensate the owner. Our survey will be a role model for other states,” Reddy said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cm-jagan-launches-pilot-of-land-survey-in-andhra-pradesh-to-provide-conclusive-title-deeds-to-owners-930002.html

The state government on Monday, after examining the matter in detail, decided to allow with immediate effectthe re-opening of bars, beer and wine parlours, airport lounge bars and toddy shops, among others, with adherence to Covid- 19 protocol. These should be re-opened with the conditions prescribed under the Foreign LiquorRules and safety precautions as per Covid-19 guidelines, an order by state Chief Secretary Dr Vishwas Mehta said. Permission has also been granted for the functioning of toddy shops as per the provisions in the Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal Rules. The outlets of the state Beverages Corporations and Consumerfedwould also function from 10 am to 9 pm. The government had decided to shut all the liquor shops since March 24 after the Union Home Ministryissued guidelines for the lockdown in view of the pandemic. After Unlock 3 guidelines came into force, the government had allowed the sale of liquor as a takeaway from special retail outlets following the virtual queue system. It has also said licenced clubs to sell liquor and food to their members as a parcel with strict restrictions on the number of persons. Excise Commissioner had recently recommended re-opening of bars in view of the fact that various states had given permission for opening of hotels with bars as per the guidelines of the Union Home Ministry. Apart from 598 hotels with bars and 357 beer and wine parlours, there are 301 government-run liquor outlets in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-bars-wine-parlours-toddy-shops-to-reopen-930054.html
21-12-2020||State||Soliga tribals have a sweet deal for consumers: Pure honey||For several years, the Soliga community residing in K Gudi, BR Hills, used to wade deep into the dense forests and return with the best honey. But lack of marketing skills meant that the product was sold at throwaway prices to traders who came all the way from Tamil Nadu’s Salem and hauled away much of the 11 tonnes of honey collected annually. Now, that is changing. Spurred by the efforts of two forest officers and recent reports about adulterated honey, the tribal community is making amends. The local Large Area Multipurpose Society (LAMP), a cooperative society consisting of over 1,200 members from the Soliga community, has decided to introduce the honey extracted from the forests in the market.  “We have found out that the honey bought from us at Rs 250 per kg is sold for Rs 600 to Rs 700 per kg in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We have a very good product and we hope that the people will recognise its speciality,” Shivanna Muttegowda, vice president of the LAMP society, told DH. Forest officials told DH that the forest produce of Soligas are of the best quality but they lack marketing. To overcome this handicap, officials have decided to train the community by conducting workshops at their colonies (‘podu’) as well as for those who have settled outside the BRT Sanctuary. Santosh Kumar, Director of Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve Sanctuary, has assured help from the department. Soligas, he said, were the first line of defence when it comes to protection of forests and the department will continue to help them. Sandeep Suryavamshi, assistant conservator of forests, who is also the president of the LAMP society, said there were three main areas of focus. He said improving methods of harvesting and helping Soligas to identify the mature honey was the first step. The mature honey, with less water content and stronger anti-bacterial effects, therefore attracts good price in the market. “Scientific training will help them identify the matured honey. The second focus is on processing where we can bring separate recognition for honey with pollen content. The process will also generate employment for more people from the tribal community. In the last stage, branding exercise will emphasise the speciality of the product,” he said. Over the last few years, products from the Soliga community, including coffee and spices, have earned much praise. Though efforts were made back in 2014 to market the honey extracted in hills the tribal community lost motivation.  Officials said the recent news of big brands selling adulterated products has opened up space for marketing the honey produced by the LAMP society.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/soliga-tribals-have-a-sweet-deal-for-consumers-pure-honey-929672.html

In the seven days, the state registered 8,059 cases, which is 345 cases less than that registered the week before. The low numbers are comparable to those being recorded in late June, just after the state recorded its first surge in cases. The numbers come even as the state has attempted a slight increase in testing capacities. In the last seven-day period, 6.92 lakh tests were officially conducted, which is about 50,000 more tests than the previous one-week period. However, four weeks ago, a higher number of 7.86 lakhs tests were carried out, which had yielded more confirmed cases (10,496). On Sunday, 1,194 cases were registered in Karnataka, out of which, 55% (or 659 cases) were found in Bengaluru Urban. The next highest numbers were found in Mysuru district 75, followed by Tumkuru district 39, Bengaluru Rural 36, Mandya 34 and Dakshina Kannada 33.  Just five new deaths were revealed on Sunday.

Some APMC markets were shut while protests took place elsewhere against the hike in the fee from 0.35 per cent to one per cent of the transaction value, President of APMC Committee, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ramesh Chandra Lahoti said. Business at several APMCs, including in the city, was partially hit while in some other places such as Hubbali, the strike evoked total response, he told PTI. According to him, the hike in the fees to one per cent during the coronavirus time when the businesses have crashed badly will hurt the interest of businessmen, labourers as well as the farmers. This was a token agitation and on December 23 traders, labourers and farmers will together stage a protest across the state if the government did not withdraw the hike in the market fee, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/traders-protest-hike-in-ampc-market-fee-in-karnataka-929843.html

The senior Congress leader claimed that online classes were not helping students as they were being conducted at the whims and fancies of teachers. "That's why I advised the government to promote school students this year because of the prevailing Covid-19 situation," the leader of opposition in the legislative assembly told reporters. Siddaramaiah said he had written three letters to the government highlighting the problems faced by the students but the latter did not pay heed to them. Reiterating his allegation of the government being 'hand in glove' with the private institutions and wanting to "trouble" the students, he recalled protests staged by parents in the city against various education institutions. Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets on Sunday charged that the government was aiding the private schools instead of helping the parents and their wards. His statement had come on the day when the parents staged a demonstration in the city against the "exorbitant" fees charged by certain private schools. Following his statement, Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar on Monday took to Twitter to hit out at him. "Day before yesterday the leader of the opposition spoke an utter lie of 'Kodavas eat beef' and then regretted it. Today he spoke another big lie that I am (education minister) hand in glove with the private education institutions. May he get the inspiration to speak truth", the Minister said. Kumar was referring to Siddaramaiah's recent statement -- in the context of the anti-cow slaughter bill passed in the Assembly -- that Kodavas eat beef to suggest that minorities are not the only ones who eat beef as the BJP projects. As the statement triggered a backlash from Kodavas, the former Chief Minister regretted his remarks saying they were misinterpreted by the media. "I never intended to say that Kodavas eat beef".||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/former-cm-siddaramaiah-appeals-to-karnataka-govt-to-promote-school-students-929897.html

Several Kodava organisations held protests in front of the Kodagu district Deputy Commissioner's office today in protest against Siddaramaiah's remarks. "I had not said like that. I had said food habits vary from people to people and they eat what they like.I have already tweeted and clarified that I did not say like that. I have a lot of respect for Kodava people and their culture, and if my statements have in any way hurt them, I express my regret," Siddaramaiah told reporters here. Alleging BJP's role behind protests against him, the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly said "BJP people don't have any other work, they look for emotive issues." According to reports, some of the protesters accused Siddaramaiah of having hurt the feelings of the Kodava community and demanded that he apologise openly. Some have even threatened to file a complaint against him for hurting the sentiments of the community. Earlier on Saturday, Siddaramaiah through a series of tweets,tried to clarify his stand on the issue. "My statement about beef and Kodava culture has been misinterpreted by the media.I regret if that has hurt the sentiments of Kodavas. I am aware of Kodava culture and I greatly respect it." "We have various food traditions and habits.Be it goat or sheep or chicken or pork or beef.I meant that it is wrong to link religion and food habits. I never intended to say that Kodavas eat beef. I have great respect for their culture," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/siddaramaiah-expresses-regret-over-remarks-on-beef-and-kodavas-929928.html

21-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Poor demand: Karnataka govt deletes 40,000 toilets from target list||Karnataka has slashed its toilets target by over 40,000 after authorities found that there was no demand wherever they were initially proposed to be constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission. For 2020-21, Karnataka set a target of building 4.76 lakh toilets for households that were left out. Now, 41,596 toilets have been deleted from the target, according to official data.  Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the government provides assistance of Rs 12,000 (Rs 15,000 for SC) for a household to construct a toilet.  The deletion of over 40,000 toilets came even as authorities were struggling to meet the construction target.  “We get proposals for toilets that get included in the target. But, on the field, we find that there won’t be demand,” Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Principal Secretary L K Atheeq said. “Other reasons include lack of space to build the toilet, duplication of beneficiaries and so on,” he added.  Of the 4.76 lakh targeted toilets, construction has been completed or is in progress for 4.18 lakh toilets. That left 58,064 toilets that authorities had to complete within December 30, requiring 5,806 toilets to be taken up every day. Now that 41,596 toilets have been deleted, the run rate has come down.  “We are not readily agreeing for deletion,” Atheeq said. “The panchayat development officer (PDO) has to give it in writing before deletion.”  In November 2018, rural Karnataka was declared open-defecation free (ODF) after 45.42 lakh toilets were constructed for as many households that had no access to toilets. The toilets being constructed now are for those left out of the 2012 baseline survey (LOB) and those categorised under no one left behind (NOLB).   According to data, the highest toilets target is in Kalaburagi at 62,188, followed by Vijayapura (38,627) and Ballari (31,215) - all in north Karnataka.  Apparently, the need for beneficiaries to invest money from their own pockets is slowing down the rate of toilet construction. “A toilet requires Rs 25,000-40,000,” an official pointed out.  The only solace is that at least 75% of the toilets constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission are being used, according to the official. “People are finding it increasingly difficult to defecate in the open.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/poor-demand-karnataka-govt-deletes-40000-toilets-from-target-list-930047.html
21-12-2020||West||Maharashtra Gram Panchayat polls to be crucial for MVA, BJP||The mid-January Gram Panchayat polls in Maharashtra will be a sort of litmus test for both -- the 'Trimurti' alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi and the opposition BJP. These polls come close on the heels of elections to six seats of the Maharashtra Legislative Council, in which the MVA won four seats, BJP and Independent, one each. The polls are very significant as 14,234 Gram Panchayats – which is nearly 50 per cent of the total 27,920 Gram Panchayats – would go to elections on January 15. The nominations for the polls will begin on Wednesday, however, the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA had not taken any formal call for an overall alliance to counter the BJP. As of now, the Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar-led NCP, and the Congress have left it for their local units to decide on tie-ups. In the Gram Panchayats – which is the grass-roots level political set-up – the political equations and dynamics are different. Symbols of registered political parties are not used in these elections and candidates and groups form panels and fight the elections. But they get the support of the mainstream political parties – and are keenly contested – and the results reflect the party’s following and penetration at the grass-roots level. Thackeray, who is the Shiv Sena President, is in touch with state NCP President and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil and state Congress President and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat. Within the MVA, there is a strong feeling that there should be a united fight against the BJP in the Gram Panchayat polls as they are encouraged with the response in the Maharashtra Legislative Council polls, where BJP could not win even the traditional Nagpur division graduates’ constituency that had been the stronghold of Jana Sangh and BJP. In fact, Leader of Opposition and ex-Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s father late Gangadhar Fadnavis, and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari had represented the seat. The gram panchayat elections will be held just a year before the crucial 2022 municipal corporation polls in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik and Nagpur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-gram-panchayat-polls-to-be-crucial-for-mva-bjp-929768.html

The temple is located around 60 km off downtown Mumbai and is one of the oldest Shiva temples on the coastal Konkan coast. The Maharashtra government has earmarked Rs 43 crore for the project. “Several years ago, I visited the temple and saw the lack of facilities. It is time that facilities are augmented,” Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday. The project is being spearheaded by Thackeray’s close aide and state’s Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde and his son Dr Shrikant Shinde, who is a Shiv Sena MP from Kalyan. “I am regularly reviewing the status of the project,” Dr Shinde said on Monday. The temple comes under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). “The temple is of immense heritage value and a lot of people go there to see it and pray before Lord Shiva....trekkers, nature lovers, heritage enthusiasts, and experts too regularly visit the temple premises and the surroundings,” said heritage enthusiast MP Joshi, who stays in the Ambarnath-Badlapur suburbs. The temple’s exterior and interior are adorned with exquisitely carved images of Hindu architecture, idols and animal decorations. Built in the 11th century, the Shiv Mandir of Ambarnath is also known as Ambreshwar Shiva Temple and known locally as 'Puratana Shivalaya'. It is located off the Waldhuni River and is around 2 km off the Ambarnath suburban railway station of the Central Railway. It is in ‘bhumija’ form, and if completed, would have been close in form to the Udayesvara Temple, also known as Neelkantheshwara Temple, in Udaipur, Madhya Pradesh, and the Gondeshwar Temple at Sinnar. The Ambarnath Shiva Temple, built in the classical style by the Shilahara king Chittaraja, was later renovated by his son Mumunni around 1060 AD. The Shilahara kings started out as vassals of the Rashtrakutas in the Konkan region, with the Chalukya kingdom to the south. The Shiva temple at Ambernath is located just a few miles away from the ancient trade route that leads right up to the Deccan plateau. As far as the augmentation of facilities is concerned, Rs 20 lakh would be spent in Phase I while the rest Rs 23 lakh will be spent in Phase II. The revamp would see a new amphitheatre, parking space, children’s parking area, garden and bus stop. The Waldhuni river bank would also see a beautification.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/1000-year-old-shiva-temple-in-thane-to-get-a-facelift-929807.html

Some residents of Jamsar village in Jawhar taluka of Maharashtra's Palghar district were digging a lake on Friday when they found the sculptures buried underground, Jawhar tehsildar (revenue officer) Santosh Shinde said.

Some villagers claimed such idols have never been found in the area earlier. The village has three lakes full of water, and their desilting and excavation may lead to finding of more such idols, they said. Jawhar, a city and a municipal council in Palghar, is an erstwhile princely state located in the Western Ghats. The tribal-dominated area is famous for its Warli paintings.

It has incidence of 5-10 new cases every 100,000 person-years. Up to 80 per cent of them would eventually rupture and has at best 10-20 per cent five-year event-free survival. Being a male, an ex-smoker, and hypertensive were his risk factor as no one in the family had this history. He has recently admitted in Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital’s emergency department in tremendous pain with unstable hemodynamics. Reliance foundation took charge of his medical care and assured the family of all possible assistance to take him through this arduous journey.  Because of the tortuosity of the aorta, the size of the aneurysm and his young age, open surgery was preferred than endovascular stenting. Thoracoabdominal aneurysm also has a very high incidence of mortality and requires tremendous skill to operate. Incidence of postoperative mortality too is high. A team of advanced cardiac surgery and gastroenterology doctors headed by Dr Anvay Mulay operated tenaciously on him for a gruelling 14 hours surgery and repaired his aneurysm. His subsequent stay in hospital remained uneventful and was discharged on December 16 and back with his family and one and a half-year-old son.  He thanked the entire team at RFH for the care and empathy shown towards him. On the day of discharge, Ismail said, "For two years, I couldn't work because of my ailment. I am finally free of it and wanting to get back to normal life. This wouldn't have been possible without Dr Mulay and team."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/man-suffering-from-rare-medical-disorder-saved-after-14-hour-surgery-in-mumbai-hospital-929834.html

Sawant, who heads the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in the state, also said that he is committed to ensuring that the 30 per cent minority population in Goa are not deprived of beef, in the midst of the crisis which has been precipitated by the recent passing of the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill (2020) in the neighbouring state, which is the prime supplier of red meat in Goa. "At present, there is an issue because Karnataka has suddenly banned beef. Karnataka was a major source for sourcing live animals and (slaughtered) beef, along with Maharashtra. I have given directions to the state Director of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services. He is sourcing for live animals and beef meat from other states," Sawant said. Beef is a routinely consumed red meat in Goa and is served in restaurants in the coastal fringes of the state, which are frequented by nearly eight million tourists every year.More than 25 tons of beef is consumed in Goa every day, most of which has been imported from Karnataka's Belagavi district. The state's only legal facility for animal slaughter, the Goa Meat Complex has been virtually non-functional for several months. The non-availability of beef, especially ahead of Christmas and the festive season when demand for the red meat peaks, has created anxiety among Goa's Christians who account for around 26 per cent of the state's population. Along with Muslims, the minority communities account for more than 30 per cent of Goa's population. Sawant also said, that while he worships the cow as 'gau mata', as Chief Minister it was his duty to look after the welfare of minority communities for whom beef is a staple diet. "I also worship gau mata. I offer puja to gau-mata. But we have 30 per cent minority persons in our state. It is my duty to look after them too," the Chief Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/karnataka-beef-ban-goa-cm-admits-to-red-meat-crisis-says-efforts-on-to-import-from-other-states-929984.html

Gujarat is one of the few states that doesn't live telecast the Assembly sessions or even keeps any record in public domain. The PIL has highlighted that although the assembly's website purports to provide information on the debates, the "database has not been updated since 2002." A division bench of justices J B Pardiwala and Ilesh J Vora issued notice to Gujarat Legislative Assembly Secretariat on the PIL filed by Neeta Hardikar and Siddarth Pathak. Hardikar is based out of Devgadh Baria in Dahod district where she works on tribal health, rights and local self-governance district while Pathak is a retired professor of Saurashtra University at Rajkot where he taught ecology and Environmental Science and researched on environmental issues. The PIL seeks disclose on Assembly's website information relating to the proceedings, live and old telecast and transcripts, the papers to be laid, Private Member’s Business, Zero-hour, list of question and their answers, text of debates; text of legislations (including subordinate legislations) as introduced, passed, pending, assented, lapsed, withdrawn and negatived by the Assembly; Information on the committees of the Assembly (House Committees) summary of their work and reports prepared by them; the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records, held by it or under its control or used by the assembly for discharging its functions, and copy of documents that are held by it or under its control; which at present is not disclosed proactively on the website of Gujarat Legislative Assembly." The petitioners have argued that they have filed the PIL "in the spirit of democracy, transparency, accountability, constitutional guarantee for availability of information and the mandate under the Right to Information Act for the citizens of India and residents of Gujarat." Invoking Right to Information Act, 2005, the petition says that the act requires the public authority to disclose details of procedure followed in the decision making process, channels of supervision and accountability, norms set by it for the discharge of its functions, the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records, among others. It says that unavailability of such information "violates democratic and constitutional rights of the people of Gujarat to view and understand the work undertaken by their elected representatives. Further such non-disclosure also violates statutory obligation cast upon the respondent under Right to Information Act." It also cites other state assemblies like  Kerala, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Bihar which provide information related to the house as required under RTI act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-hc-issues-notice-to-state-on-pil-to-bring-assembly-database-in-public-domain-930007.html

He also expressed apprehension that flights coming from some other countries might also be cancelled for a certain period. Earlier in the day, the Civil Aviation Ministry said that all flights connecting the UK and India will remain suspended from Wednesday till December 31 in view of the emergence of a mutated variant of the coronavirus there. "The cancellation of flights coming from the UK will definitely have an impact on Goa's tourism, which is dependent for its revival on international tourists, mainly those coming from the UK and Russia," the chief minister told reporters. He said some countries were seeing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. "In such scenario, we will also have to take precautions," Sawant said even as he ruled out the imposition of night curfew in the coastal state. "There are no such guidelines on a night curfew from the Ministry of Home Affairs," he said. Appealing Goans to be vigilant and get themselves tested for Covid-19 if symptoms warrant them, the CM said the fatalities generally occur due to people delaying seeking treatment. "People don't undergo (Covid-19) tests on time after onset of symptoms. People who are infected continue to remain at home for 8-10 days. If patients receive treatment at a primary stage, than they can recover from the infection," he added. Sawant said the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the upcoming festive season was in place in Goa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/cancellation-of-flights-from-uk-will-impact-goa-tourism-says-chief-minister-pramod-sawant-930059.html
