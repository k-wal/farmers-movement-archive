Russia announced that it will open a military base on the Red Sea coast in Sudan. The deal for the base is for 25 years and the Russian navy is expected to deploy four warships and 300 troops at the base. While Russia is stepping up its presence in the Western Indian Ocean, the United States announced that it will withdraw its 700 troops from Somalia. The troop withdrawal is ordered by the outgoing President Donald Trump and is likely to adversely affect the effectiveness of the counter-terror operations in Somalia. As the geopolitics in and around the Western Indian Ocean is in a state of flux; both of these developments warrant greater scrutiny. Russia has long been interested in acquiring a foothold in the Indian Ocean region and access to its warmer ports. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which brought Soviet power within the striking distance of the Persian Gulf, was considered as a step towards that strategic objective. During the Cold War, the Soviet navy had managed to gain access to a network of bases in the Indian Ocean including those in the Red Sea due to the friendly regimes in countries like Ethiopia, Yemen and Somalia (such as the port of Berbera).  In the post-Cold War years, the primary strategic focus of Russia has been on its periphery in Asia as well as in Europe and it no longer possessed the ability and willingness to hold bases in the Indian Ocean region. However, since the successful intervention in Syria in 2015, Russia has been expanding its influence in the Western Indian Ocean and the base in Sudan is a major step in this strategy. Apart from Sudan, the Russian navy already possesses a base in Syria on the Mediterranean coast. These two bases will allow Russia to project its influence in Africa, the Middle East and the Western Indian Ocean. It will also enable Russia to monitor international maritime traffic, especially energy trade, passing through the Red Sea.  In 2019, Russia had held military exercises with the navies of China, South Africa and Iran in the Western Indian Ocean. Moreover, Russia had organised the first Russia-Africa summit last year and Russian fighter jets had paid a visit to South Africa. Besides, Russian mercenaries are also spotted in gas-rich, terror-affected Mozambique. Sudan is a key state in the evolving geopolitics of the Red Sea and North-Central Africa and it is well-known that since 2017, Russia has been present in Sudan’s resource-rich neighbour, the Central African Republic, fighting insurgents. All of these developments point towards greater Russian activity in the Western Indian Ocean and Africa.  Geopolitical contest Interestingly, while the Russian (and Chinese) presence is growing in the Western Indian Ocean, American withdrawal from Somalia is likely to shrink Western military presence in this part of the world. Somalia has been a controversial topic in the American domestic politics since the disastrous military intervention in 1992-93. The incident, known as the ‘Black Hawk Down’, in which its 18 soldiers were killed in Somalia, has influenced American decision-making towards Somalia. However the US re-established presence in Eastern Africa, including in Somalia, in the wake of the ‘Global War on Terror’ and stepped up its military-intelligence efforts to eliminate terrorists from the country. Somalia is crucial in the geopolitics of the Western Indian Ocean as the double threat of terrorism and maritime piracy radiate from this unstable country. US presence in Somalia was primarily focused to fight terrorism but in the context of seriousness of the threat of maritime piracy, the US navy has been operating an international naval coalition around Somalia to deter piracy. In the context of the US military withdrawal from Somalia, its base in Djibouti assumes greater strategic significance.  The Western Indian Ocean is strategically important not just owing to the energy and resource potential of the region but also because of the ongoing geopolitical contest. Western Indian Ocean is part of the Indo-Pacific region and major global powers have demonstrated interest in this region. Military forces of France, China, Japan, Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain and South Korea enjoy some sort of permanent or semi-permanent presence in the Western Indian Ocean. Russia has now joined these powers. Indian Navy is a major player in this region as well.  Therefore, the African coastline and littoral states between the Suez Canal and South Africa are assuming growing geopolitical weight. They will be in a position to leverage their location as well as resource potential and extract maximum benefits from the interested players. Russia’s upcoming military base in Sudan and American withdrawal from Somalia indicates the fluidity of the geopolitical competition in this region. Following China and Russia, India would do well to acquire permanent military facilities in this part of the world.       (Sankalp Gurjar is a Research Fellow with the Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi.

09-12-2020||Comment||More reforms needed in agriculture, not less||The recent farm laws passed by Parliament have generated a furore and concern amongst farmers. Good economic reasoning will point out that they are much needed reforms. The farmers involved in the protest are majorly concerned about the removal of Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism and the sentiment of being ‘sold to corporates’ is being echoed by farmers and the commentariat.  However, the reforms, in more ways than one, give greater economic freedom and agency to farmers, which will eventually result in greater efficiency and  prosperity. While many parties, ranging from farmers’ unions to scholars, have voiced their opposition to the laws and support to the farmers, this piece emphasises that the two positions are not antagonistic – agricultural reforms increase farmer’s welfare. The case against MSP The MSP system is a relic of an era where India had perpetual food shortages and thus the government had to ensure quantity and give price guarantees in order to incentivise farmers. This was largely carried out through the state run agricultural mandis. Though the new laws do not mention MSP explicitly, the protesting farmers fear that the removal of the mandis will also result in the disappearance of MSP.  It is no wonder that states that have disproportionately benefited from the MSP regime, such as Punjab and Haryana, are in the forefront of the protests. Yet, what is surprising is that even in these states, awareness of MSP is limited. Only 51 per cent of the farmers in Punjab and 31 percent in Haryana were aware of the existence of MSP as per NSSO data from 2013.  The countrywide statistic is dismal – 71 per cent and 79 per cent of farmers were not aware of MSP for paddy and wheat respectively. It is much higher for other crops. Another telling statistic is that only six per cent of farmers in India take advantage of MSP, according to a Union government committee report. Therefore, the effect of the existence or disappearance of MSP is likely to be limited.   Second, MSP has led to excessive stocking of wheat and paddy, which has exceeded buffer norms by around 2.5 times. This  automatically translates into higher economic cost to the Food Corporation of India and thus, a higher debt burden which has crossed Rs. 3 lakh crore (the railway budget itself is around Rs. 1.7 lakh crore). As mentioned, MSP was established when the agri management context was that of shortages. Now that we are a grain-surplus economy, we need to transit toward a market-driven price mechanism, which can either prevent such surpluses by allocating resources better or absorb them when they occur. Lastly, and most importantly, MSP distorts price realisation by setting a floor price. Greater control of prices by the government, especially in times of surpluses is unwarranted. By removing barriers in the functioning of the market especially with regards to middlemen in the mandis, farmers gain by better competition between buyers.  Why more reforms are needed  While the current set of reforms are proving to be difficult politically, this article argues that this is just a start and more needs to be done, especially in the domain of land reforms. Land holdings in India are small and fragmented, which leads to the dismal productivity of agricultural labour.   Over the years, the average land holding size in India has been falling and stood at  1.08 hectares in 2015-16, down by 8 per cent from the 9th Agricultural Census (2010-11). In addition, the share of small and marginal land holdings in the country stand at 86.21 per cent of the total operational holding while the share of medium and large operational holdings has decreased in the recent years. Larger landholdings can lead to economies of scale and higher productivity. Consider a situation where land remains fragmented and two farmers separately employ a tractor to till their land of two hectares each. However, since the tractor has the capacity to till both the lands with negligible marginal cost, there is loss of efficiency and unnecessary additional capital costs. It is a well-known fact that agriculture contributes to about 16 per cent of the GDP while it employs about 43 per cent of the labour force. A broad interpretation of this figure is that additional people employed in agriculture are not contributing much to what is being produced. Inefficiency is inevitable.  Couple this with another statistic. As per NSSO data from 2011-12, Shifting a person from agriculture to a relatively low-skilled job in a sector like construction raises his productivity by over 60 per cent and wages by about 70-80 percent (talk about doubling farmers’ income!). Moving him to manufacturing raises his productivity by 313 percent. All these facts highlight that agriculture has been severely underperforming and there is a need to either make agriculture productive or shift away employment from agriculture. Enhanced role of markets and the private sector will, at least in expectation, begin to consolidate land holdings. Labour productivity will not automatically improve with the removal of the monopoly of APMCs, but should be coupled with land reforms, as undertaken by a few states in the recent months. An ideal land policy will allow less productive farmers to exit the market by selling their land and investing the capital elsewhere and for productive farmers to buy and consolidate their land holdings.  Mitigating spillover effects While the new laws have heralded much needed reforms, there will be some spillover effects that need to be addressed. If these bills, coupled with potential land reforms, lead to migration of the unproductive labour from agriculture, which sectors are going to absorb this surplus labour? Are other sectors prepared for it? How can we ensure upskilling of this migrating labour force? How can these laborers be brought under a social safety net?  These questions beg forward thinking and a massive mobilisation of resources in other productive sectors. A successful example is the High School Movement in the US that helped capture a quarter of the workforce that moved out of agriculture over the course of one working lifetime. Students, in schools itself, were trained for careers in factories and offices. Something radical of that magnitude may be needed.  (Vedant Monger is an economic analyst at Arthashastra Intelligence)  The views expressed above are the author’s own.

09-12-2020||First Edit||Centre must spend to help states||The latest data on the Centre’s gross tax collections in October and the figures for GST collections for both October and November have shown a departure from a series of negative markers of the economy. According to the data released by the Controller General of Accounts, the gross tax collections at the end of October amounted to Rs 8.75 lakh crore, with that month breaking the negative trend of the previous six months. The improvement was broad-based too, with both indirect taxes and personal income taxes showing a higher turnover. It was much less than the collections for the same period last year but there was a positive turn, with the October revenue showing a 17% increase. However, while excise and customs taxes and personal taxes showed a healthy uptick, corporate tax collections continued to decline. The income from disinvestment was disappointing, and non-tax revenue collections were also much less than expected.  The most significant signal of change is the improvement of GST revenue which topped the Rs 1 lakh mark for the second month in a row in November. The partial unlocking of the economy in September was reflected in the GST revenues of October and the transactions in October were reflected in November. The revenues were lower in November, showing that the festival demand may have declined after giving a temporary push to economic activity. Other indicators also agree with this. Auto sales and the manufacturing index had peaked in October. Some continuing demand may have lingered in November and might also be there in December owing to Christmas and New Year, but there are worries that the trend might again turn negative. There are already some indications of this. These signs have emanated from many sectors and areas of the economy. November e-way bills have fallen and that indicates that GST revenues may not sustain. The latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing has fallen to a three-month low. Power and automotive demand has also declined. The inference is that the recent recovery was not robust and may not happen again immediately without a conscious push for it. The biggest cause of uncertainty is the behaviour of the epidemic in the coming weeks. Infections have shown an upward trend in some states and there is again a threat to economic activity in important industrial and business centres. The key to revival in the present scenario is government spending. Though there was an increase in the Central government spending in October, the level of spending for the past seven months is the same as last year. Since all the state governments are badly stressed, it is only the Central government which can spend its way out of the present situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/centre-must-spend-to-help-states-925188.html
09-12-2020||In Perspective||Hampi: Where heritage meets nature||Most people associate Hampi with mesmerising ruins, ancient temples, adrenaline pumping rock climbing or spending a quaint weekend in the picturesque rural setting by the banks of the Tungabhadra river. But only a few are aware about the other side of Hampi - a world hidden from the popular imagination of the tourists.  The dry lands of eastern Karnataka present an unimaginable amalgamation of history, culture and nature. These dry lands form an excellent dry deciduous habitat for a number of dwindling populations of unique wild animals and birds. What is interesting is the fact that the famed ruins of Hampi cover only around one-tenth of the massive landscape, the remaining is wilderness that provides shelter to wildlife.  But the region around Hampi has managed to hold on to a unique ecological bastion. The Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary, which lies just adjacent to the ancient town of Hampi, offers a unique opportunity for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts to witness scrub forest species. Make no mistake, this dry scrub landscape may not be a UNESCO world heritage site like its acclaimed neighbour, but it is surely a gem of a natural habitat for mammals and birds. Leopard, sloth bear, monitor lizard, pangolin, star tortoise, mongoose and otters thrive here. It is a heaven for bird watchers, especially if one is on the lookout for ground dwelling birds like the bush quail, francolin, spurfowl and junglefowl.  If one is extremely lucky, you may also come face to face with the much elusive painted sandgrouse. Other enigmatic birds such as the eagle owl and yellow throated bulbul may also welcome you with their charisma if you look deeply and patiently enough. Birds like silverbill, shrike, bulbul, swallow and tern are found aplenty here. Due to this, Hampi and its surroundings are recognised as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. But Hampi has more charms up its sleeves, especially for wildlife enthusiasts who search the forests for large carnivores; and soothing enough for the bird watcher who finds solace in observing birds for long durations without any disturbance. The landscape dotted with scrub forest lies midway from mega cities of Bengaluru and Hyderabad and the silence of the landscape may be overwhelming at first sight but once one assimilates the serene environment, the landscape becomes a part of his consciousness.  Rich heritage The ruins of Hampi are popular among travellers from all over the world. Whether it is the Anegundi or Kishkinda, associated with the birthplace of Lord Hanuman and the site of the fight between Bali and Sugreeva; or the virupaksha temple, Hemakuta temple, the main Hampi bazaar, the Vithala temple, or the Matunga hill, these places are the ones that hardly any traveller would miss. But, while one enjoys the ancient architecture and rich history, it would be really unwarranted to miss the poetic natural heritage of Hampi. The villages here are typically rural with small hamlets surrounded by large stretches of lush green farmlands. Patient wildlife spotters can even get lucky with leopards prowling around gigantic boulders of the rugged countryside. Another lucky sighting would that be of a mother bear piggy-backing her cubs in search of food for the family! The ground dwelling birds are a treat to watch especially their antics while they are feeding, breeding or taking a bath in a puddle of water. The ground dwelling birds can adapt very well in farmlands as well but increasing farmlands around the area does put them at a certain disadvantage.  Whether it is the large group of small birds like the jungle bush quail who are perfectly camouflaged in the scrub forest or the painted spurfowl couple who are taking a stroll on the forest floor- one is certain to enjoy their head bobbing walking pattern, looking all around with alertness and curiosity. Then there are the long-necked birds like the grey francolin who can give a delightful call upon seeing you; and of course, the once abundant and elegant painted sandgrouse, who welcomes only a few lucky ones as it has become rare over a period of time due to degradation of its habitat.  Most of these fearless birds are categorised under the order galliformes, consisting of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, quails, partridge, pheasant, francolin, junglefowl and peafowl. Galliformes face numerous threats from anthropogenic activities like hunting, deforestation, habitat destruction and climate change.  Hidden from the glamorous world of tigers and elephants, these shy but resilient denizens are quietly scripting their own story, in this mystical landscape. The landscape and its birds may not be as colourful as the canvas of a rainforest but they have their own qualities to enthral the viewer and fill one’s life with colours for eternity!  (Dutta works in the field of conservation and climate crisis; Sharma is a faculty at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/hampi-where-heritage-meets-nature-925190.html
09-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Midday meal: Karnataka HC for proper compensatory distribution system||The state government on Tuesday informed the High Court that an order has been issued on December 5 for immediate procurement and distribution of foodgrain and other commodities to the children under the midday meal scheme. Accordingly, the government would distribute 1 kg of iodised salt, 1 kg of edible oil and tur dal for the five months (August 2020-April 2021). The scheme is for eligible students between class 1 to 10. A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, had directed the government to come up with a proper compensatory scheme since the children had missed the scheme for six months during the Covid-19 pandemic. S R Umashnkar, principal secretary, Department of Primary and Secondary Education, was present during the hearing through Video Conferencing. The principal secretary submitted that Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation (KFCSC) has been directed to procure and distribute the salt, oil and tur dal to the children. The memorandum stated that the commissioner of public instruction has also been directed to implement the midday meal scheme until the school and the centralised kitchen centres reopen. The bench observed that the state may consider distributing more dal instead of one kg each of salt and edible oil. “Prima facie, it appears to us that what is provided in the order will not stand the test of reasonableness and will not amount to compensating those deprived of midday meals,” the bench said. The court posted the further hearing to next Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/midday-meal-karnataka-hc-for-proper-compensatory-distribution-system-925163.html

When the trials started on December 2, the hospital had aimed to administer the first dose of vaccine to 1,000 volunteers in a week. However, as of December 8, only 400 people had approached the hospital to participate in the trial. The volunteers have to be screened to check their suitability for the trial. The hospital has now offered travel arrangements for bigger groups of people - such as residents welfare associations and apartments - who want to be vaccinated as part of the trial. As an alternative, the hospital has offered to reimburse the travelcost. Dr Rajesh Naidu, an orthopaedic doctor at Vydehi Hospital and Director of Clintrac International Private Limited, an autonomous research institute conducting the clinical trial said they were hopeful of reaching thetarget. “We were trying to reach a target of 1,000 volunteers in one week. We are asking everyone. People have to come forward. Hopefully by the end of next week, we hope to inoculate 1,000 volunteers. Other centres started early and so there is more awareness. We only started recently. It will pick up slowly,” Dr Naidusaid. The hospital said they can give the first shot as and when volunteers come, till Bharat Biotech clocks 26,000 volunteers across all its 25 trial sites acrossIndia. “The screening of the volunteers will take at least a day. If interested volunteers are coming from far in groups of 10 or 20, we can provide transport. If people have apprehension of coming to a hospital, we have a separate entrance, passage and wing for them,” he added. Covaxin clinical trials are based on a two-dose schedule, given 28 days apart. The vaccine efficacy will be determined 14 days post the second dose. It is the largest phase 3 clinical trial conducted in India. It is also the only efficacy trial being conducted in India for Covid-19 vaccine, to determine its suitability for the diverse Indian population. “Once the ICMR has the data for the booster dose of 26,000 volunteers, we will stop giving the first shot to more people. Till this number is reached, we will vaccinate as and when the volunteers come forward without a cut-off date,” Dr Naidu said. Clintrac’s Covaxin clinical trial team member said interested can contact the coordinator: Nripesh Nepal at 9739419272 or call Vydehi hospital with an extension number 1692 and ask to be connected to the Covaxin clinical trial room.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-vaccine-trial-in-bengaluru-yet-to-pick-up-pace-925165.html

The court passed the direction, observing an increase in such petitions. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka passed the order, while hearing a petition filed, regarding illegal quarrying units in and around Tippagondanahalli (TG Halli) reservoir and Manchanabele reservoir. The petition filed by an NGO said that while the jurisdictional Gram Panchayats said that they have not accorded permission to any stone quarrying units or crusher units, the state government claims to have accorded permission to some units. In one of the previous hearings, the court had directed the petitioners to implead the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) as party respondent.   The bench said it is the duty of the government as well as KSPCB to take immediate action against the illegal quarrying or stone crusher units. It said the government should set up a redress mechanism so that citizens can file complaints. Based on the complaints, the authorities are also duty bound to take action against the persons operating quarries illegally. The court directed the government to file supplementary statements of objections, including directions on setting up of a redress mechanism. The matter has been posted to January 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/illegal-quarrying-hc-tells-state-to-set-up-redress-mechanism-925166.html

However, farmers, members of various political parties, pro-Kannada and Leftist organisations staged protests across the city. The bandh fizzled out as the day progressed. While some shops resumed business after 11.30 am, some more opened by evening. The response was no different in Hassan also. KSRTC bus services, autorickshaws and other vehicles plied as usual. Hotels, shops, banks and government offices were open. The business was as usual in markets. Weekly shandies too were not affected. Normal life was not affected and the bandh was restricted only to protests in Mandya.  The response was poor in Mangaluru also. Government and private buses operated as usual. The business was normal at shops and commercial establishments. Dakshina Kannada city bus owners’ association president Dilraj Alva said that the association did not extend support to the bandh call. There was a muted response in Kodagu district also. Most of the shops remained open in Chikkamagaluru. North and Kalyana Karnataka There was mixed response in Hubballi-Dharwad. Most of the shops remained closed. The KSRTC and BRTS buses did not venture on the roads. Farmers stage a protest in Haveri while they blocked roads in Vijayapura and Mudhol of Bagalkot district. The protesters blocked Belagavi-Raichur state highway for around 30 minutes. Life was normal in Belagavi, Gadag and Karwar. Shops and commercial establishments remained open and vehicles plied as usual. The bandh call evoked mixed response in Kalyana Karnataka region. Leaders of political parties and farmer associations staged a protest in Kalaburagi. As a precautionary measure, the NEKRTC had withdrawn its bus services and the city buses too didn’t ply. The movement of private vehicles including autorickshaws and two-wheelers was less till afternoon. The bandh was not successful in Bidar and Vijayanagar districts while it was partially successful in Raichur. Peaceful protests received wider support, but normal life was not affected. Many organisations had joined the farmers in a show of strength, leading to protests and rallies at Maurya circle, Town Hall, Mysore Bank Circle and Freedom Park. Thousands of farmers from various districts had come to Bengaluru to take part in the protest against the Union government. At Maurya circle the farmers blocked the road by preparing tea on the road and also slept on the roads blocking the movement of the vehicles. A few protesters were seen asking the motorists to go back to their residences and in a few places they asked the shopowners to close and support the bandh. The police deployed at these places of major crowd gathering and other places across the city managed to stop them from blocking the road and also from involving in any unlawful activities. According to city police they didn’t detain anyone, but stopped them from heading towards Vidhana Soudha.  The farmers have given a call to lay siege to Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday and the police have made the necessary arrangements to stop them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bharat-bandh-partial-in-karnataka-poor-response-in-mysuru-coastal-region-925178.html

The 'Lakshadeepotsava', which is held in a grand manner, will be a simple affair this time by adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. The temple authorities have made arrangements for live streaming of the celebrations via YouTube and Facebook. The exhibition will not be held as a part of 'Lakshadeepotsava'. The 'Sarvadharma Sammelana' will be held on December 13 while 'Sahithya Sammelana' will be held on December 14, temple sources said. On account of 'Lakshadeepotsava', many ''Padayatras' have been organised where hundreds of devotees, in groups, arrive at Dharmashtala on foot. Farmers offer vegetables, fruits and pulses to the Temple. The flower vendors from Bengaluru decorate the temple, 'Beedu' (Veerandra Heggade’s residence) and dining hall with a variety of flowers. Already, the Temple, 'Beedu', lodges, park, entrance arch and 'Bahubali Betta' (hill) have been decked up with lights. Appeal to devotees The 'Lakshadeepotsava' will be held on December 14.

Instead of calling for a bandh, people should understand the reality. Our government, be it in the state or centre, is pro-farmer. Modi will not do anything against the interests of farmers,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bharat-bandh-failed-congress-ship-sinking-bs-yediyurappa-925177.html
09-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Congress stages walkout over MSP, crop procurement||Opposition Congress, unhappy over the state government’s response to procure all crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP), opening procurement centres and removing restrictions on procurement, staged a walkout in Legislative Assembly on Tuesday. During a discussion on MSP and crop procurement held since noon, Opposition leader Siddaramaiah raised questions on delay in opening the procurement centres and low procurement target of some crops in Karnataka, such as paddy. "While the expected yield of paddy was around 29 lakh metric tonnes, the government would procure only 2.1 lakh tonnes," he said. Siddaramaiah also demanded the government to enact a law similar to Kerala and Punjab under which any crop procurement below MSP was penalised. “The Central government should make sure that all crops come under MSP,” he said, adding remunerative prices should also be paid as per the recommendations of Swaminathan Report. Senior Congress leader HK Patil noted that there was a revolving fund of around Rs 2,500 crore and urged the government to procure maize using these funds as farmers who cultivated the crop were under distress. “Only way to double farmers income is by ensuring MSP,” he said. Law and Parliamentary Affairs J C Madhuswamy said that though the government was ready to procure any amount of paddy or ragi, it could not procure maize as per Centre’s directions to buy only such crops that could be used in the Public Distribution System. On increasing procurement targets for paddy, he said that the limits were set based on previous years’ procurement. “We are willing to petition the Centre to increase the target to 10 lakh metric tonnes. But, the argument will fail if we do not reach the allotted target (during the year),” he said. Congress was left unhappy with the government response as the import policy of the Centre has dipped prices for crops, such as pepper. “The government should at least try to stabilise the prices,” Siddaramaiah said before the party staged a walkout. JD(S) leader H D Revanna urged the government to emulate states, such as Andra Pradesh and Telangana, and procure maize at Hobli level. Madhuswamy responded saying that he would discuss the procurement of maize with the chief minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-stages-walkout-over-msp-crop-procurement-925203.html
09-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||BSY urges farmers to withdraw protests; calls for talks||In the wake of continued protests by farmer groups in Bengaluru over the controversial farm Bills, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa urged farmers to withdraw all demonstrations and invited them for discussions with the government. Speaking to reporters at Vidhana Soudha, he said that the government will not allow repeated protests in the state. "It is questionable if such protests are held daily. There is no opportunity to organise bandhs again and again. Please cooperate with the government. If you have any reservations (on farm Bills), come, let's discuss them," he said. More than farmer groups, BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are with farmers. "Modi-ji is making special efforts to double farmers' income. At such a juncture, holding such events that unnecessarily inconvenience people is not right. People will not appreciate it," he said, urging farmers to withdraw all protests and padayatras. Farmer groups in the state had launched an indefinite stir against the controversial farm laws from Monday, December 7. The protests had intensified after the state BJP government passed the controversial Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Legislative Council with backing from JD(S).||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bsy-urges-farmers-to-withdraw-protests-calls-for-talks-925305.html
09-12-2020||Main Article||The growth conundrum||Economic growth has been a contentious issue, at least from the 1970s when it was felt that the GDP was not a good enough measure to get a true picture of the people’s lives. It was then that the Human Development Index (HDI) was evolved to measure the quality of life of people in terms of health, nutrition, education and standard of living.  The GDP vs HDI battle continues, with the GDP advocates falling back on the argument that ‘the rising tide raises all boats’, and the HDI partisans pointing to the harsh fact of gaping inequality of incomes. Some of the economists on the GDP side had argued that the concern should be of eliminating absolute poverty, and that inequality can be ignored for the moment.  But it has not been easy to hold the truce because the challenge was of sustaining growth which seemed to be cyclical, bringing more misery to the poor than to the rich. If too many people become too poor due to the growth cycle, then this will impact and impair the GDP number. So, sustainable development became an imperative.  Sustainable development was also seen as necessary to fight the challenge of climate change because climate change posed a threat to the cosy assumption of an ever-growing economy. Many of the things assumed by HDI and sustainable development required state action, and this was considered necessary even in the freest of free economies. So, governance has become an issue as well in matters of economic growth. Bengaluru-based Public Affairs Centre (PAC) has taken the GDP/HDI issue head on in its annual survey of governance among Indian states and evolved the Public Affairs Index (PAI) and ranked the performance of the states in terms of governance for 2020, an exercise it had begun in 2016. The index is based on the three vectors of growth, equity and sustainable development, and they are tested on the parameters of rule of law, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, control of corruption, voice and accountability.  This is a comprehensive checklist. But this is applied at the level of the states and not at the national level. PAC Director Gurucharan Gollerkeri, a former bureaucrat who worked in the Karnataka government as well as at the Centre,  points to the critical lacuna in the developmental programmes, in the Preface: “…the influence of a ‘one-size fits all’ approach on our development outlook has been pervasive and the overwhelming majority of interventions, including centrally sponsored schemes, designed and implemented uncritically and mechanically, unwittingly perhaps, subverting the doctrine of objective pluralism.” This is indeed a terse formulation of the real issues at stake in the developmental agenda. In some ways, the PAC premise that what the governments do is of utmost importance in fighting poverty and inequality, is acknowledgement of the fact that India remains a developing country even after 30 years of economic reforms and though it has acquired the label of ‘emerging economy’, state intervention is crucial for a large section of vulnerable people.  The report looks at the ‘competitive imperatives’ between implementing national policy objectives, which have to be necessarily done by the state governments, and the report curiously uses the phrase ‘sub-national governance’ to refer to the state governments’ responsibility, and the local exigencies. The report pointedly refers to two of these issues. First, the ease of doing business index of the World Bank, and the labour reforms that go with it. The state governments in the absence of a protective net of social security is forced to fall back on welfare measures for the workers.  State subject Second is the issue of doubling farmers’ income, which is again a national policy goal, but agriculture is a state subject and it is the state governments that shape specific measures to fulfil the objective. And the report notes the fact of “the inadequate pace of agrarian reforms across India illustrate the divided state of mind in which state governments address the difficult task of envisioning the future of the Indian farmer.” The rankings of the states on the basis of the three pillars of growth, equity and sustainability, and the Composite Index, which is the PA Index, reflects a complicated reality rather than a picture of the victory podium as to who stands first, second and third. For example, under the Equity Pillar, the parameters are exhaustive, which include proportion of population under social protection, proportion of seats held by women in state legislature and local government, rural indebtedness, worker population ratio (female). Quite fairly, the states are divided into large, small and Union Territories (UTs) and the comparative rankings make sense because the competition is among near equals.  The drive of the national parties has been to collapse the federal structures as far as possible with the intention of achieving efficiencies. The BJP government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing for single systems that hold across the country, and this is the base for the GST based on one nation, one tax,  though the GST Council comprising state finance ministers and consensus as the proviso for making decisions stands for symbolic federalism.  But the PAI report argues with much justification that the economic development of the country will depend on the performance of the states, and that the take-off conditions in the states are too different in terms of resources, and the stage of social and political development diverse creating a situation of inherent inequality, and each state has to develop from its own starting point.  The report draws the right conclusion that the ‘revolution of devolution’ must be continually pushed from the centre to the states and from the states to rural and urban local bodies. The report, however, accepts the fact that national initiatives have created a certain amount of convergence towards growth and equity and sustainable development, and each one of them gives a push to the other.

"Kota (South), Port Blair, Bhubaneswar, Moga, Gurugram and Ranchi are other cities which will start the operationalise the helpline," said the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The setting up of the helpline is one among the few criteria mentioned by the Ministry to encourage urban local bodies to adopt mechanised cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. Earlier Union Housing and Urban Affairs have launched Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge on this issue. The Challenge aims to ensure that no life of any sewer or septic tank cleaner is ever lost again owing to the issue of ‘hazardous cleaning. The Challenge focussed on creating citizen awareness on this critical issue. Along with this, a dedicated helpline number has been set up to register complaints and provide real-time solutions on desludging of sewer overflow. The Ministry will make an on-ground assessment of participating cities in the Challenge in May 2021 by an independent agency and results of the same will be declared on 15 August 2021. "Cities will be awarded in three sub-categories – with a population of more than 10 lakhs, 3-10 lakhs and up to 3 lakhs, with a total prize money of Rs 52 crores to be given to winning cities across all categories," Hardeep Singh Puri earlier said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/mysuru-to-have-helpline-for-sewage-cleaners-925481.html

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa will visit Talakad on the banks of River Cavery, on December 13, Sunday, and will participate in the early morning puja on Monday, December 14, the actual day of Panchalinga Darshana. The officials said that in the wake of Covid crisis, the festivities will be limited to just rituals and tradition. H B Natesh, Executive Officer of Talakad temples, said, "Due to the MCC, no stage function will be held. Panchalinga Darshana is held once in five, seven, nine and 12 years. This darshana is being held after a gap of seven years. All arrangements for the festivities are made and it will begin with Sankalpa Puja at Sri Vydyanatheshwara temple at 6 pm, on Thursday."

09-12-2020||Mysuru||HD Kumaraswamy's ‘game plan’ for gram panchayat polls in Mysuru region||All recent political developments in Mysuru region, as of now, are related to Gram Panchayat (GP) elections. Thus, JD(S), which is a major player in the region, has begun a new game plan to regain its hold. Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy knows well that rivalry with the Congress, rather than the BJP, yields good results for his party, here. It is not the first time that former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy blamed Opposition Leader Siddaramaiah for the fall of his JD(S)-Congress coalition government. But, this time, a formal invitation was extended for a media conference, held last week, on December 5, Saturday, where he made the allegations against Siddaramaiah. Besides, why Mysuru for these formal allegations? Only the previous day, he had addressed a media conference in Mandya but did not speak anything to this effect. In the Legislative Council also, the JD(S) supported the BJP in passing the amendment to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act (1961), that allowed non-agriculturists to buy agricultural lands in Karnataka, inviting the wrath of both Congress and farmers organisations. Both JD(S) and its leaders are famous for their unorganised and uncourteous ways. It has to be noted that this is the first time, that an invitation for a media conference was extended by a JD(S) spokesperson, on behalf of his leader, by messaging on a group. Otherwise, the attitude of the JD(S) top leaders is that, if they give bytes to a couple of TV channels and websites, the rest of the media organisations should followup. A senior JD(S) leader said, “Our party knows well, that we cannot win enough seats to form a government on our own, in general elections. We do not take byelections seriously, unless a member of our first family, that is of former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, contests. The byelection of Anitha Kumaraswamy in Ramanagara can be recalled.” “Otherwise, our leaders do not deem it worth to invest funds and energy on a byelection. Now, that the GP elections are scheduled to be held on December 22 and 27, there is a need to energise party workers. Besides, GP polls are the election of the party workers, who are the main strength of JD(S),” the leader added. Another JD(S) leader said, “Even though the BJP is the ruling party in the state, it does not have grassroots level workers in Mysuru region, especially in rural areas. Despite BJP vice-president B Y Vijayendra and district in-charge ministers are doing their mite to strengthen the party base, they cannot match the JD(S), whose supporters blindly follow either former prime minister H D Deve Gowda or Kumaraswamy.” “Hassan is an exceptional case. There it is Deve Gowda and H D Revanna. Traditionally, it is the fight between the JD(S) and Congress. In fact, the recent infusion of strength into the BJP will split the votes of the Congress, thus, helping the JD(S),” he said. Another JD(S) leader bets on the Vokkaliga loyalty of the supporters to the party top leaders. “Thus, confronting either Siddaramaiah or KPCC president D K Shivakumar will help the party prospects. It has to be recalled that the drubbing of the Congress in the 2018 Assembly polls was a result of the bad-mouthing of JD(S) leaders by Siddaramaiah. Besides, at a time when Shivakumar is trying to emerge as an alternative Vokkaliga leader, evoking sympathy is a strategy,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/hd-kumaraswamys-game-plan-for-gram-panchayat-polls-in-mysuru-region-925489.html
09-12-2020||Mysuru||IMA to stage protest, health services likely to be affected on December 11||Health services in the city are likely to be hit on Friday, with doctors, also members of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Mysuru chapter, deciding to stage a protest, by staying away from work. IMA members will protest against the Central government, for allowing post-graduate scholars of Ayurveda to practice general surgery, including ortho, dentistry, and allopathic surgical procedures. The IMA has condemned the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), which regulates the medical study and practice of Ayurveda, for the decision. In a press conference here, IMA, Mysuru chapter, president Dr  B N Anandravi, said, "Over 3,000 doctors worked, wearing black bands on their shoulders, on Wednesday." According to him, in a gazette notification, dated November 20, the CCIM has amended the Indian Medicine Central Council Regulations, 2016, to introduce formal training and practice of surgeries to PG students of Ayurveda. As per the amendment, the students would receive training in 'shalya' (general surgery) and 'shalakya' (diseases of ear, nose, throat, eye, head, oro-dentistry) specialisations. Accusing the government of playing with the lives of the people, he said that such trained doctors of these two specialities would conduct 58 types of surgeries. "There is no provision for MBBS doctors to perform surgery even in allopathy, and even doctors with Masters in Surgery are not allowed to conduct all types of surgery. The government’s move will have adverse effect on people’s health," he said. The doctors will boycott work from 6 am to 6 pm on December 11. Except for emergency and Covid-19, no cases will be attended, he said. IMA central committee member Dr S P Yoganna said, "Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy have different treatment procedures. Mixing one another is risky and the government must reconsider its decision." All India Surgical Society president Dr Siddesh was present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/ima-to-stage-protest-health-services-likely-to-be-affected-on-december-11-925490.html

09-12-2020||National||India's weapons procurement from the US jumps to $3.4 billion in 2020||India's weapons procurement from the United States jumped from meagre $6.2 million to a whopping $3.4-billion in the final year of the Donald Trump administration, according to official data. The jump in sale of American weapons to India comes at a time when sale of weapons from the US to other countries has dipped to $50.8 billion in 2020 from $55.7 billion 2019. In 2019, the sale of US weapons to foreign countries was $55.7 billion, according to data from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). In 2017, the sale of US weapons to other countries was $41.9 billion. According to the statistics released by the DSCA, major buyers of American weapons in 2020 were India ($3.4 billion up from $6.2 million in fiscal year 2019), Morocco ($4.5 billion up from $12.4 million), Poland ($4.7 billion up from $673 million), Singapore ($1.3 billion up from $137 million), Taiwan ($11.8 billion up from $876 million), and the United Arab Emirates ($3.6 billion up from $1.1 billion). Several countries reported drop in purchase of weapons from the US. Prominent among them were Saudi Arabia which came down from $14.9 billion in 2019 to $1.2 billion in 2020, Afghanistan ($1.1 billion down from $1.6 billion), Belgium ($41.8 million down from $5.5 billion), Iraq ($368 million down from $1.4 billion), and South Korea ($2.1 billion down from $2.7 billion). According to the 2020 edition of the Historical Sales Book, India purchased weapons worth $754.4 million in 2017 and $282 million in 2018. Between 1950 and 2020, US sale of weapons to India under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) category was $12.8 billion. For Pakistan, the official figures reflected that sale of weapons under FMS did happen, even though there was a freeze in any military and security assistance to Islamabad from the Trump Administration. In 2020, US sale of weapons to Pakistan was $146 million, in 2018 it was $65 million and in 2017 it was $22 million. In 2019, there was no sale of US military weapons to Pakistan. In fact, the US refunded $10.8 million to Pakistan, taken for the purchase of weapons. Between 1950 and 2020, Pakistan purchased weapons worth $10 billion from the US under FMS. However, the total supply of American military weapons to Pakistan is much more, as a major chunk of weapons to Pakistan has gone from United States as military and security assistance. According to the Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs Clarke Cooper, fiscal 2020 saw a total of $175.8 billion in US government-authorised arms exports. This is overall a 2.8 per cent increase since fiscal year 2019. The overall value of State Department-authorised government-to-government FMS cases implemented by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency decreased 8.3 per cent from USD55.39 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 to USD50.78 billion in Fiscal Year 2020. “The dollar value of potential FMS sales, formally notified to Congress, also rose by more than 50 per cent from $58.33 billion to $87.64 billion. This was driven by the July potential sale of $23.11 billion worth of F-35 aircraft to Japan, which was the second largest single FMS notification ever authorised by the Department of State,” Cooper said. The Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which is the Department of State-authorised commercial export licenses, totalled USD124.3 billion in fiscal year 2020, and this was up from USD114.7 billion in fiscal year 2019, he said. “This represented an 8.4 per cent increase. This total value covers authorisations of hardware, defense services, and technical data. The total number of licences issued decreased by 20-per cent from 36,111 in Fiscal Year 2019 to 28,800 in Fiscal Year 2020,” Cooper said. The top commercial DCS notified to Congress in Fiscal Year 2020 included an $8.39 billion sale to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for F-35 components. This also included a $3.2 billion sale to Australia for P-8 aircraft parts, and a $2.48 billion sale to United Kingdom and Australia for E-7 airborne early warning and control aircraft, Cooper said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-weapons-procurement-from-the-us-jumps-to-34-billion-in-2020-925214.html
09-12-2020||National||SC upholds rejections of bid for not disclosing FIR, charge sheet in Varanasi flyover collapse||The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the rejection of a bid by the Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) Ltd, for construction of an elevated corridor in Madhya Pradesh, for suppressing information about filing of a charge sheet in a case of a 2018 flyover collapse that claimed lives of 15 persons in Varanasi. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and K M Joseph set aside a decision by the Madhya Pradesh High Court which has held as on the date of submission of the technical bid, since no investigation was pending, there was no suppression of facts by UPSBC. The notice inviting a tender by the Madhya Pradesh PWD for the construction of 7.4 km-long elevated corridor at Indore, with an estimated cost of Rs 272.66 crore within 24 months, mandated disclosure of pending investigation by the bidder. In respect of UPSBC, an FIR was lodged on May 15, 2018 after a particular flyover, constructed by it at Varanasi, had collapsed, killing 15 persons and injuring 11 persons. The investigation resulted in a charge sheet. After the trial commenced, the Allahabad High Court, however, on July 30, 2019 stayed it. The UPSBC's counsel contended that it was justified in going by the literal reading of the document, which only required a disclosure of pending investigations. Rejecting the contention, the top court said it must defer to the understanding of clauses in tender documents as per the issuing authority unless there was perversity or mala fides. "Clearly in the facts of the present case, though the investigation is no longer pending and though there is no conviction by a court of law, UPSBC has certainly been “indicted” and a charge sheet has been filed in which a trial is pending, though stayed by the High Court," the bench said. The court said MP's Additional Advocate General Saurabh Mishra was correct that an omission of facts or disclosure of incomplete facts in order to influence the bidding process would come as "the fraudulent practice”. "In the present case, there is clearly an omission of a most relevant fact and suppression of the information that an FIR had been lodged against UPSBC and subsequently a charge sheet filed," the bench said. Acting on a writ petition by UPSBC, the HC was "swayed" by the fact that the company had made the bid for a sum of Rs 306.27 crores, while another company Rajkamal Builders for Rs 315.80 crores, the court said. A third company, which made the lowest bid, was disqualified for some other reasons. The court directed the MP government to offer the letter of intent to Rajkamal at the same financial bid as that of UPSBC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-upholds-rejections-of-bid-for-not-disclosing-fir-charge-sheet-in-varanasi-flyover-collapse-925220.html

Over the last four days, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International (BBIL) have applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking EUA for their Covid-19 vaccines. The government on Tuesday had assured that early licensure was possible for all or any of the vaccines. "Several points would be discussed in meeting - for one, BBIL had changed its dosage during the trial. It had come to seek approval for the same. We will be reviewing this bit very carefully," Business Standard quoted a person close to the matter. The New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, clearly specifies that under specific special situations, relaxation, abbreviation, omission, or deferment of data including local clinical trial data may be considered for approval. ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that while granting EUA, the regulator has to be satisfied with the risk-benefit ratio and in such an emergency if the benefit is more than the risk it may consider.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/expert-panel-to-review-sii-pfizer-bharat-biotechs-covid-19-vaccine-applications-today-report-925255.html

09-12-2020||National||P Chidambaram dubs Modi govt's attitude on farm laws 'Trumpism'||Hitting out the Modi government over farmers' agitation over new farm laws, former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that the government is inspired by 'Trumpism' and they have a 'either my way or the highway' attitude.  In a sharp attack, he said that the Centre is unwilling to consult anybody on the laws.  "This attitude of the government, I won't consult anyone, I won't consult the opposition... I will pass a law. If you force a vote, will ensure there is no vote in the house. There was no vote in the Rajya Sabha. This is known as Trumpism. Trumpism is the word that describes what the Modi government is doing," he commented. The farmers have camped at Delhi's borders for the last two weeks in their fight against the Centre's new farm laws. After several levels of talks with Union Ministers, the farmers have remained strong and firm on their demand -- that farm laws have to be unconditionally repealed.  The Opposition has come in unity against the Modi-led government in backing the farmers and several leaders have termed them 'anti-farmer.'  Congress, and other parties, have claimed that the new laws will leave the farmers at the mercy corporates and thus will deprive them of their deserved earnings. ' Chidambaram said the government should use scrap the laws. "This Bill is anti-farmer. Not a pro-market Bill as it is being projected. This is a Bill that paves the way for corporates, weakens the APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) system. It takes away the sole safety net of farmers and sends a fear among farmers that eventually it will be an unregulated environment in which they will sell their produce," said the veteran said.  Earlier this week, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had alleged that the Congress was protesting the very laws that it proposed when it was in power. In a reply, the Congress leader said the claims were false. "The Law Minister's words are not the gospel truth. Read our manifesto. Our manifesto said marketing of agricultural produce must be reformed, there is no quarrel on that, but in a way farmers do not end up feeling cheated, deprived of the only safety net they have and leave them at the mercy of corporates," he said. "What we proposed was to establish markets in large villages and small towns. Multiple markets, thousands of markets, and make them accessible to the farmer. But with light regulation -- prices should be fixed at not less than the Minimum Support Price (MSP). Then the APMC becomes irrelevant over a period of time. These farm acts dilute, diminish and debilitate the sole safety net for farmers." He said it was a 'wrong assumption' that farmers will have more markets to sell. "The government Bill gives an unregulated environment," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/p-chidambaram-dubs-modi-govts-attitude-on-farm-laws-trumpism-925276.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said the state governments and Union Territories can resort to the exercise only when any direction is issued by the competent authority under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.  The court noted the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on July 2 did not recommend for pasting of posters outside the residences of Covid-19 positive persons.  The court also pointed out a letter that has been sent by the Centre to the States on November 19 against affixing of posters or other signage outside the residences of those found Covid-19 positive. "We only observe that no State or Union Territory is required to paste posters outside the residence of Covid-19 positive persons, as of now," the bench said in its 11-page judgement on a PIL by advocate Kush Kalra. The court disposed of the petition which questioned continuing with the practice for being in violation of individuals' rights to privacy and to live with dignity. The plea also sought a direction that the names of Covid-19 patients were not circulated in WhatsApp group of Residents Welfare Associations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-covid-19-positive-to-be-affixed-outside-covid-19-patients-homes-supreme-court-925277.html

An NCB official claimed it is the "biggest seizure" of drugs in the case linked to Sushant Singh Rajput's death. The Hashish-based Malana Cream is considered one of the purest forms of drugs and is often used in high-profile parties. One of the accused, identified as Regel Mahakal, was arrested late Tuesday night after raids in some areas of Mumbai, including Lokhandwala, by an NCB team led by the probe agency's zonal director Sameer Wankhede, an NCB official said. One more person was also arrested during the raids, the official said without divulging further details. Mahakal's name had cropped up during questioning of some drugs peddlers in the case. He allegedly used to supply drugs to Anuj Keshwani, also an accused in the case who was arrested in September this year, who was supplying it to others, the NCB official told PTI. The NCB is conducting two parallel investigations – the drug angle behind the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the larger Bollywood-drug mafia nexus. As part of the investigations, over 50 persons have been grilled and nearly 25 have been arrested.

"Today's meeting with farmer unions' leaders has been cancelled," a Union Agriculture Ministry's spokesperson told PTI. There was no official confirmation whether the government has sent a written proposal to farmer unions on key amendments to some of the provisions of the three farm laws.   The Home Minister' meeting on Tuesday with a select group of union leaders that included Hannan Mollah of the All India Kisan Sabha and Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) had failed to break the ice. In the meeting, Shah had offered amendments to some of the provisions of the three farm laws in writing. But many farm leaders had said they will not attend Wednesday's meeting and that they will take a call on their next course of action after studying the government's written proposal on Wednesday. No breakthrough has been possible in the five rounds of talks so far as the protesting farmers have stuck to their demand for the repeal of the laws despite the government's assurance to look into specific issues without abolishing the legislations. In the previous meeting on December 5, Agriculture Minister Narender Singh Tomar had assured 40 farmer union leaders that the government is open to considering ways to strengthen APMC mandis, create a level-playing field with proposed private markets, and provide a provision for approaching higher courts for dispute resolution while asserting that procurement at minimum support price (MSP) will continue. But the protesting farmer unions' leaders are insisting that the laws must be scrapped. On December 7, a group of 20 progressive farmers from Haryana submitted to the government a memorandum demanding that the government consider amendments as suggested by the protesting farmers' unions but not repeal them. Tomar had told these progressive farmers backing these legislations that these measures will benefit the peasantry and the agriculture sector and that the government will handle such agitations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-centre-calls-off-6th-round-of-talks-with-farm-leaders-925284.html

The IAF plea has claimed that the "information so sought includes details related to the entire entourage, names of Special Protection Group (SPG) personnel accompanying the Prime Minister of India on foreign tours for his personal safety, and the same, if disclosed, can potentially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State". The petition, filed through central government senior panel counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate C K Bhatt, is in an appeal against the CIC's July 8 direction to IAF to provide certified copies of available and relevant Special Flight Returns-ll to RTI applicant Commodore (retd) Lokesh K Batra. Batra had sought certified copies of SRF-I and SRF-II with regard to each foreign visit of former PM Manmohan Singh as also Prime Minister Narendra Modi from April 2013 onwards. IAF, in its plea, claims that the CIC has "failed to appreciate and consider that the information sought by the respondent (Batra) from the petitioner (Air Force) cannot be disclosed and the application of the respondent for seeking the same ought not to have been allowed as the information sought is extremely sensitive in nature..." The petition contends that the SRF copies sought to relate to "official records of functioning and working of the security apparatus of the Prime Minister of India which cannot be brought in the public domain for safety and security reasons".  The matter is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cant-disclose-details-of-pm-modis-flights-as-it-relates-to-his-security-apparatus-iaf-plea-in-hc-925310.html

They said Tops Grup Managing Director M Shashidharan was placed under arrest on Monday night here under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED is probing the role of Shashidharan in connection with alleged financial irregularities in providing Tops Grup security guards for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) projects during 2014-15 and the payments made in this connection. Shashidharan recently had filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police alleging that a former director of the Tops Grup, Ramesh Iyer, had allegedly perpetrated fraud with the company. Iyer had earlier filed a police case in Mumbai against the security group and its promoter Rahul Nanda for alleged financial irregularities in the company and its transactions. The ED had earlier arrested Amit Chandole, an alleged associate of Sarnaik, in this case. The central probe agency, sources had said, is probing Chandole's role and alleged suspect dealings with Sarnaik, Tops Grup security providing service and Nanda, they said. Nanda, as per media reports, had denied any wrongdoing. Searches at ten premises of Sarnaik, Nanda and few others were launched by the ED on March 24 in neighbouring Thane and Mumbai. The Shiv Sena had earlier called the raids a "political vendetta" and said the Maharashtra government or its leaders will not surrender to pressure from anyone. The ED case is based on a Mumbai Police economic offences wing FIR filed against the promoters of the Tops Grup on charges of alleged irregularities in acquisition of some overseas assets in 2009 and some other transactions. Sarnaik, 56, represents the Ovala-Maijwada constituency in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and is also a spokesperson for his party.

Vijayvargiya shared a short video where a police personnel is seen purportedly loading bullets in a shotgun to target protesters, and said there is a huge difference between what the force says and actually does in the state. "This is just a sample footage, I have 10 such videos to prove how the West Bengal Police speaks blatant lies," the senior BJP leader said. BJP worker Ulen Roy was killed during a protest march in Siliguri on Monday, following which the party called a 12-hour bandh on Tuesday to protest police brutalities during its rally. The West Bengal Police, in an earlier tweet, said that the post-mortem report of Roy revealed that he died of pellet wounds fired from a shotgun, which the force does not use. "It's obvious that during (Monday's) protest in Siliguri, armed persons were brought and they fired from firearms," it added. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also accused the saffron party of "killing people in its rallies" and sought to know if it was done for propaganda. "The BJP lies, kills people; it holds rallies and kills people. Are you doing it for publicity since there weren't many people in the rally? The police do not use these... Did you kill a man with pellets for the sake of publicity, for propaganda?" Banerjee said at a public meeting in Ranianj. Vijayvargiya, who appears in the video for about 40 seconds, asserted that his party will move the Supreme Court if its workers are wrongly framed by the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state. "This video is proof of what the West Bengal Police tweets and what it actually acts like," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west-bengal-police-speaking-blatant-lies-about-bjp-workers-killing-vijayvargiya-925328.html

The top court was hearing a suo motu case registered by it to ensure proper treatment of Covid-19 patients in hospitals and dignified handling of dead bodies there. Recently, it also took cognisance of the fire incident in a designated Covid-19 hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot in which several patients had died, raising the issue of lack of proper fire safety measures in hospitals across the country.  A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Gujarat government, to file detailed affidavits within three days on the issues such as enforcing of Covid-19 guidelines and fire safety measures in hospitals and nursing homes.  The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, directed the states as well to file affidavits by Friday on steps taken on these issues and fixed the suo motu case for hearing on December 14.  The bench directed that the Justice (Retd.) DA Mehta committee will probe the Ahmedabad fire incident, besides the fire tragedy at a Covid-19 hospital at Rajkot which is already being inquired into by the panel. At the outset, the law officer said he would request the Gujarat government to appoint a judge to probe the fire incidents in hospitals if the apex court suggest any name to head such an inquiry.  "It is upon the discretion of this court," Mehta said. Mehta said the Centre has asked all the states and Union Territories (UTs) to send status report on the implementation of fire safety guidelines to prevent recurrence of fire incidents in hospitals and nursing homes. A detailed report on fire safety would be prepared after getting the inputs from states, he said. The bench then asked about the fire safety audit of Gujarat and hospitals there and said as to how many nodal officers have been appointed.  It then enquired about the steps taken to enforce the Covid-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks in public and adhering to the social distancing norms.  "You file a detailed affidavit giving all steps taken," it said.  Earlier, the apex court had said that people are violating “with impunity” the Covid-19 guidelines on wearing of face masks at public places and are not adhering to social distancing norms. It had pulled up the authorities for not ensuring strict compliance of these measures to contain coronavirus and had asked the Centre and states to give suggestions so that appropriate directions can be issued to implement these guidelines. The top court had however stayed the Gujarat High Court direction to send people caught without wearing masks to do community service at the Covid-19 patient care facilities. It had taken note of the submissions of the Gujarat government that the order was harsh, having serious repercussions on health of the violators. The top court had asked the Gujarat government to strictly enforce the Covid-19 guidelines.  The apex court had also expressed concern over the spurt in number of Covid-19 cases across the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-seeks-reply-from-centre-states-on-covid-19-guidelines-fire-safety-in-hospitals-925338.html

However, several strategies that have been envisaged under the policy approved almost two years back are yet to be implemented including rationalisation of taxes, levies and spectrum price. "The policy initiatives required from the government for 5G must include and ensure spectrum availability at affordable prices, lower reserve price, uniform RoW (right of way) policy for fiberisation etc," Jog said. Telecom operators have been demanding the government to make available spectrum for 5G at the earliest and lower the reserve price. Mobile service providers can start 5G services in India once suitable airwave frequencies are allotted to them by the government. Spectrum auctions in India were held every year between 2012 to 2016. No auctions have been held in the last four years. The government started the process of spectrum auction but has not clarified the timeline for the sale to commence. The Digital Communications Commission, the apex decision making body at DoT, had approved spectrum base price recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in May. Mukesh Ambani-led firm Reliance Jio had in September too written to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash questioning the Department of Telecom's (DoT) rationale to pause the policy of annual spectrum auctions and said the sale of airwaves should be held at the earliest to meet the demand for data services. Trai had recommended a plan to auction spectrum worth Rs 5.22 lakh crore. However, some of the spectrum frequencies identified by DoT for auction are being used by the defence ministry and the Department of Space. According to Jio, spectrum worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore is lying unused with DoT for auction. Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has said it will not buy 5G spectrum in the upcoming auction if its base price is fixed at Rs 492 crore per megahertz as recommended by regulator Trai. The company has been reeling under a debt of Rs 1.14 lakh crore with liability to clear statutory dues of around Rs 35,500 crore, following a Supreme Court order in October 2019 that upheld the government's stand on calculating levies over telecom licences. Trai has recommended base price of proposed 5G spectrum in 3,300-3,600 Mhz band at about Rs 492 crore per Mhz unpaired spectrum on all India basis. Telecom operators interested in buying radiowaves for 5G will have to shell out a minimum of Rs 9,840 crore on all-India basis to buy spectrum in 3,300-3,600 Mhz band as Trai has suggested that it "should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz. This comes to around Rs 50,000 crore for 100 megahertz of 5G spectrum required to deliver high speed broadband services.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/need-to-expedite-implementation-of-new-telecom-policy-lower-5g-reserve-price-says-dot-official-925349.html

An editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' alleged that the BJP-led government at the Centre wants to keep the Damocles'sword of "fear and terror" hanging on the country for its own political interests. "Instead of resolving unrest in the country, it wants to keep it (unrest) burning," it charged. Various farmer unions observed the 'Bharat Bandh' on Tuesday, demanding a repeal of the new agri laws. The editorial asked what was wrong in political parties extending support to the 'Bharat Bandh'. It criticised the BJP for calling the farmers' agitation as an "attempt to create anarchy" in the country and for labelling the protesting farmers as 'Khalistanis'. "What the BJP is doing in West Bengal is political chaos where caste and religious polarisation is being done. Threats of bloodshed and violence are being given. This is anarchy," it alleged. If farmers' issues were resolved expeditiously, they would have gone back home, the editorial said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-bandh-befitting-reply-to-state-backed-anarchy-shiv-sena-925350.html

Addressing BJP workers in Kolkata on the first day of his two-day long visit to the state, Nadda said that BJP would not rest till it is able to uproot the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government from West Bengal. “Seeing the current situation in Bengal, I want to refer to Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s comments on discipline and intolerance. It is very relevant today. Mamata Banerjee is synonymous with intolerance,” said Nadda. The BJP president said that the “Sonar Bangla” of earlier days has been reduced to a state plagued with corruption and communal divide under the TMC regime where "state sponsored terrorism" is taking place unabated. “But the TMC government will not last forever. We will not rest till we uproot the TMC from Bengal… BJP will come to power in Bengal by wining 200 seats in the 2021 Assembly elections,” said Nadda. Nadda further alleged that so far 130 BJP workers have been killed in the state and he himself conducted “tarapan” of 100 slain BJP workers. “Everyday the TMC is setting new shameful examples of intolerance. BJP workers are being murdered with modern weapons,” he said. The BJP president accused the TMC of resorting to “dynastic politics”, asserting that no family runs the party but party is the family in BJP. He said that the TMC Government’s policies are influenced by “appeasement politics” which can be seen in the fact that although it had imposed statewide lockdown on August 5, the day for the “bhoomi pujan” of the Ram Templre in Ayodhya, the lockdown was withdrawn on the occasion of Bakri Eid on July 31. “We have no objection to holiday on Eid and want everybody to be happy on the occasion. But the sentiments of all must be respected,” said Nadda. Later in the day, Nadda took part in BJP’s public outreach initiative at Kalighat in South Kolkata, in the neighborhood of the Chief Minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mamata-synonymous-with-intolerance-j-p-nadda-925352.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said the petition has been filed without doing any homework on which schools are overcharging fees or are denying access to online classes as these details have not been indicated. The petition claims that "proper" online classes are not being held, the court said and asked what the petitioner means by "proper". "It is such a vague term. Anything can be termed as not being proper," the bench said, adding that it appeared to be a "bogus matter". "Without doing any homework this petition has been filed. No details have been given. It appears that this is a publicity interest litigation. It is not a public interest litigation (PIL) at all," the bench said and directed that the cost of Rs 20,000 be deposited within four weeks in favour of the Delhi Legal Services Authority. The court said the amount would be used for access to justice programmes. The plea was filed by the Anti-Corruption Council of India Trust, through advocate Ashok Kumar Singh, claiming that according to news reports several schools are allegedly collecting fees under various components, other than tuition fees, and are denying access to online classes to those students who are unable to pay the amounts demanded. It contended that such actions are in violation of the Delhi government's directions to schools not to charge anything more than tuition fees during the prevailing pandemic when schools are closed. It had claimed that according to the Delhi Parents Association there are 76 private schools which are in violation of the Delhi government direction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-junks-pil-claiming-overcharging-of-fees-by-private-schools-imposes-rs-20k-in-cost-925353.html

Farmers have been demonstrating since late last month over reforms enacted in September that loosened rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce, and had protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades. Small growers, in particular, fear that they will be at the mercy of big business if they are no longer assured of floor prices for staples such as wheat and rice sold at government-controlled wholesale markets. Unhappy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's liberalisation, farmers have set up protest camps and blocked roads surrounding the capital New Delhi, and on Tuesday they mounted a nationwide strike. In response, the government decided against rushing into a planned second day of talks without first coming up with some proposals that could mollify the angry farmers, a federal government spokesman said. "We're open to amendments, but a complete withdrawal of the laws is just plain impossible," said a senior government official in the agriculture ministry in New Delhi, who declined to be identified. A second senior government official said they were working on a fresh proposal to "fine tune" the three laws, which would be presented to the over 30 farmer unions actively involved in the protests. Farmer leaders want the government to retain mandatory government purchases, and said that buyers at private markets should pay the same tax as at state-run markets. Hannan Mollah, the general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha (All India Farmers' Union), said his members would discuss intensifying resistance to the new laws. The protests, led by influential farming groups from the grain-producing states of Haryana and Punjab, pose a major challenge to Modi as he seeks to reform the vast agriculture sector, which makes up nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half of its 1.3 billion people. Opposition parties have criticised the reforms, saying they will benefit big business and be disastrous for the rural economy, and are due to meet President Ram Nath Kovind, the country's ceremonial head of state, to discuss the controversial laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-government-seeks-ways-to-tweak-farm-laws-to-appease-farmers-925358.html

This does not conform to the behavioural norms of those in the armed forces of India. The related scenes need to be withdrawn,” the IAF tweeted tagging Netflix India and Kashyap.  The IAF has officially written to Netflix India seeking withdrawal of such scenes, which supposedly took the Air Force Headquarters by surprise as it was not aware of this movie. Hours after the IAF flagged its concerns, Kapoor publicly apologised for those scenes and said it was never his or the filmmaker’s intention to disrespect the IAF. He offered an explanation about why the scenes were depicted that way. Netflix also offered an apology. “In the film, my character is of an actor playing the role of an officer who finds out that his daughter was kidnapped. The anger and rage that he portrayed are of an emotionally distraught father. As I am wearing the Indian Air Force Uniform while using unparliamentary language, I would like to sincerely offer my humble apologies for unintentionally hurting sentiments.”  “Our intention would never be to disrespect the Armed Forces of India in any regard. At no point does the film represent the Indian Air Force or our Armed Forces. We have nothing but the highest respect for the brave people protecting our nation,” tweeted Netflix India. Earlier this year, the IAF wrote to the CBFC over “undue negative portrayal and gender bias” in the movie Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/iaf-objects-to-inaccurate-donning-of-its-uniform-in-netflix-movie-ak-vs-ak-925374.html

The apex court said that its December 3 order, in which it had said that “for the time being, there will be stay of redemption payment to the unit holders”, would continue in the meantime. A bench comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna posted the matter for hearing in the third week of January. The apex court is hearing an appeal filed by Franklin Templeton against the Karnataka High Court order which stopped the fund house from winding up its debt fund schemes without prior consent of the investors. At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Sebi, told the bench that appeal filed in the apex court by the market regulator in the matter has not been listed for hearing today. When Mehta urged the court that Sebi’s appeal be listed for hearing in a day or two, the bench said, “We can list the matter for hearing in January”. On December 7, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund had said it has sought consent of the unit-holders for the orderly winding up of the six fixed income schemes. The electronic voting will take place from December 26-28 and the meeting of unit-holders of relevant schemes on December 29, Franklin Templeton MF had said in a statement. On December 3, the apex court had asked Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund to initiate steps within one week for calling a meeting of unit-holders to seek their consent for closure of six mutual fund scheme. The bench had observed that the issue is big and people wanted a refund. “In the meanwhile, without prejudice to the rights and contentions of all parties, the trustees are permitted to call meeting of unit holders to seek their consent/approval. Steps in this regard be taken within a period of one week from today”, the bench had said in its last week order. Sebi had told the bench that the market regulator has no role in the winding up process but had written to the Reserve Bank of India in this regard. On October 24, the Karnataka High Court had said that decision of the Franklin Templeton Trustee Services Private Limited to wind up six schemes cannot be implemented unless the consent of the unit holders is obtained. The six schemes are Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund. Franklin Templeton MF closed these six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, citing redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in the bond market. Till November 27, the six schemes received total cash flows of Rs 11,576 crore from maturities, pre-payments and coupon payments since April 24, 2020. The cash available stands at Rs 7,226 crore as of November 27 for the four cash positive schemes, subject to fund running expenses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/franklin-templeton-matter-supreme-court-asks-sebi-to-appoint-observer-for-e-voting-process-925379.html

The cabinet approved the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recommended aggregator-model, paving the way for new categories of public data offices (PDOs), public data office aggregators (PDOAs) and app providers to deliver public WiFi services without a licence.  "PM Wi-Fi Access Network Interface to unleash a massive WIFI network in India. With this, public data centres will be opened across the country," Prasad said. The proposed categories of PDOs, the Minister said, won’t need a licence, and also won’t have to pay any entry fee or go through a registration process. The aggregators, who will work closely with the PDOs and app providers, will be registered within a week of putting in an application. The Union Minister also said that the proposal will promote growth of public Wi-Fi networks in the country. Prasad further added that businesses can take services from Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio or any such internet service provider (ISP) and use their physical location to provide Wi-Fi to anyone who happens to be nearby. At present the country has around one lakh WiFi hotspots against the target of 5 million by 2020 and 10 million by 2022, set by National Digital Communications Policy, 2018. The TRAI  had 4 years ago recommended the aggregator-model, involving PDOAs, to deliver public WiFi services.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cabinet-approves-pm-wani-scheme-for-proliferation-of-public-wi-fi-network-925381.html

Scores of protestors, who belong to various districts of western Uttar Pradesh and are chiefly members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union's Bhanu and Lok Shakti factions, are camping at the Noida-Delhi border amid heavy deployment of police personnel. According to officials, both carriageways of the Delhi-Noida Link road – a key route connecting UP and the national capital – remained closed for commuters on Wednesday also due to the farmers' stir at the Chilla border. "Commuters to and from Delhi have been advised to take either the DND route or the Kalindi Kunj route instead of the Link Road via Chilla," an official said. In Noida, the protestors belonging to BKU (Bhanu) are staying put at Chilla border, while those from BKU (Lok Shakti) are camping at the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 1. They are opposed to the three farm laws passes by the Centre in September and are demanding that these legislations be withdrawn. Asked about the protest continuing for the ninth day, Rajeev Nagar, a local farmers' union leader said, "It is not the farmers but the government that is prolonging the protest." "The government knows our demands and knows well about our peaceful demonstration. It can address our concern and we will be gone. We do not want to sit here for long, we have got our farms and cattle to look after," Nagar, the Gautam Buddh Nagar unit president of the BKU (Bhanu), told PTI. He said a 'mahapanchayat' of the farmers belonging to western UP and opposed to the new farm laws is expected to be held on Wednesday afternoon. The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called chiefly by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.   They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-farmers-centre-responsible-for-prolonging-protest-bharatiya-kisan-union-leader-925383.html

It said the prosecution complaint has been filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court here and the agency has named Embraer SA, Brazil, Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd, KRBL Limited, Anoop Kumar Gupta (director of KRBL Limited), Anurag Potdar (nephew of Anoop Kumar Gupta) and others. KRBL Ltd is the manufacturer of India Gate Basmati Rice. The case pertains to payment of alleged commission by Embraer to clinch the $208 million deal with India, in which it is suspected and alleged that kickbacks were paid. The ED, in a statement, said its probe found that "Embraer SA Brazil obtained the contract for the supply of aircraft to Indian Air Force for $210 million and paid a commission of $5.76 million to a middleman named Vipin Khanna for influencing the said contract in its favour". "The said kickbacks of $5.76 million were routed by Embraer SA, Brazil through its subsidiaries to Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd, Singapore in lieu of sham agreement." It alleged the "kickbacks" of around $3.275 million were further routed from Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd to KRBL DMCC, Dubai (a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of KRBL Ltd) in lieu of sham agreement to finally reach India through KRBL Ltd "projecting" the same as untainted money. The agency said its investigation found that "Anoop Kumar Gupta signed the sham agreement held between Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd. and KRBL DMCC to receive proceeds of crime which were finally received in the bank account of KRBL Ltd, in which he is one of the director". The agency has attached assets worth Rs 16.29 crore in this case till now and it has "prayed for the confiscation" of these immovable properties in its prosecution complaint, it said. The ED had registered a criminal complaint under PMLA after studying a CBI FIR against Embraer SA of Brazil, unknown officials of the Ministry of Defence, alleged middleman Vipin Khanna, Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd of Singapore and others. The ED had alleged that "Embraer, Brazil engaged Vipin Khanna to secure the contract for supplying three fully modified EMB-145 aircrafts to Government of India as platform for Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) project". The ED and the CBI are probing alleged payment of $5.70 million as commission to seal the deal, officials sources had earlier said. This is one of the defence deals of the previous UPA regime at the Centre, that the two central agencies are probing, besides the AgustaWestland choppers deal case and the Pilatus aircraft deal. The deal for three aircraft, which were to be used by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for air-borne radar systems, was inked with Embraer in 2008. According to defence procurement rules of India, middlemen are strictly barred in defence deals. A Brazilian newspaper report had alleged that that the company (Embraer) had taken the services of middlemen to clinch deals in Saudi Arabia and India. Embraer, while reacting to the case in the past, had said, "Since 2011, Embraer has publicly reported that it has been conducting an extensive internal investigation and cooperating with the authorities on investigations regarding alleged violations of the (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) FCPA." "The company voluntarily expanded the scope of the investigation, systematically reporting the progress of the case to the market. The company is not party of the legal proceedings in Brazil. Therefore, it does not have access to the information contained therein," it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-files-charge-sheet-in-embraer-defence-deal-money-laundering-case-925390.html

After five rounds of talks with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and informal deliberations with Home Minister Amit Shah, the agitating farmers received a seven-point proposal from the government addressing concerns flagged by them over the reforms. On apprehensions of farmers that the reforms would impact Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis, the government proposed to allow state government levy taxes at par with such markets in private trading areas. Another amendment seeks to grant powers to state governments to frame rules to register private traders as against the new law that allows anybody with a PAN card to buy directly from farmers. The government has approved a framework for the proliferation of public Wi-Fi networks through PM WANI scheme, Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Wednesday. PM Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM WANI) would unleash a massive Wi-Fi revolution in the country, Prasad said. This would entail a complete framework involving multiple elements -- Public Data Office (PDO), Public Data Office Aggregators and app providers.   As many as nine states have completed One Nation One Ration Card reform following which the central government has allowed them to raise an additional Rs 23,523 crore, said an official release on Wednesday. The states which have successfully completed the Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms are Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is the biggest beneficiary with an additional borrowing window of Rs 4,851 crore, followed by Karnataka Rs 4,509 crore and Gujarat Rs 4,352 crore.   The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved Rs 22,810 crore outlay for a new employment scheme that aims at encouraging businesses to do fresh hiring. Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana, the government will for two years provide employee and employer contribution to the retirement fund for new hires by businesses and entities, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said. The scheme would till 2023 entail an outgo of Rs 22,810 crore and would benefit around 58.5 lakh employees.   A certain section of people may be hesitant to take Covid-19 vaccine but not biotechnology industry veteran Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, who said on Wednesday she will get vaccinated though its durability is not known as of now. The Executive Chairperson of Bengaluru-headquartered biotech major Biocon supported the unprecedented speed in taking the vaccine from the development stage to approval process. "This is an unprecedented pandemic and extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures," Mazumdar-Shaw told PTI in an interview.   Earth remains on course to warm more than 3 degrees Celsius by the century's end despite a dip in greenhouse gas emissions due to the pandemic and pledges to curb pollution, the UN said Wednesday. In its annual assessment of emissions levels, the UN's Environment Programme found that 2020's 7-percent fall in carbon pollution would have "negligible impact" on warming without a broad and rapid shift away from fossil fuels.   Two allergic reactions were reported on the first day of the rollout of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the head of Britain's medicine regulator said on Wednesday. "Last evening, we were looking at two case reports of allergic reactions. We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn't a feature," June Raine, Chief Executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told lawmakers. "But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we've had this experience in the vulnerable populations, the groups who have been selected as a priority, we get that advice to the field immediately."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-centre-proposes-significant-changes-to-three-farm-sector-laws-925406.html

They also said they will block the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra expressways on or before December 12, and all the roads entering into the national capital, one-by-one if their demands are unmet. Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka told a press conference here that there was nothing new in the government's proposal sent to them on Wednesday, and that it was "completely rejected" by the 'Sanyukta Kisan Committee'. Farmer leader Jangvir Singh said that their unions may consider if the government sends another proposal.  Kakka said the farmers have decided to intensify their agitation, and that they will block all roads leading to Delhi one by one if the three farm laws are not scrapped. Another farmer leader, Darshan Pal, said the proposals sent by Union Home Minister Amit Shah contained the same things as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told farmer leaders in previous meetings.   All the highways to Delhi will be blocked on December 14 as part of the nationwide protest, he said. The Union Home Minister had Tuesday evening met 13 representatives of the protesting farmers, but the their talk failed to break the impasse.

09-12-2020||National||Delhi HC asks Centre to verify if all e-commerce entities are displaying country of origin on products||The Delhi High Court directed the Centre on Wednesday to find out and inform it whether e-commerce entities, like Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, are complying with the requirement of displaying 'country of origin' on products sold on their platforms. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan directed the central government to file a fresh affidavit after verifying the e-commerce entities' claims of complying with the relevant laws and rules and to also keep in mind the objections raised by the petitioner who has contended that there are still ambiguities in displaying country of origin on products sold by them. The court was hearing a PIL by Amit Shukla, a lawyer, seeking directions to the Centre to ensure that the name of the manufacturing country is displayed on products being sold on e-commerce sites.  During the hearing, Shukla said there were major ambiguities with regard to products being sold on e-commerce sites including that there are several countries of origin on one product, country of origin is foreign but item is shown as made in India and country of origin being different from manufacturing country. He also claimed, in his rejoinder affidavit, that even till date the e-commerce entities "are grossly flouting the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules, 2011 and Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 and has sought that prosecution be initiated against those found flouting the rules. The e-commerce entities like Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and Decathlon have claimed that they are displaying country of origin on products sold on their platforms as required under the Legal Metrology Act and Rules. Therefore, the instant petition has become infructuous, they contended. The counsel for Decathlon, during the hearing, said sometimes products are manufactured in one country and then assembled in another or in India and that accounts for the different countries of origin and manufacture. Shukla, in his plea, has sought implementation of the Legal Metrology Act 2009 and the rules framed under it which mandate that country of origin has to be displayed on products being sold on e-commerce websites. The petition has claimed that the mandate was not being enforced with respect to e-commerce entities. It has contended that enforcement of the mandate was important in the current scenario when citizens intend to comply with the central government's appeal to promote and purchase Indian goods and not from some neighbouring countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-verify-if-all-e-commerce-entities-are-displaying-country-of-origin-on-products-925413.html

Special judge PP Rajvaidya rejected the bail applications of former CFO Anil Khandelwal and former internal auditor Naresh Jain. They were arrested underthe provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in October this year. According to the ED, its probe found that Yes Bank had a total outstanding of Rs 3,642 crore in respect of Cox & Kings Group of Companies (CKG). Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor and DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were arrested by the ED early this year. The agency has alleged that Kapoor, 62, entered into a criminal conspiracy with Kapil Wadhawan, DHFL promoter for round tripping of funds where loans from Yes Bank to DHFL landed in companies owned by daughters of Kapoor, DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd, officials had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/court-denies-bail-to-2-former-executives-of-cox-and-kings-group-925417.html
09-12-2020||National||LAC stand-off: Signs of stalemate in India-China talks again, Jaishankar says ties in 'most difficult phase'||The relation between India and China is in its “most difficult phase”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday, amid signs of yet another impasse in the talks between the two neighbouring nations to resolve the seven-month-long stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. “We are today probably at the most difficult phase of our relationship with China, certainly in the last 30 to 40 years...or even more,” he said, pointing out that the June 15 violent face-off at Galwan Valley resulted in first military casualties on the disputed boundary between the two nations since 1975. During an online discussion hosted by the Lowy Institute of Australia, he said that the relations between India and China are “profoundly disturbed” as the communist country’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) amassed a large number of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. The External Affairs Minister’s comment on the state of relations between the two nations came just a day after China hinted that its negotiation with India for resolution of the stand-off would remain suspended, unless New Delhi acted on the “consensus” the two sides had reached during earlier rounds of parleys. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had held the eighth round of talks on November 6. Though the talks had ended without any breakthrough, the two sides had agreed to have another round of meetings soon. But neither the military commanders, nor the diplomats of the two nations had any engagement in the past four weeks to end the stand-off. The Chinese PLA not only reinforced and fortified its forward positions along the LAC, but also built roads, particularly on the northern bank of Pangong Tso (lake), instead of preparing to pull back its soldiers from the face-off scenes. China also inked a new defence cooperation pact with Pakistan last week, ostensibly to step up pressure on India. The Chinese Air Force also recently sent fighter jets to a base of the Pakistani Air Force closer to Pakistan-India border for a joint exercise. Beijing also recently cancelled the launch of a commemorative postal stamp to mark 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India, alleging that it had not received the feedback from New Delhi. Jaishankar on Wednesday referred to a series of agreements India and China signed to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, beginning with the one signed in 1993, which prohibited deployment of large numbers of soldiers along the disputed boundary between the two nations. He alleged that China had violated its agreements with India and “literally brought tens of thousands of soldiers in full military preparation mode right to the LAC in Ladakh”. He said that Beijing had so far given New Delhi five differing explanations for its build-up along the LAC. “Naturally the relationship would be profoundly disturbed by this,” said the External Affairs Minister. Though India and China had agreed upon a roadmap for mutual withdrawal of front-line troops from the face-off scenes along the LAC in early July, the process had come to a halt within a fortnight, with the Chinese PLA declining to completely pull back soldiers from several “points of friction” along the LAC – like Depsang Y junction, Gogra Post and the northern bank of Pangong Tso. Though the senior military commanders of the two sides had held the fifth round of talks on August 2, they had failed to end the stalemate. After Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a meeting in Moscow on September 10, the military commanders of the two nations had again met on the LAC on September 21 – ending an almost six-week-long hiatus. They had agreed to stop further deployment of soldiers on the face-off points, but had not been able to reach an agreement to restart the stalled process of pulling back troops already deployed on the LAC. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had discussed during the seventh and eighth rounds of talks in October and November a plan for restarting the mutual disengagement of troops from the face-off scenes, beginning with the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso. The plan, however, could not be implemented yet as the Indian Army turned down the Chinese PLA’s proposal for creating a moratorium on patrolling between Finger 3 and Finger 8 on the northern bank of the lake. China on Tuesday said that its further talks with India to resolve the seven-month-long military stand-off along the disputed boundary between the two nations would depend on implementation of the consensus reached during the previous rounds of parleys. “China and India have been in close communication on the border issue through diplomatic and military channels to further ease tensions,” Hua Chunying, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Government, said in Beijing. “The two sides will hold consultations over specific arrangements for further talks on the basis of acting on existing consensus reached through previous talks.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lac-stand-off-signs-of-stalemate-in-india-china-talks-again-jaishankar-says-ties-in-most-difficult-phase-925427.html

Broadcasters NDTV and CNBC-TV18 reported that India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) had sought more data from the drugmakers after deliberating on applications made in the past three days.   A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that a decision on the vaccines would be taken "in toto" and it was too early to say whether they would be rejected or accepted. India's health ministry denied the reports in a statement on Twitter. The government had said on Tuesday that some vaccines may be approved in the coming weeks. The Serum Institute of India, which is the local manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine, only applied for emergency approval on Monday. The SII did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bharat Biotech declined to comment. The CDSCO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NDTV said the CDSCO did not consider a similar application from Pfizer Inc because their US experts could not attend the Wednesday meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-denies-reports-it-rejected-emergency-approval-for-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shot-925433.html

A five-judge Constitution bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan preferred to list a batch of matters for consideration from January 25 onwards. The court issued notice to Attorney General K K Venugopal as the matter also involved the 102nd Constitution Amendment Act related to grant of constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Maharashtra, asked the court to modify its order passed on September 9, 2020, to allow the reservation in jobs and education. He said when the Constitution bench takes up a matter, it can decide upon the interim order. At the time when stay order came, the recruitment process for the entire 2,185 people had been undertaken. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, they could not be issued appointment letter, he said. He said 16% quota was allowed in 2018 after state Assembly approved a report by Justice Gaikwad commission, set up to find out if Marathas constituted a separate class. In a detailed report, Justice Gaikwad said Marathas constituted 30 % of the population. The Bombay HC held the law as valid even though it exceeded 50%, generally thought to be a benchmark as per the Indra Sawhney judgement by a nine-judge bench. Maintaining that the Indra Sawhney judgement cannot remain cast in stone forever, Rohatgi said the 50% limit has been breached a number of times. In 1993, Tamil Nadu breached it to 69%.  "It was our constitutional duty to uplift the backward educationally and socially especially due to last 300 years of oppression. Of course, it has a snowballing effect. It depends on facts and figures every 10 years," he said. The counsel also asserted that if more seats have to be created to adjust general category without disturbing the quota, then certain amelioration measures can be taken. The court, however, said the application filed by the state to vacate the interim order, was required for final hearing. "Wait for some more time. Let us see if the Act survives. It has to be immediately heard and decided," the bench said. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said several states have breached 50% limit for reservations and the instant case would have huge ramifications. He said, "We should collate all matters pending relating to the breach of 50% limit and hear it together."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-maratha-quota-in-january-refrains-from-modifying-stay-order-925440.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian held that she was disqualified to contest elections in view of her convictions in two separate cases. "The disqualification under Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act will continue so long as there is no stay of conviction. In the case on hand, the petitioner could not obtain a stay of conviction but obtained only a stay of execution of the sentence. Hence her nominations were validly rejected by the Returning Officer," the bench said. According to the provision in the RP Act, a candidate is disqualified to contest an election for six years from the date of conviction. "The petitioner was imposed with a punishment of imprisonment for a period (of three years) not less than two years in two independent criminal cases. Therefore, her case is covered by Section 8(3) of the Act," the bench said. Nair, for her part, claimed since the sentence in both the cases was suspended, it was sufficient to save her from the applicability of Section 8(3). She also pointed out in the Amethi constituency of Uttar Pradesh, despite the disclosure of the very same information about her conviction and pendency of appeals, her nomination was accepted. She contended that two different yardsticks cannot be applied, so long as the sentence of imprisonment remained suspended. The court rejected her plea, saying, "Merely because the Returning Officer in Amethi Constituency committed an error in overlooking this fact, the petitioner cannot plead estoppel against statutory prescription". The top court, however, said that the Kerala HC was "wrong" and adopted "improper" procedure in rejecting her election petitions on October 31, 2019, on the ground of incurable defects, without giving her opportunity. "The procedure adopted by the High Court cannot be approved. The HC was wrong in thinking that the defective verification of the election petition was a pointer to the game plan of the election petitioner to disown the pleadings at a later stage, especially after making serious allegations against the former Chief Minister," the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-dismisses-election-petition-by-solar-scam-case-accused-saritha-nair-925442.html
09-12-2020||National||Stop playing games with farmers: Shiromani Akali Dal to Centre||The Shiromani Akali Dal on Wednesday asked the BJP-led Centre to “stop playing games” with innocent farmers and withdraw the three farm laws "immediately and unconditionally". The SAD, which had pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance amid the consistent digs at it by the Congress after the enactment of the laws, also backed the farmers’ rejection of the Centre’s proposal on these laws. “These proposals were nothing but delaying and diversionary tactics and tricks which have rightly been rejected by the farmers,” it said. "We are with the farmers in everything and in every way," it added. Farmer leaders on Wednesday rejected a government proposal on the three contentious agriculture-marketing laws and said they would intensify their agitation against the legislations with a nationwide protest on December 14. In a statement here, senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia said there was nothing new in these proposals. "These are the same proposals which had been rejected by the SAD before quitting the government and the NDA to stand with farmers,” he said. "It is so tragic that the country's 'annadata', the farmers, are battling cruel and biting cold along with their family members ranging from barely 14-day-old infants to elders in their late eighties and nineties," said the Akali leader. He urged the government to "abandon its stubborn refusal to listen to farmers and announce an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of their demands". “The government says the farm laws are meant for farmers' welfare. If the farmers don't want these, it is absolutely unreasonable, wrong and undemocratic to thrust these laws upon them," said the former minister. The senior Akali leader expressed grave concern over how "our country's soft and civilised image is taking a huge beating with the government's repressive handling of a peaceful stir”. “What an irony that people and institutions from all over the world, including the UN, have felt deeply touched and extended solidarity with our brave but beleaguered farmers while our own elected government continues to be utterly callous and insensitive to their sufferings," alleged Majithia. “The unspeakable miseries, which the country's breadwinners are braving, present a touching human spectacle that can move even the most heartless enemy,” he said. The Akali leader alleged that the government's “apathy” towards its people and its "love and preference for the rich corporates" have brought back memories of the "colonial rulers". "The pity is greater because the rulers today are not foreigners but our own elected representatives. People elected them in the hope that they would address their problems as does a parent in a family. Unfortunately, the parent has turned cruelly and heartlessly against its own children," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/stop-playing-games-with-farmers-shiromani-akali-dal-to-centre-925467.html

The chargesheet said that Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a "secessionist outfit floated in the garb of human rights advocacy group", spearheaded the campaign and was a frontal organisation of Khalistan terrorist outfits operating from countries, including Pakistan. The SFJ has its offices in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia among others. Those named in the chargesheet filed in a Delhi special court include Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Avtar Singh Pannun, Gurpreet Singh Baagi, Harpreet Singh, Paramjit Singh, Sarabjit Singh Bannur, Amardeep Singh Purewal and JS Dhaliwal. The others are Kulwant Singh Mothada, Dupinderjit Singh, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Kulwant Singh, Harjaap Singh, Sarabjit Singh, Jatinder Singh Grewal and Himmat Singh. Under the Referendum campaign, the NIA claimed, social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and a number of websites have been launched. They were used to "propagate sedition as well as enmity on the ground of region and religion, radicalise impressionable youth and cause disturbance to peace and harmony and to raise funds for terrorist activities". The SFJ has been attempting to undermine the security of the Indian State by instigating Sikh personnel in the Indian Army to rise up in mutiny against India. It was also trying to radicalise youth of Kashmir and openly extending support for secession of Kashmir from India, the NIA said. Pannun, who is named in the chargesheet is spearheading the 'Referendum 2020', has been "found actively" in touch with UK-based Babbar Khalsa operative Paramjit Singh, Canada-based Khalistan Tiger Force's Hardeep Singh Nijjar and International Sikh Youth Federation's Malkit Singh Fauji besides Punjab-based "hardliners". The notification designating Pannun as a terrorist said he has been issuing appeals through social media to "Punjab-based gangsters and youth to fight for the cause of the independent state of Khalistan, challenging the sovereignty, integrity and security of the country He has demanded and advocating a separate State Khalistan". Paramjit Singh was involved in Kanishka bombing in 1985, assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh in 1995, bomb blast in Delhi Liberty and Satyam cinema halls in 2005 and Shingar cinema hall in Ludhiana in 2007. Nijjar is actively involved in operationalizing, networking, training and financing Khalistan Tiger Force module members, according to the notification branding him as a terrorist.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nia-files-chargesheet-against-16-khalistani-operatives-925479.html

Siddhant Batra, who hails from Agra, had lost his seat after he clicked at “wrong” link, meant to withdraw from the process. A three-judge bench presided over Justice S K Kaul took note of the submissions of lawyer Pralhad Paranjpe on behalf of the student and asked the IIT Bombay to grant provisional admission to him. The bench issued notice to the prestigious institution and fixed his plea for hearing after winter break. The candidate questioned the Bombay High Court's November 23 order which dismissed his petition by noting the submissions of the IIT that it cannot intervene at this stage as all the seats for the course were full and the admission rules had to be followed. It had said Siddhant could apply again next year for JEE (Advanced). Siddhant had secured All India Rank (AIR) of 270 in JEE Advanced exams. He sought a direction for creating an additional seat on humanitarian grounds. In the plea, Siddhant, who lives with his grandparents following the death of his parents, said he had worked hard against all odds to crack the IIT-JEE exams. The petition said he had lost his father when he was a child and was brought up by his mother who died in 2018. As per his plea, while filling out the admission process online, he came upon a page with ‘freeze’ option, which he thought meant confirming the seat and the completion of his admission process. “On October 31, 2020, when he was surfing the IIT portal to check for further updates, he came upon a link which carried a declaration that read ‘I would like to withdraw from the seat allocation process of JoSAA (Joint Seat Allocation Authority’,” the petition said. In November 2020, when the final list of students was uploaded on the IIT portal, his name was not included.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-relief-for-teen-who-lost-iit-bombay-seat-due-to-wrong-click-925486.html

He also alleged that Muslims were earlier misled over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but as those efforts did not succeed, now farmers were being told that they will face losses due to the new laws. Danve was speaking at the inauguration of a health centre at Kolte Takli in Badnapur taluka of Maharashtra's Jalna district. "The agitation that is going on is not that of farmers. China and Pakistan have a hand behind this. Muslims in this country were incited first. What was said (to them)? That NRC is coming, CAA is coming and Muslims will have to leave this country in six months. Did a single Muslim leave? "Those efforts didn't succeed and now farmers are being told that they will face losses. This is the conspiracy of other countries," Danve said. The minister, however, did not elaborate on what basis he claimed that the two neighbouring countries are behind the farmers' protests. "The government is buying wheat at Rs 24 and rice at Rs 34 per kg and giving it to people at Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kg respectively. The government is spending Rs 1.75 lakh crore on the subsidy for this. The government is spending money for the welfare of farmers," the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs said. "These initiatives by the central government show that it is ready to spend money for farmers, but others don't like it," the BJP leader claimed. Danve said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the prime minister of farmers and none of his decisions would be against farmers. The Shiv Sena slammed Danve for dragging China and Pakistan in the farmers' stir, saying the BJP leaders are out of their senses. Sena spokesperson and former Union minister Arvind Sawant told PTI that the BJP leaders are out of their senses because they lost power in Maharashtra. "They don't know what they are speaking," the Sena leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-pakistan-behind-farmers-protest-bjp-minister-raosaheb-danve-925494.html

"Every general and standalone health insurer, who has been issued a certificate of registration to transact general and/or health insurance business, shall mandatorily offer this product," said the draft guidelines issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). General and health insurers should offer the product from April 1, 2021 onwards. The insurance market is having a wide variety of personal accident insurance products, the draft said adding that each product has unique features and the insuring public may find it a challenge to choose an appropriate product. "Therefore, with the objective of having a standard product with common coverage and policy wordings across the industry, the Authority has decided to mandate all general and health insurers to offer the standard personal accident insurance product," said the draft. The cover would offer protection against death, permanent disablement, or partial disablement due to accidents. The standard product would be offered with a policy term of one year. It would also cover expenses towards hospitalisation. The draft, on which comments from stakeholders have been invited by December 18, said the standard product should have the basic mandatory covers. The covers should be uniform across the market. The insurer may determine the price keeping in view the covers proposed to be offered subject to complying with the norms, it said. "Minimum sum insured shall be Rs 2.5 lakh and a maximum sum insured shall be Rs 1 crore," the draft said. Beyond that, insurers can offer on their own and can use the same name for the product if all terms and conditions remain the same, it added. On base covers, it proposed that benefit equal to 100 per cent of sum insured shall be payable on death of the insured person, due to an injury sustained in an accident during the policy period, provided that the insured person's death occurs within 12 months from the date of the accident. Benefit equal to 100 per cent of sum insured has also been proposed in the case of 'permanent total disablement' subject to conditions. It further said following an admissible claim of the insured person under the policy towards death or permanent total disability of the insured person, "a one-time educational grant of 10 per cent of the base sum insured, each, shall be payable, for a maximum of two dependent children of the insured" subject to certain conditions. Also, sum insured should be increased by five per cent in respect of each claim free policy year, provided that the policy is renewed without a break subject to maximum of 50 per cent of the sum insured. If a claim is made in any particular year, the cumulative bonus accrued may be reduced at the same rate at which it has accrued, IRDAI has proposed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/irdai-proposes-standard-personal-accident-product-from-april-1-925514.html

Karnataka’s Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee expects a second spike in Covid-19 cases in January or February based on the disease progression in other states. The positivity rate for Karnataka is 7.6% higher than the country's average of 6.1%. India and France are among some of the world’s most Covid-19 affected nations that are yet to witness a second surge in the number of infections as witnessed by the USA, Russia, UK, Spain, Brazil and Turkey. Based on the global experience that shows the occurrence of a second wave three to four months after the first wave, Karnataka apprehends a second spike in January- February 2021. The IT-BT state is not alone in such an assessment. The Maharashtra government is also expecting the second wave in January-February, 2021. With the rise in cases in Europe, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray warned people of a second possible wave which he referred to a tsunami. On September 11, Maharashtra recorded its peak of 24,886 cases and four days later maximum deaths of 515 in a day was reported. This happened nearly a month after the Ganesh Utsav. But a month down the line, there was an improvement of the situation between Navratri and Diwali with positive cases dipping to 2,535 in a single day on November 16. The state’s Pune-based Directorate of Health Services issued a circular on November 11 warning of a second wave, but the situation remained somewhat stabilised since then. “If there is another corona wave in Maharashtra, it will cost everyone dearly,’’ said Maharashtra public health and family welfare minister Rajesh Tope said. Kerala too fears a second wave in the coming months after the local body elections while officials in Gujarat are of the opinion that the second wave has already passed. In Gujarat, the post-Diwali period saw a surge in Covid-19 cases forcing the government to impose complete curfew in Ahmedabad city, the worst affected, for two days while night curfew in all four major cities. "We believe the so-called second wave of infection was caused mainly due to relaxation extended to commercial units in view of Diwali festivities when people violated mask rules and social distancing,” said a senior Gujarat health official. The eastern states, on the other hand, have no such concerns. The Covid-19 situation is no more alarming in Bihar, which witnessed the first assembly election amidst the pandemic followed by Chhath festival in November, where large numbers of people congregate on the banks of the rivers. Both events passed over with relatively fewer casualties. Little wonder, Bihar’s Home Department this week revised its guidelines and allowed 200 persons (from the earlier limit of 150 persons) to attend any marriage function in the State. Neighbouring West Bengal’s Director of Health Services Ajay Chakraborty told DH, “The second wave arrived in the state when migrant workers returned (in June-July). The second wave is already in decline and almost over.” Northern states like Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan experienced a second spike (third in case of Delhi) in positive cases. But the numbers were never too high to trigger any nation-wide alarm. On other hand, no surge is visible in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana as well as in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir where Covid-19 numbers are steadily going down.

While Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech is conducting a three-phase clinical trial -- the third phase involves testing the vaccine's efficacy on 26,000 individuals -- for its indigenous shot, Pune-based Serum Institute has been asked to undertake a phase-2/3 bridging study on 1,600 persons to examine the vaccine's safety and immune responses on Indians since the efficacy of the original vaccine is being tested in multiple trials abroad. SII vaccine is the same as the AstraZeneca-Oxford University one.  Though none of the Indian trials have been completed, the two companies applied for the emergency use authorisation earlier this week after pharmaceutical giant Pfizer made a similar application before the DCGI seeking an EAU licence. Pfizer also sought a waiver from the clinical trial requirements. While considering the SII application, the regulator asked for updated safety data of phase-2/3 clinical trials in India, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India, along with the outcome of the assessment of the UK regulator –- the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. As for the Hyderabad-based company, the expert panel formed by the regulator suggested that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase-3 clinical trial for further consideration of the EAU application. None of the EAU applications has been rejected, health ministry sources said. The Pfizer case was not considered as the company sought more time to make its presentation. As many as nine vaccines are in various stages of clinical evaluation in India at the moment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dcgi-asks-sii-bharat-biotech-for-more-data-on-covid-19-vaccine-925524.html
09-12-2020||National Politics||AAP claims Arvind Kejriwal's movement still 'restricted', Delhi Police deny claim||The AAP on Wednesday alleged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's movement is still "restricted" and the main gate of his residence remains closed at the behest of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, a claim denied by the city police. Police sources said that the chief minister left his residence around 11 am to attend a programme. However, a senior Delhi Police officer dismissed the claim as "totally baseless". Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that there was an atmosphere of "undeclared emergency" around the chief minister's residence. "I am telling you with full responsibility that the movement of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is still restricted at the behest of the (Union) home minister. The main gate of the chief minister's residence is still closed," Chadha said. "In a way, there is an atmosphere of undeclared emergency. All this, just because we did not allow the stadiums to be converted into prisons for farmers," he said. A senior police officer said that there is no restriction on any kind of movement of the chief minister. "The police deployment outside the chief minister's residence is part of security protocol," he said. According to police sources, Kejriwal left his residence around 11 am to attend a programme. On Tuesday, Kejriwal came out of his residence after hours of drama outside. Addressing party workers, he said the Centre tried its best to ensure that he did not step out. He said that if he was not stopped, he would have gone and supported farmers in their Bharat Bandh movement. Kejriwal claimed that the Centre was "very angry" as his government did not allow Delhi stadiums to be used as prisons for farmers. "We faced a lot of pressure to allow the use of stadiums as temporary prisons, but we did not give permission and I feel this helped the movement. But since then the Centre has been very angry," the chief minister said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws has failed to cut ice with the protesting farmers who have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the legislation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/aap-claims-arvind-kejriwals-movement-still-restricted-delhi-police-deny-claim-925312.html

Mayors of North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, Jai Prakash, Anamika Mithilesh and Nirmal Jain, accompanied by many women councilors, have been sitting outside Kejriwal's Flagstaff Road residence since Monday. They are demanding payment of "unpaid" dues of Rs 13000 crore from the Delhi government. "Although Kejriwal calls himself an 'Aam Aadmi' (common man), he is basically against common man. That is why his government has not paid dues of Rs 13000 crore to municipal corporations which would help in payment of salaries to sanitation workers, doctors, nurses and other employees," Tiwari said. If the chief minister was sensitive, he would pay dues to corporations whose employees are fighting the pandemic as corona warriors, said Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, who was also present at the protest venue. Earlier, BJP MPs Meenakshi Lekhi and Parvesh Verma met the protesting municipal corporation leaders on Tuesday and joined the protest. AAP leaders including Kejriwal have alleged "corruption and mismanagement" at the three municipal corporations ruled by the BJP and claimed all due funds have been paid to them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-mps-manoj-tiwari-gautam-gambhir-join-mayors-dharna-outside-cms-residence-925315.html

09-12-2020||National Politics||Opposition delegation meets President; seeks repeal of farm laws||A delegation of Opposition leaders led by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met President Ram Nath Kovind seeking repeal of the three farm laws. Besides Pawar, the five-member delegation of Opposition leaders included former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D Raja and DMK leader TKS Elangovan. The opposition parties are also planning to call a meeting of like-minded parties to chart a joint strategy to address the issue. “We met the President and informed him of our view regarding the three farm laws. We have asked for their repeal. We informed the President that it is critical that they are taken back,” Rahul told reporters after meeting the President.   Yechury said that the memorandum that they had submitted to the President had the support of more than 20 political parties but not all could visit the Rashtrapati Bhavan on account of Covid-19 protocol. Rahul said the entire Opposition will stand by the farmers in demanding the repeal of the farm sector laws. "If the farmers do not stand up for their rights now, they will never be able to stand up. We all are with you. Nobody can push you back. You are Hindustan," he said. Pawar, a former agriculture minister, said that various political parties have requested President that these farm laws should be repealed as they were not discussed with either stakeholders or in the Select Committee of Parliament. “All opposition parties had requested for an in-depth discussion on farm bills and that they should be sent to a select committee, but unfortunately no suggestion was accepted and the Bills were passed in a hurry,” Pawar said, adding that it was the responsibility of the government to resolve the issue. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-delegation-meets-president-seeks-repeal-of-farm-laws-925415.html
09-12-2020||National Politics||BJP's great dilemma over farm laws: Bend, back off or battle it out?||The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre seems to be in a dilemma on whether to bend and yield to the demands of protesters over the farm laws, back off or battle it out. The farmers' protest has entered the 14th day and the Opposition parties are trying to create a 2015 land bill moment, having supported a Bharat Bandh, taking a delegation to the President and demanding a special Parliament session to discuss the issue. The government is trying to strike a balance between ruling out withdrawal of the laws altogether and promising to tweak it to mollify the farmers on the streets. The BJP is declaring that its victory in the recent election results in a dozen states suggest that the farm laws had the farmers' backing. Wednesday's results of Panchayat polls in Rajasthan in which the BJP has made substantial gains denting the support base of the ruling Congress have only added to this narrative. The BJP bagged 1,989 of the 4,371 panchayat seats, which is 137 more than Congress. On a day when the government proposed a written assurance that the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime for procurement will continue, the Rajasthan results came as a shot in the arm which the BJP described as "farmers' mandate". This is perceived to help the BJP battle the crisis of perception it is facing in agriculture-dominated states of Punjab and Haryana. "This victory is a symbol of the trust the poor, the villagers, the farmers and labourers' repose in Prime Minister Narendra Modi," BJP chief J P Nadda tweeted. Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar claimed that the results indicate this is a "farmers’ mandate and a vote for farm reforms". After meeting a group of farmer leaders supporting the agriculture laws on Monday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had expressed confidence that the government will "handle" the agitations. However, two days later, on Wednesday after Bharat Bandh, the government hastened to break the logjam bringing in new proposals. With farmers rejecting even the fresh proposals, a further climbdown by the government is expected as it cannot afford to keep the pot of farm politics boiling when elections in a number of states are just months away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjps-great-dilemma-over-farm-laws-bend-back-off-or-battle-it-out-925464.html
09-12-2020||National Politics||PM Modi has worked more for farmers in 6 years than earlier governments did since 1947, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||Amid the ongoing farmers’ stir against the three central farm laws, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done much more work for farmers in last six years compared to what previous governments did since Independence. While inaugurating two sugar mills in this eastern region of the state, Adityanath also attacked the opposition, saying some people are not able to appreciate the welfare work being done for farmers by the BJP government. The chief minister was here to inaugurate a sugar mill at Pipraich in Gorakhpur district. He also inaugurated the second mill at Munderwa in Basti district from here digitally as his helicopter was unable to take off for Basti due to bad weather. Accusing the previous governments of selling 21 sugar mills in the region at throwaway prices after suppressing farmers’ agitation against the move, Adityanath expressed satisfaction that his government was able to start two mills with “four times higher processing capacity. He also promised to open many more mills after the pandemic is controlled. The chief minister said besides employing a large number of youths in the region, the two mills, the first ones to produce 'sulpherless' sugar in the state, would help the region register its name globally by the export of their product. Referring to PM-KISAN scheme, the chief minister said the Modi government is directly sending Rs 6,000 per year to each of the farmers’ account, which has “made mediators restless as due to technology they are not able to loot farmers' benefits”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-has-worked-more-for-farmers-in-6-years-than-earlier-governments-did-since-1947-says-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-925496.html
09-12-2020||North and Central||Amit Shah's meeting with farmer leaders ends in stalemate||Home Minister Amit Shah has rejected the demand to repeal the three farm laws after meeting a small group of farmers’ leaders on Tuesday night, even as farmers across the country staged Bharat Bandh in a show of strength. The shutdown call received a mixed response, with northern states like Punjab and Haryana reporting widespread protests. It evoked a partial response in Karnataka. On Tuesday night, Shah went into a “huddle” with a few farmer leaders. After the meeting, leaders announced that there would be no further talks with the government. “The home minister told us that a proposal will be given to the farmer leaders by 11 am on Wednesday. We will hold a meeting over the government’s proposal and decide the future course of action,” Jagjit Singh Dalewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union-Sidhupur, told DH after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting with Shah. Dalewal said the “refrain of the government again was to have a point-by-point discussion on our concerns”. “We told them we have had enough of these discussions and now want a result from the government,” he said. Shah called 13 leaders -- eight from Punjab-based peasant unions and five from broader national organisations of farmers -- for an informal meeting on a short notice, but no breakthrough could be achieved after nearly four hour of discussions. Shah's efforts, a day before the scheduled sixth round of talks between the government and farmer unions, were aimed at ending the protests on Delhi's borders that have been going on for 12 days. At the meeting, Shah requested farmer leaders "to end the agitation and said the government will send a proposal in writing.... Some farmer unions asked why the government did not consult them before bringing these laws. To which, the ministers...said there is no point in looking back," Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh national president Shiv Kumar Kakka said. Three union ministers who have been leading the government's consultations with the agitating farmers -- Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Parkash -- were part of the meeting. Farmer leader Darshan Pal of AIKSCC, who attended the meeting with Shah, said, "The central government will send us a note on our demands tomorrow.... There won't be any meeting between the Union government and farmer leaders tomorrow." All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah said after the meeting that ended around midnight, "Shah-ji said the government will give tomorrow in writing the amendments which the government is keen to (make). We will decide about attending the meeting after discussing the written amendments with all 40 farmer unions." While there was no official words from the government on the status of Wednesday's scheduled meeting, many union leaders said there is no question of attending it and that they would take a call on their next course of action after studying the government's written proposal. Farmer leaders have claimed that the laws will benefit corporates and end the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime. The government has maintained that it is committed to the welfare of farmers and have presented these laws as major reforms for their benefits.

The encounter erupted after Army’s 55-Rashtriya Rifles and J&K police launched a cordon-and-search operation (CASO) in Tiken, Pulwama, 32 km from here, during wee hours of Wednesday following ‘specific’ information about the presence of militants there, police said. During the search operation, militants fired at the forces triggering a gun battle in which three militants were killed while a civilian was injured. Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar while confirming the death of three militants in the encounter said they were locals and affiliated with Al-Badr outfit. Since the beginning of district development council (DDC) polls in Kashmir in the last week of November, there has been a decline in anti-militancy operations by the security forces. Today’s encounter was the first between militants and security forces in December. A senior police officer said the focus of security agencies was to ensure violence-free polls at the moment “due to which hot-pursuit of militants has been stopped for some time.” “However, wherever any information regarding the movement of militants is received, security forces act accordingly. The anti-militancy operations will increase as soon the DDC polls end,” he added. This year security forces have killed 201 militants, including 30 foreigners, in 90 operations across Jammu and Kashmir. As many as 157 militants were killed in Kashmir in 2019 while the number was 257 in 2018 which was the highest in a decade.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/3-al-badr-militants-killed-in-kashmir-s-pulwama-925251.html

The army also conducted a medical and veterinary camp in Sumber panchayat, benefitting hundreds of nomadic Gujjar and Bakerwal community, a defence spokesperson said. Amid a pandemic, he said the army unit in Ramban district carried out distribution of ration and medical kits to 350 families residing in the areas of Sumbar, Dagnari, Banj, Bajon and Malpatti in consonance with its programme 'Corona Mukt Awam'. “The kit contains basic essential day to day needs of the people residing in remote and higher reaches of Ramban,” the spokesman said, adding at present the people residing in these areas are deprived of basic facilities due to remoteness of location and rugged terrain," the spokesperson said. He said the lack of road connectivity catalyses Covid-19 environment and makes it difficult for the local residents to make their ends meet, thus the project comes to them as a blessing. "The ration kit comprised of dal, rice, atta and cooking oil and medical Kits included soap, reusable face mask, and sanitiser,” he said. In another goodwill gesture, the spokesperson said army's battalion located at Gool under the aegis of Reasi-based Counter Insurgency Force (Uniform) organised a medical and veterinary camp for benefit of Gujjar and Bakerwal community staying in remote and inaccessible areas of Sumber in Ramban district.         The camp was organised with assistance from local administration, consequent to popular demand from the people, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-reaches-out-to-350-families-with-ration-in-jammu-and-kashmir-925339.html
09-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Centre ready to amend but won't repeal farm laws||Bowing to pressure from farmers, the Modi government on Wednesday proposed to make significant changes to the three farm sector laws, but rejected their demand for a repeal of the reforms. After five rounds of talks with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and informal deliberations with Home Minister Amit Shah, the agitating farmers received a seven-point proposal from the government addressing concerns flagged by them over the reforms. On apprehensions of farmers that the reforms would impact Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis, the government proposed to allow state government levy taxes at par with such markets in private trading areas. Another amendment seeks to grant powers to state governments to frame rules to register private traders as against the new law that allows anybody with a PAN card to buy directly from farmers. The government also expressed readiness to give a written assurance on continuing the practice of procurement of farm commodities at minimum support prices, but turned down the demand to make it a statutory right. The Centre also agreed to the farmers' demand to allow them to approach civil courts for settlement of disputes related to sale and purchase of farm produce, instead of settling the matter at the Sub-Divisional Magistrate level. The Centre also made it clear that the contract farming law does not permit sale, lease or mortgage of farm land nor does it allow the buyer of the crop to build any structure on the farm. The government also agreed to explicitly mention that the buyer of the crop cannot take loans on any kind of structure that is built on the farm nor can he stake claim to such a structure. On apprehension over attachment of farm land, the Centre said the new laws do not have any such provision but it is ready to incorporate any clarification in the Act in this regard. The Centre also made it clear that the Electricity (Amendment) Bill is at a consultation stage right now and there would be no changes in the existing system of payment of power bills.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-centre-ready-to-amend-but-wont-repeal-farm-laws-925362.html

According to sources in the government, a draft proposal in this regard has been prepared to amend the UP Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Rules 2014, which included the provision to deny inheritance rights to the sons and daughters, who did not take proper care of their parents. ''The draft proposal has been sent to the government,'' said an official here on Wednesday. He said that the existing rules were found wanting in ensuring proper care of the parents and senior citizens by their children. ''There have been several cases where the old parents were thrown out of their homes by their children....many such cases have reached the courts also,'' the official added. The official said that the parents would be able to lodge complaints with the sub-divisional magistrates and other competent authorities in case their children did not take care of them. The SDM or the other competent authority may take appropriate action against the uncaring children. The parents could also deny them a share in the property. ''Besides the children, the relatives of the aggrieved parents will also be included in the new rules,'' he added. According to the sources, the draft proposal had been prepared after conducting thorough research. ''The draft proposal is likely to be placed before the state cabinet's next meeting,'' the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-mulls-law-against-inheritance-rights-of-children-not-taking-care-of-parents-925396.html

Thousands of farmers camping at the Tikri borders are largely seen without the basic preventive measure against Covid-19 - protective masks. “The government has already tied a noose around our necks with these laws… we cannot afford to be afraid of coronavirus,” Gagandeep Singh, a farmer from Bhatinda in Punjab, said. He has been protesting at the Delhi-Haryana border for the last 10 days. Demonstrating for 12 straight days, the farmers have been demanding that the three laws be revoked. Sporting a long white beard, Gurvasan Singh said he was not afraid of the disease that has already killed over 1.4 lakh people in the country. “We are losing our rights. We do not have time to worry about coronavirus,” he said. According to Sachin Kumar from Delhi's Uttam Nagar, the government's refusal to hear the farmers' demands proved that it was creating the fear of the virus to shutdown the protest. Kumar, whose family has land in Uttar Pradesh mocked, "It seems that the virus will infect us exclusively." "What is shown on camera and the reality on ground is different,” he added. The Centre has cancelled its crucial sixth round of talks with 40 protesting farmers' unions that was scheduled on Wednesday as farm leaders declined to participate, after a meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday night failed to break the deadlock. Meanwhile, traffic was disrupted at border points with farmers agitating on the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi.

The BJP bagged 1,989 of the 4,371 panchayat samiti seats while the Congress won 1852 with almost all results of the four-phase local government polls being declared. The CPI (M) bagged 26 seats, the RLP six and the Bahujan Samaj Party five. Independent candidates won 439 panchayat samiti seats. At the zila parishad level, BJP candidates won 353 of the 635 seats for which results were declared and the Congress got 252. Only one zila parishad seat result is yet to be announced in the election held across 21 of the state’s 33 districts. The BJP candidates are now in majority in 13 of these district boards and the party is set to head one more with the help of ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP). The Congress has won five of the remaining zila parishads. The results come as a boost for the Bharatiya Janata Party when its government at the Centre is facing protests – mainly from farmers in Punjab and Haryana -- over the three new laws to deregulate the sale of crops. On Twitter, BJP president J P Nadda called the Rajasthan success a symbol of trust farmers, labourers and the poor have in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. In Delhi, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the results indicate that crores of rural people are in favour of agriculture reforms. “This is a farmers’ mandate and a vote for farm reforms,” he told reporters. He said the results bucked a trend in Rajasthan where in the panchayat elections in 2010 and 2015, the party in power had won the rural government elections as well. Polling for the panchayat elections was held on November 23 and 27, and December 1 and 5. The results come just days before the Ashok Gehlot government completes two years in Rajasthan, and only months after it tackled a revolt among the Congress MLAs led by sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot. The Congress lost even in the home districts of ministers Govind Singh Dotasra, who is also the head of the party's state unit, Cooperative Minister Udai Lal Anjana and Sports Minister Ashok Chandna. In Sikar’s Laxmangarh panchayat samiti, which comes under Dotasra’s constituency, the BJP won 13 of the 25 seats while Congress got 11. An independent candidate also won. In Chittorgarh’s Nimbahera panchayat samiti, the BJP won 14 out of 17 seats, an embarrassment for minister Udai Lal Anjana. In Tonk panchayat samiti, where no party got a majority, three independent winners have pledged support to Tonk MLA Sachin Pilot, according to the husband of one of them. If this happens, the samiti will go to the Congress. Rajasthan Congress president Dotasra said his party will perform better in the next election. “Many thanks to all the candidates for increasing the base of the party in the panchayat elections held in 21 districts of the state,” the Congress leader tweeted. “These results motivate us to do better in future; Congress will do better in the upcoming elections by keeping good synergy between the government and the organisation,” he added. But BJP state president Satish Poonia said the results signaled “farewell” to the”corrupt government” in the state. The polls were held in the districts of Ajmer, Banswara, Barmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Bundi, Chittorgarh, Churu, Dungarpur, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Jhalawar, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pali, Pratapgarh, Rajsamand, Sikar, Tonk and Udaipur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-suffers-blow-in-rajasthan-panchayat-polls-bjp-says-mandate-for-farm-reforms-925401.html
09-12-2020||North and Central||Negotiations work in progress, hopefully in last stage, says Javadekar on farmer protest||Sounding optimistic about an early resolution of farmer crisis, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday described the ongoing negotiations with farmer organisations as "work in progress" which hopefully is in the last stage. The Modi government, the minister said, is "sensitive" and has already held several rounds of talks with farmer organisations which are protesting against the three farm laws enacted by Parliament during the last session. "This (ongoing negotiations) is work in progress. Hopefully in the last stage. Let us wait for some more time," the minister said while replying to questions regarding farmers' protest. The government on Wednesday proposed to give a "written assurance" that the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime for procurement will continue as thousands of farmers continue to protest at various borders of the national capital demanding the repeal of three new farm laws. The government also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the mandi system. In a draft proposal sent to 13 agitating farmer unions, the government also said it is ready to provide all necessary clarifications on their concerns about the new farm laws enacted in September, but it did not mention anything about the main demand of protesting farmers for the repeal of the laws. Home Minister Amit Shah in Tuesday night's meeting with 13 union leaders had said the government would send a draft proposal on key issues raised by farmers regarding the three farm laws, even though the meeting had failed to break the ice with farm union leaders who are insisting for repealing these laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, has also been cancelled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/negotiations-work-in-progress-hopefully-in-last-stage-says-javadekar-on-farmer-protest-925410.html

Authorities at the Bhim Rao Ambedkar Bihar University here were flummoxed when screenshot of a BA 2nd year students purported admit card, which has now gone viral on the social media, was brought to their notice. The examinee, Kundan Kumar, is supposedly a student of Dhanraj Mahto Degree College, affiliated to the varsity and situated in Meenapur block of the district. Against the column of fathers name is printed Emran Hasmi, which despite its different spelling brings to mind the Bollywood actor known for a licentious onscreen persona. Moreover, the name of Leone, a porn star-turned- Bollywood actress, as the mother, and Chaturbhuj Sthan, the towns infamous red light area, as the address give away the mischief. We have ordered an inquiry. It is obviously a mischief and the student might himself be responsible for the same. Based on the report of the inquiry further action will be taken, the universitys registrar Ram Krishna Thakur said.

A committee chaired by the chief secretary had already submitted its report to the government on opening institutions of higher education in the state which got the Cabinet's nod. The cabinet cleared 27 out of a total of 29 proposals put before it on Wednesday, the sources said.  A presentation was also given at the cabinet meeting on how to carry out the Covid-19 vaccination exercise.  Twenty per cent of the state's total population will be vaccinated in the first phase of the exercise, including people above 55 years of age and frontline workers who are more at risk of contracting the infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/higher-education-institutions-in-uttarakhand-to-reopen-from-december-15-925472.html

Modi will also perform the ground-breaking ceremony for the building, which is expected to be completed by 2022 at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. Some chief ministers and governors will also attend the event virtually. Lok Sabha Speaker Birla had earlier said, "The existing temple of democracy is completing 100 years... It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that the new one will be built by our own people as a prime example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat." "The new building will showcase the cultural diversity of the country. Hopefully, in the 75th year of Independence (2022), Parliament session will be held in the new building," he said. The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said. The existing building is a British-era structure, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for members. The Lok Sabha chamber will have an option to increase its sitting capacity to 1,224 members during joint sessions. This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses. At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha 245. In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new Parliament building. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project. The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building. The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand. The building has twelve gates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-new-parliament-building-on-thursday-925475.html

The anti-smog gun is fed by a 5,000-litre water tank and can work for 3-4 hours continuously. It is mounted on a BS-VI emission standards engine truck which causes lesser vehicular pollution, said a government statement. Under the Delhi government's ‘Yuddh, Pradushan ke Viruddh (war on the pollution)’ campaign, the Public Works Department (PWD) has installed 23 anti-smog guns at key intersections and construction sites across Delhi, it said. The PWD has also taken the responsibility of sprinkling water on trees, roads, and construction sites to combat dust pollution. The number of anti-smog guns and water tankers will be further increased if required, and directed by the chief minister, added the statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/as-delhi-battles-air-pollution-kejriwal-inaugurates-truck-mounted-anti-smog-gun-925483.html
09-12-2020||Opinion||What motivates Covid-19 rule breakers?||As the Covid-19 pandemic lashes countries in a second (and in some cases, third) wave of infections, patience and solidarity are giving way to frustration and blame. Officials in the United States and Germany say the latest upsurge in infections in their countries is a consequence of a selfish minority that is ignoring basic social distancing rules, while Berlin’s tourism authority has launched a colourful campaign—complete with an old lady and an offensive finger—chastising visitors who refuse to wear masks. But while casting aspersions on “rule breakers” might feel cathartic, it does not invite a genuine inquiry into the psychological roots of such behaviour. Just who are these unmasked deviants, and what motivates them to ignore Covid-19 restrictions? In early 2020, as the coronavirus was racing through Europe and North America, we helped gather more than 100 colleagues from around the world to measure how people were responding to the pandemic. With prosocial behaviours such as social distancing, frequent handwashing and mask-wearing the best tools against the virus, we wanted to understand why some people follow government rules and others don’t. Now, with 60,000 responses from more than 30 countries, preliminary results are in, and they paint a complex picture of individual and collective motivations for curbing the coronavirus. For instance, we found that fear of financial loss caused by virus containment strategies—rather than health risks—was often a stronger motivator for abiding by or ignoring government rules. In one particular analysis, we found that not a single country ranked the likelihood of getting infected with Covid-19 as a higher risk than suffering economic consequences stemming from the coronavirus. On average, people around the world are more motivated by their wallets than their health. These findings suggest that a way to motivate more people to follow health guidelines is to appeal to their economic well-being. We also found that political orientation predicted how people would act in the weeks and months that followed the initial outbreak. In the US, for instance, conservatives were far more likely to minimise the virus’ risks and avoid wearing face masks than were liberals, exemplified by the downplaying of Covid-19 by the Trump administration. Although this might not be surprising to observers of American politics, it does illustrate the importance people ascribe to their leadership’s views. In many countries experiencing second and third waves, there are people who simply ignore or actively protest against governmental restrictions on their movement. The politicisation of Covid-19 suggests that people have other pressing concerns that motivate them to de-emphasise the pandemic. Finally, our data shoot down the commonly held perception that young people are uniquely at fault for the virus’ spread. While many officials, particularly in Europe, have blamed the spike in new Covid-19 cases on young people gathering recklessly, this may be a minority. Our findings show that, on average, age is not a reliable indicator of rule flaunting. At the same time, however, younger people do report experiencing a greater impact on their lives and livelihoods than older people. Given this, governments might consider replacing Covid-19 policies that coarsely target entire age groups with strategies that target certain underlying motivations that are common among certain age groups. What can we make of these early findings? A common thread could be what behavioural scientists call “psychological reactance,” more commonly known as reverse psychology. In 1966, the American psychologist Jack W. Brehm published a classic theory positing that people believe they have specific behavioural freedoms and when these freedoms are threatened or eliminated, they become motivated to reassert them. In other words, when somebody tells you to do something, you do the opposite. So strong is this human tendency to resist curbs on personal freedoms that in the 1970s, researchers in Florida testing Brehm’s theory found that when a specific laundry detergent was taken off the shelves in one county because of high levels of phosphates, which are dangerous to human health, “people started to smuggle phosphate detergent from neighbouring counties or purchased the product in vast quantities.” The same psychological forces that motivate someone to drive hundreds of miles for a banned soap may fit the current pandemic response. Of course, to implement meaningful policies that change public behaviours, governments must command a high degree of public trust to dissuade the breaking of rules. Not surprisingly, we found that stronger trust in one’s government to fight Covid-19 was significantly associated with higher willingness to make personal sacrifices to protect vulnerable groups from the coronavirus and its economic consequences. We found the opposite to be true among people who felt aggrieved and disempowered in society. In the current crisis, all it takes is a few people to flaunt the rules to put entire communities at risk of infection. The challenge for policy makers, then, is figuring out how to use behavioural insights to target the most relevant individual and collective motives that could bring the rising caseloads back under control. Our early research points a way forward. To help mitigate financial strains, a key concern of publics around the world, policymakers can do more to support state-run welfare systems and encourage private solidarity. To depoliticise virus control, bipartisan leaders can communicate the long-term economic benefits of virus control. To reduce grievances, there can be public recognition of essential workers and less blame applied to entire groups. In other words, we recommend a focus on addressing human needs and motivations that could determine whether individuals are willing and able to participate in virus control. To be sure, there are examples of successful and continual containment. In parts of Asia, swift government action and a high degree of public trust have helped keep the virus at bay. Similarly, across Africa, speedy government responses and strong public support have helped keep case numbers on the continent low by comparison. However, cultures differ, and certain regions have more experience with deadly epidemics that help to prioritise virus containment. For many places in between, the coming months will be a battle between an invisible enemy and a public that is tired of fighting. Until effective vaccines and therapeutics become widely available, the best weapons the world has in the war with Covid-19 are behavioural. Identifying, explaining and addressing the motivations that make rule breakers tick is necessary to end the crisis for everyone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/what-motivates-covid-19-rule-breakers-925418.html
09-12-2020||Panorama||Work hard, work smart||Among the well-known statements of the Bhagavad Geeta is the one which exhorts man to do his duty without any expectations. The crux of the advice is that work done without any desire for the results, purely with a sense of duty and dedication cleanses one’s mind from the worldly ills of greed and selfishness, which in turn enables man to achieve higher and better ideals in life. On this point regarding doing one’s duty without an eye on the fruits, the explanation offered by the great Swami Chinmayananda is noteworthy. “The past is dead and gone. The future is yet to come. Man has only the present moment available to do his work. What you do now manifests as the result in the future. So the future is contained in the present. The farmer has to do his preparatory work of ploughing, de-weeding and sowing to get a good crop later. Instead of doing this, if he starts thinking about the possible adversities that may come up, like pest attack and so on, his future will be in peril. Similarly, do not allow your future to be affected by thoughts about the past and the future possibilities. What you do now comes back to you as the future result. The future is not something that is thrust upon you by someone from somewhere. You are the architect of your destiny. So use the present efficiently and smartly. As long as you do your duty honestly, as an offering to the divine, the future will take care of itself. Do not misinterpret this as advice to be complacent and shirk your responsibilities. The secret is to work hard, work smart.  When you work like this, inspiration automatically dawns upon you so that you live better, work better. The four points to remember are be fully involved in your work, do not worry about the outcome, do not expect any particular result or gain from your work, do not resort to the twisted logic of thinking “anyhow I have been advised not to aspire for the results. So why take the trouble of trying in the first place?” He who understands this and lives accordingly is a true ‘KARMA YOGI’. When you work like this, your inner self evolves to higher and higher levels of awareness.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/work-hard-work-smart-925193.html
09-12-2020||Panorama||After botched Covid-19 response, UK tackles giant vaccine rollout||In Bristol, a sports stadium is being converted into a temporary clinic to provide inoculations, as is a racecourse outside London. Village halls, libraries and parking lots across the country are also being quickly turned into makeshift vaccination centers, with the government enlisting military planners for advice. As it prepares to begin rolling out a coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, Britain is taking on the biggest logistical challenge ever faced by the country’s health service: the vaccination of tens of millions of people against coronavirus in a matter of months. At the same time, law enforcement authorities are contending with an array of potential security threats to the vaccination campaign. Inoculations are expected to begin Tuesday at selected hospitals throughout Britain that have received the first batches of vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech, which need to be stored at very low temperatures. But the temporary clinics that are being hurriedly put together are expected to play critical roles as the mass vaccination program expands. Retired health workers are being asked to help, while the National Health Service is also recruiting tens of thousands of first aid workers and others to help administer the shot, as the vaccine becomes available to progressively more people. “I think all people who can help should put their hands up,” said Sarah Wollaston, who worked as a doctor before serving in Parliament until recently. She has just completed part of an online refresher course to qualify to help in the vaccine rollout. “Physically, giving someone a vaccine is very straightforward,” she said. “The challenge is the logistics.” While industry experts and health officials grapple with that, law enforcement officers and cyber-sleuths face an equally pressing challenge in the potential security threats surrounding a product in such high demand. “It is the most valuable asset on earth right now,” said Lisa Forte, a former British counterintelligence employee and a partner at Red Goat, a cybersecurity firm. “Naturally, this will attract highly skilled cybercriminals, criminal groups and state actors.” Europol has warned that organized crime groups might target trucks containing vaccines for theft and hijacking, and last week Interpol warned against an “onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,” which it has described as “liquid gold.” From the factory to hospitals and other sites, the Pfizer vaccine — because it has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, or minus 94 Fahrenheit — is acutely vulnerable to sabotage, in addition to theft. Last week, IBM said it had detected a series of cyberattacks in September against companies involved in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the world. IBM said the attackers, whose identity could not be determined, had tried to learn how the vaccines would be stored and delivered. “We’ve seen petrochemical companies targeted, because they’re essential in producing dry ice used to store the vaccine,” said Claire Zaboeva, a senior cyber-threat analyst at IBM’s Security X-Force. As nations compete to be among the first to administer the vaccine, Zaboeva added, state actors or even terrorist groups might try to disrupt deliveries. “Making loads of vaccine doses spoiled and useless, that would be a pretty destructive attack,” she said. While security agencies look after those concerns, Britain’s health service will have the daunting problem of managing a mass vaccination program that will reach further and faster into the population than any other public health outreach in living memory. Success is hardly guaranteed, given Britain’s spotty record on logistics during the Covid-19 crisis. In the early stages of the pandemic hospitals were left chronically short of basic protective equipment like masks and gloves, putting some workers at risk of infection. Since then, the government has struggled to establish a test and trace system, despite budgeting around $16 billion for the much-criticized project. Already, Pfizer’s problems sourcing raw materials may force it to cut the number of vaccine doses promised for delivery this year to Britain possibly by around half, to 5 million. And there is a potential bottleneck in the production of dry ice needed for packing and shipping the vaccine. Yet experts are cautiously optimistic that the vaccine rollout will go better than the government’s earlier, fumbling efforts to address the pandemic because it will be handled under the umbrella of the National Health Service, which has extensive experience with organizing mass immunizations, like annual flu shots. “It is not going to be without problems because of its scale and the logistics — I would be amazed if, in six months something, somewhere, didn’t go wrong,” said Helen Buckingham, director of strategy and operations at the Nuffield Trust, a research institute specializing in health. But the concept of mass vaccination is a familiar one, she added, “and overall people are putting a lot of effort into making this work.” Vaccines will be offered at three different types of locations: hospitals; doctors’ offices and clinics; and temporary vaccination centers still being prepared, including drive-thru sites, sports stadiums and public buildings. Family doctors, who will carry much of the burden, can call on their experience of giving at least 15 million flu shots each year. Coronavirus vaccination will be different for several reasons, however. In addition to the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, Britain is likely to authorize at least two others, one produced by Moderna and another by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. But when and where each one will be available is unclear. Martin Marshall, chair of the council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, notes that refrigeration requirements particularly for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines introduce a complication doctors do not have to manage with flu shots. Both require a second injection after several weeks, which can be an administrative nightmare. “We are pretty used to delivering big vaccination programs, but of course no one has ever had to deliver one in a situation where the vaccinations don’t come through in pre-filled syringes,” Marshall said. Early plans to vaccinate nursing home residents have been shelved because of the deceptively vexing issue of how to break down the 975-dose batches that Pfizer ships and safely take them into those facilities. And it is unclear when — and in what quantity — other vaccines will become available. All this has to be done at a time when the health care sector is under acute strain, its staff stretched after months of relentless pressure and during a winter season when people are generally more susceptible to illness. Nonetheless, Marshall is confident that the vaccine rollout can succeed. “I think we can make this work if we work across the NHS and show some flexibility,” he said. “It plays to the strength of the NHS, which is a centralized, organized and managed system — and it plays to our values as well.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/after-botched-covid-19-response-uk-tackles-giant-vaccine-rollout-925194.html
09-12-2020||Panorama||Farm protests, a breakdown in farmer-state trust||As one writes this in the dawn of a new morning, parts of Delhi remain still engulfed in darkness, clouded with barricades, with its borders blocked by farmers who are lying down across the highways, protesting against the new farm laws.  The situation of unrest, like many other from the recent past, forces (and urges) each of us to take a step back and reflect on one of the nation’s structural failings - a broken ‘kisan-sarkar’ contract. The broken farmer-state-Union relationship has been one of independent India’s worst failings and contributes to widespread rural-urban inequalities - in terms of both (limiting) incomes, aspirations, and opportunities for the citizenry.  The context of this numbing economic divide largely surfacing from the failures of agriculture, now further accentuated by a pandemic-induced economic crisis, is bound to breed collective feelings of chronic discontentment and fuel public resentment, now being witnessed on the streets.  Having written about this previously, the root of India’s agrarian crisis is linked to the 5Ps: Price, Product, Position, Profitability and Protection. These 5Ps, in a general understanding, are the foundational pillars of strategic focus for any enterprise (even farming), or an entrepreneur (say, a farmer too). Farmers have often found it difficult to get their main produce sold at a fair, market price at a place of closer proximity. Their cropping pattern and choice on ‘what to produce’ and ‘how to produce’ is conditioned by a string of factors that are less grounded in commercial, market principles, but are sourced more in conditions of political levering (around MSPs), poor market infrastructure, high cost of production, and entrenched middlemen-based price interventions.  Furthermore, an urban consumer bias entrenched in our consumption pattern of farm goods further adds to the seasonal price fluctuations which become a war cry on news channels every once in a while.  In a previous study undertaken around Haryana, we discussed some of these issues at length. Studying the average land-size under cultivation, we saw how around 68-70% of the farmers have acreage of less than 4-5 acres (with 16% land harvested anywhere between 1-2.5 acres; 24% owning anywhere between 2.5- 5 acres, and 28% with less than an acre).  The national level scenario in this regard sees more than 80-85% farmers having less than 2.5-3 acres of cultivable land. The issue of lesser acreage, entwined with concerns around processes of land ownership, and easier availability of credit also makes the situation of women-farmers (and their own agency in farming) even more inhibiting.  An interplay of all these variables have not only lowered a farmer’s actual income, negatively impacted her profitability but also seen pre-designed measures of social (or crop) protection schemes poorly implemented at a local level across states.  Most states, especially those in northern and central India, don’t even pay the promised MSP to farmers on all listed crops, even though they are bound by law.  An average farmer is self-reliant (atmanirbhar) without adequate support from the government and for worse, remains financially indebted in almost medieval-style living conditions with very little to actually be content about. This is now being witnessed in the angst of farmer unions protesting against the new farm laws. Even during the pandemic-induced lockdown, the situation for most farmers across India (particularly in Haryana and Punjab) became worse. Ravinder, a farmer from Bhidnauli village of Haryana said, “The vegetables we could earlier sell for Rs 30 per kg (in a pre-pandemic time) can now get us only Rs 10 per kg. Our yield has already dropped by 25-30%. Farmers who generally grew around 20 quintals of wheat, have seen their yield reduced to 14 quintals.”  As more mandis opened up, the overall demand was still low and extremely volatile, forcing most farmers to sell produce for amounts as low as Rs 2 per kg.  Poor healthcare Social distancing requirements, poor healthcare and safety conditions made many retailers and wholesalers averse to visiting mandis while consumers were too afraid to buy non-packaged vegetables that resulted in aggregating the demand-shock. Neetu, a young farmer from village Rampur has been farming since the age of 12. More than the loss of livelihood due to the pandemic-induced lockdown, he expressed extreme frustration against the local and state governments for mismanaging the response to the health-crisis that destroyed his family’s main source of income and livelihood.  He said, “Sarkaar ne hamare liye kuch nahi kiya, siraf TV pe dikhate hai sab, kisaan ke liye kuch hota nahi hai (‘The government has done nothing for the farmer, it is all a performance for the television’).”  Therefore, the symbolic reflection of current farmer protests mirrors a deep erosion of the kisan-sarkar contract and a deeper erosion of trust between them.  Unfortunately, there is little hope on offer. No matter what one may think on the farmers protest, or the opposition to the new Agricultural Bills, what is lucid is how our system of governance and its projected ‘economic reform’ model lack any effective institutional channel to ensure a proper debate on  ‘economic ideology’ new laws/‘reforms’ etc. Also, there is no mechanism for participatory dialogue with the concerned (aggrieved) stakeholders in a reasoned way.  The prevailing governmentality is embedded in a monolithic command style order of functioning where law (and its institutions) is simply used as a tool of enforcement-at-cost against all, irrespective of who is at the receiving end.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/farm-protests-a-breakdown-in-farmer-state-trust-925195.html
09-12-2020||Panorama||Green energy spikes up||The ongoing pandemic has spared none, including the power sector. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), following the pandemic, the global energy demand has reduced by around 6%. This, along with the increase in the percentage share of renewable energy sources, indicates that carbon emissions this year will decrease by around 8%.  In India, power demand has reduced by a staggering 25–30%. This demand reduction, coupled with reduced tariff collection and slow recovery, has adversely impacted the already stressed distribution companies (DISCOMs) by creating a significant cash crunch. Moreover, the pandemic is likely to affect India’s energy transition, either creating uncertainty or inducing a radical shift in favour of renewable energy. One thing is certain though—the status quo cannot remain. The central government and many state governments have implemented several proactive policies and fiscal measures to mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on the power sector. The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission issued an order in April 2020 to continue with the existing tariff on solar rooftop PV (SRTPV) and grid-connected solar plants. The order mandated that the deadline be extended till 31 March 2021 despite the module cost, and thereby the solar plant costs, coming down drastically. This step was aimed at promoting and encouraging more investment in SRTPV uptake. Globally, the current pandemic situation has led to an increase in the share of renewable energy in the total power mix. In India, the renewable energy share increased from around 19% in early March (pre-lockdown) to over 30% by the end of June. This significant increase can be attributed to the combination of reduced electricity demand and the ‘must-run’ status of renewable power plants. Moreover, solar power plants have witnessed a capacity increase because of the drastic reduction in air pollution levels during the lockdown. As cleaner air leads to more sunlight reaching the solar panels, energy production has increased.  The total power generated from renewable energy sources in 2020 remained almost equal to that in 2019. However, thermal power in 2020 reduced significantly (19.75%) compared to the generation in 2019. This decrease is attributed to a reduced energy demand, which ultimately increased the share of renewables.  The share of electricity generated from coal and natural gas is expected to increase again as India slowly eases the strict lockdown measures. According to IEA, the global natural gas demand could decrease by 5% by the end of 2020. Nevertheless, unless the Government of India enacts substantial policy changes to promote renewables, the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix could increase and that of renewables could return to levels before Covid-19. The recently proposed draft of Electricity Act (Amendment) Bill 2020 is a step in the right direction as it has the potential to usher in some much-sought reforms in the renewable sector. These include simplification of tariff structure, cost-reflective tariff, and reduction of cross-subsidies, among others. The central government’s initiative ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) will help to further boost the renewable industry. It will encourage indigenous manufacturing over heavy reliance on imports of solar PV panels, wind turbines, and other raw materials from China, which currently accounts for 79% of India’s solar module supplies. These policy changes are expected to significantly reduce imports from China. A reduction in the country’s energy demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent increase in the renewable share (because of the must-run status of renewable plants) have highlighted the robustness of India’s power sector in handling unforeseen circumstances. By pursuing favourable policies, the government can generate further confidence in renewable energy developers, encouraging them to invest more in green energy.

09-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Remembering thatha||When I was eight years old, I fell in the middle of an alley and skinned my knee. There was blood and lots of tears. When I finally picked myself up and trudged to my grandparents’ house, I’m sure I was met with sympathy and someone cleaned me up. I don’t recall the details of that. What I do remember is that my grandpa—thatha as we called him—took my little hand in his and gently walked me back up the street. “Is this the spot?” he asked as we stood over the offending area of concrete. With my tear-streaked face and quivering lip, I nodded. (Surely this was the most traumatic thing that had ever happened in the history of mankind!) “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do…” His kind eyes were twinkling. He picked up his foot stomped hard on the evil piece of concrete. Then he started chastising the concrete, encouraging me to also stomp at it with my uninjured leg. There was much stomping, light yelling, and even some spitting at the malicious concrete that had caused all the crying. It only lasted a few minutes (and I can’t even remember if I stopped crying after that), but it’s a memory that has a permanent spot in my brain. It is a memory that always elicits warm feelings, albeit with a tinge of grief now that he has passed. Thatha was a good man. It is a cliché to say that about the departed, but there really is no better way to sum up his essence than with the word “good.” He wasn’t the most enlightened or progressive person—which is par for the course for most people, and especially men, from that generation. He held fast to his ideas of gender, class, and caste roles. Within the confines of these rules, he was as generous as they come. He gave money, time, love, good humour, and infinite patience to those who needed it and those who didn’t. I’m not sure which of those categories my sister and I fell into, but he showered us with all of it anyway.  We lived outside of India and away from my grandparents for much of our lives but we visited them every summer. Most of these summers are lost in the haze of failing human memory, but certain moments like the skinned knee—or how thatha saved every issue of the newspaper’s children’s section “Open Sesame” throughout the year to give to us in the summers—have stayed with me.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/remembering-thatha-925191.html
09-12-2020||Second Edit||Apathy towards frontline doctors in Karnataka||It is extremely disheartening that hundreds of frontline doctors in government hospitals and medical colleges in Karnataka who have put their lives at grave risk fighting Covid-19 have not been paid their salaries for three to four months. The highest number of unpaid doctors are from Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s home district, Shivamogga. Medical professionals at all levels have been hailed as warriors for their stellar role in fighting the pandemic but the state government seems to be satisfied with merely extending lip sympathy to them, without addressing the real issues. It would, in fact, be in the fitness of things, to pay all medical and associated professionals a special risk allowance, but that would be a far cry when even basic salaries are not paid. Health Minister K Sudhakar, who blames a technical reason for the delay, has assured that the issue would be sorted out within a week. But the question is, why did he permit the problem to come to a boil in the first place? Given the seriousness of the pandemic, the minister was expected to have a finger on the pulse and not allow such a situation to arise in the first place. While Sudhakar busied himself with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation  (GHMC) elections, doctors in his own backyard were going hungry. An army marches on its stomach and the same applies to Covid warriors whose role during the pandemic has been no less than that of the Army. According to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), about 500 doctors have lost their lives to Covid in the past few months. This is not the first time that medical professionals - including those involved in crucial activities like swab collection - have complained of non-payment of their dues. That the government allows the issue to recur every few months, only shows its total callousness and lack of concern. While the government has funds to splurge on various community-based development corporations with an eye on the upcoming assembly byelections, it is unfortunate that it is unable to mobilise resources to pay its medical staff.  Covid management in the state has been mired in controversy right from the start with ministers pulling the cart in different directions, besides allegations of corruption. Fighting Covid is like war and the health minister should don the role of a general and lead from the front instead of letting his foot soldiers fend for themselves. The government should immediately resolve the issue  as Covid warriors have more important things to do than hit the road every now and then demanding their wages.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/apathy-towards-frontline-doctors-in-karnataka-925187.html

LDF convener and CPI(M) secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan said it shows that the "authoritarian BJP government" will not tolerate any democratic protest against it. He asked civil society to express strong protest against the "house arrest" of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and CPI(M) leader Subhashini Ali. "The arrests were part of an effort of the BJP government to quell the peasant agitation, which is becoming a strong warning to the central government," Vijayaraghavan said in a statement. He claimed the arrest and house arrest of the leaders, who expressed support to the farmers, show that the current situation in the country is worse than during the period of Emergency. "The arrests by the authoritarian BJP government shows that it will not accept any unpopular protests even in a democratic manner," the LDF convener said. He requested thecivil society to come together and protest against "such dictatorial tendencies." Farmer leaders claimed on Tuesday their 'Bharat Bandh' against the new farm laws was "successful" and had an impact in 25 states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ruling-left-front-in-kerala-condemns-arrest-of-leaders-in-delhi-during-bharat-bandh-925161.html

Crocodile enters house in Kerala||A family staying close to the Athirappilly tourist spot at Thrissur district in Kerala had an unexpected guest on Wednesday morning -- a crocodile. Atthirappilly, a known eco-tourism spot and about 55 km from Thrissur city, is frequented by tourists. It is known for its waterfalls. Right from the early hours of Wednesday, the family of Sabu alias Sajan, staying close to the Chalakudy river, had been hearing noises in their courtyard. The family was under the impression that it would be monkeys or stray dogs. But when Sabu's wife opened the door at around 5.30 am, she was shocked to see a crocodile in their courtyard. She immediately alerted Sabu. The efforts of Sabu and some local people to chase away the crocodile back to the nearby river did not yield any result as the crocodile was resisting their bids aggressively. They then alerted the nearby forest officials. A team of forest officials, assisted by local people, managed to trap the crocodile using a snare with rope and pulled the crocodile into the river. Sabu's family comprising his wife, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter are staying in the house. Sabu said it was a narrow escape as his grandchild plays in the courtyard regularly. Luckily, his wife spotted the crocodile first. Range forest officer of the locality T Ajikumar told DH that crocodiles were frequently spotted in the locality and hence tourists were not allowed to enter the river. He said that the crocodile was around ten years of age. Generally, it would not attack humans. But in case of it faced attack from humans, the reptile would resist the attack aggressively, he said. Meanwhile, a section of local people alleged that many tourists, especially youths, who visit the areas enter the river flouting the restrictions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/an-unwelcome-guest-crocodile-enters-house-in-kerala-925345.html

After the gold smuggling case accused and former employees of the UAE consulate in Kerala, Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S, recently deposed before the Customs that some higher authorities were involved in smuggling activities, a court in Kochi stated that the revelation regarding the involvement of some 'big sharks' was shocking. Thereafter, a section of the media reported that it was a person holding a constitutional post that was involved in the smuggling case with BJP Kerala state president K Surendran stating on Tuesday that foreign trips of the speaker were also suspicious. It was in this context that the speaker's office came out with a denial note on Wednesday stating that Sreeramakrishnan had neither traveled abroad with the gold smuggling accused nor had any meetings with them abroad. All the foreign trips were carried out by informing the respective embassies and all details regarding the foreign trips were already made public. Most trips were based on invitations from various organisations. In addition to that, family trips to meet relatives were also carried out. It was very unfortunate that a constitutional body was being dragged into a row based on baseless assumptions, said that statement. Sreeramakrishnan was on the defensive in the past as well when a video of him inaugurating an automobile service centre of one of the gold smuggling accused had surfaced. Key accused Swapna Suresh was also at the event and the speaker had clarified that Swapna, who was known to him as an official of the consulate, had invited him to the function.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-speaker-p-sreeramakrishnan-denies-nexus-with-gold-smuggling-racket-925357.html

The protests were against the amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Act-2020 and Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation and Development) (Amendment) Act-2020. While the KLR (Amendment) Act-2020 was passed by both the Houses, the APM (Amendment) Act-2020 is waiting for clearance from the Council after being approved by the Assembly in the Monsoon session. Following a call given by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Hasiru Sene and allied organisations, the farmers geared up for another showdown, a day after joining the nationwide protests against the farm bills brought by the Centre. Many protesters arrived in the city by train due to which security was beefed up at the Bengaluru City Railway Station. The rally started from the railway station, went to Anand Rao Circle and converged at freedom park. Later, the farmers will march towards the Vidhana Soudha carrying whip used to guide bulls. The police barricaded all the roads leading to the Vidhana Soudha and intensified the security measures to prevent any protester venturing closer to Karnataka's seat of power. Already the prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC are in place around the Vidhana Soudha.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/karnataka-farmers-protest-amendments-to-land-reforms-march-to-vidhana-soudha-925372.html

"The  Cabinet, chaired by  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for Provision of Submarine Optical Fibre Cable connectivity between Mainland (Kochi) and Lakshadweep Islands," Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. The Project envisages provision of a direct communication link through a dedicated submarine Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) between Kochi and 11 islands of Lakshadweep viz. Kavaratti, Kalpeni, Agati, Amini, Androth, Minicoy, Bangaram, Bitra, Chetlat, Kiltan and Kadmat. The estimated cost of implementation is about Rs.1072 crore including operational expenses for 5 years. The Project would be funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund. The submarine connectivity project will have a vital role for the delivery of e-Governance services at the doorstep of citizens, potential development of fisheries, coconut-based industries and high-value tourism, educational development in term of tele-education and in health care in terms of telemedicine facilities. Presently, the only medium of providing telecom connectivity to Lakshadweep is through satellites, but the bandwidth available is limited to 1 Gbps. Lack of bandwidth is a major constraint in providing data services, which is a pre-requisite for providing e-governance, e-education, e-banking etc. for inclusive growth of society.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cabinet-approves-laying-submarine-optical-fibre-to-provide-high-speed-broadband-to-lakshadweep-925377.html

But after several rounds of tests, they opined that organochlorine and lead could be the primary causative agents that triggered the disease, whose symptoms mainly were fits and nausea. In their preliminary findings presented to the Andhra Pradesh government, the experts noted that it was a point source epidemic and a likely case of acute intoxication of toxins, but not chronic. "There is a likelihood of toxin lead or organochlorine or both causing the sudden convulsions", the experts observed. The total number of those afflicted by the disease touched 593 on Wednesday, but 523 of them have already been discharged from hospital upon recovery. Another 33 patients were referred to the Government General Hospitals in Vijayawada and Guntur for better treatment. The number of active cases is now only 36. Only about 24 patients reported sick on Wednesday, but all of them were stable. Though a couple of people complained of a relapse, they too got cured after a few hours in hospital. Teams of experts from the National Institution of Nutrition, the National Centre for Disease Control and the AIIMS were now examining the cattle for possible traces of the chemical compounds. As bleaching powder and chlorine were extensively used for sanitation to contain the spread of Covid-19, they could have been a source of contamination, the two-member WHO team felt after visiting the affected areas in the city. Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy interacted with the experts via a videoconference and said the government would come out with an action plan once the final reports on the disease outbreak were received. He asked them to first focus their study on whether or not drinking water caused the mysterious disease and then analyse the other aspects. The experts told the Chief Minister that the number of cases has dwindled significantly and also those afflicted were recovering in three to four hours. Senior specialist A Shariff from AIIMS said detailed examination of all samples has to be done, though the blood samples indicated a high level of lead. Since nickel is largely present in Indians, there was no need to panic, he noted. The lead level too was significantly declining in 24 hours after the patients recovered, he added. Recycled batteries could have been the source of lead contamination, Shariff explained. "The batteries may have got buried in the soil after breakage, which could have led to lead contamination. It could have got into human bodies through rice or vegetables. Or, lead could have been in the air when used batteries were burnt," he pointed out. The AIIMS expert said they were studying all these aspects. Experts from the NIN, Hyderabad, said they spoke to some of the affected families in Eluru and collected details of the food they had taken. "We collected samples of vegetables, blood and urine from them. We also collected samples from some patients in hospital. We went to the markets where vegetables and other essential commodities are purchased. We are examining all those samples," the NIN experts said. They informed the Chief Minister that NIN would submit a report based on the examination of water, food, milk, urine and blood samples. The IICT scientists said they were conducting a thorough study on drinking water as lead content was found to be high in the patients. They, however, said a preliminary analysis of water did not reveal any dangerous content as such. "We are conducting a comprehensive analysis for determining the exact cause," they added. The CCMB team said it was studying whether any virus caused the mysterious disease outbreak in Eluru. "It will take some time for the results to come out and determine the exact cause," it told the Chief Minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rapid-decline-in-number-of-people-falling-sick-to-andhra-pradeshs-mysterious-disease-925447.html

In the latest instance, a 17-year-old girl at Kannur district in Kerala alleged of sexual torture from the chairman of district Child Welfare Committee (CWC), E D Joseph, during the detailed statement recording. Joseph allegedly enquired in detail about the extent of sexual assault the girl faced, which caused further trauma to her. She deposed the matter before the court following which a Pocso case was registered against Joseph who was placed under suspension. Child rights activists point out that children who face sexual assault are facing further sexual torture owing to statement recording by multiple agencies like Childline, police and CWC. Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KeSCPCR) former member advocate J Sandhya told DH that agencies like CWC need not record details of the extent of sexual assault, which is the job of the police. CWCs only need to see if the child requires care and protection. She added that there were instances in which sexual assault victim children had to depose in detail about the ordeal they suffered for at least ten times or more before various welfare agencies and investigation teams. Such acts sabotage the efforts to relieve children from the mental trauma they suffered and aggravate it further. Kerala Women and Child Development department director T V Anupama said that many such issues pertaining to the handling of sexual assault cases were noted, and hence a new SOP was being prepared, which would also prescribe the extent to which the CWCs could collect details from a sexual abuse victim. The draft SOP prepared by former chairperson of KeSCPCR Shobha Koshy also stresses that only friendly interactions should be there with the sexual abuse victims and there should not be any sort of questioning. Discussions are being held with retired judicial officers, psychologists and child rights experts and the SOP is expected to be finalised by end of this month, he said. Meanwhile, Sandhya said that there was a need to sensitise the officials handling child abuse cases, as many seem to be thinking that counselling is a process to dig out facts from victims. "The intention of subjecting sexual abuse victims to counselling is to help reduce their trauma. However, in some instances, the police felt that the victims need to be subjected to counselling for extracting the facts," she said. Kerala has been witnessing an increasing trend in Pocso cases over the years. Sexual assaults against women and children were also reported to be high during the lockdown days. While 3,609 such cases were registered in the state in 2019, in 2018 it was 3,179 and in 2017 it was 2,697.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/new-sop-in-kerala-to-bring-some-relief-to-sexually-abused-children-925448.html

The two Hyderabad-based companies are involved separately in the development of Covid-19 vaccines. The diplomatic visit comprising high commissioners and government representatives of 64 countries comes at a time when Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is at an advanced stage of human trials. About a fortnight ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) to take stock of the vaccine progress. The envoys' visit was organised by Ministry of External Affairs, in order to appraise the world about the headway made by the country on the Covid-19 vaccine front and the growth of the pharma industry in general. The delegates visit was facilitated in two batches to both units. At BBIL, chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella presented the COVAXIN update. COVAXIN is India's indigenous vaccine for Covid-19 developed in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV). The inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's Bio-Safety Level 3 bio-containment facility here. “The highly purified vaccine is manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” a company representative said. COVAXIN trials were conducted on about 1,000 volunteers in Phase I and II, with promising safety and immunogenicity results. Phase III human clinical trials began in November, involving 26,000 volunteers across India. “This is India’s first and only Phase III efficacy study for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the largest phase III efficacy trial ever conducted for any vaccine in India,” BBIL said. Suchitra Ella, joint managing director of Bharat Biotech, said: “Development and clinical evaluation of COVAXIN marks a significant milestone for novel vaccinology in India. COVAXIN has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction.” “It is an honour to have all the distinguished ambassadors of various countries with us today. It not only makes us proud but also reminds us that the world is looking up to India in the common fight against the deadly pandemic,” she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covaxin-garnered-interest-from-several-countries-for-supplies-and-introduction-says-bharat-biotech-925450.html

The situation was so bad at one point that the residents had to use tractors and earth-movers to get to the office and to receive essential supplies. While residents of Jawahar Nagar, which is part of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), are forced to walk in waist-deep water for more than 2 km to reach the main road, those living in near-by Thazhambur which is part of Chengalpattu district have to depend on tractors and JCB for travel. Residents alleged that excess water released from lakes in Navalur and Thazhambur and illegal encroachments on the banks of these water bodies and their surroundings as responsible for the “man-made floods.” Their sufferings began on November 25 when Cyclone Nivar brought heavy rainfall across Chennai and only compounded last week due to showers under the influence of Cyclone Burevi. “Our area was like an island. The gated community where we live is free of inundation. But the water was at the waist-deep level on the road. We live just two km from the IT corridor that is all fancy, but we had to climb on tractors and sit precariously on earth movers to reach the main road,” Prabhakar, a resident, told DH. “For about a week, we depended on tractors and earth movers to get out of the area. Only on Tuesday, after much water receded, a bus made its way. Still, one bus is not adequate. Many are still taking tractors and lorries,” he added. Another resident blamed the government for the flooding. “The plots where people live are approved by the government. Yet we are blamed for building our houses here. Why is that the blame is on us?” he asked. Dhanashekar of Thazhambur said the road leading from the IT corridor to Jawahar Nagar is still under 3 to 4 feet water and no steps have been taken to pump out. “We have been suffering for the past 15 days and we walk every day 4 to 5 km to go to the main road to just buy essentials and come back. The floods are not natural. It is man-made and it is because encroachments have not been removed. The power supply is yet to be restored,” he said. When contacted, GCC Regional Deputy Commissioner Alby John said the area does not come under the limits of the civic body, while the Chengalpattu district administration said things will be normal in a few days. Prabhakar added that if not for the tractors and earthmovers that could wade through the stagnant water, the situation could have gone worse. “We expected the water to drain out in a few days but to our utter shock, our sufferings increased each passing day. And Cyclone Burevi was the last straw. Our area was completely inundated till our sufferings made it to television screens,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/areas-off-chennai-s-i-t-corridor-still-under-water-residents-use-tractor-925460.html

After challenging Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for a debate following his comments that DMK leaders were accused of corruption, former Union Telecom Minister A Raja has now asked the AIADMK leader to acknowledge that his late boss was “corrupt” as concluded by the highest court of the land. The war of words between the two Dravidian parties began last week with DMK MP Kanimozhi accusing the current AIADMK dispensation of “corruption” only to get back the same tag from Palaniswami. The Chief Minister said it was the DMK, not AIADMK, that had indulged in corruption and cited 2G spectrum allocation and Sarkaria Commission that probe corruption allegations against the then DMK government in the 1970s. Raja, who was exonerated by a CBI court of all charges in the 2G spectrum allocation case along with Kanimozhi, challenged Palaniswami to debate with him on the corruption during Jayalalithaa’s first tenure from 1991 to 1996. On Wednesday, he convened a press conference to ask Palaniswami to “stop spreading lies” and “hiding the truth” to “protect the sanctity” of the Chief Minister’s chair. “Judge O P Saini not just exonerated me of all charges but also said the case was choreographed. It has been three years since the judge delivered his verdict. Yet, Palaniswami wants to spread lies and hide the corruption by his leader Jayalalithaa. They are trying to keep her out of the DA case by citing her death as an excuse,” Raja said. Raja also quoted relevant portions from the 2017 Supreme Court judgment that saw Jayalalithaa’s aide V K Sasikala, her sister-in-law Ilavarasi, and V N Sudhakaran, who was the late leader’s foster son, to drive home his point. Responding to Raja’s challenge, Palaniswami went on the defensive calling the former Union Minister as a “nobody” and a “cash cow” for the DMK. “He may be big in the DMK, but this is AIADMK.

Stating that the laws deprived farmers of their rights, she alleged that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has betrayed the ryots by supporting the laws introduced by the BJP government at the Centre. While addressing the farmers in nearby Pollachi, the DMK MP said the laws were opposed by chief ministers of states ruled by non-BJP parties. Reiterating that DMK always stood for the welfare of the farmers, she said the party during the tenure of her father and former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi was the one which provided free power supply to the ryots and waived their loans.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-only-non-bjp-ruled-state-to-support-farm-laws-dmk-mp-925488.html

The Assembly election in Kerala is hardly five months away. One major reason behind the ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front suffering a major debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was the stand it took in favour of implementing SC order allowing women of all age group enter the hill shrine. Hence, the present announcement of the Congress leader assumes political significance. Hassan even challenged the LDF to bring in a law to protect faith of Sabarimala devotees. He said that the Left Front has no moral right to speak about communal harmony anymore. The Congress leader's announcement also comes close on the heels of the state police withdrawing a mention in the guidelines for virtual queue for Sabarimala darshan that women below the age of 50 won't be allowed to enter the temple during the ongoing pilgrimage. The guidelines initially mentioned that women below the age of 50 were not allowed to visit the temple.  After the Supreme Court constitution bench had referred the review petitions on the order allowing women of all ages to the hill shrine to a large bench in 2019 November, the Kerala government had decided not to implement the order allowing women of all ages to the hill shrine until a final decision on the review petitions was announced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/congress-evokes-sabarimala-issue-in-poll-bound-kerala-925515.html

In March, the beginning of the pandemic in the state, chief minister Reddy had advocated paracetamol as the remedy and bleaching of the surroundings to prevent the virus spread. On Wednesday, the fifth day since the sudden illness surfaced in the Andhra Pradesh town, total cases remained below 600 as new cases reduced drastically. The CM conducted a virtual review on the situation as the cause of the disease remained elusive. The World Health Organisation experts told the CM that “they suspect bleaching and chlorine used in sanitation measures as part of Covid-19 prevention might have been the cause.” A two member WHO team, which arrived in Eluru on Tuesday, surveyed the affected areas, collecting the food intake habits, health details of the victims. Differing views Doctors and experts from AIIMS, New Delhi said that a comprehensive investigation with blood, water and milk samples is on, “but it was primarily revealed that the blood of those who fell ill contained Lead, Nickel particles in high levels.” “Since Indians have a certain amount of nickel in their bodies, we suspect that lead presence might have caused the illness. A significant drop in these lead levels was found post 24 hours of patients showing symptoms,” the AIIMS team told the CM. Delhi AIIMS experts said that recycling, dumping of broken batteries, or their burning could have led to the air, soil contamination, which subsequently could have entered the human bodies by various means. At the same time, experts from AIIMS Mangalagiri suspect that pesticides could have contaminated the organic chlorides, leading to the condition. The National Institute of Nutrition team from Hyderabad said that they have not found any unsafe substance yet in the vegetables, food essentials samples. Indian Institute of Chemical Technology experts said that high levels of lead were found in blood samples of the patients, while nothing hazardous was found in the water samples yet. The Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology investigators said that they are probing for any virus angle to the illness. While urging the experts to find the actual reason behind the illness at the earliest, Chief Minister Reddy said that corrective measures will be taken based on the final outcome. Health officials said that case numbers are declining and the patients are recovering within 3-4 hours. Meanwhile, opposition leader Chandrababu Naidu demanded that a health emergency be declared in Eluru and surrounding parts, and life, health insurance cover be extended for the locals. Dr AVR Mohan, Superintendent of the Eluru government hospital said that no fresh case was reported since Wednesday afternoon. “We only had 18 admissions today, which took the overall cases to 589. The number of patients remaining in our hospital at present is 42,” Dr Mohan told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/eluru-mystery-disease-who-adds-bleaching-chlorine-in-covid-19-sanitisation-measures-to-the-suspect-list-925516.html

Among the students who secured seats in the first round of allotment,  12,000 students have reported to their respective colleges for admission. Similarly, about 1,000 students have also rejected/returned seats allotted during the first round. According to the schedule put out by the KEA, Tuesday was the last date for students who have been allotted with the seats in the first round to report to the colleges for further admission. Data accessed by DH from KEA revealed that about 28,000 students are yet to report and most of them have opted for the second round (Holding on to the seat allotted in the first round and looking for a good college in the second round). “The general trend is that at least 50% of these 28,000 students will retain their seats that were allotted during the first round of counselling,” a KEA official said.  Interestingly, about 1,000 students have returned the seats allotted to them in the first round. “The students who have returned the seats are those who have already got seats under IIT-JEE or Comed-K. The returned seats will be added to the pool again during the second round allotment of seats,” the official clarified.  This year witnessed a considerable increase in the number of engineering seats compared to previous years. According to the data, more than 56,720 seats available for allotment suggesting 1,000 seats more than the previous year.

They want exclusion of nursing assistants, midwifery associates and homecare personnel from the Bill as they are not trained nurses.  “There are a huge number of nurses qualified with ANM, GNM and BSc (nursing) courses and candidates with lower skill sets will deteriorate the quality of healthcare. This endangers public safety,” said the Trained Nurses Association (TNA, Karnataka unit), in its letter. Separate Board sought A separate Nursing and Midwifery Practice and Rating Board needs to be constituted to regulate the standards of nursing services, the letter said.   All members of the Commissions are nominated, giving importance to those from central government institutions. There is no representation for registered nursing associations, it said. “The composition is against the democratic set-up and violates equal representation in the decision-making process,” said P Girijamba Devi, secretary of TNA, Karnataka unit.   Advanced education qualifications like PhD nursing, doctoral, post-doctoral and advanced fellowships need to be included in NNMC PG board, for regulations of doctoral programmes, it said. The autonomous boards mainly focus on nursing education. There is no monitoring agency for the quality of nursing service. Hence, a separate Nursing and Midwifery Practice and Rating Board needs to be created, says TNA. “A majority of the states don’t have an inspection on the quality of nurses and nursing services. There should be an inspection on an annual basis through the Board which shall submit a report to the Commission for further action. The major areas to inspect are the qualification of the nurses employed, salary and working conditions, in hospitals and nursing homes,” Devi said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnatakas-nurses-write-to-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-raise-objections-to-nursing-bill-925202.html

Briefing mediapersons at the KPCC Office on Tuesday, he said that both Central and state governments had no goals. Law should be passed after discussing it in both upper and lower houses. “Unfortunately, the central and state governments are passing laws through ordinance.” "The state and central governments will fall if they go ahead with the anti-farmer laws. Both the state and central governments have been following anti-farmer policies," he said “Karnataka government has already approved amendments to the APMC Act, Land Reforms Act and Labour laws in the Legislative Assembly. However, they failed to get it passed in the Council. So they are trying to introduce them through the ordinance route. The government should discuss the pros and cons before introducing any law,” he said. It should be discussed in public domain to collect public opinion. Passing a law without understanding the problems will lead to huge protests, he added. More than 1.5 crore farmers are on the streets fighting for their rights, he said. “If you look at the history of India, it is evident that all governments that followed anti-farmer policies have fallen. But the central and state governments are firm on going ahead with their new farm laws,” D’Souza added. "Now, the state government is also planning to introduce amendment to the cow slaughter act. Will Prime Minister Narendra Modi stop export of beef from the country? Will the government purchase all cattle that are sold in markets by the farmers?" he asked. "What is the purpose behind introducing an act to check love jihad? Who will be benefited from it? Will the country see drastic progress with laws to check love jihad?" he questioned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/centre-state-govts-passing-laws-through-ordinance-mlc-ivan-d-souza-925244.html

Ayanur Manjunath, senior BJP MLC along with other members urged the Chair to consider their notice to move 'No-Confidence' motion against the Chairperson. However, Congress MLCs present in the House opposed the move paving way for a heated argument between leaders of both the parties. Intervening in the debate, the chairperson announced that he would consult legal experts for an opinion on the matter before arriving at a conclusion and adjourned the House for an hour. Buoyed by the success in the recently held polls to the Upper House by winning all the four-seats, the BJP had emerged as the single largest party and was hopeful of dislodging the Council chairperson with the support of JDS(S) MLCs. Accordingly, the members, as per the rule, had given a notice 14-days prior to the commencement of the Winter session. BJP members were upset that despite the prior notice, the 'No Confidence' motion was not included in the day's proceedings by the officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/no-confidence-motion-against-council-chairperson-triggers-furore-in-upper-house-of-karnataka-legislature-925331.html

The convicts are Srinivas Prasad, Superintendent of Customs and Lourd Prabhu, head hawaldar. Both were posted at the Kempegowda International Airport in Devanahalli. Special judge for CBI cases Shivaram K sentenced the convicts to four years of simple imprisonment and levied a penalty of Rs 30,000 on Prasad and Rs 15,000 on Prabhu. The prosecution case was that the Customs officials had intercepted the complainant with 15 laptops when he landed from Singapore in 2015. Prasad demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to release the laptops since there were no proper documents. After negotiations, the superintendent scaled down the demand to Rs 50,000. Since the complainant requested for some time to arrange the money, the superintendent retained the boarding pass, e-visa and other documents, including the passport. He, however, let the complainant go out of the airport along with the laptops. The complainant had recorded the demand for bribe on his mobile phone and went to the CBI office to lodge a complaint. The CBI police laid a trap and arrested both Prasad and Prabhu, while receiving the bribe amount. The complainant was not examined as a witness before the court, since he passed away during the pendency of the case in 2018. However, he had given a statement under Section 164 of the CrPC before the magistrate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/two-customs-officials-convicted-for-graft-925528.html

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka directed the government to place on record the procedure laid down, especially in the light of the order issued under the Disaster Management Act, in view of Covid-19. The counsel for the petitioner argued that on the one hand, the order restricts senior citizens from moving out, on the other they have to venture out to receive their pension. The petition is filed by Akhila Karnataka Vayovrudhara Okkoota (Aikyata), an organisation representing senior citizens.    The petition said despite the orders that the disbursement of social security pensions to senior citizens was to remain functional, pensions have not been received since January 2020. The pension amount payable under Sandhya Suraksha Yojana and Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme is also not being regularly released. In the previous hearing, the court had directed the government to immediately look into the grievance and take remedial steps, if necessary.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/clarify-if-senior-citizens-can-get-pension-at-home-karnataka-hc-asks-govt-925164.html
09-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Will take Covid-19 vaccine, safety and efficacy not a concern: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw||A certain section of people may be hesitant to take Covid-19 vaccine but not biotechnology industry veteran Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, who said on Wednesday she will get vaccinated though its durability is not known as of now. The Executive Chairperson of Bengaluru-headquartered biotech major Biocon supported the unprecedented speed in taking the vaccine from the development stage to approval process. "This is an unprecedented pandemic and extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures," Mazumdar-Shaw told PTI in an interview. "I think there is a need for regulatory speed to review and approve". Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer have applied to the Drugs Controller General of India seeking emergency use authorisation for their Covid-19 vaccine candidates. "Because of the urgency for the need for the vaccine, they (the Vaccine makers) are focusing on safety and efficacy but they don't have data right now on durability of response and, if there is any, long-term side-effects", according to her. Mazumdar-Shaw, who has been named among the world's 100 most powerful women by Forbes which described her as "India's richest self-made woman", contended that if one looks at the risk-benefit ratio, the risk of not approving a vaccine is far greater than the kind of risks associated with any side- effects. Safety and efficacy data is pretty good for all the vaccine candidates but the only question unanswered as of now is how long they will give protection, she said. The risk of waiting to get the answer to the durability question is too high. Even if the vaccine gives protection for a short-time, it is worth it, she argued. Terming the pandemic as a "public health catastrophe", Mazumdar-Shaw said there is nothing wrong in government exerting pressure on the regulatory bodies to review the vaccine candidates. On a certain section of people worried about side-effects of Covid-19 vaccine, she said they should not feel like that, adding, it's not unsafe but the only thing one may not know as of now is how durable it is. "Right now, as a person, I am not concerned about safety and efficacy (of Covid-19 vaccine). I am more concerned about: Will it protect me long enough?". "If I were asked whether I will vaccinate myself, I will say 'yes'; because whatever it is, I would like to at least protect myself. I am one of those fortunate people who actually developed natural immunity because I got Covid-19. But would I recommend that my family takes it? I would say 'yes'," the 67-year-old said. Mazumdar-Shaw, who has more than four decades of experience in biotechnology, underlined that there is a need to allay fears of people on safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines and to remove vaccine hesitancy. "It is important to build that reliability and awareness saying that the vaccines are safe, and over time we will know how effective they are in terms of durability", she added. Noting that "so many" vaccines are being developed because of the pandemic, Mazumdar-Shaw said in an year's time it would be known as to which one is more effective than others. "... we have no other option. We need to get back to normalcy. I think taking a safe and efficacious vaccine... (even if) with limited protection, you should take it. It's the way I look at it", she said||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/will-take-covid-19-vaccine-safety-and-efficacy-not-a-concern-kiran-mazumdar-shaw-925368.html

Some of them sought a probe.  “As expressed by MLAs on both sides, there is sufficient scam in this. I’ve seen myself during visits how equipments are lying unused with no work happening. I see that money was spent four times more than what was necessary. This is a big scam. I will have this probed,” Yediyurappa said, urging Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri to consider constituting a joint legislature committee for this.  “It’s not about who was or is in power. The people concerned have cheated by not even showing up to repair the units. A comprehensive inquiry will be done and action will be taken against those responsible for this. The probe will cover different parts of the state in two months and its report will be tabled in the legislature,” Yediyurappa said.  According to Rural Development & Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Minister KS Eshwarappa, a recent survey commissioned by his department showed that of the 18,500 pure drinking water units, 70 per cent were functioning, 26 per cent were temporarily dysfunctional and 4 per cent were permanently shut. “We are not silent on this. This was one of the first things we discussed in detail in the very first Cabinet meeting of our government,” he said . BJP legislators such as Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and Araga Jnanendra called it a scam. “These units were set up expressly to make money. One unit can be installed at a cost of Rs 3-4 lakh, but tenders have been given at a cost of Rs 15-10 lakh per unit,” Jnanendra said.  Former JD(S) minister Venkatrao Nadagouda said this is a problem everywhere. “Tenders are awarded, but no maintenance is being done,” he said.  The government’s initiative to launch a probe is seen as getting back at Congress leader HK Patil, under whose tenure as RDPR minister many of these reverse osmosis (RO) water units were installed. Patil went after the government for alleged irregularities in Covid-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bs-yediyurappa-orders-probe-into-drinking-water-units-alleged-scam-925376.html

The Congress has dubbed the Bill as “anti-farmer”. The JD(S), which positions itself as a pro-farmer party, faced protests following the Bill’s passage.  "The responsibility of an opposition party is not merely limited to opposing the government's moves. It has to work creatively to provide a solution," Kumaraswamy said, reaffirming the party's decision.  The regional party had objections to certain sections of the proposed amendment and it worked with the ruling party to ensure that these sections were dropped in the interest of the farmers, he said in a tweet.  "While earlier, the government had proposed to increase the ceiling for land holding to 248 acres per person, that section has now been dropped. It has also ensured that land under irrigation will be used only for agriculture under section 80. The party has ensured that even with the amendment, the tiller of the land will be the owner, in line with the vision of stalwarts such as D Devaraj Urs. However, the role of Congress is limited to just opposing the government's decision without offering any solution," Kumaraswamy added.  Much has been discussed about the utilitarian value of Sections 79 (a) and (b) under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act. “Prof Nanjundaswamy himself had once said this was against the interest of the larger public as it limited people's freedom to purchase agricultural land. Repealing these sections will now enable more youngsters to take up agriculture,” Kumaraswamy said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/hd-kumaraswamy-defends-jds-backing-land-reforms-bill-925391.html
09-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Assembly passes anti-cow slaughter Bill||The controversial Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, was passed in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday amid protests by the Opposition.  The Bill proposes to prohibit slaughter of cows and other cattle. It is widely seen as the BJP’s push for the Hindutva agenda.  The Bill will now go to the Legislative Council, the upper house, for approval.  The Opposition objected to the tabling of the Bill saying it was not discussed in the Business Advisory Committee meeting held Tuesday.  Under the Bill, 'cattle' is defined as cow, calf of a cow and bull, bullock and male/female buffalo below the age of thirteen years. Slaughter of cattle will be a cognisable offence and will attract three to seven years of imprisonment and a fine that shall not be less than Rs 50,000, extendable up to Rs 5 lakh.  A second and subsequent offence will attract a "fine not less than Rs 1 lakh but which may extend to Rs 10 lakh along with imprisonment which may extend to seven years," the Bill said. A police officer of sub-inspector or higher rank, or a competent authority has the power of search and seizure, if they have "reason to believe that an offence under this Act has been committed". After the seizure, the officer shall report it "without unreasonable delay before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for confiscation." The Bill also recommended constituting special courts for the purpose of speedy disposal of disputes under this Act. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah-led Congress rushed to the well of the House. Siddaramaiah said the Bill was introduced in a “clandestine manner” as it was not part of the day's agenda.  The demonstration by Congress members led to sloganeering from both ruling and opposition camps, with BJP legislators accusing Congress of being a pro-cow slaughter party. BJP members were seen wearing a saffron shawl.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-assembly-passes-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-925416.html

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state’s public health and family welfare minister Rajesh Tope have been making repeated requests over the last two days to motivate citizens to be part of the blood donation process. The State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) is also reviewing the stock situation daily. According to last week’s status, there are 19,059 units of blood and 2,583 units of platelets in 344 blood banks in Maharashtra out of which 3,239 units of blood and 611 units of platelets are in 58 blood banks in Mumbai. The collection has been badly affected because of the Covid-19 lockdown, unlock situation, as colleges where camps are regularly held were shut. “The shortage is acute,” Tope said, appealing people to donate blood. According to reports, scheduled as well as emergency surgeries may be affected because of the shortage. Coinciding with the 74th birthday of Congress, the party organised several blood donation camps. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar turns 80 on 12 December, when the party would hold blood donation camps. Shiv Sena too has been holding blood donation camps. Yuva Sena leader Samadhan Sarvankar has organised a blood donation camp on Sunday wherein donors will be compensated with one kg chicken or paneer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/acute-blood-shortage-in-maharashtra-surgeries-to-be-impacted-925320.html

Hema (43) and Bhambani (65) were murdered on December 11, 2015. Upadhyay’s husband artist Chintan Upadhyay and four others -- Azad Rajbhar, Pradeep Rajbhar, Vijay Rajbhar and Shivkumar Rajbhar alias Sadhu -- all part of a fabrication unit – have been arrested by the Mumbai Police. The prime suspect in the case, Vidyadhar Rajbhar, a metal fabrication artist, who the police claimed had carried out the murders at the behest of Chintan, has remained untraceable since the crime. The crime came to light on December 12, 2015, when two bodies wrapped in plastic and packed in separate cardboard boxes were found dumped in an open drain at Dahanukarwadi in Kandivali here. The bodies were identified as that of Hema and Bhambani. Chintan was arrested on December 22, 2015, and so far, has not been able to secure bail. A Mumbai court is conducting the trial of the case. The motive behind the murders is still not clear, but police had said Hema and Chintan, married in 1998, were in a legal battle on divorce and alimony for five years and there was a dispute among them over a flat in Juhu. As far as the Rajbhars are concerned, since both of them were artists, they knew them and were basically metal fabricators working for the couple. On December 11, Rajbhar -- who had a financial dispute with Hema over an art installation -- allegedly called Hema to his workshop saying he had evidence that would help in her alimony case. However, Hema preferred to take her lawyer along with her and he too became a victim. Both of them met in her Juhu studio and then went to the warehouse of the Rajbhars, where they were killed and the bodies were later dumped.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/prime-suspect-in-hema-upadhyay-harish-bhambani-murder-case-absconding-925323.html

The state government had last month empowered district collectors and local authorities to decide on reopening of schools, which have been shut since March this year due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown, for classes 9 to 12 based on the pandemic situation in their areas. "The school education department will discuss the issue of reopening schools with the public health department. Once we get their approval, we will resume classes," Gaikwad told reporters. Major cities in the state, including Mumbai, Mumbai suburbs, Thane, Pune and Nashik will be notified about reopening of schools only after consultation with the state public health ministry, she said. "We are consulting parents and local officials in this regard. Local officials have also conducted a large number of RT-PCR tests on school teachers and non-teaching staff before reopening schools," Gaikwad said. At least three lakh students from classes 9 to 12 have been attending schools in 25 districts of the state since November 23, the minister said, adding that the figure has increased to five lakh as per a review taken last week. As of Tuesday, Maharashtra overall Covid-19 caseload stood at 18,59,367, including 47,827 fatalities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-schools-to-reopen-for-classes-5-to-8-after-health-departments-nod-925364.html
09-12-2020||West||Mumbai-based writer revives tent cinemas of yore||At a time when smartphones have emerged as a popular form of entertainment, Mumbai-based researcher and writer Sharon Irani takes us back to the days of tent-show cinemas.“More than a century ago, tent shows were a major form of entertainment. A few tent shows still run in the hinterland,” Sharon told DH on Wednesday.During the last weekend, she had made a presentation on “From Tent-shows in the Maidan to the Lost Cinemas of Lamington Road: The Story of Bombay’s Early Film Culture" hosted by the Mumbai Research Centre of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai. It was on July 7, 1896, when the French cinematographers' duo Lumiere Brothers arranged a screening of six films at the Watson Hotel in Bombay – marking the birth of cinema. Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatavdekar of Bombay was in attendance and he then made the first Indian motion picture ‘The Wrestlers’.This was much before the 1913 release of 'Raja Harishchandra', the first feature film of the silent era made by Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of Indian cinema. Bhatavdekar in Bombay and Jamshedji Framji Madan in Calcutta, now Kolkata, imported short reels and showcased them alongside their own work. Abdulally Esoofally was another early film entrepreneur who started the tent show cinemas all over British territories in East Asia and eventually moved to buy Alexandra Theatre and Majestic Theatre. He was in partnership with Ardeshir Irani, who made 'Alam Ara', India's first talkie that was released in 1931.  "These men behaved like technology start-up companies today, constantly thinking how to innovate fresh formats for the audiences," she said. “This started a cinema-viewing culture…tent cinemas were set up in maidans, and then inside old theatre houses…much before cinema halls and multiplexes came into existence,” said Sharon.“Before the 'tambu' talkies, 'lavani' and 'tamasha' had been the sources of entertainment…but tent shows changed the way you entertained in those times,” she said. She took the online viewers on a trip through the evolution of cinema from its earliest avatars, with an introduction to famous personalities like Kajjanbai, Patience Cooper, Jamshedji Framji Madan, 'Fearless' Nadia and others. According to her, ‘The Cinema Travellers’, a film directed by Shirley Abraham and Amit Madheshiya and produced by Cave Pictures, was released in 2016, on the current condition of tent shows. Drawing a comparison of tent shows to cinemas and the current entertainment scenario, she said: “While you can sit at home and watch any number of movies on whichever streaming platform of your choice, the experience of going to a cinema has always been a collective gathering, a shared experience. This is why people would, earlier, dress up to go to the cinema or the theatre. As an audience, we understand that it is an experience. Cinema halls were built like fantasy palaces, with luxurious furnishings. ”On the Plague and Covid-19 comparison and entertainment, Sharon points out: “With Covid, sometimes, forcing our methods to go full circle back to the 1890s maybe it's time to indulge in a little bit of nostalgia and flashback.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-based-writer-revives-tent-cinemas-of-yore-925380.html
09-12-2020||West||Kisan Bagh movement starts in Maharashtra||With Tuesday’s Bharat Bandh in solidarity with the farmers, a new Shaheen Bagh-type protest is gaining pace in Maharashtra – the Kisan Bagh movement. The Jan Andolanichi Sangharsh Samiti (JASS), a body of 70-odd organisations, unions, NGOs, is spearheading the campaign. On Tuesday, outside the Pune Collectorate, a group of 50-odd farmers staged a sit-in and they claim to do so till the three farm laws are repealed. The agitation in Pune is led by Baba Adhav, the 90-year-old 'hero' of the working class. Baba Adhav had taken part in the Independence movement, Samyukta Maharashtra movement, protests against Emergency and several other protests and campaigns. Coinciding with International Human Rights Day on Thursday, a group will start a sit-in outside Konkan Bhavan, which houses the Divisional Commissioner’s office of Konkan region. “The peaceful protests need to continue. We want to cover all the regions - Konkan, Western Maharashtra, North Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha,” Vishwas Utagi, the convenor of JASS, told DH on Wednesday. “The laws would undermine the autonomy of the farming community and reduce them to dependent producers within the structure of corporate farming. Under the banner of the ‘One Nation, One Market’ dominated by large corporations, the laws would render the long standing protection of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) redundant, which was critical in regulating agricultural produce and ensuring food security in the country,” he said. According to Utagi, the agrarian economy has been in crisis over the six-and-a-half years of BJP rule as the increase to the MSP has been deliberately suppressed, credit to rural areas shrunk along with a year on year reduction in government expenditure. While the existing agricultural produce markets and the MSP mechanism are not without flaws and require change, turning agriculture over to corporates is not the solution, Utagi said. “Recommendations for reforms made by M S Swaminathan, who chaired the National Commission for Farmers, have been completely ignored by the BJP while promising ‘doubling farming incomes by 2022’. The new laws will not just affect large farmers, they will impoverish small and marginal peasants and make millions of landless agricultural workers unemployed, changing the very structure of the agrarian economy. "In an economy where manufacturing, industry and services fail to create jobs, the agrarian economy forms the backbone for the livelihood for nearly half the country’s people,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kisan-bagh-movement-starts-in-maharashtra-925459.html
