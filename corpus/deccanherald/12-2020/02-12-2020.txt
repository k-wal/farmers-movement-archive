02-12-2020||First Edit||Funds to MPs: Wrong decision||Chief Minister Yediyurappa’s decision to accede to the demand of MPs from the state to release Rs 3 crore to each for developmental works in their constituencies is wrong. This is in direct conflict with the Centre’s decision to suspend the Member of Parliament Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years, so that funds can be better deployed to combat Covid-19. Yediyurappa has said that this will be implemented only in the next budget, so we must hope that better sense will prevail by then. With 40 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members from the state, this special grant would entail an expenditure of Rs 120 crore at a time when the state is reeling under an acute financial crisis. The MPLADS is a politically and morally wrong scheme and it violates the best norms of governance, financial prudence and administration. MPLADS was introduced in 1993 by the then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao as a State-sponsored reward for MPs to keep his minority government afloat. Even so, the original aim of the scheme was to enable MPs to create durable assets pertaining to drinking water, education, public health, sanitation and roads in their constituencies. Following a subsequent amendment, this year, all BJP MPs donated Rs 1 crore from MPLADS to the newly formed PM-Cares fund to deal with Covid-19, leading to criticism that the amount could have been better served had it been utilised to address the pandemic by creating related assets in each parliamentarian’s constituency. Nonetheless, MPLADS has been plagued by various controversies, including charges of corruption or misuse of funds arising from CAG audits. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution and the Second Administrative Commission headed by Veerappa Moily had recommended its discontinuation. The scheme violates the separation of powers between parliament and executive because MPs are not expected to be directly involved in public expenditure. They can prompt the government to undertake development work and even specific projects, but should not take money and implement them. Most MPs have failed in bringing much-needed projects to the state, including those related to Bengaluru that have been pending before the Centre for years. MPs should act as a link between the Centre and state to ensure overall development of the state. Both the Centre and the state should put an end to discretionary use of funds by elected representatives by scrapping both the MPLADs and the Member of the Legislative Assembly Development Scheme (MLALADS). The history of the scheme is one of arbitrary selection of projects, misspending, wastage, underutilisation and corruption. It is also not possible to make MPs accountable for the scheme. The proposal should be dropped altogether.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/funds-to-mps-wrong-decision-922274.html
02-12-2020||In Perspective||Farm laws are women’s issues, too||It’s been two months since I met Kalyani. She was sitting with six other women on the footpath in front of the Town Hall in Tumkur. They were bargaining with the masala groundnut seller -- a typical Bengaluru belt scene – even as Kalyani untangled the cable of the microphone she was holding. Their union, the Akhila Bharatiya Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane, was there to express solidarity with the farmers’ community. Talking about the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 (ECA), Kalyani said that the removal of cereals, pulses, potatoes and onions among others from the purview of the law, would further worsen the already poor nutrition levels among rural women. “The women in poor rural families do not have a good share of food. They usually end up eating leftovers. Now, this amendment will cause a price hike in the basic ingredients of our staple diets. We won’t be able to afford them, and that will impact our nutrition levels,” she explained. The government should listen to the voices of women, too, on the matter of food and nutrition. But will it? The amended ECA states that the central government may regulate the list of essential commodities under extraordinary circumstances. Surprisingly, having brought in the amendment in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, the pandemic does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for it! The inexpensive availability of staple crops has, over the years, reduced the problem of hunger. Removing them from the essential commodities list will mean that they would not be available for the poor under the Public Distribution System (PDS) once the market forces kick in. That means, increased hunger and malnutrition, especially among rural women. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020 claims to create an efficient, transparent and barrier-free framework for electronic trading of farmers’ produce. This Act is hailed for its potential to break through physical boundaries of a market and allow a farmer to directly sell her produce, without middlemen in the picture. It looks neat on paper. Here is the ground reality in three numbers: According to the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, 74% of the rural female workforce is in agriculture. The National Council of Applied Economic Research says that women constitute over 42% of the total agricultural labour force in India. And according to a global survey, 15% of women in India own smartphones, mostly in the cities. The digital divide is real, and gender-based digital divide is even more so. A woman who could be the landowner or a sharecropper without the privilege of owing a smartphone or having access to electronic trading has to depend on a third party for transactions. Though this is not an exclusive challenge created by the new Act, it still does not address it. If it deepens the existing gender disparity, it cannot be called ‘reform’. It will force women to drop out of the labour force, or worse, they will have to continue what they are doing without a voice. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 provides a framework for contract farming agreements. Going back to the statistics, 73.2% of rural women workers are farmers but only 12.8% of them own land. The Act will mean that women farm labourers will have no agency whatsoever. But it also worsens the structure by keeping the women away from decision-making positions. The quality, time, standard, price, etc., of the produce will be decided by a corporate giant and by the landowner. Women who are farm labourers, tenant farmers or sharecroppers, will have no say in this agreement. In the rare scenario where the woman is the landowner, she still won’t have enough agency to fight the middlemen or the bureaucracy in case of force majeure or disputes. Any dispute arising from the agreement must be resolved in a conciliation board set up by the sub-divisional magistrate. A small landowner fighting a group of corporate and bureaucratic entities, which are mostly filled with men – won’t that be overwhelming? Needless to say, that there’s no provision of a conciliation board that a woman farm labourer can go to if she’s not getting her share or money. Landowners’ burden and risk is inevitably transferred to the women labourer. In addition to these three Acts, the Karnataka Assembly passed a land ‘reform’ Act in the midst of the pandemic. Talking about the same, Nalini Gowda of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) said it would damage the entire rural structure. “Small and medium farmers will be pressured to give away their lands to IT/privileged professionals who want to ‘try’ farming. Debt, alcoholism and other rural realities will eat away whatever money farmers get by selling land. Men will end up migrating, and rural women will be stuck with the burden of running their families,” she feared.

Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, he said, former chief minister Siddaramaiah who claims himself as the leader of Kurubas and backward classes, has no support of any community at present. If Siddaramaiah has the support of all Kurubas and backward classes, why Congress lost in the polls. Siddaramaiah deserves the credit of eradicating Congress in Karnataka, he taunted. Ridiculing the Congress leader, Eshwarappa said: "He should have used the term crossbreed after seeing Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. We use such a term for dogs. Siddaramaiah governed the State as the chief minister for five years. Does not he know the sufferings of Hindu women who became victims of Love Jihad? The population of Muslims is rising in the country due to religions conversion, he alleged. He said, Siddaramaiah's claim that RSS is behind Kurubas demand for ST tag is far from the truth. Referring to BJP leader H Vishwanath's attack on the chief minister, he said, the party leaders should not make such statements in public and they should discuss it in the party forum. The Central leaders would resolve the issues and such statements hurt workers, he added. On the gram panchayat polls, he claimed that BJP has given basic facilities in rural areas. It has given employment through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The BJP would give equal importance to gram panchayat polls and Lok Sabha polls, he stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/i-am-not-a-leader-of-kurubas-k-s-eshwarappa-922539.html

Shanthakumar threatened of launching 'jail bharo' movement if the Union government failed to resolve the issues of the farmers. Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, “When a prime minister of another country could raise voice in favour of our farmers, our PM has no time to respond.”  Nagendra described the BJP-led Union government, is worse than the British rule. It is ill-treating the farmers, who are urging to resolve their issues. The government’s move is a threat to the nation and the farming community. Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed his concern towards protesting farmers. But, the government is reluctant, he said. Though more than 500 farmers' organisations are protesting in Delhi, only 40 organisations were invited for discussions. The government is trying to divide the farmers, he blamed. The farmers in Karnataka are planning to participate in the ongoing protest in Delhi. As many as 100 vehicles will be arranged to ferry farmers, he said. The farmers of the region have decided to stage a protest in front of Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru, during the winter session between December 7 and 15. While the sugarcane growers have decided to stage protest on December 8, demanding to increase the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane, the members of Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha Mattu Hasiru Sene have decided to protest from December 7 to 15, opposing amendment to the Land Reforms Act and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act.  Kurubur Shanthakumar said that the members of the association, along with the farmers, will stage a protest against the government demanding to increase FRP to Rs 3,300 per quintal of sugarcane. The sugarcane growers have been suffering due to crop loss and other problems. The government should bail out the farmers by increasing the FRP, he demanded. Badagalapura Nagendra said, "As the amendments are likely to be passed by the state government through ordinances, the farmers will stage a protest during the session opposing it. It has to be noted that the government had presented the amendment bills in the monsoon session of the legislature."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/delhi-chalo-campaign-farmers-threaten-to-launch-jail-bharo-movement-922593.html

The event aims at creating awareness among the general public about speech and hearing and to instil confidence among the persons with disabilities, according to Amulya P Rao, Research Associate with ISHA. In many cases, individuals with speech and hearing problems were being treated differently and many suffered humiliation in the society. According to her, the needs of children and young people who have difficulties in speaking must be identified as soon as possible to ensure they receive the best support as they face the challenges of learning to communicate. Stereotypical depictions of disability that originate in the arts, film, literature, television, and other mass media fiction works, are frequently normalised through repetition to the general audience.

In a letter to Kateel, Kumar has expressed concern over ministers, legislators and party leaders making public statements over the delayed Cabinet expansion and nominations to various state-run boards and corporations. Kumar urged Kateel to convene a meeting of MLAs so that they can express their views on a party forum. "These public remarks (by ministers and MLAs) have hurt thousands of party workers and well wishers, who are working under a common ideology,” Kumar, who represents Karkala and is said to be a ministerial aspirant, said. The delay in Cabinet expansion has given rise to groupism within the BJP with leaders belonging to different factions hobnobbing. Plus, some of them have publicly expressed their disgruntlement. Particularly, the possibility of MLC CP Yogeeshwar becoming a minister has divided the party, leading to a ‘native vs migrant’ debate. Natives are older BJP MLAs whereas the migrants are those who jumped ship from the Congress-JD(S) last year. “Without discriminating between natives and migrants, they must be made to remember the disciplinary framework of the party. I am confident that you will do that immediately," Kumar told Kateel. The Karkala MLA said that legislators like himself had to express their views on these developments within the party forum. "We would like to share our views regarding developments under the current BJP government, its decisions and activities within the party. The suggestions we offer will help in further strengthening the party and ensuring more efficient administration by the state government," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/convene-mlas-meet-immediately-karnataka-govt-chief-whip-tells-kateel-922422.html

02-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Second wave of Covid-19 in Karnataka expected during Jan-Feb: Technical Advisory panel||The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for Covid-19 in Karnataka has said the second wave of the pandemic is expected in early 2021 and has made a slew of recommendations including banning public celebrations ahead of the new year in a bid to avert a crisis. It has also recommended clamping night curfew during that period, but the government said that it was yet to take a call on the matter. The TAC has said the second wave of the pandemic was expected in January-February next year. It has asked to keep ready by the first week of January, clinical facilities at October level (when daily cases were about 10,000 per day) in terms of beds, ICUs, ventilators, and so on, both in government and private hospitals or this could be ramped up at a short notice of 2-3 days maximum. It has also recommended a ban on new year public celebrations from December 26 to January 1 and impose a night curfew (8 pm to 5 am) during this period. The TAC, based on the deliberations at its 53rd meeting held on November 24, has given an advisory on recognition and containment measures for the second wave of COVID-19 in Karnataka. According to TAC, early recognition of the second wave of Covid-19 in the state can be done by closely monitoring the 7-day average growth rate and reproduction number (R0) at district and state levels. It said that an epidemic intelligence team shall be supporting the state war room for early recognition of the second wave and alert the Additional Chief Secretary and Commissioner of the Health and Family Welfare department. Speaking to reporters here, Health Minister Sudhakar said a meeting will be held at the government level regarding the TAC recommendations. "Our positivity rate is less than 1.2 per cent. The report of the TAC states that there may be a second wave. A meeting regarding this will be held in a couple of days. Based on the outcome of the meet, discussions will be held with the Chief Minister and the final decisions will be taken," he said. To a query on the night curfew, he said no decision has been taken. A meeting is yet to take place to discuss the recommendations. There has been a second wave of Covid-19 in the USA, Europe, Australia, and other countries. Recently, there has been a surge in cases in Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala, and other states, so it is now considered important for Karnataka to prepare for a possible second wave of Covid-19. According to experts, the second wave is anticipated usually three to four months after the first spike or wave i.e., January- February 2021. This is factoring in winter, unlocking progress, weak enforcements, population movements, etc. Noting that a minimum of 1.25 lakh tests per day should continue till the end of February 2021, of which one lakh shall be RT-PCR ( 1:5 pooled in lab as per state protocol), the TAC advisory recommends for fortnightly testing of all teachers, pupils, and staff in educational institutions, Anganwadi staff, and others by RT-PCR. On the need for ramping up clinical facilities, it has suggested exploring Covid Care Centres (CCCs) to be run on a PPP model with reputed NGOs for better facilities, services, and care. After carefully assessing the Covid-19 situation in the last week of December, graded opening of schools from January may be considered, i.e. classes 12 & 10 to initially from January and classes 11 and 9 to follow later on. TAC has also recommended restriction of mass gatherings like fairs and festivals, religious congregations, cultural events, etc., and to strictly restrict super spreader events during December and January (winter months) like permitting events only in open areas like marriages, etc with a cap of 100 people. It could be 200 for political and public events, up to 50 in death ceremonies and 20 in funerals. Suggesting to enforce usage of facemasks, it said more marshals/police can fine violators in busy areas like markets, bus stops, commercial areas, buses, and traffic junctions. TAC also suggested considering introducing tough action like simple imprisonment of a few hours for mask violators as being done in Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/second-wave-of-covid-19-in-karnataka-expected-during-jan-feb-technical-advisory-panel-922464.html

During an interaction with more than a dozen consul-generals, Yediyurappa discussed trade and investments, especially in key sectors such as IT, services, machine tools, manufacturing, and so on. Consul-generals of Spain, Poland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Rwanda, and others were there. “The state has secured the highest FDI among all Indian states in the April-June 2020 quarter, with FDI of over Rs 10,000 crore,” Yediyurappa said, according to a statement from his office. “Moreover, Karnataka has attracted 50% of the investment proposals in India, amounting to Rs 1.1 lakh crore between January and May this year,” he said. Yediyurappa said that Tumakuru, about 70 km from Bengaluru, would be home to one of India’s largest industrial townships with 10,000 acres of the planned area. “We will be pleased to provide infrastructure for your companies as well, to make it easy for them to invest in Karnataka,” Yediyurappa said. Tumakuru has been identified as an industrial node as part of the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (IBIC). Bullish on ease-of-doing-business reforms, Karnataka has taken up several policy measures. Yediyurappa said the reforms initiated in the last six months would help attract investments and develop Tier-II cities such as Mysuru, Mangaluru, Hubballi-Dharwad, and Belagavi. “The critical policy reforms are procurement of land, labour and amendment of Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act that allows any approved project to start without any downstream approvals,” Yediyurappa said, promising to bring ease to regulatory compliance for businesses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/come-to-tumakuru-bs-yediyurappa-woos-consul-generals-922513.html
02-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka BJP speaks in two voices on law against 'Love Jihad'||BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Wednesday asserted that a stringent law against ‘Love Jihad’ will be enacted even as Law Minister JC Madhuswamy said there is no such plan. With an apparent disconnect between the party and the government, there is no clarity on whether a Bill against Love Jihad will be tabled in the winter session of the legislature starting December 7. Speaking to reporters in Hoskote on the outskirts of Bengaluru, Kateel said the law will be enacted against ‘Love Jihad’, a moniker for religious conversions for marriage. “The BJP government in Karnataka is going to take strict action against Love Jihad. Indiscriminate action is inevitable on this front,” he said. Kateel also said that a law prohibiting cow slaughter will be introduced. Kateel’s statement came a day after Madhuswamy said the government has no plan on tabling a bill against ‘Love Jihad’. “No decision has been taken at the government’s level,” Madhuswamy told reporters in Chikmagalur on Tuesday. “Being the chairman of the scrutiny committee, no such proposal has come before me. What else should I discuss when we aren’t going to bring any such law?” he said. Earlier this month, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had announced his intent to ban religious conversions in the name of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-bjp-speaks-in-two-voices-on-law-against-love-jihad-922549.html
02-12-2020||Main Article||Going beyond the slogan||The Prime Minister’s enthusiastic call ‘vocal for local’ or his localisation vision, if you will, has expectedly received media attention and appreciation from many admirers, including in industry. Emphasising self-reliance or an Atmanirbhar India, the government has asked that products not just be made in India, but local brands and supply chains be promoted. While articulating a vision is easy enough, walking the talk needs focus, discipline and entrepreneurial risk-taking, and a progressive policy framework conducive to innovation and scale. It is perhaps about time that local industry and governments together went about the business of translating slogans into action. After all, India is the biggest and the fastest-growing market in the world for the vast majority of product categories. The public healthcare sector, for instance, on which the vast majority of the poor depend, generates significant demand for medical supplies. Ironically, the onslaught of Covid-19 has also brought in its wake business opportunities of considerable magnitude and turned the spotlight on the enormous but woefully under-utilised potential in the country to manufacture quality hospital equipment, medical devices and disposables. We can rid ourselves of the excessive dependence on imported goods that has served as the easy, lazy response in both public and private healthcare in India thus far. Consider this: India imports the bulk of hospital furniture, such as hospital beds, OT tables, despite having a number of local manufacturers, simply because they fall well short of quality standards. Basic medical equipment like ECG machines, bedside monitors, syringes and infusion pumps are mostly imported. There is a large number of fine instruments for ophthalmology and ENT, surgical instruments used regularly, and medical devices commonly used that can be manufactured in India to high quality standards with little investment in Research and Development. Yet, unfortunately, we do not even manufacture a quality, world-class IV Fluid delivery set. This is a shame because these are products used in large quantities. Though a few Indian manufacturers have improved some of their products, the quality does not match up to the best in the world. Our own specifications fall short: they have to be manufactured like precision products; tooling and design, and raw materials, have to be best of class; and the manufacturing process automated with laser-assisted quality checks. There are genuine reasons why our pricing is not right, quality below best-of-class standards, and the extant procurement policy seriously compromised. These deeply entrenched causes need to be addressed. If we want to go beyond being vocal and truly implement local, it will require courage to face up to the political economy dimensions of being a prisoner to imports of even rather basic healthcare supplies -- the vested interests and corrupt lobbies -- that currently circumscribe the healthcare sector. A more important reason, to break out of the health supplies-import syndrome, must be the realisation brought home in morbid fashion by the pandemic -- that there is an urgent need to at least double the existing public healthcare delivery infrastructure. What is more, this will need to be done over the short-term, say no later than the next five years, if we are to be equipped to face other zoonotic pandemics that might confront us in the future. Existing public health infrastructure, including government hospitals and teaching hospitals, can be upgraded and doubled for a fraction of the costs relative to the unconscionably high costs that private hospitals might require. This, in itself, should give the private players a run for their money, and perhaps serve as a catalyst to inspire them to lean more towards Hippocrates and a little less towards Mammon. Yes, considerable changes in public healthcare will need to be wrought, not least to make them more accountable, enhance the quality and the adequacy of service delivery, and upgrade quality assurance standards in both products and services under the public healthcare system. This is not an option but an imperative -- the poor, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable have no recourse but the public health system. Government hospitals and teaching hospitals must be compelled to compete with the private healthcare players, but only after they are provided an even playing field, and of course rigorously audited for performance. To achieve this, the government must specify quality standards for every product used in a hospital to meet the standards prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration or the European CE mark, as the case might be. This is important because when the Prime Minister says go ‘vocal for local’, it is implicit that products be made competitive vis-a-vis global brands, to enable local brands to have a global presence. Several factors determine the length of time it takes for a medical device, particularly a new device, to reach its end-user. One is the time it takes manufacturers to navigate regulatory requirements and establish the safety of a device and its effectiveness before it gets to the market. In terms of these requirements, government needs to demonstrate a strong will to enable completion of regulatory compliance in no more than 12 months. If this is achieved, it would be practicable to mandate adherence by all manufacturers to the new standards prescribed, if they are to be allowed to commence or continue manufacturing, as is the case with the manufacturers of medicines. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation will need to pioneer the regulatory reform process, if the new standards to be set by the government should become the benchmark for manufacturing; and if the approval process is to be simplified. This is a necessary step if we want to emerge as a high-quality hub for the manufacture of quality hospital equipment, medical devices and disposables. This would be action that can transform ‘vocal for local’ from the nicely rhyming but nonetheless the mere slogan that it is to becoming a reality on the ground that will hold meaning for manufacturers and users alike, and help transform public health services for the greater good.

02-12-2020||National||Deep depression over Bay of Bengal now cyclonic storm 'Burevi'||The deep depression over southwest Bay of Bengal intensified into cyclonic storm 'Burevi' on Tuesday and it is very likely to intensify further and cross the Sri Lankan coast on December 2, the India Meteorological Department said. After making landfall in the neighbouring country, close to Trincomalee, it is very likely to emerge into Gulf of Mannar and adjoining Comorin area -around Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu- on December 3 morning, the IMD said in a bulletin. It would then move nearly west-southwestwards and cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Kanyakumari and Pamban in the wee hours of December 4, it said. In south Tamil Nadu and south Kerala, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places and extremely heavy showers at isolated places on December 3, the department had said earlier. Similar spells could be expected on the preceding and following day as well in parts of the two states including Kanyakumari and Thiruvananthapuram, the IMD had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/deep-depression-over-bay-of-bengal-now-cyclonic-storm-burevi-922272.html
02-12-2020||National||Ramdev bats for Centre's new farm laws||Yoga guru Ramdev on Tuesday came out in support of the Centre's new farm laws being stiffly opposed by the farmers, but said the government should have initiated wider consultations with ryots before framing the legislations. Ramdev called on Haryana's Home and Health Minister Anil Vij at his office here on Tuesday. "There is no mention of scrapping MSP in these laws nor there is any such intent of the government. In the recent past, I have talked to the prime minister, Union Home Minister, Agriculture Minister, but I never felt there is any plan of the government to end the minimum support price system," he said in an informal interaction with the journalists at Vij's office. "Why will PM Narendra Modi frame policies against farmers. He is neither a slave of any MNC, nor of any corporate, nor he has any enmity with farmers," Ramdev said, adding the prime minister's intent is clear and "he wants to bring further improvement in the lives of peasants". He, however, felt that before bringing the three agri laws, the government should have held wider consultation with farmers. "This situation (protests) could have been avoided. Now, they have to do this exercise. It may take time, but this issue will settle. The entire government is concerned and wants to resolve the issue at the earliest," he said. Ramdev said whatever he was saying on the farmers' issue is what he felt right, and added that "I am not a representative of the government nor a BJP spokesperson". The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. He said the existing mandis are not going to end, the MSP will continue, and with the enactment of the three farm laws, farmers will now have wider choice to sell their produce. He said some 'middlemen' may have problem if farmers decided to sell crop outside mandis when he gets higher rates, but asked "why should farmers be chained". "And on the other side, if a farmer gets more price for his produce in nearest mandis than outside market, why should he not take the benefit," he said, adding "I don't think any government of the day can scrap MSP over the next 25-30 years". "If you were to ask the farmers and their leaders what is wrong with these laws, they may not be able to exactly tell that," he said. Earlier, Ramdev said that Yoga is his mission and he has been propagating it more, especially when the world is gripped by coronavirus pandemic. He also felt that while various Covid-19 vaccines are in various stages of development, once these are cleared and will be available in our country, the challenge will be to get it to masses in a huge population. He said that Yoga asanas like Bhastrika, Kapal Bhati and Anulom Vilom can have multiple health benefits including strengthening lungs.

02-12-2020||National||Centre deliberately prolonging farmers’ problems: SAD||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday blamed the Centre for “failure” of talks with the farmer leaders, saying it was “deliberately prolonging and deepening” the farmers' problems with an aim of “tiring them out”. The government on Tuesday suggested setting up a committee to look into issues raised by farmers protesting against new farm laws, but it was rejected by representatives of 35 agitating organisations during their marathon meeting with three union ministers that ended without any resolution. The meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital remained inconclusive and the government has called for another round of discussions on Thursday, December 3, farmer union leaders said. The SAD, which had quit the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the new farm legislation in September, cautioned the farmers' organisations against alleged “conspiracies to trap” them with “misleading and vague commitments through tricks like setting up a committee”. Setting up a committee is merely a part of the “delaying tactics to tire the farmers out”, the party alleged in a release here. “But this shows how little does the BJP know about the strength, stamina and staying power of our brave farmers,” senior Akali leaders Balwinder Singh Bhunder and Sikandar Singh said in a joint statement issued here. The SAD praised farmer leaders for not “biting the government's committee bait and for not blinking at the critical hour”. It said the “failure” of Tuesday's talks is the result of the government's “refusal” to focus on the specific demands of the poor and beleaguered farmers. The government is “deliberately prolonging and deepening” the farmers’ crisis with an aim of “tiring them out and prolonging their agony”, it added. Instead of resolving the crisis, it is playing “dangerous political games”, the party said. “But it won't succeed.” “What is there about these bills which are not known to the government or to the farmers? What is it that the government wants a committee to tell the farmers and the government on the issue," the statement quoted the Akali leaders as saying. “The BJP is clearly trying to create divisions in the organisations and may have unleashed agents to accomplish this task. Farmers must be vigilant against such dangerous moves and stay united under all circumstances. Their success depends on their unity and on their success depends on the future of our country,” it said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, protesting against the new farm laws which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and leave them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-deliberately-prolonging-farmers-problems-sad-922298.html

In a video message on Tuesday evening, Desai said the temple trust's move to put up such boards for devotees is an insult to the freedom of expression given by the Constitution. Desai also warned that if the boards are not removed, she and other activists will go to Shirdi in Maharashtra's Ahmedanagar district to remove them. The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust's Chief Executive Officer Kanhuraj Bagate on Tuesday said the trust has just made an appeal to the devotees coming to offer prayers at the shrine, and they have not imposed any dress code on them. He said the appeal was made after devotees complained that some people come to the shrine in "objectionable" attire. Reacting to it, Desai said, "The priests in temples are half-naked, but no devotee has raised any objection to it. The boards should be removed at the earliest, or else we will have to come to Shirdi to remove them." She said devotees of different castes, religions and faith come to Shirdi from across the country and the world. "In India, the Constitution has given the freedom of speech to its citizens and as per that right, it is one's personal choice what to speak and what to wear," she said. All devotees are aware of how to be dressed when they visit a place of worship, Desai said. "In fact, one cannot judge a devotee with what attire he or she is wearing. One's faith is important," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-civilised-dress-must-only-for-devotees-not-priests-asks-activist-922371.html

The NGT also clarified that its earlier direction to restrict the use of firecrackers in cities/towns, where air quality is moderate or below, to green crackers only and for not more than two hours and only for the celebration of any specified festivals or permitted occasions will continue. Such festivals will be specified by the states, the order said. The NGT principal bench headed by Adarsh Kumar Goel said the decision was taken as the pandemic is continuing and is aggravated by the addition of firecrackers. The Tribunal passed this order after hearing a plea seeking a ban on crackers in NCR due to rising pollution and fear of increasing Covid-19 cases. The bench took note of a report filed by the Central Pollution Control Board, which maintained that 'overall, this year Deepawali has witnessed higher background levels of pollutants. "Other than specified festivals, prior permission of the district magistrate of the area will be required for use of crackers for a limited period which will be given having regard to air quality," the Tribunal in its latest order said.

"Why do roads have to be laid in a straight line by cutting trees? Keep roads zigzag. It will reduce speed, lessen accidents on roads and save many lives," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said. The court's suggestion came while hearing a plea by the Uttar Pradesh government for felling 2,940 trees for the Krishna Goverdhan road project in Mathura. The court asked the state government to evaluate trees in terms of the oxygen level that they would have given in their lifetime. The court said that the though PWD assured that they will compensate by planting the same number trees in another area so that there was no loss to the environment in general, it is obvious that there cannot be compensatory reforestation if 100-year-old tree is cut down, the court added.  "It is not possible for us to accept a compensation in merely arithmetical terms especially when there is no statement forthcoming from Uttar Pradesh or PWD as to nature of trees whether they are classified as shrubs or large trees," the bench said. The court also pointed out moreover, there was no information available regarding the age of trees. "Clearly they cannot do so in terms of timber but must adopt a method of evaluation which takes into account oxygen-producing capacity of the particular tree over the remaining life span, assuming it may be cut now," the court said. Acting as amicus, advocate A D N Rao said there was a method of Net Present Value(NPV) for evaluation of trees.  The court asked the Uttar Pradesh government to consider the NPV value and respond within two weeks. "The UP government is to ascertain the total number of trees to be felled for building roads. It is clear that only effect, if the trees are retained, would be roads may not be straight and therefore incapable of high speed traffic. Such an affect may not be necessarily deleterious,"(sic) the bench said.

Around a dozen industry associations have also demanded to stop imposing an anti-dumping duty, mandatory BIS standards, decrease import duty on raw material and ban/restrict export of raw material from the country to enable the plastic industry to survive and remain competitive with other countries like China. The plastics industry in India consists of 50,000+ plastics processing units of which 90% are MSMEs. In a letter, Chandrakant Turakhia, President of The All India Plastics Manufacturers Association has pleaded with the PM for help ‘to save the plastics processing industry which is on the verge of collapse due to the dramatic increase in the price of raw material by raw material manufacturers in the country.’ To elaborate their grievances the associations have said in the letter that the prices of raw materials like PVC, ABS, polypropylene, PC, PET have increased multifold ranging between 20 and 140% over the last five months. “The petrochemical companies are taking advantage of the surge in polymer prices by restricting the supplies to domestic processing units and releasing the material after increasing the prices at regular intervals. Unfortunately, PSUs have also joined hands with private players and are dancing to their tunes and are not serving the processing industries in a fair manner. The rationale of price increased by domestic industries are not justified as compared to international prices,” the letter has stated. It has also mentioned that since domestic petrochemical producers do not enter into forward contracts like overseas producers do, price play and manipulation by domestic companies become very easy. Domestic producers demand anti-dumping proceedings on select grades of polymers on which they are already charging premium due to constrained availability. Raw material manufacturers export raw material in large quantities and create scarcity of the polymer raw materials. This has resulted in an exponential rise in the price of raw material by petrochemicals companies in the last 5 months which is threatening the survival of thousands of plastics processing units in India, the letter has said. It has been signed by heads of the various plastics manufacturing and processors associations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plastic-manufacturers-urge-pm-modi-to-constitute-regulatory-authority-922430.html

A bench presided over by Justice R F Nariman put the appeal filed by the company against the Madras HC order, upholding the closure, for detailed hearing in January. Appearing for the company, senior advocate A M Singhvi, said wastage of national resource can be stopped by allowing short run of the plant for three months.  "There is a pre-conceived decision to not allow the plant to run. The short run would allow us to identify any issues still remaining. The plant was started in 1997. It provided for direct employment to 4,000 people, indirect employment to about 20,000," he said. "There were trickle down dependants, of more than two lakh. It supplied 36 per cent of the country's copper needs. Now, India is becoming dependant on copper imports," he said. He also said the closure of the Sterlite plant has made India a net importer. There were allegations of asphyxiation etc, but the district collector had given certificate that emission was within limits and no one had asked for help. The counsel also said protests had turned violent in May, 2018, following which the Pollution Control Board denied consent to operate and shad hut down the power supply, in mala fide and motivated orders.  The counsel said none of these orders followed principle of natural justice.  The High Court, in its judgement of August 18, went into hundreds of the intervention applications since 2013.  "The order says we have done something wrong even though their own report said everything is fine. Four of the orders were passed after the violence by protesters. What is the public interest I am harming if I go and inspect? It takes two months to make the plant operational because it has been closed for a while," he said. Countering the submissions, the Tamil Nadu pollution control board's counsel said the company was trying to mislead the court, as the industry has been polluting.  At this stage, interim arrangement to reopen the plant cannot be given particularly since the HC had upheld the PCB order for closing the plant, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-declines-vedantas-plea-to-reopen-sterlite-plant-for-interim-measure-922449.html
02-12-2020||National||Include cybersecurity in curriculum: UGC to varsities||The University Grants Commission has directed all varsities and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to facilitate and encourage the academic fraternity to work on cybersecurity and includes the topic in the curriculum. The commission has noted that the government is in the process of formulating a National Cyber Security Strategy document and till then cybersecurity awareness should begin at the school level itself. “Cyberspace is a complex environment consisting of interactions between people, software and services, supported by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices and networks. It is vulnerable to a wide variety of incidents, whether intentional or accidental, manmade or natural. Therefore, cybersecurity awareness has become a prime concern in today's networked world,” UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said in a letter to vice-chancellors. “The government is in process of formulating National Cyber Security Strategy document. In the meantime, it has been decided that cybersecurity awareness should start at school level where syllabus can start with cyber safety measures and progressively include offensive and defensive aspects at IIT and higher education level,” he added. Directing, the HEIs to take appropriate action on the implementation of the cybersecurity awareness, the Commission said, “HEls may further encourage, promote and facilitate the academic fraternity to work on cybersecurity start-ups and conduct of hackathons”. According to the United Nations, millions of children around the world are at an increased risk of online sexual exploitation, violence and cyberbullying as they spend more time on virtual platforms due to the closing of schools amid Covid-19 lockdown. More than 1.5 billion children and young people have been affected by the closing of schools worldwide and many are online now taking classes and socialising, the UN's children's agency UNICEF said. When a nationwide lockdown was announced in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection, all teaching and learning activities had to be moved online to avoid disruption of learning. The National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) had in May sent the detailed guidelines to schools, defining the role of teachers as well as parents in promoting safe, legal, and ethical use of the internet by students. Allowing only authorised people to access computer labs, banning the use of USBs, blocking pop-ups and keeping a check on the appearance of new and unfamiliar icons on desktop were among the cyber security and safety guidelines issued to schools and parents by the NCERT.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/include-cybersecurity-in-curriculum-ugc-to-varsities-922458.html

India is the only high endemic country which has reported a decline of 17.6 per cent in 2019 as compared to 2018 as far as malaria cases are concerned, it said. "The Annual Parasitic Incidence (API) reduced by 27.6 per cent in 2018 as compared to 2017, and by 18.4 per cent in 2019 as compared to 2018. India has sustained API less than one since the year 2012," the ministry said. India has also contributed to the largest drop in such cases region-wide, from approximately 20 million to about 6 million.  The percentage drop in the malaria cases was 71.8 per cent and deaths were 73.9 per cent between 2000 to 2019, the ministry said. India achieved a reduction of 83.34 per cent in malaria morbidity and 92 per cent in malaria mortality between the year 2000 (20,31,790 cases, 932 deaths) and 2019 (3,38,494 cases, 77 deaths), thereby achieving Goal 6 of the Millennium Development Goals (50-75 per cent decrease in case incidence between 2000 and 2019). "Decrease in the incidence of malaria cases is also exhibited in the year-on-year tally. The cases and fatalities have declined significantly by 21.27 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively in the year 2019 (3,38,494 cases, 77 deaths) as compared to 2018 (4,29,928 cases, 96 deaths).  "The total number of malaria cases reported in 2020 till October(1,57,284) has further decreased by 45.02 per cent as compared to the corresponding period of 2019 (2,86,091)," the ministry said. Malaria elimination efforts were initiated in the country in 2015 and intensified after the launch of the National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME) in 2016 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination (2017-22) was launched by the health ministry in July, 2017 which laid down strategies for the next five years. The first two years saw a 27.7 per cent decline in cases and 49.5 per cent reduction in fatalities; 11,69,261 cases and 385 deaths in 2015, and 8,44,558 cases and 194 deaths in 2017. The states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya and Madhya Pradesh disproportionately accounted for nearly 45.47 per cent (1,53,909 cases out of India's 3,38,494 cases) of malaria cases and 70.54 per cent (1,10,708 cases out of India's 1,56,940 cases) of falciparum malaria cases in 2019.  The health ministry said 63.64 per cent (49 out of 77) of malaria deaths was also reported from these states. "Due to the efforts made by the Government of India in the provision of microscopes, rapid diagnostics Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) – about 5 crore of them have been distributed in seven northeast states, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha up to 2018-19 and another 2.25 crore LLINs are being supplied/distributed during the current financial year to high burden areas leading to reduction in endemicity in these otherwise very high endemic states. "An additional procurement of 2.52 crore LLINs has also been initiated," it said. Use of LLINs has been accepted by the community at large and has been one of the main contributors to the drastic malaria decline in the country. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has initiated the High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) initiative in 11 high malaria burden countries, including India. The implementation of the 'High Burden to High Impact (HBHI)' initiative was started in four states, namely, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in July, 2019.   "A key strategy to reignite progress is the HBHI response, catalysed in 2018 by WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria continued to make impressive gains in India, with 18 per cent reductions in cases and 20 per cent reduction in deaths over the last two years," the ministry said. Malaria has been made notifiable in 31 states and UTs and the decline has been observed in the hitherto high endemic states.  Percentage of decline in the year 2019 as compared to 2018 is as follows: Odisha – 40.35 per cent, Meghalaya- 59.10 per cent, Jharkhand – 34.96 per cent, Madhya Pradesh –36.50 per cent and Chhattisgarh –23.20 per cent. The figures and trends between the last two decades clearly show the drastic decline in malaria. The malaria elimination target of 2030 looks achievable building on the Union government's strategic interventions in this regard, the ministry added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-only-high-endemic-country-to-report-malaria-cases-decline-of-176-in-2019-over-2018-govt-922465.html
02-12-2020||National||3 bids for BPCL, says Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan||The government has received three preliminary bids for buying of controlling stake in India's second-largest fuel retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Wednesday. Mining-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta had on November 18 confirmed putting in an expression of interest (EoI) for buying the government's 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL. The other two bidders are said to be global funds, one of them being Apollo Global Management. "Lot of interest is there," Pradhan said at a webinar series on 'The Road To Atmanirbhar Bharat' organised by Swarajya Magazine. "DIPAM has recently informed market... I think three parties have given EoI for the bidding process." He did not give details. Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is handling the strategic sale, had tweeted on November 16 - the last date for bidding - that the transaction advisors (TA) for the sale have reported receiving "multiple expressions of interest." "The transaction will move to the second stage after scrutiny by TA," he had said. Pradhan said the government is looking to privatise some of the state-owned companies to bring in professionalism and competition. "As I have earlier said the government is committed to offloading its share from some state-owned companies. That way more professionalism and competition will come. We are committed and keen on that aspect," he said. A special purpose vehicle floated by the BSE-listed Vedanta Ltd and its London-based parent Vedanta Resources submitted an EoI before the close of the deadline on November 16. The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL as part of plans to raise a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021). But share price of BPCL has plunged by nearly a fourth since the time the strategic sale was approved in November last year. At Wednesday's trading price of Rs 385 on BSE, the government's 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL is worth just over Rs 44,200 crore. Also, the acquirer would have to make an open offer for buying another 26 per cent stake from the public, which would cost about Rs 21,600 crore. Vedanta's interest in BPCL stems from its USD 8.67 billion acquisition of oil producer Cairn India nearly a decade back. The company produces oil from oilfields in Rajasthan which are used in refineries such as those operated by BPCL to turn them into petrol, diesel and other fuels. Sources said transaction advisors have begun evaluating the EoIs to ascertain if the bidders meet the qualifying criteria and have the financial muscle to do the acquisition. This process may take two-three weeks, thereafter a request for proposal (RFP) will be issued and financial bids sought. BPCL will give the buyer ownership to 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh), and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15.3 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.8 million tonnes. While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity -- 12 million tonnes Mumbai unit, 15.5 million tonnes Kochi refinery and 7.8 million tonnes Bina unit. It also owns 17,355 petrol pumps, 6,156 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 256 aviation fuel stations in the country. BPCL is India's second-largest oil marketing company with a standalone domestic sales volume of over 43.10 million tonnes and a market share of 22 per cent during FY20. It is India's sixth-largest company by turnover. Its petrol pumps sell more fuel than the industry average -- BPCL pumps sell 124 kilolitres per month as compared to the industry average of 116, according to the company website. The firm also has an upstream presence with 26 assets in nine countries such as Russia, Brazil, Mozambique, the UAE, Indonesia, Australia, East Timor, Israel and India. It is also making a foray into city gas distribution and has licences for 37 geographical areas (GAs).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/3-bids-for-bpcl-says-oil-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-922466.html

The CSE team purchased 13 brands of honey from the market and tested them at a National Dairy Development Board laboratory in Gujarat. Almost all the top brands (except Apis Himalaya) passed the tests of purity. But when the same brands were examined using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance tests – used in advanced countries to check the honey adulteration - which is mandatory for honey exported from India - almost all brands failed. Out of the 13 brands tested, only three passed the NMR test, which was done by a laboratory in Germany. Indian standards for honey purity cannot detect the adulteration because Chinese companies have designed sugar syrups to bypass such standards. "It is a food fraud more nefarious and more sophisticated than what we found in our 2003 and 2006 investigations into soft drinks; more damaging to our health than perhaps anything that we have found till now,” said Sunita Narain, CSE director general. Out of 22 samples tested, only five cleared all the tests. Nearly 77 per cent samples were found adulterated with sugar syrup, mostly made in China. The CSE investigators sent emails to the Chinese companies posing as honey sellers soliciting syrups that could pass tests in India. They received replies that such syrups were indeed available and could be sent to India. The companies informed that even if 50-80 per cent of the honey is adulterated with syrup, it would pass all stipulated tests. A sample of the syrup that can bypass tests was sent by the Chinese company as 'paint pigment' to get through customs. The team also tracked down a factory at Jaspur in Uttarakhand that manufactures syrup to adulterate honey. The CSE team managed to procure a sample from there too. Subsequently, the team adulterated pure honey procured from the beekeepers with the sugar syrup and sent for testing. “What was shocking to find is that adulterated samples with 25 per cent and 50 per cent sugar syrup passed the test of purity. We confirmed that sugar syrups exist that can bypass the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s, 2020 standards,” said Amit Khurana, programme director of CSE’s Food Safety and Toxins team. “The business of adulteration has evolved so that it can pass the stipulated tests in India. Our concern is not just that the honey we consume is adulterated, but that this adulteration is difficult to catch. We have found that the sugar syrups are designed so that they can go undetected.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/honey-sold-by-major-brands-in-india-adulterated-with-sugar-syrup-cse-922469.html

However, it is an open competition and the one who gives the right atmosphere and security in which talent can work will get the investments, he told reporters here. Ahead of his Mumbai visit, ruling Congress in Maharashtra had alleged a conspiracy to snatch away the FilmCity to UP, and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had vowed not to allow anybody to "forcibly" take away businesses. "We are not snatching or hindering anyone's investments," Adityanath said. "No one can take anything along. It is not like a purse which gets taken away. This is an open competition. One who can give a safe atmosphere, better facilities - and especially social security - in which one can work without discrimination will get investments, he added. Responding to Sena MP Sanjay Raut's assertion that replicating the FilmCity in other city is a tall task, Adityanath said, "weve not come here to take away anything." "We are creating something new. Why are you getting concerned? We are giving a new world class infrastructure to all. Hence, everybody will have to grow up, widen his thinking and better facilities will have to be given. One who is able to do that will get the people, he added. Earlier in the day, Raut said it is not easy to shift Mumbai's FilmCity elsewhere even though attempts have been made for it. "What is the status of Noida FilmCity now? Can you create Mumbai's FilmCity in Lucknow and Patna?" Raut had said while speaking to reporters. "Earlier, attempts were made. It is difficult to replicate Mumbai's film industry elsewhere. Mumbai has a glorious film history and past," Raut said. Ahead of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart's visit to the financial capital, Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday warned he will not let anybody "forcibly" take businesses away from the state, adding Maharashtra is not "jealous" about someone's progress if it happens on the back of fair competition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-snatching-or-hindering-anyones-investments-yogi-adityanath-allays-fears-on-filmcity-impacting-mumbai-film-industry-922481.html

In letters to Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police, the MHA said the three-tier mechanism is needed to tackle the menace in a "comprehensive and full-bodied manner". At the state level, an Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau (AHTB) should be set up under an additional director general of police "to oversee and coordinate" all trafficking-related issues within the state and for coordination with other states and union territories. The states should also notify an Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) in every district, which shall be responsible for all human trafficking-related matters in its jurisdiction and will report to the state-level AHTB. The district-level ATHUs will be headed by a superintendent of police or deputy superintendent of police. States should also set up a Women Help Desk in every police station and be given the responsibility to undertake matters of rescue, prevention, protection and support investigation of human trafficking cases of women. It will coordinate activities with other police stations and will also perform such duties and responsibilities as directed by the district AHTU. "By establishing the above arrangement, each state will have a unit for preventing and countering human trafficking at all levels of the State/UT-Headquarters of the State/UT, district level and police station-level, thus dealing with the problem of human trafficking in a comprehensive manner," MHA Deputy Secretary Arun Sobti said in the letter sent on Monday. Sobti said Rs 25.16 crore was released between 2010 and 2019 for setting up such units in 332 districts, another Rs 100 crore from Nirbhaya Fund was released in March this year to extend the programme to all the 739 districts in the country as well as under the border guarding forces. Another Rs 100 crore under the Nirbhaya Fund was also allocated for setting up the Women Help Desks. In July, DH had reported that the MHA had asked states to provide extensive training for police personnel at state border outposts to spot victims and involve panchayats in identifying children vulnerable to criminal gangs, fearing that the economic strain unleashed by the Covid-19 could lead to increased human trafficking.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/set-up-anti-human-trafficking-units-in-all-districts-mha-to-states-922485.html

The farmers’ organisations also decided to burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani in every village on Saturday, which will be followed up by the return of all state awards by many sportspersons and ex-servicemen. The protesting farmers are scheduled to meet the ministerial panel headed by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday and submit in writing their objections to the three farm sector laws passed by Parliament in September. This meeting is a follow up to the deliberations on Tuesday which remained inconclusive. “If there is no outcome after Thursday’s talks, we will intensify our agitation. More farmers will be joining us in the coming days,” Darshan Pal, President of the Krantikari Kisan Union told reporters after the meeting of farmers’ organisations. “We demand that the government convene a special session of Parliament to repeal the three farm laws,” Pal said. The leaders of 35 farmers’ organisations, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, held talks with Rakesh Tikait, the leader of the Tikait faction of Bhartiya Kisan Union, which wields considerable influence in western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Uttarakhand. “Rakesh Tikait has also agreed to join us in the fight against the farm laws,” Pal said at the press conference at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border flanked by Shiv Kumar Kakkaji of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and other leaders. Tomar ruled out granting statutory cover for minimum support price for farm produce, insisting that it was an administrative decision and should remain so. “Let us see to what extent issues can be resolved... the laws are in their interest and the reforms have been carried out after a long wait. But if they have any objection to it then we are ready to address their concerns,” Tomar said. The protesting farmers blocked key arterial roads linking the national capital with Noida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh. Delhi Police advised motorists to avoid the Chilla Border in East Delhi and Kalindi Kunj flyover connecting Noida with South Delhi due to the farmers’ agitation. A senior police officer said "The farmers at Ghazipur Border wants to either move to Ram Leela Maidan or to Jantar Mantar. Everyday, they try to push our barricades with their vehicles in an attempt to enter Delhi but in any case, we will not allow them to enter. However, the situation on ground now remains peaceful. "Cemented barriers and multi-layered barricades have been put up besides heavy security personnel at Ghazipur border near UP gate where many farmers have been protesting since Saturday," a senior police officer said. A protestor camping at the Ghazipur border said farmers are here despite facing huge losses back home. "This is the time we harvest sugarcane. But this is more important. We will continue to protest until the government agrees to our demands," Sonu, a member of Muzaffarnagar Bharatiya Kisan Union, told PTI. The Bar Council of Delhi has urged the PM to withdraw the farm laws, as they encroach upon the jurisdiction of civil courts by entrusting settlement of disputes with the sub-divisional magistrate. The protest at the Delhi-Noida route (Chilla Boarder) intensified leading to the closure of the key route for the second consecutive day as more farmers from Firozabad, Meerut, Noida and Etawah started gathering there. Later, one carriage was opened for motorists.     (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/call-special-parliament-session-to-repeal-farm-laws-protests-will-continue-farmers-to-centre-922516.html

The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) is the apex body of transporters, representing about 95 lakh truckers and other entities. "AIMTC has already extended its support to the farmer agitation from day one. We have decided on stopping our operations strategically starting from North India and if the government does not address the issue of the farmers then we may decide to go for shutting down of transport operations nationwide in their support," AIMTC President Kultaran Singh Atwal said. Atwal said the road transport fraternity of the country has extended its full support to farmers who are 'ann daata' (food providers). AIMTC Core Committee Chairman Bal Malkit Singh told PTI, "Starting December 8, we will halt the movement of supplies in entire North India including Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. We will then escalate it to entire country if the government fails to address their issues." The AIMTC, in a statement, said the farmers are fighting for their legitimate rights and over 70 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture. Entire North India is affected and thousands of trucks carrying food, vegetables and other perishable and non-perishable items coming from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are impacted, it said. AIMTC supports the farmers as 65 per cent of the trucks are engaged in carrying farm produce, it added. "At present it is the season of apples, which are getting wasted. Apart from that potatoes, onions and other fruits and vegetables as well as other essential commodities like medicines, milk etc too (are) stuck up as their movement is disrupted, which is leading to their shortage in Delhi and in other northern states," the statement said. The situation will worsen in the days to come, unless the government take prudent and pragmatic steps to resolve farmers' concerns, it said. "The government must treat the farmers with dignity and allay their apprehensions on the farm Acts. We wholeheartedly support the cause of the farmers and look forward to a peaceful and amicable resolution of their issues raised by the Government," it said. AIMTC is the apex body of transporters (both cargo and passenger), representing more than 95 lakh truckers and about 50 lakh bus and taxi operators across the country. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for seven consecutive days at the borders of the national capital against the Centre's new farm laws. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will provide farmers with better opportunities. It has also accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/transporters-threaten-to-halt-operations-in-north-india-from-december-8-in-support-of-agitating-farmers-922519.html

Dr Dhananjay Datar, CMD, Al Adil Trading LLC in the UAE, popularly known as Masala King, took painstaking efforts to make this rescue possible through continuous communication and following up with the Indian Embassy in Djibouti which is close to Yemen. The Indian workers include 6 Maharashtrians named Sandeep Lohar and Nilesh Lohar (Kolhapur), Fairoz Zari (Ratnagiri), Ahmed Wakankar (Dapoli), Tanmay Mane (Alibaug), Dawood Jivarak (Dapoli); the others being -- Chetan Gawas (Goa), Maniraj Marippan, Mohanraj Thanigchalam and William Nicamden (Tamil Nadu), Pravin T. (Puducherry), Abdul Mustaba (Kerala), Hiron Seikh Siddiki (West Bengal) and Sanjeev Kumar (UP). They are expected to return home via Aden by this weekend. The 14 Indian sailors had travelled from Mumbai to Muscat last January to work at an Oman-based shipping company and were accompanied by 6 other sailors from Bangladesh and Egypt.  Since the shipping company got a contract from Saudi Arabia, the crew started its first voyage on two ships on February 3 to the Yanbu port in Saudi. On February 12, the sea turned turbulent and resulted in the sinking of one ship. Fortunately, the crew members of the sunken ship were rescued in time and their journey continued through another ship, but soon, the weather turned rough and cyclonic, forcing the ship to anchor on the spot. What they didn’t know was that the anchor point was actually in a war-prone zone and also within the maritime border of Yemen. As a result, the Yemeni Coast Guards arrested the entire crew and confined them in a hotel in the city of Sanaa for further enquiry. Their passports, documents, cell phones and cash were seized. The group spent six months in isolation at the hotel, expecting their employer to take efforts towards their rescue, much to their disappointment. They couldn’t even contact the outside world as their cell phones were confiscated. It was only a couple of months ago that they were allowed to communicate with their families. Some friends of the confined Indian sailors called Dr. Datar and informed him of their plight, who in turn used his contacts to secure the release.  In a press statement, Dr Datar said, “I have done nothing great. I am determined to help my countrymen who are stranded in a foreign land under challenging circumstances. I wish them to reach home safely and unite with their families.” Dr Datar has also donated a sum of Rs. 20,000 to each of the rescued sailors as emergency help. The Indian Embassy in Djibouti is working towards getting temporary passports and visa documents for the workers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/masala-king-dhananjay-datar-helps-release-20-sailors-confined-in-yemen-for-past-10-months-922525.html

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), cited quick relief to Goswami, who was arrested in abetment to suicide case. Kappan was arrested by Uttar Pradesh police on October 5 while he was on way to Hathras. The police invoked stringent charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Sibal submitted before a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde that Goswami’s plea was decided by the top court though his bail petition was pending before the trial court.  He made this submission, as the court asked him if he has approached the Allahabad High Court seeking relief in the matter.  “In Goswami's case, bail was pending before the lower court and still this court entertained it," he said. Maintaining, "every case is different”, the court asked Sibal, “are you willing to go to the court below?”  Sibal, for his part, replied in negative. The case involved grave violations and insisted on arguing the matter before the top court. “The FIR itself is false. He was arrested on the basis of false allegations," Sibal said.   Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, said the investigation into the matter has revealed some "shocking" details. He said Kappan claimed that he is working as a journalist in a Kerala-based daily but that newspaper was closed two years.  The court posted the matter for consideration next week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-brushes-aside-comparison-of-arnabs-case-with-kappan-saying-every-case-is-different-922527.html
02-12-2020||National||Odisha launches single emergency helpline '112'||Odisha on Wednesday launched emergency helpline '112' to provide all forms of assistance to the people in distress. The '112' integrates emergency services such as police, ambulance, fire department and women's helpline under a Centre-sponsored scheme that is already functional in several states, officials said. People in distress need to just dial '112' now, instead of remembering and calling different helpline numbers such as '100', '101', '102', '104', '108' and '181', they said. All these numbers have now been clubbed into the single toll-free helpline of '112' for the convenience of the people, officials said. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said the unified emergency helpline will enable the police to provide services in a better and efficient manner. Patnaik expressed hope that the facility, which comes into force with immediate effect, will strengthen people's faith in the system. The chief minister also approved the creation of 1,098 posts in the police department for providing quick and efficient services to the people of the state through this facility. Four Deputy Superintendents of Police, 151 Sub- Inspectors, 203 Assistant Sub-Inspectors and 740 Constables will be engaged to provide the '112' emergency service. This apart, 198 call-receiver executives will be outsourced and 236 vehicles will be deployed for the purpose, it said The scheme is aimed at ensuring optimum utilisation of manpower and prompt action on emergency calls. The rescue and service vehicles of all services, including police, fire and ambulance, will be tracked on a real-time basis using a digital map and immediately directed to help those in need, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/odisha-launches-single-emergency-helpline-112-922533.html

IIT-Delhi students bagged over 300 placement offers, including pre-placement offers (PPOs), by the end of the first day of the first phase of the placement season. "Given the situation this year, a new company scheduling paradigm has been conceptualised for a smooth placement process. This is to create an optimum environment for both the recruiters and the students for a seamless selection process. Given the fact that all selection processes are being conducted in a virtual mode this year, the entire interview process would span a single day instead of multiple shifts unlike past years and many other campuses," an IIT-Delhi official said. "What this translates into is that the spread of companies will be more across days. This process will give ample time to recruiters to make selection judgements to facilitate the right fitment both for students and recruiting organisations,” the official added. With a record high in pre-placement offers, many students have already bagged offers as high as Rs 1.54 crore from international companies. The packages for domestic companies have also seen a sharp rise to about Rs 80 lakh this year for all top IITs, including IIT-Madras, Bombay, Roorkee and Guwahati. In IIT-BHU, 217 students have bagged jobs with annual CTC ranging from Rs 11.5 lakh to 64.27 lakh. Last year, it was Rs 10 lakh to Rs 58.21 lakh. In IIT-Madras, a total of 123 offers were made by 222 companies during day one’s session, higher in any of the preceding years. "The year 2020 has seen the placement process happening online and the number of recruiters joining the virtual placement has been very encouraging despite the pandemic and we are thankful to all the recruiters. The students of IIT-Guwahati who are appearing for the placement from across the country are very determined and are likely to benefit from this online process due the equal opportunity provided to them as other institutes and we expect an upward trend in placement this year at IIT-Guwahati," TG Shriram, Director, IIT-Guwahati. At IIT-Bombay, there were 18 companies who participated in the placement drive on December 1. According to a statement from the institute, for domestic jobs, the highest number of offers came from Microsoft, Google, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Boston Consulting Group, and Apple. Amsterdam-based proprietary trading firm Optiver, meanwhile, made lucrative international offers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/iits-beat-pandemic-blues-in-placement-drives-with-record-job-offers-high-salary-packages-922534.html

The bench was hearing a writ petition filed by Kamini Devi and Ajay Kumar of Farrukhabad. The petitioners contended before the court that both of them are adults and in love with each other. They have been living together as a couple for the last six months but Kamini's parents were harassing them as they want her to marry another man. The couple said they made a complaint to the SSP, Farrukhabad in this regard on March 17 but their application was still pending.  The bench while allowing the petition observed, "We are of the view that the petitioners are at liberty to live together and no person shall be permitted to interfere in their peaceful living, as Right to Life is a Fundamental Right ensured under Article 21 of the Constitution of India in which it is provided that no person shall be deprived of his right to life and personal liberty."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/two-adults-can-live-together-without-interference-from-families-allahabad-hc-922535.html

The Central Crime Branch, which was investigating a case against Karnan, arrested him. The former judge of Madras and Calcutta high courts has been making several defamatory remarks against women and judges of the Supreme Court in his videos posted online. He has been booked under Sections 509 (whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any words, makes any sound or gesture) and 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). A case in this regard is also pending before the Madras High Court, which had posed tough questions to the police on why no action was taken against the former judge for his comments. Justice Karnan uploads videos online on several issues, but many find them defamatory and insulting. The action against Karnan comes three years after he was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court. He dodged the police for several days before he was arrested and sent to jail in 2017. He is the first sitting judge of a high court to have undergone prison term while in service.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/former-judge-of-madras-calcutta-high-courts-arrested-in-contempt-case-for-remarks-on-judges-women-922545.html

The top law officer pointed out that the Supreme Court currently has only two women judges as against the sanctioned strength of 34 judges and this figure is consistently low across the higher judiciary. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and S Ravindra Bhat was told by Venugopal that currently no data is centrally maintained on the number of women in tribunals or lower courts. “Improving the representation of women in the judiciary could also go a long way towards a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence. For instance, this Court only has two women judges, as against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges. There has never been a female Chief Justice of India. This figure is consistently low across the Higher Judiciary,” he said, Venugopal gave his suggestion to the bench in an appeal filed by advocate Aparna Bhat against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order granting bail to an accused in a molestation case on the condition that he requests the alleged victim to tie a ‘rakhi’. Suggesting that data should be collected from all High Courts, lower courts and tribunal, Venugopal said efforts should be made for greater representation of women at all levels of the judiciary. Giving the data in his written submission, he said that there are only 80 women judges out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,113 judges in the High Courts and the Supreme Court across India. He said that out of these 80 women judges, there are only two in the Supreme Court, and the other 78 are in various High Courts, comprising only 7.2 per cent of the total number of judges. “Of the 26 courts whose data was accessed, including the Supreme Court, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has the maximum strength of women judges (11 out of 85 judges) in the country, followed by the Madras High Court (9 out of 75 judges). There are eight women judges in both Delhi and Bombay High Courts,” his written submission said. He said that there are six High Courts--Manipur, Meghalaya, Patna, Tripura, Telangana, and Uttarakhand--where no sitting judges include any woman judge. Bhat who also filed her written submission said, “It is submitted that no observation/condition should be included in the judgement which reflects bias and affects the dignity of a woman. It is further submitted that no observation/condition should be made which affects the conduct of the trial in a fair and unbiased manner”. She contended that no observation/condition should be made which permits the accused to meet/have access to the victim and her family members. “It is submitted that no observation/condition should be made which initiates and encourages compromise that normalizes an otherwise heinous crime thus indicating a mindset, which accepts such offences. It is further submitted that no observation/condition should be made which notes that the best option for the victim is to marry the accused,” she said in her written submission. Referring to various cases where objectionable bail conditions were imposed, Bhat said, “It is submitted that in POCSO cases, no observation/condition should be made which takes note of the fact that the victim has attained majority and that the accused has offered to marry her”. She submitted that no observation/condition should be made which allows bail in favour of an accused for the purpose of solemnizing marriage with the victim or on the ground that the victim is of “loose character” or is “habituated to sexual intercourse”. She sought directions to the High Courts, trial courts to ensure that in every order that they pass in relation to cases of sexual violence against women and children, there should be no observation made, conditions imposed or directions passed which are extraneous to the facts and circumstances of the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-has-never-seen-female-cji-improve-representation-of-women-in-judiciary-ag-to-apex-court-922563.html

"I strongly feel that the real tribute to all those known and unknown Freedom Fighters who sacrificed their lives and fought for Liberation of Goa will be by extending a helping hand to the needy. The Government must curtail expenditure on celebrations and focus on providing basic facilities to the Common man, especially during these testing times," Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat told reporters on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Kamat along with former Congress Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane as well South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, had been nominated to a committee appointed by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to organise the yearlong 60th-anniversary celebration events. Working president of the Goa Forward party Kiran Kandolkar also said that his party would not participate in any meeting called to organise the anniversary celebrations. "It’s a waste of precious public money at a time when Goa’s economy is in shambles, with the government borrowing to pay salaries. We stand by our demand that the celebrations should be scrapped and the money be used to help rickshaw owners, motorcycle pilots, taxi owners and bus owners who are badly affected due to Covid19 pandemic," Kandolkar said.Goa was a Portuguese colony for a period of 451 years before the region was liberated by the Indian armed forces in 1961. Earlier this week, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant had said that the Goa government will organise at least one event in every Indian state capital to celebrate the 60th anniversary year of the liberation of Goa from colonial Portuguese yoke. The year-long celebrations would also be used, Sawant had said, to broad base Goa's tourism offerings by highlighting various other lesser facets of the state to potential tourists. The Chief Minister during his visit to the national capital last week had requested the central government for a special Rs. 100 crore package to organise the series of events.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amid-pandemic-60th-anniversary-bash-of-goa-liberation-is-wasteful-oppn-slams-cm-922564.html

"Since these directions are in furtherance of the fundamental rights of each citizen of India guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, and since nothing substantial has been done in this regard for a period of over two-and-half years since the first order passed on April 3, 2018," the bench said. The court said that whenever there is the information of force being used at police stations, resulting in serious injury or custodial deaths, it is necessary that persons should be free to complain about redressal of it.

On the eve of the Armed Forces Flag Day, Singh also appealed to people to contribute to a fund for the rehabilitation and welfare of next of kin of the soldiers who laid their lives in the line of duty, or were rendered disabled. "The entire month of December will be celebrated by the Centre, states and union territories through the Sainik Board as Gaurav Maah," Singh said. The Kendriya Sainik Board is the apex body of the government that formulates policies for rehabilitation and welfare of ex-servicemen and their dependents.    India has been observing December 7 as the Armed Forces Flag Day since 1949 to honour those soldiers who valiantly fought on the borders to safeguard the country's honour. The government had constituted the Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF) for the welfare and rehabilitation of the ex-servicemen (ESM) community. There are more than 32 lakh ESM and around 60,000 are added every year due to superannuation. Urging people to contribute to the AFFDF, he said it was the responsibility of the country to ensure the welfare of the soldiers who have always been fighting valiantly to safeguard the sovereignty of the country. "In the process sometimes, they have even laid down their lives, leaving behind their families or being rendered disabled. The rehabilitation and welfare of our ex-servicemen, the next of kin of our martyrs and our disabled soldiers is the responsibility of all citizens,” he said. “The Flag Day provides us an opportunity to fulfil this responsibility by contributing to the AFFD fund,” he added. Noting that over Rs 47 crore was raised during 2019-20 through voluntary contributions, Singh hoped that people will show the same spirit this year too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/december-to-be-celebrated-as-gaurav-maah-rajnath-singh-on-armed-forces-flag-day-922575.html

Besides the Chairman, the NHRC can have five members -- a sitting or retired Supreme Court judge, a sitting or retired High Court Chief Justice and three members who have knowledge of, or practical experience in matters relating to human rights. With the amendments in the Protection of Human Rights Act in 2019, the government now also has the liberty to appoint a retired judge of the Supreme Court as the NHRC chairperson.

New Delhi has extended an invitation to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to visit India in the last week of January and attend the Republic Day ceremony on the Rajpath in the national capital, sources said. Johnson’s visit to New Delhi is likely to be officially announced by the government of India and the UK once the invitation is formally accepted by 10 Downing Street in London. He is likely to be the first foreign leader to visit New Delhi after the Covid-19 pandemic swept India and the UK as well as the rest of the world. The United States President Donald Trump and Myanmar President U Win Myint were the last foreign leaders to visit India. Trump was in Ahmedabad and New Delhi on February 24 and 25. Myint visited New Delhi on February 27. With shutdowns and restrictions on international travels imposed to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, most of the world leaders switched to video-conference to hold bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral meetings with counterparts, instead of embarking on 'in-person' visits. Modi and Johnson last Friday spoke to each other over phone and reviewed bilateral cooperation in the area of development and manufacturing of the Covid-19 vaccines. They reiterated their shared desire to impart a quantum jump to the India-UK partnership in the post-Covid, post-BREXIT era, and agreed that there is tremendous potential for enhancing collaboration in trade and investment, scientific research, mobility of professionals and students, and defence and security, the Ministry of External Affairs stated. Sources in New Delhi said that Modi had discussed with Johnson the proposed visit of the UK PM during the phone-call. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla also discussed the proposal for the UK PM’s visit to New Delhi when he had recently met Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Philip Barton, during his recent visit to London. The Modi Government hosted Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as the Chief Guest on the occasion of the Republic Day on January 26 this year. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rab Butler was the first dignitary from the UK to attend the Republic Day ceremony of India. He had witnessed the ceremony on the Rajpath in New Delhi in 1956. The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth of the UK were the chief guests in 1959 and 1961 respectively. The UK Chief of Defence Staff, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had been invited as the R-Day Chief Guest in 1964. British Prime Minister John Major was the last UK dignitary to witness the military parade on the occasion of the Republic Day.

The officials of the board also said that if students were not able to sit for practicals in classes before the exams, alternatives would be explored. "No final decision has been taken regarding the dates for conduct of board exams, and consultations with stakeholders are still in process. The exams, as and when they are conducted, will be in written mode and not in an online mode. The exams will be conducted following all COVID protocols," a senior CBSE official said. "In case students are not able to do practicals in classes before the exams, alternatives to practical exams will have to be explored," the official added. Union Minister of Education Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' is supposed to hold an interaction with students, teachers and parents on December 10 on the issue of conduct of board examinations and competitive examinations next year. Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the infections. The board exams that were being conducted in March had to be postponed mid-way. The exams were later cancelled, and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. Competitive exams like JEE and NEET were also postponed twice this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of the continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online. The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Main for admission to engineering colleges across the country is likely to be held in February instead of January, according to officials. The rising number of COVID-19 cases and engineering admission for this year still being underway are among the reasons behind authorities contemplating the move. The JEE-Main, which is the national-level competitive test for admission to various undergraduate engineering and architecture courses, is conducted twice a year – January and April. However, due to the COVID-19 situation, the April exam was postponed twice and conducted in September.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbse-officials-rule-out-conducting-board-exams-online-to-be-in-written-mode-only-922594.html

The evaluation has to be done not in terms of their “timber value” but by taking into account factors like their “oxygen producing capacity,” said the apex court. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian noted in the order that the state government was not in a position to “to make a statement as to how the Forest Department” intended to evaluate the trees in question and granted four week time to the authorities to inform it about the method of evaluation it wanted to adopt. The state government and its authorities including the Public Works Department have filed an application seeking nod for felling of 2,940 trees for the Krishna-Govardhan road project at Mathura. “You can't fell thousands of trees that too in the name of Lord Krishna,” the bench observed orally when a lawyer for the state PWD said that the project also included widening of a road leading to the temple at the birthplace of Lord Krishna at Mathura. “Clearly they cannot do so (evaluation) in terms of the timber but must adopt a method of evaluation which takes into account the oxygen producing capacity of a particular tree over its remaining life span, assuming that it may be cut now,” the bench said. It took note of the statement of lawyer A D N Rao,  assisting it as an amicus curiae, that there was a system of evaluation called Net Present Value (NPV) which takes note of the oxygen producing capacity of a plant also “The State of Uttar Pradesh is expected to look at the NPV method of evaluation also. In any case, at the request of Aishwarya Bhati, ASG, we adjourn the matter(s) for a period of four weeks so that the State of Uttar Pradesh may inform the court about the method of evaluation it intends to adopt,” it said in the order. It also said the state government may also consider the reduction in the number of trees proposed to be fell for the purposes of building the road. “It is to be kept in mind that the only effect that is likely to arise if the trees are retained would be that the roads may not be straight and therefore, not capable of accommodating high speed traffic. Such an effect may not necessary be deleterious particularly since high speed on the highways is known to cause serious accidents and cause of innumerable deaths on Indian roads,” the order said. At the outset of the hearing of a PIL, filed by environmentalist M C Mehta on protection of Taj Mahal and several applications, the bench asked state government as to how many trees it proposed to cut for its project and on being told that several banyan and neem trees were to be felled, it reacted sharply. “Why cannot the road take a turn around the tree. That will only mean that speed will be slow. If the speed is slow, it will lower accidents and will be more safer, “ the bench said. The bench suggested that instead of cutting trees, roads may be built in a zig-zag manner which will reduce the traffic speed and accidents as well. The bench said that it was not possible for it to accept a compensation in merely arithmetical terms “particularly since there is no statement forthcoming from the State of Uttar Pradesh or the PWD as to the nature of the trees that is to say whether they are classified as shrubs or large trees.” “Moreover, there is no information available to us regarding the age of the trees since it is obvious that there cannot be compensatory reforestation if a sampling is planted after one hundred year old tree is cut down,” it noted in the order. It was not prima facie in agreement with the submission that the state authorities would undertake compensatory afforestation by planting the same trees at some other place in and around Mathura, which falls under the Taj trapezium zone. The tree loss will be compensated by afforestation and by payment to the tree fund of the forest department, a lawyer said. “You want to cut 90-year old trees and plant a few week old saplings in lieu of that,” the bench asked, adding that it was not satisfied with this submission. "Living trees cannot be evaluated simply on the basis of timber value. Living trees give oxygen. That should be considered in valuation. Oxygen producing capacity of the tree must be evaluated over its remaining life span," it said. The apex court's nod is needed if any activity, having a repercussion on the flora and fauna of Taz trapezium zone, is proposed by the government authorities and private parties. Meanwhile, the top court granted M.C. Mehta three months' time to undertake further visits and carry out sampling and analysis of major drains and water bodies and the proposed leather parks and also discuss with the local authorities so that the final report may be submitted before it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/felling-of-trees-in-name-of-lord-krishna-cant-be-allowed-sc-over-ups-krishna-govardhan-road-project-922602.html

Accusing Delhi CM of having “fake” sympathy for farmers, Badal also suggested changing the term “crocodile tears” to “Kejriwal tears”. “This is not just political dishonesty in the extreme but also an inhuman betrayal of the simple-hearted and trusting farmers,” said Badal in a statement here. The Shiromani Akali Dal chief said he and the farmers have been shocked to learn that Kejriwal had already implemented the Centre's “anti-farmer” laws and even issued a gazette notification in this regard. “Even a crocodile would have a thing or two to learn from Kejriwal about how to shed fake tears. In fact, the idiom about crocodile tears will have to be changed now to 'Kejriwal tears'," he alleged. Stating that the “latest betrayal” of Kejriwal has “exposed” him as well as the AAP, Badal said the Delhi Chief Minister should withdraw the gazette notification immediately. “Kejriwal should also announce that the Delhi government will not implement the three agri laws and will ensure assured government marketing at minimum support price,” he said. The Delhi government has notified one of the three laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/replace-crocodile-tears-with-kejriwal-tears-sad-chief-922617.html

The speaker took the decision after seeking an explanation from Isaac on the matter. The development came a day after Isaac faced criticism from the CPM state leadership for his open criticism against the raids by state vigilance at state-run Kerala State Financial Enterprises. Congress MLA V D Satheesan moved the breach of privilege against Isaac alleging that contents of the CAG report were disclosed before being tabled in the Assembly. Isaac flayed the CAG for pointing out flaws in Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. Both Isaac and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan even alleged a political ploy behind the report.

Earlier the government warned Twitter for showing Leh a part of China. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney issued the order to Wikipedia on November 27. The government had invoked Section 69A of the Information Technology Act that empowers the government to order intermediaries to block public access of any information. Actions were taken after a Twitter user pointed out the incorrect map on Wikipedia page, linked it the Union Ministry and asked the government to take strict action against the website. The government said that the content posted on the website was done with the intent to “defame” the country and has the “potential to disturb the sovereignty and harmony of the nation”. The contentious Wikipedia page, which links the incorrect map, is on Bhutan-India relations and talks about the ties between the two countries. Wikipedia is one of the popular repositories of information online, and works on a volunteer-based model to compile the information.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-twitter-wikipedia-shows-aksai-chin-as-a-part-of-china-centre-asks-to-remove-wrong-map-922627.html
02-12-2020||National||Kanhaiya Kumar joins Left parties stir against Farm Laws||CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday asserted that the ongoing farmers stir against farm bills was an uprising to save democracy from crony capitalism and deplored attempts to discredit the agitations. Kumar, a former JNU students union president, appealed to people from all walks of life to lend their support to the movement launched by the farmers. He coined a slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Samvidhan to underscore that the stir had far-reaching implications. Some people are whispering conspiratorially why is it that only better-off farmers of Punjab are protesting. This is as abominable as witchcraft being practised in villages where widows are often vilified by those eyeing their property said Kumar, who hit the streets here as part of a joint demonstration by Left parties in Bihar to express solidarity with the agitating farmers in the national capital. I am not a farmer but come from a family of agriculturists. I can understand why agriculture has become an economic activity in which the people involved never want their children to follow in their footsteps, unlike doctors and bureaucrats, he said. Kumar expressed anguish that unlike manufacturers who could determine the maximum retail price of their produce, farmers could not do the same for the minimum support price. He also challenged the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, which has been insisting that the recently passed agriculture laws were not aimed at doing away with MSPs, to make procurement at rates below MSPs a punishable offence. This government keeps saying that those opposed to the farm bills are in cahoots with middlemen. The fact is, these legislations have been brought with the sole aim of benefiting those big businessmen on whose donations the ruling party runs its expensive election campaigns Kumar alleged. We must be wary of making all our sectors vulnerable to the onslaught of big businesses. Telecom companies have begun to run amok with the state-owned BSNL in shambles. The country's salaried middle class should also realize that the current trajectory may lead to a situation wherein buying food will burn a hole in their pockets, Kumar asserted. He also lamented the reported use of force to quell the farmers' protests at many places. Often our jawans belong to families which earn their livelihood by tilling the soil. This regime is, in effect, turning sons against their fathers. The Left leaders, who also included CPI(ML) secretary-general Dipankar Bhattacharya among others, staged a demonstration in front of the Buddha Smriti Park a stones throw from the railway station and burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kanhaiya-kumar-joins-left-parties-stir-against-farm-laws-922631.html
02-12-2020||National||Now, smart Covid-19 vaccination strategy to check spread||The Union Health Ministry has prepared a “smart vaccination strategy” under which only a select group of people may be given the Covid-19 vaccination with the aim of breaking the chain of transmission, leaving out the vast majority. The strategy, according to the experts, is distinctly different from the previous plan of protecting every individual through universal Covid-19 vaccination as highlighted even by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a review meeting in June.  Instead, the smart vaccination plan focuses on the public health goal of curbing the epidemic by breaking the chain of transmission through targeted vaccination even though experts have doubts about the merits of adopting such a strategy. Chairing a high-level meeting on June 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated that the Covid-19 vaccination must be affordable and universal and no person in the country should be left behind in the process. Smaller population But the strategy drawn by health officials a few months down the line seeks to do exactly that — leaving out the majority and targeting a smaller population. According to the smart vaccination strategy — shared recently with a panel of lawmakers — the population has been divided into three groups – core, bridge and the general population. Once the core group is vaccinated, there is less chance of spread of the disease and there would not be a requirement for vaccination of the whole population of the country. “With all preventive measures such as wearing masks, the pandemic can be contained without vaccinating the entire population,” Balram Bhargava, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research told the lawmakers.  The ICMR chief, however, did not elaborate on how the members of the core or bridge group would be identified as per the scheme devised by the national expert group of vaccination. Since July –- a month after the Prime Minister spoke about universal vaccination –- the Union government began talking about targeted vaccination by prioritising groups like doctors and healthcare workers, front line staff and those who are vulnerable. As the states were asked to draw up their own priority list, the Union Health Ministry in October said it wanted to vaccinate 250 million people from such vulnerable groups by July 2021. But the smart vaccination strategy was never discussed in the public domain. Asserting that targeted vaccination may be the way forward for a resource-poor country like India, experts questioned the basic assumption underlying the strategy. “There is no good evidence to demonstrate that such a vaccination prioritisation will substantially reduce the speed of transmission and or the occurrence of outbreaks,” senior scientist Satyajit Rath, a visiting faculty at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research told DH. “Worryingly, the government’s withdrawal from a mass vaccination scheme may introduce inequality as the vaccine available in the private market may be affordable only to the rich,” pointed out a senior researcher on medical ethics. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare in its report said, “Smart vaccination may be used as an immediate strategy but subsequently the whole population should be vaccinated.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/now-smart-covid-19-vaccination-strategy-to-check-spread-922636.html

Sources said that Singh will hold deliberations with Shah on Thursday morning in Delhi in an effort to work out an amicable solution to the deadlock. The Punjab chief minister and his Congress party have been supporting the farmers' stir and the state Assembly had also passed a set of bills aimed at negating the Centre's farm legislation. Singh had said that he and his government were willing to mediate in the talks between the Centre and the farmers in the collective interest of all. The protesting farmers, a large number of whom are from Punjab, have been holding sit-ins for seven days on the borders of the national capital. They are demanding that the government withdraw the new farm laws if it wants them to end their stir. The farmer leaders and the central government are set to hold another round of discussions on Thursday after a meeting on Tuesday was inconclusive.          Farmer unions claim the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving farmers to the mercy of corporate houses. But the government says the system will continue and the laws will give farmers more options to sell their crops.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-to-meet-amit-shah-on-december-4-amid-farmers-protests-922637.html

He also demanded that the government abolishes the three "black" farm laws which are against farmers and farm labourers and asked it not to befool them with rhetoric. No immediate response was available from the government. Gandhi's remarks come at a time when farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders of the national capital against the Centre's new agriculture reform laws. "They (government) said farmers' income will be doubled. What they did was increase the income of (their) 'friends' four times and halved that of farmers. This is a government of suit-boot, lies and loot," the Congress leader said in a tweet in Hindi. Gandhi also shared a video showing police using water cannons and firing tear gas shells during protests by farmers with a speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi playing in the background wherein he says his government is taking steps to resolve the problems faced by farmers and double their income. "Modi government, stop giving 'jumlas' (rhetoric) to farmers, stop the dishonesty and atrocities, stop giving them the falsehood of talks, (and) abolish all three black laws which are against farmers and labourers," Gandhi said in another tweet. मोदी सरकार,- किसानों को जुमले देना बंद करें- बेईमानी-अत्याचार बंद करें- बातचीत का ढकोसला बंद करें- किसान-मज़दूर विरोधी तीनों काले क़ानून ख़त्म करें। The Congress has been attacking the government over the use of force against the protesting farmers, and urged the dispensation to withdraw the new farm laws and redress the grievances of the protesters. Farmer unions say the three new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving farmers at the mercy of corporate houses. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.

He, however, did not name Thackeray. According to him, the proposed FilmCity in Noida would be a “world-class facility” catering to the emerging needs of the entertainment industry. It needs to be mentioned that Thackeray had stated that the FilmCity was born in Mumbai, has a history of over a century, and would not allow being taken away. Thackeray on Tuesday said, “We are not jealous if someone progresses, we do not have any problem with someone's progress if one competes. But if you are going to forcibly take anything away, then, of course, I won't let it happen and you will not be willing to go. ”The visit of Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand BJP leader, had rattled the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Speaking further, Yogi Adityanath said that the FilmCity will be near the proposed Jewar International Airport, which would be the biggest in Asia. Besides, a FinTech City and Electronics City will also be there in the vicinity. “We are thinking big and doing big,” he said, adding that the UP government’s plans are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of a five-trillion-dollar economy. However, he clarified that he was not here to curtail anyone’s growth.  “We are offering facilities, safety, social security, and the right environment for work,” he said. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said Mumbai’s FilmCity could not be replicated. “What is the status of Noida film city now? Can you create Mumbai’s Film City in Lucknow and Patna?” Raut asked and pointed out that Bengal and South have big film industries and their actors have worked in Mumbai too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/be-ready-for-open-competition-adityanath-tells-uddhav-922455.html

''Many film producers, directors, and actors want to leave Mumbai and shift base to UP but they are being threatened by the underworld at the behest of Shiv Sena and NCP,'' UP minister for minority welfare Mohsin Raza said here. Raza said that the Maharashtra government had been 'rattled' by the kind of warm reception for Adityanath by the film personalities in Mumbai. ''UP is home to many national cultural treasures....it is the right place for film making....we do not want to snatch anything from anyone...there is no reason for the Maharashtra government to be worried,'' the minister said. Raza's remarks came in the wake of statements by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and SS spokesman Sanjay Raut on Adityanath's visit to Mumbai to woo the Bollywood personalities to come to Noida. ''It is not easy to shift Bollywood to Noida,'' Raut had said. Uddhav too had said that Maharashtra had the ''magnetic power'' and that no industry would move out of the state. Film actor and BJP MP from Gorakhpur Ravi Kishen, however, said that the controversy was uncalled for. ''We all should work together rather than fighting each other,'' he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/up-minister-says-shiv-sena-ncp-using-underworld-to-pressurise-bollywood-922472.html

Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Dhillon and several others were taken into custody by the Chandigarh Police. The activists wanted to 'gherao' Khattar’s home to protest against the use of water cannons and teargas against Punjab farmers last week, when the Haryana Police had tried to stop them from entering the state to continue their “Delhi Chalo” march. “We came here to wake up the Khattar government,” Dhillon told reporters. “We will continue to fight till the farmers get justice,” he said, appealing to all sections of society to support the agitation. The Chandigarh Police first used water cannons against the Congress workers at barricades set up about three kilometers ahead of Khattar’s official residence. But some activists managed to reach closer to the CM's home after jumping over police barricades. Again, water cannons were used to stop them. Police took several of them in custody. Some activists claimed police used canes to disperse them. Chandigarh Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Chahal was present on the spot. The roads leading to Khattar’s home were sealed and there was heavy police deployment near it. The protesters had earlier gathered near the Chandigarh headquarter of the Punjab Congress. They raised slogans against the BJP government at the Centre and in Haryana, calling them "anti-farmer”.

02-12-2020||National Politics||Congress first political party to encourage Ayodhya movement; Indira Gandhi planned to open Babri Masjid for Hindu prayer: Book||The Congress was the first political party to “encourage” the Ayodhya movement at a Hindu Sammelan organised by the VHP in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar town in 1983, says author and political scientist Vinay Sitapati in a new book. It is no coincidence that two former Congress ministers Dau Dayal Khanna, who fashioned himself into a “twentieth century avatar of Tulsidas”, and Gulzarilal Nanda were in attendance at the meeting, Sitapati says in 'Jugalbandi: The BJP Before Modi'. While Khanna was a former Congress state minister, Nanda, a prominent Congress leader, was a minister in the cabinets of the first three prime ministers -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. He became acting prime minister twice, in 1964 after the death of Nehru and in 1966 after Shastri’s demise. "The Congress was the first political party to encourage the Ayodhya movement. Even Advani (Lal Krishna) admits to Congress's initial backing for the Ayodhya movement. In contrast, the BJP stayed away," Sitapati, who earlier authored former prime minister P V Narasimha Rao biography "Half Lion", writes. "... when the VHP organised a 'Hindu Sammelan' in Muzaffarnagar in 1983. Dau Dayal Khanna, fashioning himself into a twentieth-century avatar of Tulsidas, was the star speaker. In the presence of another Congressman, Gulzarilal Nanda, as well as the RSS, Khanna reiterated his idea, with emphasis on building a Ram temple in Ayodhya," he adds. In fact, it was Khanna who also came up with demands regarding "three north Indian mosques" that he claimed were built above the “vestiges of shattered temples”, the recently launched book states. "The temples Khanna alluded to were supposed to have been built for different deities: Mathura to mark Krishna's birth, Kashi for Shiva and Ayodhya to signify Ram's birth place. He demanded that the temples be rebuilt after demolishing  the mosques," says Sitapati, who holds a PhD from Princeton University as well as degrees from Harvard University and the National Law School (Bengaluru) and teaches at Ashoka University. Based on private papers, party documents, newspapers and over 200 interviews, the book tracks Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP's dominance in Indian politics through the 100-year story of the RSS, the Jana Sangh -- which later went on to become BJP -- and the partnership of its founding leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. The book also includes a statement by a Congressman, who declines to be named and says "he heard rumours that Indira Gandhi was planning to open the locks of the Babri Masjid for Hindu prayer as far back as 1983". The locks were eventually opened on February 1, 1986 for Hindu prayers on the decision of then prime minister and Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi. In his book, Sitapati describes Rajiv Gandhi as the "first senior politician" to support the Ayodhya movement.   The Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute took a turning point in December 1992 when the mosque was razed to the ground by supporters of the VHP, Shiv Sena and BJP, prompting nationwide communal riots that killed thousands of people. The Supreme Court, in November 2019, settled the long-pending Ayodhya land dispute by allowing Hindus to build a Ram temple on the disputed land while sanctioning Muslims five acres to build a mosque in the temple town. On August 3 this year, Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Tipped to be a grand event in normal times, the guest list was  curtailed to 175 in view of the COVID-19 crisis.

Tomar, Goyal along with Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash had represented the Union government on Tuesday during the talks with farmer leaders, who have been demanding a repeal of the newly enacted laws. During the deliberations on Wednesday, the ministers are believed to have discussed the issues raised by farmers, and how the Union government can constructively respond to dispel concerns expressed by them over the farm laws. Over 35 farmer leaders had held a three-hour meeting on Tuesday at Vigyan Bhavan with the ministerial delegation. Though their first round of talks on Tuesday did not yield a breakthrough but both sides agreed to hold the next round of talks on Thursday. In a statement, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella outfit of the farmer unions, said the talks remained inconclusive. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for seven consecutive days at the borders of the national capital against three farm laws. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that the new laws will provide farmers with better opportunities. It has also accused the opposition parties of misleading farmers||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shah-tomar-piyush-goyal-hold-deliberations-ahead-of-talks-with-protesting-farmer-leaders-922566.html
02-12-2020||National Politics||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh calls Arvind Kejriwal a 'sneaky little fellow'||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh called his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal “this sneaky little fellow” as the two traded charges over the notification of one of the three new central farm laws in the national capital. A day earlier the Punjab Chief Minister had slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader over the November 23 notification in Delhi, accusing the party of just “pretending” to support the farmers’ cause. At a press briefing in Delhi, Wednesday Kejriwal hit back, but that triggered the release of another press statement by the Congress veteran in Chandigarh. Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition in Congress-run Punjab, farmers from where are now camped outside Delhi in a huge protest against the Centre’s agri-marketing laws. Amarinder Singh trashed Kejriwal's assertion that states are “helpless” against central legislation, and said it was clear that the AAP leader did not even want to try to fight the “draconian” laws. He accused Kejriwal of “undermining” the farmers' fight by notifying one of the laws and reminded that the Punjab Assembly had passed its own Bills in an attempt to “negate” them. “Instead of meekly just notifying the central laws, Kejriwal could have tried to make some effort to counter them and protect the rights of the farmers,” the Punjab Chief Minister said. He alleged it is evident that “this sneaky little fellow, whose double standards have been exposed time and again, is now completely cornered on the issue.” In his briefing earlier, Kejriwal had accused the Punjab CM of playing "dirty politics", and suggested that he was under pressure from Central agencies. "I want to ask Captain saheb, are you under the pressure of these very same people because of which you are making these false allegations against me, abusing me. I know that the reason may be that your family is charged with cases and receiving notices from the ED," he said. The three farm laws were implemented across the country with the signature of the president and no state can stop them, he said. "If the implementation of the laws depended on the states, why would farmers from across the nation reach Delhi to talk to the Centre and put their demands forward? They would have put their demands in front of their Chief Ministers," he said. He accused the Punjab CM of not trying to stop the farm bills when he had the chance. "Captain saheb had many chances to stop the farm bills. Why did he not act against these bills being a member of the central government's committee formulating and deliberating on these bills?" Kejriwal asked. "Is this Captain saheb's friendship with the BJP or is he under pressure, because of which he is making false allegations against me?" he asked. Kejriwal also said his AAP government had angered the BJP government at the Centre by refusing to give permission for turning city stadiums into temporary jails for protesting farmers. Singh hit back, saying it was apparent that Kejriwal, whose survival depended on the central government, was more worried about angering it than about the farmers’ plight. He dubbed Kejriwal's latest comments – including an appeal to the Centre to address the farmers' concerns -- as “mere hogwash” and said the AAP leader's actions had “exposed the hollowness” of his remarks. It is evident that Kejriwal is only playing to the sentiments of the farmers now because his party has completely lost the political narrative in Punjab, he charged. The Delhi government notified the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 on November 23. Thousands of farmers, most of them from Punjab, are camping at Delhi’s border demanding a repeal of the central laws. Farmer union’s claim that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which the Centre denies. The Narendra Modi government says the laws give more options to farmers to sell their crops, fetching better prices for them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-calls-arvind-kejriwal-a-sneaky-little-fellow-922584.html

Tewari, a former union minister, has made the demand ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with floor leaders of political parties in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on Friday. “Farmers have besieged Delhi, the economy is officially in recession, Chinese continue to encroach upon over 1000 square kilometres of our land, Covid cases are at 95 lakhs with 1.38 lakhs dead in 8 months,” the Lok Sabha member from Sri Anandpur Sahib said. “Government needs to convene the Winter Session of Parliament as soon as possible without delay,” Tewari said. The government is planning to merge the Winter Session with the Budget Session of Parliament which begins on January 31 given the increase in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. The monsoon session of Parliament took place in September amid unprecedented measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, despite the precautionary measure, more than 30 members of Parliament contracted Covid-19 during the monsoon session, forcing the government to cut it short by eight days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/convene-parliament-session-without-delay-manish-tewari-922595.html

Former Karnataka Minister and Congress’ in-charge for Tamil Nadu affairs, Dinesh Gundu Rao, met Stalin at DMK headquarters and briefed him about Gandhi’s tour to Tamil Nadu, which is likely to be made public on Thursday. “The purpose of the meeting was to invite Stalin ji for the meetings to be addressed by Rahul Gandhi ji in Tamil Nadu. Stalin ji has accepted the invitation and he will be attending some of them,” Rao told reporters. He also said no discussion on seat-sharing took place during the meeting as it was 'not on the agenda'. Rao’s meeting with Stalin comes two days after Gandhi held a video-conference with leaders from Tamil Nadu Congress to discuss the 2021 assembly elections. During the meeting, several leaders asked Gandhi to campaign actively in Tamil Nadu as it would help the DMK-led alliance in a 'big way'. He said detailed discussions on Gandhi’s tour plan will take place on Thursday during a meeting with leaders of the state unit. Sources said the tour plan is likely to be discussed and announced on Thursday. The state unit of the Congress has been requesting Gandhi to address rallies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-invites-stalin-to-participate-in-rahul-gandhi-s-rallies-in-tamil-nadu-922601.html
02-12-2020||National Politics||Congress piles up pressure on Dushyant Chautala to dump BJP in Haryana||Amid protests by farmers against the farm laws, Congress on Wednesday increased the pressure on Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala to quit the coalition government with BJP and support the agitation. Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which has a largely agrarian support base in Haryana, is a crucial ally of the BJP, propping up Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s government in the state. The BJP has 40 MLAs in the 90-member Haryana assembly, while the JJP has 10 legislators. Two independent legislators supporting the Khattar-Chautala government have already quit the alliance and declared support to the protesting farmers. “In Punjab, the Akali Dal left BJP's side due to the farmers’ protests. In Rajasthan, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party is preparing to leave BJP. The question is when will Dushyant Chautala resign from the post of Deputy CM? When will JJP withdraw support from BJP in Haryana?” AICC General Secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said. The JJP is feeling the heat of the farmers' protests and almost all of its MLAs have supported the agitation. JJP chief Ajay Chautala, the father of Dushyant, has said that the problems of the farmers should be addressed through a unanimous resolution and the Centre should consider the inclusion of MSP in the Act. JJP leaders are also upset at the use of water cannons and tear gas shells against the farmers and the attempts by BJP to portray the agitation as one mostly led by farmers from Punjab. “There are statements by the Union Agriculture Minister and the Prime Minister himself that the MSP regime would continue. What is the harm in including it in the Act?” the senior Chautala asked. “Haryana's history will never forget the backstabbing of Dushyant Chautala. The farmers he wooed for votes, whose loans he promised to waive, are on the roads today facing police lathis and tear gas shells. But JJP continues to sit on the lap of the BJP just to remain in power,” Surjewala said, egging on the JJP to quit the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-piles-up-pressure-on-dushyant-chautala-to-dump-bjp-in-haryana-922616.html

While the state Congress leaders slammed Chouhan for alleged plagiarism, the ruling BJP refused to comment. In a tweet on November 22, Chouhan shared a few lines of a poem titled "Bauji" (father) on his Twitter handle, stating that it was written by his wife to express her feelings after the last rites of his father-in-law. Bhumika Birthare, who claims to be a TV anchor/reporter, took to Twitter on Monday to assert that it was her poem. "I am like your niece, what will you get by stealing my poem. This poem was written by me. Hope you will not violate my rights as `Mama' is known for protecting the rights," she said, tagging the Chief Minister. Chouhan is popularly known as `Mama-ji'. According to Birthare, she had posted the same poem on social media with a title "Daddy" on November 20. Besides Chouhan, she also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi and Kamal Nath. In a Facebook post she also claimed that she was getting calls from police who wanted to know her location, and demanded security. Congress leader Arun Yadav shared Birthare's tweets and said the BJP was expert in changing names. "Earlier they used to change the name of the schemes introduced by the Congress regime, but now the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is showing off a poem written by somebody else as that of his wife's," said Yadav, a former Union minister. K K Mishra, another Congress leader, also shared Birthare's post. State BJP spokespersons refused to comment on the issue when contacted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mp-cm-accused-of-crediting-wife-for-poem-written-by-someone-else-922315.html
02-12-2020||North and Central||Post-Covid patient undergoes lung transplant in Delhi||A 31-year-old man, who had contracted Covid-19 a few months ago, has successfully undergone a lung transplant surgery, lasting 10 hours, at a private facility after the organ was transported from the city airport in a green corridor, hospital authorities said on Tuesday. In a statement, the hospital group claimed that this was the “first” such procedure performed on a post-Covid-19 patient in north India. The recipient, a resident of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh, was suffering from advanced interstitial lung disease, it said. The donated lungs were from a 49-year-old woman from Jaipur who had suffered fatal head injuries in a road accident recently. “In these difficult times, the harvested lungs were flown down to Delhi by an Air India flight in clockwork precision. A green corridor had already been created between the private hospital and the airport at Jaipur, and then between the IGI International Airport and Max Super Speciality Hospital at Saket in Delhi. An ambulance waiting at the airport speedily transported the donor lungs through an 18.3 km stretch in a matter of just 18 minutes,” the statement said. Given the criticality of an early transplant for success, safe passage was facilitated by authorities. This ensured the retrieved lungs to be transplanted within the critical eight-hour chest to chest period, it said. The hospital claimed that it was “for the first time in north India” that doctors at the Max Super Speciality Hospital, performed a life-saving lung transplant surgery on the patient “who had developed Covid lung fibrosis (a condition that arises due to severe lung injury in Covid-19 patients causing irreversible lung dysfunction), late on November 28”. A team of 15 doctors operated through the night for 10 hours to successfully carry out the transplant, it said. The team was led by Rahul Chandola, Associate Director, Adult CTVS, Heart & Lung Transplant Specialist, at the hospital. The 31-year-old recipient had been having breathing difficulty for the last one year and was diagnosed with lung silicosis. He had contracted Covid infection in March that made the situation worse, and till transplant, he was on oxygen requirement that went from “nil to 15 litres/min following Covid-19 infection. He eventually worsened to a point where he needed BIPAP support intermittently,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/post-covid-patient-undergoes-lung-transplant-in-delhi-922316.html
02-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality inches closer to 'severe' zone||Delhi's air quality was in the upper end of the “very poor” category Wednesday morning, while pollution levels have already entered the “severe” zone in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 381 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 367 on Tuesday. It was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 430 and 410, respectively.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The maximum wind speed is expected to be 12 kmph on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 27 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The predominant wind direction remained westerly-north-westerly on most of the days. These winds blow from snowcapped western Himalayas towards the plains. Another reason for the below normal temperatures is La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the "very poor" category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it said. The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was 2,500 m2/s on Tuesday and is likely to be 6,000 m2/s on Wednesday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The contribution of stubble burning in the neighbouring states to Delhi's PM 2.5 levels was 4 per cent on Tuesday, 7 per cent on Monday and 6 per cent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-inches-closer-to-severe-zone-922380.html

While the police has kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic, the protest at Ghazipur, the city's border with Uttar Pradesh, has also intensified. The protest at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border led to the closure of a key route connecting the national capital with the state. “The Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic due to farmers' protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for going to Noida and use NH 24 and DND instead,” the traffic police tweeted. Two more border points connecting the national capital with Gurgaon and Jhajjar-Bahadurgarh were also closed as precautionary measures. The traffic police said the borders at Tikri, Jharoda and Jhatikra are closed for all kinds of “traffic movement”. The Badusarai border is open only for two wheelers. Available open borders to Haryana are Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera, it said. As traffic spilled over to alternate routes, it led to long jams there as well. The protest against the new farm laws is set to continue as talks between three Union ministers and farmer groups ended in a stalemate on Tuesday after they rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by agitating farmers. The two sides, however, decided to meet again on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-no-relief-from-traffic-chaos-in-national-capital-922390.html

Chief Minister Adityanath had launched the ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign in October focussing on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against women will be dealt with an iron hand. Attacking the BJP government, Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, “When the government's aim is hypocrisy and false propaganda, then missions are bound to fail." "Mission Shakti launched by the BJP government to cover up the rising crimes against women in UP has failed. Case is being registered against those responsible for burning a woman after one month. Crimes are rising," the Congress general secretary in-charge of UP alleged. She also tagged a media report which claimed that a 21-year-old woman in Bhadohi was burnt inside her house by bullies, but a case was registered only after a month. The Congress has been attacking the UP government over the state of law and order, alleging that criminal activities are rampant, a claim denied by the Adityanath dispensation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-govts-mission-shakti-has-failed-crimes-against-women-rising-priyanka-gandhi-922394.html

Under the NSA, a person can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that he or she is a threat to national security or law and order. Indore's Additional District Magistrate Abhay Bedekar told reporters on Tuesday that during a raid, 70 litres of acetic acid with more than 99 per cent concentration was found in two dairies located near the Pologround industrial area here in Madhya Pradesh. "These establishments were making cottage cheese and other products by processing milk with the highly concentrated acetic acid, even as the use of this chemical is prohibited in dairies," he said. Citing his discussions with experts, the ADM said the use of highly concentrated acetic acid for milk processing can have harmful effects on human health. According to Bedekar, the owners of both the dairies were allegedly using highly concentrated acetic acid to process milk in a bid to save their money and time. "Action under the NSA is being initiated against both the dairy owners so that food traders who are playing with the lives of people learn a lesson," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nsa-to-be-invoked-against-2-dairy-owners-in-madhya-pradesh-for-using-banned-chemical-922409.html

Sopore, which remained a safe bastion of militants for more than two decades after the insurgency broke out in Kashmir in 1990, has seen less violence in recent years. The area has always witness negligible polling during the Assembly and General elections held 1996 onwards. However, this Tuesday was different as the BJP openly campaigned in the area on tongas. The tonga rally was held in Mazbugh area of the apple rich town and all the tongas were decorated with BJP flags.   "This is a message of peace and in this rally dozens of Tonga wallas participated. We want to tell the people to come out and vote for the BJP candidate in the DDC polls and give a chance to serve the people of Sopore,” Abdul Majeed, a BJP sarpanch told reporters. BJP General Secretary and J&K affairs incharge, Vibodh Gupta, who was also present at the rally, said that Sopore was previously known as mini-London (as rich people live there), “but militancy and separatism blocked all means of development in this area.” “Today’s tonga rally is a direct message of people of Sopore that they are with the Prime Minister Narendera Modi. We promise them that if they choose a BJP candidate, we will set up an international (fruit) mandi in Sopore,”(sic) he said. The DDC polls mark the Centre’s first attempt at restoring democratic processes in J&K, following the revocation of its special status and bifurcation in August 2019. The polls are being held in eight phases starting from November 28 to December 19. Sopore, famous for its apples, is the hometown of hardline separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani who won several elections from the Assembly constituency prior to joining the separatists’ movement in 1989. The ailing separatist leader comes from Dooru village in Sopore, which is the sixth-largest town in the Union Territory. Sopore and its adjoining areas are a strong bastion of Jamaat-e-Islami ideologues as well. In 1993, the army took more than a month to clear the town of militants. During the process, more than 350 houses were gutted and 54 civilians were killed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ddc-polls-once-bastion-of-insurgency-bjp-holds-tonga-rally-in-jk-s-sopore-922412.html

"When the police raided the house, they found him tied to a bed. Two armed men and a woman were arrested from the spot," Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj G told reporters. The inspector, a resident of Rampur village, was on leave and had come to the city to buy medicines on Sunday. While he was waiting at a bus stop, the accused duped and kidnapped him, the SSP said. When he did not return home, his family members were alarmed and shortly after, they received a call from his mobile phone demanding a ransom of Rs 2 lakh. On Monday, an FIR of kidnapping was registered at the Gabhana police station on his son's complaint, following which the police swung into action through surveillance of his cell phone and traced his whereabouts to a house in the city on Tuesday, the SSP said.

02-12-2020||North and Central||Sushil Modi files nominations for Bihar Rajya Sabha by-poll||Veteran BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday filed his nomination papers for a by-election to a Rajya Sabha seat in Bihar which has been necessitated by the death of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Modi filed his nomination papers at the Vidhan Sabha secretariat in presence of a host of leaders of the ruling NDA, most notable being Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose deputy he had been for more than a decade, sharing an excellent rapport that has been a stuff of legend in the states political circles. "I have come here to congratulate my former colleague. He is currently an MLC and formerly been a member of the Lok Sabha and an MLA before that. With his election to the Rajya Sabha he will hold the distinction of having been a member of both houses of the Parliament and the state legislature", Kumar told reporters smilingly. Kumar, who has two BJP legislators Tar Kishor Prasad and Renu Devi as his deputies in his fourth tenure that began last month, remarked wistfully that he would have preferred Modi by his side "but it is a decision of his party (BJP)". "Our wish is known to everybody. But, now that they want to take him to the Centre, we are hopeful that in his new capacity he will continue to serve Bihar", said the JD(U) president in a cryptic remark that lends credence to speculations that Modi might be accommodated in the Union council of ministers. Sushil Modi thanked BJP's central leadership and also NDA allies for their support. Earlier, Modi whose vigorous efforts in highlighting the fodder scam had made him a household name in Bihar in the 1990s when the BJP was still trying to make a mark in the state's politics, visited the party office at the Birchand Patel Marg and received a rousing welcome. At the Vidhan Sabha secretariat, besides Kumar and senior leaders of the BJP, those present included former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and state minister Mukesh Sahni who respectively head Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), the NDAs smaller constituents. The leaders flashed a victory sign, confident of Modi sailing through with the NDA enjoying a majority in the 243-member assembly. If the opposition Grand Alliance fails to field a candidate by the last date of filing nominations on Thursday, Modi might end up getting declared elected unopposed on December 07 when the withdrawal of nominations comes to a close. Voting and counting are scheduled for December 14. The opposition coalition, in particular its largest constituent RJD, which has been at the receiving end of Modi's attacks on Lalu Prasad and his family, had reacted with predictable peeve when his candidature was announced by the BJP. The party had thrown a fit over the seat being denied to the Lok Janshakti Party, founded by the late Paswan, out of "khunnas" (spite) against his son Chirag who now heads the party and had dented the NDA in the recently held assembly elections by going solo. The RJD had also offered to support the LJP if it considered fielding Reena Paswan, the late minister's wife. However, Chirag categorically ruled his party out of the race on Tuesday when he told reporters "I appreciate the gesture made by the RJD and the consideration shown by them for us. But my mother is not interested in entering politics as of now". Paswan reiterated his contention "the seat originally belonged to the BJP. Following my father's death, it is the party's prerogative to take a decision". Notably, Paswan had got elected to the Upper House last year from the seat that fell vacant upon the election of his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat. When asked whether the LJP, which has one member in the assembly, would support Modi in the by-poll, the 37-year-old replied "why not". The young LJP chief, who has been relentless in his attacks on the JD(U) boss but professed loyalty towards BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is reportedly eyeing a berth in the Union council of ministers in which his party is left with no representation. The party, which has six MPs in the Lok Sabha, is hopeful that it would be accommodated by the BJP-led government since no ally, with the exception of Ramdas Athawale of Maharashtra-based RPI, is now left in the Union council of ministers. The BJP enjoys a brute majority in the Lok Sabha but is said to be worried over recent exits, from the NDA, by powerful regional allies like Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, and Telugu Desam Party sending out wrong signals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sushil-modi-files-nominations-for-bihar-rajya-sabha-by-poll-922445.html

Health department officials are also present in the village and efforts are underway to bring the child out, Kumar said, adding that arrangements have been made to supply oxygen in the borewell. At the time of the incident, his parents were irrigating their field, the police said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/4-year-old-boy-falls-into-borewell-in-uttar-pradesh-922542.html

The decision, which the government said is aimed at inculcating the habit of practising yoga among students, was taken at a meeting of the Haryana Yog Parishad chaired by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The government also decided to set up 1,000 more 'yogshalas' in the state, according to an official statement. "Yoga will be included in the school curriculum as a separate subject in all government schools across the state from the next academic session commencing April 1, 2021," the statement said. During the meeting, officials informed that apart from moral education, yoga is already being taught to students since academic session 2016-17, it said. "But, taking a step ahead now, it has been decided that yoga will be a compulsory or optional subject in the school curriculum and the Department of School Education has constituted a committee for this purpose," it said. According to the statement, the subject curriculum would be designed in such a way that it would have both theoretical and practical content on the pattern of physical education so that besides education students could get training in yoga. With this, Haryana will perhaps become the first state in the country to include yoga as a subject in schools, the statement said. Speaking at the meeting, Khattar said the aim of the state government is to take yoga to the grassroots level and encourage people to make it a part of their lifestyle, it said. "For this, yoga, 'vyayamshalas' and other adequate infrastructure are being made available at the village level," he said. The meeting was also attended by Health and Home Minister Anil Vij and yoga guru Ramdev, who is also the state brand ambassador for the promotion of yoga and ayurveda. Khattar also directed the Development and Panchayats Department to submit a proposal within a week for setting up 1,000 more 'yogshalas' in the state. Speaking at the meeting, Vij said more and more 'vyayamshalas' should be set up in the state so that the maximum number of people can practice yoga at these centres and stay healthy. It was also decided in the meeting that to further encourage people to make yoga an integral part of their life, 'Yog Prashikshan Diwas' would be organised on the first Sunday of every month under the aegis of Haryana Yog Parishad. Under this initiative, programmes would be organised at district, block and tehsil levels wherein trained instructors would impart yoga training to people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-to-include-yoga-as-separate-subject-in-all-government-schools-from-next-session-922561.html
02-12-2020||North and Central||China planned Galwan Valley incident, says US report||A congressional commission of the United States Government noted in its latest report that China had planned in advance for the violent clash between its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and the Indian Army along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley on June 15. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a.k.a US-China Commission, (USCC) in its report to the American Congress gave a detailed account of the escalation of tension between New Delhi and Beijing over the Chinese PLA’s aggressive moves to change the status quo along the disputed boundary with India in eastern Ladakh. The report noted that 2020 was 'the worst year' for Sino-Indian relations 'in decades. The report referred to the June 15 physical brawl between the soldiers of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA close to the LAC – the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector – in Galwan Valley. “Some evidence suggested the Chinese Government had planned the incident, potentially including the possibility for fatalities,” noted the USCC, which was set up in October 2000 to monitor security and trade issues between the US and China. The Indian Army lost 20 of its soldiers in the clash with the Chinese PLA in Galwan Valley. The PLA too suffered casualties, but never made public the number of its soldiers, who were injured or killed in the overnight violent face-off. When External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called his counterpart in the Chinese Government, Wang Yi, just two days after the incident, he accused the Chinese PLA of launching a 'premeditated' attack on the Indian Army personnel and warned that it would have a 'serious impact' on the relations between the two nations. The US panel now noted that Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe had made a statement several weeks prior to the clash in Galwan Valley 'encouraging President Xi Jinping’s regime in Beijing to 'use fighting to promote stability'. “Just over two weeks before the incident, in another potential indication of Chinese leaders signalling their intent to escalate tensions, an editorial in China’s state-owned tabloid Global Times warned that India would suffer a ‘devastating blow’ to its trade and economic ties with China if it got 'involved in the US-China rivalry'.  Besides, the report also referred to the satellite images that 'depicted a large Chinese PLA build-up in the Galwan Valley, including potentially 1,000 soldiers, the week before the deadly skirmish'. The seven-month-long military stand-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh, particularly the clash in Galwan Valley, brought the relations between the two nations to a new low.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/china-planned-galwan-valley-incident-says-us-report-922567.html

However, some NGOs claimed that as many as 254 survivors of the Bhopal disaster have succumbed to the infection till now. The different death figures were revealed on the eve of the 36th anniversary of the Bhopal gas tragedy. In what is termed as the world's worst industrial disaster, over 15,000 people were killed after methyl isocyanate leaked on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984 from the pesticide plant of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) in the city. More than five lakh people were affected due to the toxic leak. "Till December 2, Covid-19 has claimed 518 lives in Bhopal district. Of them, 102 are Bhopal gas tragedy survivors. Out of these 102 people, 69 were above 50 years of age, while the remaining 33 were aged below 50," Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Director Basant Kurre said. However, Rachna Dhingra of NGO Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA) claimed, "As per the state's health bulletin, 518 people have died due to Covid-19 in Bhopal district so far. We visited the houses of 450 of these deceased to find out whether they were gas victims or not. Out of these 450 people, 254 were found to be the Bhopal gas tragedy survivors." "These 254 victims possessed smart cards that were issued by the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC), a dedicated facility for the treatment of gas victims. They also had the photocopy of the Bhopal gas tragedy compensation order with them," she said. "We have collected the copies of the smart cards and the compensation order by personally visiting the houses of these victims. We have even submitted these documents to the chief medical officer of gas relief, Ravi Varma," Dhingra added. She alleged that the government does not have a full record of those Bhopal gas tragedy survivors, who died of Covid-19 infection. On the basis of the documents it was established that the death rate of gas victims due to coronavirus was 6.5 per cent, which is more than the other infected persons, she said. Dhingra claimed that the 1984 gas leak incident has claimed the lives of 20,000 people so far and leftover 5.68 lakh people affected. Four organisations working for the gas victims -- Bhopal Group for Information and Action, Bhopal Gas Peedit Stationery Karmachari Sangh, Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangarsh Morcha and Children against Dow Chemicals -- demanded from the multi-national company additional compensation for the families of gas tragedy survivors who died of the pandemic, saying that the gas leak had long-lasting effects on them. "The mortality rate among the Covid-19 infected gas victims is 6.5 per cent, more than the normal ones as they are more vulnerable because of the ill-effects of the poisonous gas that leaked from the Union Carbide plant on the intervening nights of December 2-3, 1984. Therefore Dow Chemicals (current owner) should give them additional compensation," the NGOs demanded in a statement. The NGOs took out a torch rally in the city on Wednesday to highlight the plight of the gas tragedy survivors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/102-survivors-of-bhopal-gas-tragedy-died-of-covid-19-madhya-pradesh-govt-922573.html

He went on to advise the chief minister “to leave aside the business of acting and take care of the state". Chief Minister Adityanath, who reached Mumbai on Tuesday night, interacted with Bollywood stars, directors and producers and invited suggestion for the upcoming film city which he said would be built as per their requirements. According to a press release here, the chief minister sought to make it clear that his ideas behind the whole thought-process are to give the country another state-of-the-art film city equipped with all technical and modern logistics. Adityanath had unveiled an ambitious plan to set up a film city in Noida and rolled out an open offer to the film fraternity to come to the state for filmmaking. The plan had come amid actor Sushant Singh’s death controversy and actor Kangana Ranaut’s fight with the Uddhav Thackeray government in Maharashtra. Several film personalities including Kangana had welcomed the move. Yogi had also held a meeting with the filmmakers in Lucknow which was attended in person and virtually by many. Uttar Pradesh has earmarked 1,000 acres of land on Yamuna Expressway near Noida to develop the film city. Yogi has announced that Noida film city would be the biggest in India, far bigger than Bollywood.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/akhilesh-yadav-mocks-at-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-for-pursuing-film-city-dream-922587.html

A student of Class 8 from suburban Bengaluru, the teenager boarded the Karnataka Express Special train from Bengaluru city on Monday with a confirmed ticket for New Delhi. Ajay Buwa, a journalist working in Delhi for Sakal, a Marathi newspaper, who boarded the same train at Manmad on Tuesday evening and his co-passenger Bablu Singh, noticed the girl travelling alone in their compartment. On inquiry, the girl, who spoke Kannada and broken English, said that she was staying in Delhi with her grandmother and studying in a local school. She also said she had gone to her hometown and got stuck due to lockdown. “I became suspicious about the girl and immediately alerted TTE (Travelling Ticket Examiner). When TTE came, he found that she had a confirmed ticket till New Delhi and said her uncle will come to the railway station and receive her,” Buwa told Deccan Herald. He also gave her a jacket and a bedsheet to protect herself from the cold weather conditions. As the train approached Delhi, Buwa also alerted the Railway Protection Force (RPF) about a girl travelling alone in a train. As the train reached New Delhi Railway Station, the RPF personnel escorted the girl and waited for her uncle to come and receive her. As no one turned up to receive the teenager, the RPF reached out to the Delhi Kannada Sangh Secretary C M Nagraj, who rushed office staff Devaiah to the railway station to assist the girl. The girl was not carrying any mobile phone, but the RPF found a phone number in a book she was carrying and reached out to her parents. After speaking to the parents, the RPF learnt that the girl had left the home following a tiff over excessive use of a smartphone given to her to attend online classes. The parents had filed a missing person report with the Bengaluru Rural District Police. The girl claimed that she was influenced by Radha-Krishna serial on a Kannada television channel and had set out in search of Krishna, her favourite god and even planned to visit Mathura. According to the RPF, the girl’s parents were reaching Delhi to take her back home.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/runaway-bengaluru-girl-rescued-from-delhi-railway-station-922619.html
02-12-2020||Oasis||Bringing out the new you this new year||The majority of people across the globe celebrate the annual change of year with much fanfare, as if everything in the world is going to change for the better from the next day. Most people spend a lot of money on new year parties and often end up drunk and sick on the very first day of new year. Many miss their work on the first day of the year because of the late night parties they attend. The news channels churn out yearly reviews and the fortune-tellers have a good time doling out predictions for the anticipatory minds that put a lot of stake in their stars. All in all, new year means a lot of memories, dreams and business for different people in the world. Now! If we think about it deeply, does the New Year bring any newness in our lives? We all are very much aware that the world we live in has become old, dilapidated and vicious where we have so many big and small problems that seem to have no lasting solution despite all efforts by humans to create better comforts and means to improve their lives. Practically speaking, only when we give up our old habits, attitudes and behaviour and wear a new attitude of compassion, co-operation, harmony and respect, can we expect a new era to begin. Before that really happens, how can anything be celebrated as new in this old world? Nothing in this old world can be truly new as all human souls and elements of nature have become very old, impure, weak and destructive. On the contrary, everything in the forthcoming new world will be brand new, wherein not only the traits of human souls will be renewed but also the entire nature and its elements will be rejuvenated to its original pristine quality. Remember! The world becomes new only when human souls become completely pure in the present by eliminating the vices and sin within themselves. So, in the coming new year, let us all take a determined step forward to change our negative attitudes and share only positive energy of peace, joy and love. Let each one of us make a promise to reflect our best in thoughts, words and actions because when we change the world will change.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/bringing-out-the-new-you-this-new-year-922286.html
02-12-2020||Opinion||Disability: A tale of two societies||The tagline “Disability is only a state of mind” of a recent article, which featured an inspiring story of an Indian who had achieved success in spite of his physical disability, evoked a visceral reaction in me. With World Disability Day arriving on December 3, and because we all are looking for a diversion from our daily routine during Covid social distancing, I decided to sort out my feelings in writing. The thinking behind the tagline presumably goes as follows: All of us have tasks, be they mental or physical, that we are insufficiently capable of performing. An expert pianist could be terrible at mathematics, and a computer scientist might not be an inspirational orator. We learn to live with our shortcomings but build our lives around our strengths. How is that any different for those with disabilities? Could they also not let their disability dominate them, and channel their strengths to perform wonders? The view is well-meaning, intended to inspire persons with disabilities (PWDs) to strive for their best. However, the onus is not entirely on them. We must not forget the profound role that the society plays in shaping their state of mind and providing them with the right tools, environment and opportunities to flourish. I am not a social scientist; my remarks below are based on my real life experiences from living with a disability in two countries, India and the United States. I joined the community of disabled as a 12- year-old child when, during a summer break with my mother’s family in Kolkata, an automobile accident left me with head injury, broken bones and ruptured arteries. The doctors managed to save me but my left foot had to be amputated. Back home in my rural village Sambhar in Rajasthan, I began the process of coming to terms with my new life as an amputee on crutches. Physical challenges, often exacerbated by lack of proper medical resources, are only one factor adding to the daily struggles of PWDs. Social attitudes are another. Society can be unsympathetic, and even antagonistic, to the disabled, considering them objects of scorn and ridicule. The social stigma of disability often brings a deep sense of shame and guilt that robs the disabled of any feeling of self-worth and self-esteem. A combination of physical limitations and social exclusion condemns most PWDs in India to lives in the cruel, forgotten margins of the society. I was one of the incredibly lucky ones. Unlike in the Western world, amputees in India did not have access to prosthetic limbs in those days. However, just about at that time, a craftsman named Ram Chandra Sharma and an orthopedic surgeon Dr. P K Sethi invented, in the nearby city of Jaipur, a new technology for manufacturing a basic prosthesis locally. This altered the course of my life by empowering me to continue my education and step out into the real world. (It turns out that I was among the first recipients of what would later become famous as The Jaipur Foot and rehabilitate several hundred thousand amputees in India and other third world countries around the world.) Fast forwarding nine years, I found myself in the United States. While it was my passion for physics that brought me here, I soon realised that I had arrived in a land that can only be described as a heaven on earth for the disabled. What can be An indelible memory from my initial days in the US is that of a shock when I saw a student amputee in shorts, with her below-knee prosthesis in full display. Making no attempt to hide her disability, she appeared full of confidence, no more self-conscious than someone wearing glasses, and no one seemed to think any less of her for her disability. With time, the shock factor of such sights subsided. Seeing people with disabilities leading ordinary lives and employed in various mainstream professions is all too commonplace in the US and some other Western countries. Coming from India, it was hard to believe that there exist societies where there is no shame in having a physical disability, and where a disabled person can lead a life of dignity and honor, be a purposeful citizen of the society, and rise to the highest levels in all walks of life, including politics (US President F D Roosevelt) and science (Stephen Hawking). The disabled are not shut out of the proverbial American Dream. What makes the magic happen? The answer is simple: The disabled are seen and heard, not excluded, and all aspects of the society are structured keeping their functioning in mind. There is no shortcut, however. It takes strong laws, resources and a long-term commitment. Most important is education. My wife, who teaches in the local elementary school, can go on and on about the level of support, in terms of human and financial resources, set aside to help keep disabled children in the education stream. Teachers are required by law to prepare a detailed educational plan for each disabled child, with parental input. Disabled children are intermixed with regular classes to the extent allowed by their disability, but also receive specialised education where needed. A full time nurse and a paraprofessional accompany a child with extreme disability. Professional therapists and counselors deal with various issues and strive to ensure that the disabled children achieve their full potential. (Even the thought of psychological counseling for trauma survivors had never occurred to me until a friend in Europe asked me if I had received psychotherapy after my accident.) Accommodations are made in lectures and examinations for students with various kinds of physical and learning disabilities. This continues through college, which often has a Student Disability Resource Office to address disability related issues. I typically have a couple of PWDs in my undergraduate class of roughly forty students, who will all go on to have regular lives. Others are also taught, from a very early age, to treat the disabled with the respect owed to any fellow human being. A typical American would never even think of mocking or looking down on a PWD because of his or her disability. All of this is for naught unless the society makes it possible for the disabled to lead an independent life of dignity that comes with gainful employment. Law not only prohibits discrimination against qualified PWDs in granting employment but also requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for them. All bus and train routes, every workplace, all elevators, and all public facilities must have wheelchair accessibility by law. Footpaths, stairs, sidewalks, and railway station platforms feature tactile paving with markings and indicators for the visually impaired. Elevators have signs in Braille. Old buildings and structures have been reconfigured to the extent possible, and all new construction must conform to strict codes to accommodate the disabled. Additionally, the government provides tax incentives to private sector companies for hiring PWDs. In many cases, for example, for someone with autism, the state pays for a job coach to accompany and train the person every day until he or she masters the required skills. A long way to go During my frequent visits to India over the years, I have seen signs of progress over time. I notice disabled friendly buildings, with wheelchair ramps in many offices and malls (although no tactile paving for the blind). An increasing number of movies and TV shows have sought to educate the general public about the lives of persons with physical and mental disabilities, thereby raising awareness of the issues affecting the PWDs. Indian PWDs have also featured prominently in Paralympics and Special Olympics, which have attracted a large media following. There appears to be greater acceptance and understanding of the disabled. However, the goal of a meaningful integration of the disabled into the society remains a distant dream. From my various visits to India, I do not recall coming across any regular employee with a visible disability, a telltale sign of strong inherent biases against the disabled in the job market. (An exception is the Jaipur Foot facility, which preferentially employs wearers of the Jaipur Foot.) A friend of mine in India could think of only one PWD in regular employment, who, ironically, had gotten the job only by carefully concealing his disability.  How the disabled are treated and assimilated offers a true glimpse into the innermost soul of a society. Social transformation will take time, but we all can try to do something about it. Next time when you come across a disabled person, please look past the disability at the person, who has dreams and hopes just like the rest. A word of acknowledgment and empathy can go far. If you are a parent, teach your children that there is nothing sinister or evil about someone with a disability, which can befall any of us, and to treat the disabled as they would anyone else. If you are an employer, recruit PWDs for jobs that they are able to perform. The disabled are not looking for charity, pity or sympathy, but only wish to become useful members of the society and contribute in whatever way they can. If you accept them and give them a chance, they will not disappoint you. (The author is Evan Pugh University Professor & Erwin W.

02-12-2020||Panorama||Neglect of Armed Forces is not good for the nation||India suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese in the 1962 war, when we lost over 3,000 soldiers and a chunk of our territory to them. This was the result of political miscalculations and pushing an ill-equipped Army into the war. We learnt lessons after paying the heavy price, equipped the military and did well in the 1965 war, forcing Pakistan to take recourse to negotiations. Further consolidation and preparations brought about the spectacular victory in the 1971 war when East Pakistan was liberated to form Bangladesh, with 93,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendering, the second biggest surrender in military history. After 1971, India has not fought a full-scale war. Kargil was a limited conflict in 1999. Over the years, the Army has been fully engaged in internal security, fighting insurgents, fighting calamities like flood, earthquakes, maintenance of law and order during civil unrest, rescue of children from borewells, etc. In all such operations, the Army has performed exceedingly well, winning the hearts of the countrymen. But, sadly, only damage has been inflicted on the Armed Forces by all governments since 1971, affecting their morale and dignity.       At the time of Partition, the Commander-in-Chief was No. 2 in the order of precedence, next only to the Viceroy. The demotion started soon after Independence and, today, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) stands at No. 12. Field Marshal Maneckshaw lived for 35 years after he was promoted to the rank, but there is no mention of Field Marshal in the order of precedence. A Bharat Ratna awardee is placed at No. 7, but there is no place for a Param Vir Chakra awardee. In Britain, everyone, including cabinet ministers, stand by for a Victoria Cross-winner to pass by; in India, a Param Vir Chakra-winner is like anyone else on the road. Prior to the Third Pay Commission, Defence personnel were receiving pensions at 70% of their last-drawn salary in view of their early retirement. The Third Pay Commission brought down their pensions to 50% -- at par with civilians who retire at 60. The reservation of jobs for ex-servicemen is a mere 3% when around 50,000 servicemen retire every year. The One Rank One Pension (OROP) recommended by the Koshyari Committee, set up by the UPA government, was endorsed by Parliament but the government dilly-dallied on its implementation. OROP was a promise by Prime Minister Modi during the election campaign in 2014, but implementation has only been partial. To add insult to injury, no revision took place in 2019 as was promised. The veterans community had demanded a revision every two years, which the govt rejected. Lakhs of crores of rupees have been spent by the government to wriggle out of the bad debts of banks, but for implementing OROP, they don’t have the money! In Defence Headquarters, a Colonel or equivalent was designated as ‘Director’ till 2017. In 2017, the Ministry of Defence downgraded Colonels to ‘Joint Director’. There was a hue and cry all around after this degradation. Finally, the government promised that parity as before would be reinstated, but on the ground the demotion remains. The Sixth Pay Commission granted Non-Functional Upgradation for all central services and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF). However, the same has been denied to the Armed Forces.    The recent proposal to cut the pension by 25-50% for premature retirees is destructive. As per the pension regulations, a premature retiree can leave with full pensionary benefits of his length of service after 20 years. The present proposal makes 35 years’ service mandatory for full pension benefits. With this proposal, anyone leaving between 20-35 years of service would get pension at only 50% level. The proposal is double damage as it will cost the government, too -- the units and formations will have too many superseded officers, that too in the higher age groups, with medical liabilities.    There are very many issues on which the government has inflicted deep wounds on servicemen. The service ration, which was introduced in 1982, was suddenly withdrawn in 2018. It was restored after the government came under all-round criticism. The facility of hotel stay for officers on temporary duty remains withdrawn. All Defence officers on temporary duty have to stay in Defence facilities whereas their civilian counterparts in Defence are entitled to the best hotel accommodation. What’s more, the government is fighting numerous cases in the Supreme Court, spending crores of rupees, to deny disability and other benefits to the next of kin/widows of deceased soldiers. The money spent in fighting court cases is sufficient to mitigate their grievances, but the government has chosen to deny them. For the speedy disposal of grievances, the government set up the Armed Forces Tribunals, but the award of the tribunals are challenged by the government in court, defeating the very purpose of setting them up. Today, many of the tribunals are defunct as no judges/members have been appointed. The list of woes is endless. Why is this injustice meted out to Defence forces every time? They are prohibited by law from forming a union and demanding their dues. But they have been pushed to an extent that dissatisfaction and dissent has started to crop up. The recent incidents of mutiny by jawans against officers and as many as 700 servicemen approaching the Supreme Court on various issues are all the results of this neglect. The man behind the weapon is more critical than the weapon. It will be a sad day for the country when a soldier has to demand his dues. It is high time that the government stops the neglect of the Armed Forces and restores their dignity, status and perks, lest at some stage it may cost the nation heavily.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/neglect-of-armed-forces-is-not-good-for-the-nation-922283.html
02-12-2020||Panorama||Regulating violence online||Kerala just promulgated and withdrew an ordinance to grant the state far-reaching powers to regulate intimidation, bullying, insulting and defamatory content. This is a shift from traditional approaches which required the affected individual to approach the police. While social media is not specified, it appears that it is motivated by the rise of problematic content of various hues on several internet platforms. Critics have brought up the question of curbs on freedom of speech. Importantly, this law may be politicized and may arm the state with the power to suppress opponents and political dissidents.  In the face of criticism, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan has had to issue statements that press freedom will be protected. However, this is unlikely to be the last attempt in Kerala or anywhere else to regulate content and information.  Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump withdrew Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that granted an exemption to platforms from liability for content posted on them by third parties. While this is not directly analogous to the move in Kerala, efforts to use legislative and regulatory approaches to moderate speech are unlikely to stop.  While these efforts may be motivated by genuine concerns around hate speech, disinformation and violence, or the urge to regulate platforms whose algorithms editorialise content, they risk empowering partisan interests to crush opponents.  But, while regulatory approaches are critical in thinking about dealing with offensive speech and disinformation, as well as platform regulation, it will take democracies worldwide a while to find the right balance.  A growing body of research is showing the importance of intermediaries in managing a whole range of questions with respect to technology in society. An intermediary is a broad term that refers to community-level actors such as local leaders, civil society organisations, and informal associations.  Intermediaries can embed the right values around tech, as well as support marginalized communities in making claims of the state through tech. Imagine a local leader helping someone file a claim through an online portal. Offline (and online) intermediaries (called stewards in some instances) can also play a role in mediating better and more empowering ways to share data.  Intermediaries have trust of the community. In addition to being bridges between citizens and the local state, they also perform many roles of community leadership such as dispute resolution.  How to do this? This is built on two pillars – first, working with civil society organisations who are at the grassroots, playing critical roles in enabling access for citizens.  Working with civil society to embed digital literacy and act as ‘sense-checkers’ can stem some challenges. It requires building up the capacity of smaller organisations to perform this role. Second, we need to work with existing community intermediaries at both informal and formal institutions. They have the trust and goodwill of the people. These could be political intermediaries as well.  It is important to see this from the lenses of democratic values and citizenship, and inclusive governance. As Lakshmee Sharma and Kanimozhi Udhayakumar have argued, it is important to instil democratic and constitutional values in intermediaries not just the ad hoc capacity to respond to short-term problems.  Both civil society more broadly understood (philanthropies, larger NGOs) and publicly-minded corporations can play a role in working with intermediaries and building up capacities system-wide. State support through institutional linkages (for dispelling health misinformation, for example) may additionally be helpful.  Of course, this is not without challenges – offline intermediaries may have differentiated impact depending on the type of problem in question. They may be better able to stem some times of misinformation, quell rumours and prevent conflagrations; they may be less able to address the psychological harms from some types of content. Their political inclinations may lead to rent-seeking.  However, as trusted and valued systems on the ground, they can play a big role in buttressing regulatory efforts.  (The writer is Founder of Aapti Institute)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/regulating-violence-online-922284.html
02-12-2020||Right in the Middle||A sparrow soliloquy||Having lived in a concrete land ever since I have moved to Bengaluru, deep down in my heart I longed to live in a pleasant environment, close to nature with greenery, cool breeze and the chirping of birds. Luckily, I happened to move to a locality close to my imagination recently, with a lot of open space. The best part of my new abode is the of my neighbour’s garden from my kitchen window. I religiously spend the mornings sipping a mug of coffee and observing colourful flowers, butterflies, listening to the chirping of birds that visit the garden. It is a great way to begin my day as it fills my heart with inexplicable bliss. Yesterday I happened to spot a sparrow, which has lately become a rare sight--a simple and small bird but I could draw an instant connection and started thinking about this agile bird. We may not find the bird after some years. The bird may look vulnerable, ordinary and simple but it has the determination to not to stay in an environment that’s unsuitable for you. Once you realise the place is not for it, with no good bye, the sparrow vanishes. Its absence in our surroundings is a clear indication of a poisonous atmosphere. Have we ever realised this or taken it seriously? Until something visibly life-threatening happens, neither do we realise nor care. We have not only failed to accommodate the bird but have also completely forgotten the importance of coexistence. The repercussion of this ignorance is visible. Much like the bird, I may look passive but have a rebellious quality. I do not want to stay in a place where I am not appreciated. Even I wish to fly away from the environment that suffocates me. The bird has wings to fly in pursuit of happiness. Wish! I had wings to fly away to a place where I can find solace. Alas! That’s not possible for I am bound by responsibilities. I have a wonderful solution to this--it is not possible for me to relocate, so I have created a beautiful virtual world with fairies, a fresh stream, fragrant flowers, lovely lotuses and swans in clear ponds. As the sparrow is in search of an unpolluted habitat, I have found solace in my virtual uncontaminated territory. People might call us escapists. Who cares? As long as we are happy in our respective worlds.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-sparrow-soliloquy-922281.html
02-12-2020||Second Edit||Demand-side measures needed now||The provisional estimate of GDP for the second quarter of the fiscal has confirmed that the economy is in recession for the first time since Independence. The economy shrank by 7.5%, following a 23.9% contraction in the first quarter. The contraction was forecast to be about 8%, but the head of the Niti Aayog found a “pleasant surprise” that it has done better by 0.5%. At Rs 33,14,167 crore, the economic output is the lowest in the last three years. It is not yet certain that the smaller-than-expected decline is the sign of a better-than-expected recovery in the coming months. There are predictions that the current quarter and the next quarter would keep up the momentum, but it is not yet time to entertain any firm hopes in that respect.  There are some factors that call for caution in the assessment of the second quarter figures. A 0.6% growth in the manufacturing sector was the most positive of all the pointers. But this was expansion from a very low base, as in the preceding quarter there was a collapse of about 39%. Growth in the corresponding period of the last fiscal was also low. While the manufacturing data showed an improvement, the IIP data actually showed a decline. It is possible that a good part of the momentum was accounted for by pent-up and festive demand, but it is unlikely that it will be sustained. There are already signs of that. There is also a possibility that the figures released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) are not final. If they are revised, the figures could only be lower, especially because they haven’t yet taken into consideration the state of the unorganised sector, which has a crucial role in the economy.  Private consumption expenditure, which is the largest component of GDP, has continued to fall during the quarter, and that is not a sign of revival. Consumers are not spending money on goods and services for various reasons. The pandemic has reduced spending options, and incomes have fallen for many people. Government consumption has declined sharply, as much as by 22%. There are uncertainties about how the pandemic will pan out. Though the situation is said to be easing in the country now, a resurgence of the virus, as it has happened in other countries, cannot be ruled out. One important message from the figures is that there is a need for a major fiscal stimulus as the earlier packages have been inadequate and perhaps misdirected. The government should find ways to spend itself as well as to create demand in the economy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/demand-side-measures-needed-now-922273.html
02-12-2020||South||Reports of joining BJP "rumours": Ex-DMK leader Alagiri||Expelled DMK leader MK Alagiri on Tuesday hinted that reports of his joining the BJP were "rumours" and said he would consult his supporters on floating his own political party ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly election in 2021. Asked about floating his own political party, Alagiri said it would be known in the coming days. "I will consult with my supporters and take a decision. In this election (2021) my contribution will be there," the DMK's former Madurai strongman told reporters here. Alagiri was expelled from the DMK in 2014 for alleged anti-party activities in the wake of differences with his brother and now party chief MK Stalin. On Tuesday, answering reporters' queries whether his son Durai Dayanidhi has been offered "post" in the DMK, the former Union minister said it was "speculation" and a possible rumour. "Even I was said to be meeting (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah. Did I meet? You are asking only (about) rumours," Alagiri said in an apparent reference to reports about his possible meeting with the BJP veteran during his visit here on November 21. Shah was in the city then to participate in a Tamil Nadu government event, besides meeting state party leaders ahead of the 2021 elections. AIADMK, which struck an electoral pact with the saffron party for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, has announced the alliance would continue for 2021 as well. Alagiri's supporter, former DMK MP KP Ramalingam had joined the BJP on November 21 in the presence of its national general secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge CT Ravi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/reports-of-joining-bjp-rumours-ex-dmk-leader-alagiri-922254.html

The chief minister appealed to people, particularly those in the southern districts, not to step out unnecessarily between December 1 and 4. According to the India Meteorological Department, a cyclone is very likely to hit Tamil Nadu on December 4. The deep depression in the Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify further into a cyclonic storm by late Tuesday night, the IMD said. It is very likely to cross the Sri Lanka coast close to Trincomalee during the evening or night of December 2 as a cyclonic storm. It is very likely to move nearly westwards thereafter, emerge into the Gulf of Mannar and adjoining Comorin area on December 3 morning. It would then move nearly west-southwestwards and cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Kanyakumari and Pamban around early morning of Friday, the IMD said. People in the districts where alerts have been issued warning of heavy rain or storm should not venture out unnecessarily and the fishermen who have set out for fishing should return to safety, he said. The chief minister directed the monitoring officials of districts including Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin to oversee the precautionary measures there. Palaniswami, who chaired a high-level meeting to assess the cyclone's impending impact, called upon the public not to panic over the new cyclonic storm as all precautionary measures have been taken on war-footing. "I request you to follow the instructions of the government and extend your full cooperation," Palaniswami said in a statement. National disaster response teams have been stationed in Madurai, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin, he added. The meet was attended among others by deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, ministers and senior officials. Meanwhile, Revenue and Disaster Management minister R B Udayakumar said the impact of the new cyclone could be felt till Madurai. Deep sea fishermen from the coastal Kanyakumari district who have ventured into the sea have been warned to return to the shore. Permission has been sought from appropriate authorities to facilitate a safe landing for the Tamil Nadu fishermen in Karnataka, Kerala, Goa and Lakshadweep, he said. The Central team deputed to assess the damage caused to Tamil Nadu due to Nivar last week, is expected to arrive on December 5. The team would hold consultation with the chief minister after visiting the affected areas, Udayakumar said. Earlier, cyclone Nivar had crossed the coast between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on November 26.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/all-precautionary-measures-in-place-says-cm-as-tn-braces-for-second-cyclone-922334.html

The Cyclone Warning Division of the India Meteorological Department has warned that the deep depression in Bay of Bengal turned into a cyclonic storm and centred around 400 kilometres from east-southeast Trincomalee, in Sri Lanka.  "It will cross the Sri Lanka coast close to Trincomalee on December 2 during evening/night and cross south Tamil Nadu between Kanniyakumari and Pamban on the early morning of December 4, India Meteorological Department (IMD)," tweeted. Here are key things to know: Cyclone Burevi is likely to first hit Sri Lanka today, on December 2, and then cross the Lankan coast near Trincomalee in the evening or night as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 75-85 kilometres per hour going up to 95 kmph, IMD said.  Later, it is likely to move westwards into the Gulf of Mannar and Comorin area on December 3 morning. Then it may move south and cross the southern coast of Tamil Nadu passing through Kanyakumari and Pamban around early morning of Friday.  The forecast also warns of isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall likely over south Tamil Nadu on December 2 and 4 and south Kerala on 3rd & 4th December. Total suspension of fishing operation during December 2 and 5 over the area. The IMD has declared red alert in southern Kerala, Tamil Nadu on December 3. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Palaniswami has said that the state has taken all the precautionary measures to minimise the damage if any. He also urged people to stay indoors.  NDRF has been deployed in Madurai, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin. In Kerala, strong winds and heavy to very heavy rainfall is forecasted. The India Meteorological Department issued red alert in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanmathitta and Alappuzha district for December 3 and orange alert in Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki.  Kerala Chief Minister has said all government agencies are prepared for any consequences of the cyclone. Kerala government has ordered all fishing activities to cease from Monday night. The state's disaster management authority has evacuated all the low-lying areas in the state in case of heavy floods. Relief camps have also been set up. Department of Hydrology has been directed to monitor water levels in rivers if heavy rains result in floods. Water levels in rivers are checked thrice a day and in Neyyar, Killiyar and Karamanayar rivers it will be checked at 4 pm and 8 pm for the next three days. However, Burevi is unlikely to be as intense as Nivar, IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.

The cyclonic storm lies 110 km east-north-east of Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka and 520 km east-north-east of Kanyakumari and will cross the Sri Lankan coast to the north of Trincomalee on Wednesday night. It is very likely to move nearly west-northwestwards thereafter, emerge into Gulf of Mannar and adjoining Comorin area Thursday morning. “It would then move nearly west-south-westwards across Pamban area by afternoon and cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban and Kanyakumari between Thursday night and early Friday morning,” the IMD said. The cyclone’s impact on south Tamil Nadu coastal districts is very likely to commence from Thursday forenoon, initially over Ramanathapuram district and gradually towards Kanyakumari district. Under the influence of the cyclonic storm, southern districts and parts of northern Tamil Nadu are likely to be pounded by heavy rains till Friday. The state government asked administrations of nine districts – Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Sivaganga, Theni, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, and Virudhunagar – to remain on high alert and move people living in low-lying areas to safety. IMD said Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari, Tenkasi and Sivaganga districts will receive heavy rains on Thursday, while Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha in Kerala will also experience rains. The state braces for a second cyclone in just about a week – Cyclone Nivar which made landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the wee hours of November 26 claimed four lives and uprooted over 1,000 trees. As part of the efforts to move people living in low-lying areas to safety, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescued 360 persons from Palam near Dhanushkodi and shifted them to Narayanpur shelter in Thangachimadam. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and assured all assistance.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-burevi-to-cross-tamil-nadu-coast-between-december-3-and-4-922403.html
02-12-2020||South||Sasikala seeks remission, early release from prison||Late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's close aide V K Sasikala, serving a four-year jail term on graft charges, has sought remission and early release from prison, official sources said on Wednesday. Sasikala, lodged at the Parappana Agrahara prison here, is expected to come out on January 27, 2021 after she deposited Rs 10 crore fine at a special court. However, she has applied for remission of her jail term to come out early, sources close to the leader told PTI. The prison authorities have forwarded her application to higher officials. "She has applied for remission of her jail term and it has been forwarded to the head of the department for their consideration," a source said. Authorities are yet to take a call on it. After the Supreme Court restored the trial court judgment in toto against Sasikala and two of her close relatives in the disproportionate assets case, she surrendered before the court in Karnataka on February 15, 2017 and has been lodged in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail since then. Her two relatives are also undergoing four years simple imprisonment and all three of them were slapped with a fine of Rs 10 crore each. With the death of Jayalalithaa in 2016, who was the first accused in the case, the appeal by Karnataka against her stood abated. As per norms, three days of remission for good conduct is available for every month in jail and so far, she has completed 43 months, making her eligible for a reduction of 135 days in prison. "As per the Karnataka Prison Manual, I strongly believe that she will be released by the month end," her advocate N Raja Senthoor Pandian had earlier said. When the remission of 129 days is applied, the release will be during the month end and not the previously expected date of January 2021, he had said. Sasikala has already spent a total of 35 days in jail in 1997 and 2014 and availed a 17 day parole in 2017, which is deducted from the period she already served, he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sasikala-seeks-remission-early-release-from-prison-922410.html

As per the new decision, a maximum of 2000 devotees would be allowed to have darshan at the hill temple on weekdays and 3000 on Saturdays and Sundays, which was 1,000 and 2,000 earlier respectively, state Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said. "It has been decided to allow more pilgrims at the Sabarimala temple. The entire booking will be done via online," he said in a statement. Pilgrims can book darshan through the virtual queue system in the concerned website from today, the minister added. Noting that the entire pilgrimage would be in compliancewith the Covid-19 guidelines, he said all devotees were required to produce a coronavirus test negative certificate issued within 24 hours before reaching Nilakkal, the base camp. Arrangements have been made at Nilakkal for devotees to undergo the test. Pilgrims can also check in any authorised Covid-19 kiosks run by the government or private agencies anywhere en route to Sabarimala, the minister added. Meanwhile, the state Health department has intensified the antigen testing in Sabarimala and its base camps to check the possible spread of the viral infection in view of the increase in the number of permitted pilgrims at the hill shrine. The department, on Monday, began the testing at Sannidhanam (temple complex) and Pamba, the base camp, for all categories of employees and volunteers serving at the shrine and its premises for more than 14 days, official sources said. A total of 200 people are examined daily at the health centre in Pamba. Of the 200 cleaning workers, who underwent testing on Monday, four were tested positive for the virus and they were shifted to the Covid first line treatment centre at Erumeli. The antigen testing would begin at 3.00 pm at the health centre in Pamba, they added. Till November 27, a total of 39 people including pilgrims, police personnel and temple employees, had been tested positive for coronavirus in Sabarimala since the temple here was opened for the annual pilgrimage season on November 16. The auspicious Mandala pooja would be held on December 26. After the Makaravilakku ritual on January 14, the temple would be closed on January 20, marking the end of the season. It is the first annual pilgrimageseason at the hill temple after the Coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-to-receive-more-devotees-now-2000-pilgrims-on-weekdays-922426.html
02-12-2020||South||NRI voting to have a considerable impact in Kerala||The move to introduce Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System for NRIs will have a considerable impact in the electoral scenario of Kerala not just due to the high number of NRIs from the state, but also due to the overwhelming response of Malayali NRIs towards the voting options given to overseas voters in the previous elections. Political observer J Prabhash told DH that the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League would be the major beneficiaries if NRIs are allowed to vote. A major chunk of NRIs from Kerala are from the Muslim community from North Kerala. Congress and IUML are already having good connect with the NRI community. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, out of the 99,807 overseas voters who registered for the voting facility in the country, 87,651 were from Kerala. Of the 25,606 overseas voters who exercised their franchise in the country, 25,534 were in Kerala. As per the existing norms, overseas voters would have to be physically present for casting vote. Practical difficulties and expenses incurred in travelling to India was the reason why a major chunk of the 30 lakh odd NRIs from Kerala have kept off from voting. Hence the e-postal ballot facility would be well received by the overseas voters from the state. As per the data available from Election Commission, out of the 87,651 Malayali overseas voters registered in 2019, the highest numbers are at North Kerala districts Kozhikode (32,944) and Malappuram (17,143) Prabhash, who is a former pro-vice-chancellor of Kerala University, also said that a major chunk of NRIs from the Hindu community are found to be showing leniency towards BJP. This could be due to factors like the pro-development image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as the discrimination being faced by them in foreign countries. Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre, an official organisation of IUML, and the Indian Overseas Congress are already quite active among the NRIs in Gulf countries. Many outfits associated with IUML and Congress have even used charter flights and came to Kerala for polling. In order to build a connection with the NRI community, the ruling Left-Front government in Kerala has also initiated various measures like forming 'Loka Kerala Sabha', a forum of representatives of NRIs for assisting the government in policy-making for the state's development as well as NRIs' welfare.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/nri-voting-to-have-a-considerable-impact-in-kerala-922491.html

Activists scoff at proposal||Pallikaranai marsh in this metropolis is a treasure trove for biodiversity as it is home to nearly 700 species of various floral and faunal groups, including birds, plants, reptiles, and fish. Much of this marshland has already been encroached by the state and central governments for housing institutes – its area has shrunk from 7,000 hectares to just around 700 hectares now –- throwing caution to the wind with regard to the ecological concerns. But a new proposal by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) to dredge the marshland as part of its efforts to mitigate flooding in the city has forced activists to red-flag the project. The activists say dredging would not just pose a threat to the biodiversity of the marshland, which is the only urban wetland here, but also to the city’s landscape. The marsh, which is the last remaining natural habitat in Chennai, houses 167 species of plants, birds (178), mammals (10), reptiles (15), amphibians (11), fishes (50), butterflies (34), phytoplanktons (73), and dragonflies (20), among others.  A  natural habitat for endangered reptiles like the Russell's Viper and birds like Glossy Ibis, the Pallikaranai marsh has been a birdwatcher’s paradise for long, activists say. Not just government buildings and a dump yard, numerous apartment complexes have also come up in Pallikaranai in the past few decades, they say and warn that any move to dredge the remaining marshland will only increase flooding in the city and not decrease it by any stretch of the imagination. “If the project of dredging the marshland sees the light of day, it will make the city more vulnerable to floods than it is today. The project will also dry out the landscape, making the region completely dry. Contrary to what the proponents of the project say, dredging will make the city struggle for groundwater,” Dr Jayshree Vencatesan of the Care Earth Trust told DH. The project will increase the city's vulnerability to floods, and the government should stop giving “knee-jerk” reactions and focus on finding sustainable solutions to prevent flooding, Dr Vencatesan, who has been voicing support for saving the marshland, added. When contacted, J Meghanath Reddy, Deputy Commissioner, GCC, told DH that the proposal was not to dredge the marshland but only to reduce the quantity of water reaching the ecologically sensitive area from other parts of the metropolis. The activists want the government to protect the Pallikaranai marsh as India is a party to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands signed in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. The government’s move to dredge the marsh comes despite it being a protected area since 2005 – activists say an announcement in this regard by then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa had saved the land from being further encroached. G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal, an NGO fighting for the protection of the environment, said the civic body’s plan to treat the marshland like a water tank can lead to “great biodiversity loss". “It is a stupid decision to dredge a marshland which is home to several rare species. Instead of dredging lakes like Chembarambakkam which supplies water to the city, the civic body wants to dredge a marshland. They should go all out to protect such marshlands and not destroy them. These are ecologically sensitive areas that are important for a city like Chennai,” Sundarrajan told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/chennais-pallikaranai-marshland-to-be-dredged-activists-scoff-at-proposal-922537.html
02-12-2020||South||Andhra Pradesh Assembly passes 10 Bills||The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Wednesday passed 10 Bills, including one for the constitution of the AP State Agriculture Council for regulating agricultural and horticultural practice in the state. The Assembly passed the AP State Development Corporation Bill, 2020, giving statutory status to the AP State Development Corporation established as a public limited company in August this year to raise loans from different sources. Finance and Legislative Affairs Minister Buggana Rajendranath moved the two finance Bills. Agriculture Minister K Kanna Babu, who moved the State Agriculture Council Bill, said there was no law at present to regulate agricultural and horticultural practice in the state. The Council would help in improving and regulating the quality of inputs like seed, fertilisers, pesticides and services like irrigational technology, post-harvest marketing and export promotion. "The measures will help in disseminating better and quality technical farm advisories to farmers by qualified graduates. The Council will also accord permission to new agricultural and horticultural institutions and also issue recognition to institutions that have necessary infrastructure," the minister said. The AP Agricultural Land (Conversion for non-agricultural purposes) (Amendment) Bill was also passed by the Assembly to replace an Ordinance issued in August. Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) Dharmana Krishna Das said the government has agreed to the proposal that the lands put into use for establishment of solar power plants by different government entities be reconverted into agricultural lands after closure of the projects. A reconversion fee of one per cent would be collected on the basic value on such lands, he said. The House also cleared the AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition and Transfer) (Amendment) Bill that will facilitate the AP Green Energy Corporation Limited to take on lease lands originally assigned to various beneficiaries. APGECL is the executing agency for the proposed 10,000 MW solar power projects and the existing law has been coming in the way for leasing of assigned land. "To facilitate the leasing of land by APGECL from the assignees, the law is being suitably amended," the Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) said. Home Minister M Sucharita also introduced the AP Disha Bill-AP Special Courts for Specified Offences against Women and Children Bill, 2019. The Bill was previously passed by the Legislature in another name in December last year but the Centre recommended certain changes in the nomenclature and returned it to the state. Accordingly, the state government brought in the new Bill. It is expected to be taken up for discussion on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-assembly-passes-10-bills-922570.html
02-12-2020||South||GHMC poll turnout slightly better than 2016, with one ward polling remaining||The voting percentage in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections was marked at 46.5 per cent on Tuesday. The turnout was around 1 per cent higher than the votes polled in 2016, though the largely empty queue lines and the polling trends till 4 pm suggested the participation would be less than before. Polling picked up towards the closing hours, though at the end, Hyderabad voters displayed their indifference once again by keeping the overall polled votes at below fifty per cent. However, the Tuesday turnout has set a record of being the highest in the election history of the GHMC, created in 2007. 42.9 was the voting percentage in 2009 and which improved to 45.2 per cent in the 2016 civic body polls. The 2020 percentage is expected to go a notch higher as elections in Old Malakpet would take place on Thursday. Polls of this one ward were canceled midway on Tuesday as it was found that CPI(M)'s Hammer, Sickle, Star symbol was printed on the ballot papers instead of CPI's Sickle, Corn-Eears. There are a total of 150 wards in the GHMC, with jurisdiction over an expanse of 625 square KMs and around 1 crore population. Covid-19 fears and the election following a three-day holiday prompting several Hyderabadis to go on tours are among the reasons said to have disallowed a still higher polling figure. The BJP which expected a larger turnout after its aggressive campaign involving several national leaders has alleged a conspiracy by the K Chandrasekhar Rao government with the support of the Telangana State Election Commission, to limit voting. BJP alleges rigging by AIMIM On Wednesday, BJP's legislative council leader Ramchander Rao complained of large scale rigging of votes in several polling stations under the Ghansibazar and Puranapul wards in the old city.

While the convicts are eligible for three days of remission per month of good behaviour, a technical glitch in Sasikala’s case may scuttle the remission prospects according to officials, the source said. The source said more than 120 days of remission period, which Sasikala had earned, has been forfeited by earlier officials over allegations of special perks and being irregular to the assigned work at the prison.  Sources in the home department refused to comment anything on the issue while stating that ‘rules, procedures and law will take its own course.’ Knowing that her acquired remission period has been forfeited by the prison authorities, Sasikala has reportedly sought, in her petition, review of the previous decision on forfeiting her remission period.  Senior counsel C V Nagesh commented that remission is allowed in all the cases regardless of the charges on which the person is convicted. However, it is decided by the prison officials who watch the convicts on a daily basis. Hence, it is not the right of the prisoner but a discretion of the prison officials. “If the convict has obtained parole during the sentence, then such convicts may not be eligible for remission,” he remarked.  Interestingly, the Sasikala’s remission file will pass through D Roopa, IGP, currently serving as secretary of the home department who had previously exposed the alleged special privileges enjoyed by Sasikala.  The officials said if Sasikala does not get remission, she would complete her sentence on January 27, 2021 as she has paid a fine of Rs 10 crore before the court recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sasikala-files-application-for-early-release-from-jail-922599.html

The toilets are old and the restoration work needs to be taken up urgently. Though the school has been writing to the authorities concerned, no measures have been taken up so far. The toilets cannot be used. The Mudungarukatte School is 126 years old with 154 children pursuing their studies between classes 1 to 8. In addition, 35 children are pursuing their studies in LKG. Under the Madari Grama Abhiyana, initiated by the Jana Shikshana Trust, an NGO, the SDMC, with the help of donors, have installed Selco Smart Class System at an estimated cost of Rs 1.5 lakh. Even the roof of the school building is leaking. The School authorities had written to the Bantwal Taluk Panchayat president in January 2019, to take measures to repair the roof of the school building and toilets during its 125th year celebrations. There is a need to repair the roof, repair toilets and the soak pit, and the place of washing hands by children. It is estimated that Rs 20 lakh for school roof repair, Rs 4 lakh for the toilet repair and Rs 1 lakh for the repair the place for the washing hands, is required. In 2020-21, under the MGNREGS, BEO office, Bantwal, too had prepared an action plan for the construction of toilets at a cost of Rs 3 lakh, and installation of rainwater harvesting system at a cost of Rs 1.40 lakh under the MGNREGS. In fact, the School authorities, in May 2020, had submitted an appeal to the BEO office following a circular by the commissioner of Department of Public Instruction, on basic facilities for government schools. The School headmistress had sought the repair of roof building (Rs 20 lakh), repair of toilets (Rs 5 lakh) and furniture for schoolchildren (Rs 3 lakh). On noticing the poor condition of toilets, Jana Shikshana Trust director and MGNREGS former Ombudsman Sheena Shetty has also written to Balepuni GP PDO, the Taluk Panchayat and the Zilla Panchayat, on the measures to be taken in the School. There is a need to repair the roof of the school building by installing rooftop sheets. The old toilets need to be demolished and new ones should be constructed, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/126-year-old-school-in-bantwal-mangaluru-awaits-repair-of-toilets-roof-922258.html

Addressing the press meet, he said that the BJP-led state government has scrapped the Christian Development Corporation. In fact, the then CM H D Kumaraswamy in 2019-20, had announced the setting up of the Corporation in his budget and had earmarked Rs 200 crore for the purpose. Out of Rs 200 crore, a sum of Rs 75 crore was earmarked for the setting up of the Corporation. After getting administrative approval, the proposal was approved by the Finance department and the chief secretary as well. However, the chief minister on June 16, 2020, had decided not to pursue formation of the Corporation, he alleged. Stating that there is 30 lakh population of Christian community in 27 districts of the state. The poor labourers in Bidar, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Yadgiri and Ballari hail from Christian community. The scrapping of the setting of the Corporation is condemnable and an injustice has been meted out on the community. The decision to scrap the formation of the Corporation has hurt the sentiments of the people of the community, said former MLC. He demanded the government to initiate measures for the formation of the Corporation and release Rs 200 crore immediately. All the educational schemes that were suspended in 2019-20-21 should be reintroduced. Rs 20 lakh loan given for higher education in foreign countries for the beneficiary students have been scrapped. The scheme should be reintroduced. About 60% of the funds under Shramashakthi and self-employment schemes have been cut by the government. The scholarship amount under Arivu scheme for medical, engineering and other professional courses have been deducted, which is condemnable, added Ivan D’Souza. He said the government has failed to release funds for the repair of churches and community halls. As a result, the works have remained suspended. The funds should be released immediately. The government should release at least Rs 500 crore the welfare of the Christian community which constitute 4% of the total population in the state. Demanding the formation of the Corporation, a protest will be staged in front of the Gandhi Statue in Vidhana Soudha on December 7.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hunger-strike-to-be-held-demanding-setting-up-of-christian-development-corporation-922265.html

The court further said the “liberty relating to the personal relationships of two individuals cannot be encroached by anybody irrespective of caste or religion”. A division bench comprising Justice S Sujatha and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum made this observation while disposing of the habeas corpus petition filed by Wajeed Khan H B. The petition was filed seeking direction to produce his partner Ramya G before the court and set her at liberty. The jurisdictional police had produced Ramya along with her parents before the court. Ramya told the court that she had been staying at Dakshatha Samithi in Vidyaranyapura from November 07, 2020, after she filed a complaint alleging that her freedom was being infringed upon by her parents. The problem started when Ramya and Wajeed, colleagues at a software company, decided to marry. While Wajeed’s mother Sreelakshmi had no objections to the marriage, Ramya’s parents were not willing to give consent.   The family counsellor at the Mahila Dakshatha Samithi told the court that the parents of both Wajeed and Ramya were counselled. Ramya's parents have objections and they have sought one year's time to give their consent. The court also held that being an educated person Ramya was capable of taking decisions regarding her life. “The scope of habeas corpus being limited to produce the person of Kum. Ramya G and she being produced before the court, recording her submission as aforesaid, we dispose of the writ petition setting her at liberty,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/person-has-right-to-choose-ones-life-partner-karnataka-high-court-922276.html

In its seven-page report submitted to the government on Monday, the Karnataka Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) recommended several measures, including restarting Covid Care Centres under public-private partnership model, to deal with the possible surge in cases. Dr C N Manjunath, state nodal officer for Covid-19 testing and TAC member, told DH, “In USA, Europe and Australia or even in Delhi, the second wave typically happened 40-60 days after the first decline. Going by the natural trend, we predict Karnataka’s second wave in January or February.” The report said the second wave can be spotted early by closely monitoring the seven-day average growth rate and reproduction number (R0) at the district and state levels. R0 is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case. An epidemic intelligence team shall support the state war room for early recognition of the second wave and alert the officials, it said. Another TAC member and epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu told DH the intelligence team is yet to be formed. A minimum of 1.25 lakh tests per day should continue till the end of February 2021, of which one lakh shall be RT-PCR by pooling five samples. Fortnightly testing of all teachers, pupils, and staff in educational institutions, anganwadi staff, and others by RT-PCR has also been suggested. The report said facilities should be ready by the first week of January, “at an October 2020 level” in terms of beds, ICUs, ventilators, and ambulances both in government and private hospitals. The report also said that graded reopening of schools for Class 12 and 10 in January can be considered after assessing the cases at the end of December. It said restrictions on mass gatherings should continue. Health and Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar said the government was ready for the challenge. “We have seen that in August-September, when the surge started, it was steady and slow. We have to resume all medical services to take care of all patients and at the same time should be in a position to switch over to Covid treatment depending on the requirements.” Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health, said the experience of last few months will also help. “Previously, we did not know how to turn a clinical facility into a Covid facility but now we know. We can switch from Covid to non-Covid, and vice versa at short notice. Plus, we will have time to prepare,” he added. The state government, one week ago, removed the mandatory requirement for private hospitals to reserve 50% of their beds in general wards and high dependency units for government-referred Covid-19 patients. The decision was prompted by the drop in the number of infections in recent weeks. “We have already told private hospitals in a circular a week ago that a five-day advance notice would be given if the Covid-19 situation worsens and if the government requires more beds,” added Akhtar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-readying-facilities-for-likely-covid-19-second-wave-922279.html

The Home Minister added that such cooperation between the states was on since the last 8-10 months and he wanted to firm it up further.  Bommai pointed out that over 20 people from Karnataka had been arrested for “anti-national” activities. “They are currently in Tihar Jail.” The minister, however, admitted that sedition cases need to be watertight during court trials. “Sedition cases will stand in court only if we manage to collect evidence,” he said.  In the past one year, the state reported nine incidents of communal strife leading to 11 cases in which more than 140 people have been named as accused.  Bommai said the police are taking up “peace meetings” every month, especially during festivals and religious fairs. He added that preventive measures are invoked under CrPC sections 107-110 to maintain law and order. Since 2015, crimes other than sedition considered to be against public tranquillity have come down, according to data. For instance, Karnataka saw zero unlawful assembly cases in 2019 from 112 five years ago. The numbers have similarly dropped for communal/religious riots, political rioting, agrarian rioting and caste conflicts. “This doesn’t necessarily mean better policing,” retired DG&IGP S T Ramesh told DH. “If preventable crime such as property offences show a decline, then it would indicate better policing. It’s easier not to bring cases of unlawful assembly on record. Police can effect compromise or dilute them by showing less than five people since rioting happens only if there are five or more people. Or, police just register less number of cases by clubbing incidents together,” he explained. He also pointed out that southern states have always worked together on professional lines. “The term ‘anti-national’ is very generic and doesn’t have a legal definition. In any case, I think sedition law is colonial, an anachronism in this day and age,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-bats-for-south-coalition-against-anti-national-forces-922282.html

It was decided to use Kannada, Sanskrit and Tulu script in the name board. Owing to Lakshadeepotsava, there was delay in readying the Kannada name board. Presently, Sanskrit and Tulu name boards were installed. The Kannada name board will be installed shortly.

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa addressed Consular Generals of various countries on Wednesday and discussed the opportunities to attract trade and investments to the state. The meeting touched upon numerous business opportunities and investments that are available for foreign investors in Karnataka, and the Chief Minister held talks with Consular Generals and detailed on the immense opportunities IT, ITES services, machine tooling, manufacturing, aerospace, biotechnology, defence, energy and engineering design among others, an official release said. "The state has secured the highest FDI among all Indian states in the April-June 2020 quarter, with FDI of over Rs 10,000 crore. Moreover, Karnataka has attracted 50 per cent of the investment proposals in India, amounting to Rs 1.1 lakh crores between January to May this year, Yediyurappa was quoted as saying in an official release. The state has also taken a slew of policy reforms in the last six months to attract investments and develop tier-II cities such as Mysuru, Mangaluru, Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, he said, the critical policy reforms are procurement of land, labour and amendment of Karnataka Industrial (Facilitation) Act, that allows any approved project to start without any downstream approvals. "We are actively working on Industrial Corridors. Tumakuru, which is just 70 km away from Bengaluru, is going to be one of the largest Industrial Townships in the entire country with 10,000 acres of the planned area. We will be pleased to provide infrastructure for your companies as well, to make it easy for them to invest in Karnataka," he added. Consul-generals of Spain, Poland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Rwanda, and others were present at the meeting that was also attended by top state government officials. Saying that the state is taking cautious steps to reboot the economy and support economic activities in the state and the recent 2019 NITI Aayog 2019 Innovation Index has Karnataka at the top, Yediyurappa said, this has been possible due to the availability of quality human resources, reputed higher educational institutions, and a significant thrust on research and development aided by a proactive administration and conducive investment climate. Keeping the investor-centric approach, our government has launched the New Industrial Policy 2020-2025, to build a prosperous Karnataka and create large-scale employment opportunities.

The court made this observation while dismissing the petition challenging the transfer of chief engineer as director of KPTCL within two years of posting. The petition was filed by one Siddaraju, who was appointed as director of KPTCL in December 2019. He challenged the posting of one B K Uday Kumar as the director in October 2020. Interestingly, Uday Kumar is due to retire in January 2021, while the petitioner would attain the age of superannuation in April 2021. Moreover, in subsequent development, the petitioner was transferred and posted as Managing Director of Mysore Electrical Industries Ltd (MEI). Justice R Devdas said that in the interest of the KPTCL, the state and its citizens, it would not be proper in directing the state government to reconsider the appointment of Uday Kumar. Before disposing of the petition, the court observed that appointments and transfers are required to be made in the interest of the public. “Public interest means the interest of the state and the citizens. If the same is followed in letter and spirit, the powers that be would not have to face inconvenient questions and such actions would considerably reduce unwanted litigations,” the court said. The court further observed that it was sad that in spite of orders of the high court and the apex court, orders of appointment and transfers are made with utter disregard to the reminders and have become ‘a source of genuinely avoidable litigations'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-hc-reminds-govt-on-public-interest-in-appointments-transfers-922591.html

This is among the 15 colonial legislations the state government has decided to repeal through the Karnataka Repealing of Certain Enactments and Regional Laws Act, 2020, which has been notified.  In all, the government has abrogated 174 redundant laws. Other colonial legislations binned, include The Rent Recovery Act, 1853, The Sarais (Shelter) Act, 1867, and the Vaccination Act, 1877, of the erstwhile Bombay state (presidency). While six of them were applicable across the state, nine pertained to territories in Karnataka which were earlier parts of Bombay, Hyderabad, Mysore, Madras, Kerala and Coorg states/presidencies. The 2020 Act also annulled 96 enactments - four partially - passed since 2016. According to sources in the Law and Parliamentary Affairs Department, repealing obsolete laws was a routine process and was last taken up five years ago. “Finance Bills for the particular year such as Appropriation Acts, Motor Vehicle Tax Acts, Karnataka Stamp Act from 2016 to 2019 are repealed. Such Acts have no relevance in successive years and are applicable only to a fiscal year,” a source said. While enactments are repealed as a routine exercise by the state, some laws such as the 1845 one are being repealed based on recommendations made by the Law Commission to the Centre in 2014. The laws repealed will not affect any other enactment or regional laws in which the repealed enactment or regional laws have been “applied, incorporated or referred to,” the 2020 Act states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/15-colonial-laws-among-174-redundant-acts-binned-922592.html

02-12-2020||State||Infosys Prize recognises 6 for contributions to science||The 12th edition of the Infosys Prize ceremony, which was held on Wednesday, celebrated six scientists and researchers in India and the United States who had made invaluable contributions in their fields.  In his address, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy said India must leverage education to help the country solve problems of water and air pollution, malnutrition and the matter of human ethicality. "We dream of an India where the poorest children can have reasonable access to nutrition, education, healthcare and shelter, and have confidence in a better future. For that, we need well thought out and impactful ideas that are speedily executed without corruption. Every country that has succeeded in becoming or desiring to become a developed country has to work to improve its higher education and research system,” Murthy said, adding that he believes the new National Education Policy (NEP) would trigger the necessary change. "One of the objectives of the new national education policy is to orient our students to ethical thinking and towards proactive problem-solving. But it will not happen overnight,” he added. Four of the six winners of the 2020 Infosys Prize are scientists working in the fundamental or applied sciences, including probability and statistical physics plus key scientific breakthroughs which could alter the world of tomorrow through technology.  Among them was Professor Arindam Ghosh of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), whose work developing atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors to build a new generation of functional electronic, thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices could help revolutionise imaging technologies, such as cameras and deepen advances into quantum technologies. Another winner is Professor Hari Balakrishnan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a computer engineer, working to prevent road accidents. Dr Balakrishnan has suggested using the very object of motorist distraction, the smart phone, to improve road safety. “We can use algorithms to understand from the sensors on the mobile devices how people are driving, and then combine that with behavioural science to provide incentives to make people better drivers,” he told DH. The technology’s applicability in India is undergoing trials. Dr Rajan Sankaranarayanan of CCMB, Hyderabad, was recognised for deciphering basic mechanisms in biology, which has potential applications in antibiotic and immunosuppressant design. When asked whether Infosys had considered scientists directly involved in work to solve the Covid-19 pandemic, Murthy clarified “no specific discussion” had been held with the jury about the pandemic and its influence on choosing winners. However, the fifth winner: Dr Raj Chetty, Professor of Economics at Harvard, is noted for identifying barriers to economic opportunity - which is applicable to the Covid-19 outbreak. "His work examines how Coronavirus is affecting economies each day in each neighbourhood and state,” said Bhavna Mehra, General Manager, Infosys Science Foundation. The final winner was historian Dr Prachi Deshpande of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences (CSSS), who noted that “how we live in the 21st century will be understood by how people react to not just microbes but also lockdowns,” and that communication to all researchers is key.

The woman was undergoing treatment at Mahaveera Hospital and was shifted to a hospital in Whitefield, where she will undergo a lung transplant. The ambulance left Puttur at around 11 am and reached Mudigere handpost at 12.35 pm. Thanks to Whatsapp messages sent to youth in Banakal, Kottigere, through WhatsApp groups, volunteers lined up and cleared the vehicles on road to facilitate hassle-free movement. In fact, many people were seen standing beside the road to catch a glimpse of the ambulance going at a breakneck speed. Haneef said saving a life is humanity. “With the help of public and friends, I could reach the hospital on time and ensure the treatment of patient.” This is Haneef’s fourth such mission where he shifted the patient in zero traffic. “Recently, I had shifted a patient from Mangaluru to Bengaluru in 4.20 hours,” he recollected. The ambulance passed through Uppinangady-Belthangady-Charmadi-Mudigere Handpost-Hassan- Hebbala- Ramamurthinagara-Mahadevapura and reached Vaidehi Hospital. As patient's family is poor, Karunya Nidhi Karnataka Charitable Trust had sought help for the family in social media. “The appeal had received good response from public,” sources added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/puttur-patient-shifted-to-bengaluru-in-record-time-922628.html
02-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||1.5K acres of reserve forest turned into agricultural field in Karnataka but Forest Department remains mum||Over 1,500 acres of reserve forest land in the backwaters of Tattihalla Dam in Bhagawati Range of Haliyal division (Uttara Kannada district) has been allegedly encroached by farmers and individuals over the last three to four years. And the Forest Department is yet to take up any ‘formal investigation’ or action against the perpetrators. Environment and RTI activist Manjunath Y Baddi said it has been almost a month since a formal complaint regarding this was filed with Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Vigilance) Seema Garag and Principal Chief Conservator of Forest Sanjay Mohan regarding deforestation in reserve forest area in Tattihalla, Machapura and Bogura villages. “I have provided them satellite images, photographs and video records of forest land being encroached. However, so far, no action has been initiated by the forest department. On the contrary, officials posted in Haliyal division are now hushing up the matter by digging trenches and pits to plant saplings, using four to five earth-mowing machines day and night,” Baddi alleged.   He also claimed that thousands of trees, including medicinal, endemic and those over hundred years old, have been axed to make way for the farmers to cultivate paddy, sugarcane, maize, jowar, cotton and other crops in what was once an elephant and tiger corridor. The said forest land was leased out to the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) for the construction of Tattihalla Dam across a tributary of the Kali river in 1979. As a requirement, the forest department also provided land keeping maximum water level of the dam backwaters in mind in these three villages. However, over the years, farmers and individuals have encroached the land and started cultivating them, much against the rules.   Two senior Forest Department officials, who did not wish to be named, confirmed to DH that the encroachment of the reserve forest land took place over the last three-four years and a few of the officers posted in the division colluded with the encroachers. Sirsi Forest Vigilance Squad in-charge S P Hedge said: “We received a complaint from Manjunath recently. Based on the complaint, we had asked Yellapur ACF and two range officers to visit the area. According to the officials, large-scale encroachment (at least 700-800 acres of reserve forest land) has taken place in the backwaters of Tattihalla Dam and it needs an investigation.” The oral report of those officials says that the encroachments had taken place at least three to four years ago and not recently as the farmers had completely uprooted the trees or burnt them to root, Hegde said and added that his powers were limited to only checking if there was forest on those lands and whther ab FIR was filed against the encroachers.    However Haliyal Deputy Conservator of Forests Ajjaiah G R told DH the encroachments might have taken place over last two-three decades and an FIR has been registered against them. “There are also a few applications filled by farmers under the Forest Rights Act of 2005, claiming that the said land belongs to them and they have to be rehabilitated. A few of the farmers say that their property submerged in the backwaters and they have been cultivating in that land now,” he said. He added that the problem might have aroused as there was no formal boundary fixed between KPCL and the Department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/15k-acres-of-reserve-forest-turned-into-agricultural-field-in-karnataka-but-forest-department-remains-mum-922432.html
02-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19: Covaxin Phase-3 trial begins in Karnataka||Karnataka is fully prepared for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine, Health and Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar said on Wednesday, as a phase-III clinical trial of "Covaxin" being developed by Bharat Biotech began in the state. The minister said it was a matter of pride for the state with clinical trials taking place at 25 centres of 12 states across the country. He said 26,000 people were being administered the vaccine with 1,600-1,800 people being vaccinated on a trial basis in Karnataka. People should be wary of rumours and misinformation during this trial period, he was quoted as saying by his office at the launch of the 3rd phase clinical trials of Covaxin at Vydehi Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa participated in the event. Clintrac International Pvt Ltd and Vydehi Hospital have partnered to initiate the third phase of the trial, and the vaccine will be given to the volunteers in two doses, the first on Wednesday. The second dose will be administered on December 30, officials said. Sudhakar said that there may be side effects of vaccination and experts will be observing it carefully and there was no need for panic at this stage. Pointing out that the Narendra Modi government at the centre has reserved Rs 900 crore for vaccine research, he said the Yediyurappa government in Karnataka has released Rs 300 crore for providing Covid treatment free of cost. The minister said that 1.25 lakh tests are conducted per day in the state and 1.2 crore free Covid tests have been conducted so far. Karnataka was fully prepared for vaccine distribution and 29,451 vaccine distribution centres have been identified with 10,008 trained staff ready for the task on hand, he noted. He also pointed out that 2,855 cold storage centres were available for the storage of vaccines. Regional centres are being set up in Bengaluru, Shivamogga and Ballari, he said, adding that Healthcare workers will be given the vaccination in the first phase followed by frontline warriors, people aged above 50 and those with comorbidities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-covaxin-phase-3-trial-begins-in-karnataka-922490.html
02-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Six scientists and researchers receive Infosys Prize 2020||Six eminent scientists, including those from MIT, Harvard and Stanford universities, were awarded the Infosys Prize 2020 on Wednesday for their outstanding contributions to research and innovation. The annual award includes a pure gold medal, a citation and a prize purse worth USD 100,000 or it's equivalent in the Indian rupees, the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF) said. The winners were awarded during a virtual ceremony in six categories -- Engineering and Computer Sciences, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. A panel of accomplished jurors comprising renowned scholars and professors shortlisted this year's winners from among 257 nominations. "Developed countries have succeeded mainly by improving their higher education and research systems," said Narayana Murthy, Founder - Infosys, and President ISF. "The Infosys Prize contributes to this mission in India by honouring the best scientists and researchers, whose work has the potential to improve our world," Murthy said. The Infosys Prize 2020 for Life Sciences was awarded to Rajan Sankaranarayanan from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad for fundamental contributions towards understanding one of the most basic mechanisms in biology, the error-free translation of the genetic code to make protein molecules. Sankaranarayanan's work has potential applications in the design of drugs such as antibiotics and immunosuppressants. "Most of the biological processes occurring in a living cell, from the simplest of bacteria all the way to humans, are carried out by proteins. These are long polymers made out of very basic building blocks known as amino acids linked together like a chain of beads, as dictated by the genetic code,” Sankaranarayanan told PTI. "This chain then folds to form specialised molecular machines that carry out specific cellular tasks like metabolic reactions, regulation of genes, providing defence against pathogens, transporting cargo etc. Therefore, life depends heavily on the way the amino acids are assembled to form proteins," he explained. The prize in the Engineering and Computer Science category was given to Professor Hari Balakrishnan from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US for his broad contributions to computer networking, and his seminal work on mobile and wireless systems. According to ISF, Balakrishnan’s commercial use of mobile telematics can improve driver behaviour and make roads safer. In Humanities, Prachi Deshpande from the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences (CSSS), Kolkata was awarded for her nuanced and sophisticated treatment of South Asian historiography. Deshpande’s book ‘Creative Pasts’ and many articles provide fine insight into the evolution of modern history writing in Maharashtra from the Maratha period onwards, and offer a novel perspective on the history of Western India, ISF said. In the field of Mathematical Sciences, the prize was awarded to Professor Sourav Chatterjee from Stanford University in the US for his groundbreaking work in probability and statistical physics. According to the jury, Chatterjee’s collaborative work has played a critical role in areas such as the emerging body of work on large deviations for random graphs. The award in the Physical Sciences category went to Professor Arindam Ghosh from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore for his development of atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors to build a new generation of functional electronic, thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices. Ghosh's creation of a new platform for light-matter interaction impacts quantum technologies and sensing in a fundamental way, according to the jury. The prize for Social Sciences field was awarded to Professor Raj Chetty from Harvard University, US for his pioneering research in identifying barriers to economic opportunity, and for developing solutions that help people escape poverty towards improved life outcomes. Chetty’s research and extraordinary ability to discern patterns in large data have the potential to induce major shifts in the discipline of Economics, ISF said. The Infosys Prize has a history of awarding exceptional talent, some of whom have also earned prestigious international honours like the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, the Fields Medal and the Padma Shri.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/six-scientists-and-researchers-receive-infosys-prize-2020-922504.html

Justice P S Dinesh Kumar gave this direction while observing that even the banks have not revealed the provision of law while freezing the accounts on the direction of the ED. The petitioner - Indians for Amnesty International Trust - had stated that the banks cited confidentiality and refused to share the details. The court pointed out that bank transaction is a fundamental right of the petitioner, the account holder. The petitioner is challenging the ED communication dated August 25, 2020 to the banks. The petitioner has alleged harassment stating that subsequently through a provisional order dated November 26, the ED directed to freeze the bank accounts. According to the petitioner, there was gross violation of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) since the matter was not even taken before the adjudicating authority within 30 days of the seizure. The counsel representing the Union government submitted that the activities of the petitioner had been under watch under successive governments for the past eight years. The counsel further added that the petitioner has alternative remedies under the PMLA, adjudicating authority and the appellate tribunal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-hc-asks-ed-to-explain-authority-of-law-to-freeze-bank-accounts-922611.html

During his two-day visit to Mumbai, Adityanath is slated to meet industrialists and film personalities and is also expected to attend a listing ceremony for municipal bonds issued by the Lucknow civic body at the BSE on Wednesday, as per a statement by the Uttar Pradesh government. Earlier in the day, senior Congress leader and Maharashtra PWD Minister Ashok Chavan alleged the BJP was scheming to take away a "slice of Bollywood" to the northern state. "When BJP was in power in Maharashtra, many industries and offices were shifted to Gujarat. Though the government changed in Maharashtra, the BJP is now readying a script to take away a slice of Bollywood in the name of the Uttar Pradesh government. "Whatever had happened in the tenure of the BJP, we won't let it happen again," Chavan tweeted. Sachin Sawant, a spokesperson for the Congress party, a constituent of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi dispensation in Maharashtra, has reportedly alleged a conspiracy to shift Bollywood out of Mumbai. Adityanath had earlier unveiled an ambitious plan to set up a film city and rolled out an open offer to film fraternity to come to Uttar Pradesh. The UP government had already approved a proposal for setting up a film city in Sector 21 along the Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, "Yogiji may be coming here to study the film city and facilities being provided to the industry, but nobody can take the film city and its glamour away from Mumbai". The BJP leader also said every state has the right to develop or provide some facilities to the film industry. "They are free to do so," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bjp-trying-to-shift-bollywood-to-up-ashok-chavan-922320.html

The Bhiwandi Road railway station on Mumbai Division lies on the Vasai-Diva-Panvel route that connects Central Railway and Western Railway. Located within the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR), many ecommerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and FedEx have their warehouses here. When the Covid-19 pandemic was sweeping the state and lockdown/unlock measures were in force, the Central Railway (CR) commissioned a parcel terminal and goods shed on September 9. It has gained a much-needed momentum. On Tuesday, Bhiwandi MP Kapil Patil and CR’s Divisional Railway Manager Shalabh Goel, who heads the Mumbai Division, visited and inspected the facilities. Patil urged all loaders to send their goods through the railway in a cost-effective environment-friendly manner. Goel said the parcel trains are time-tabled hence come with assured transit time. “Sending the parcel by railway takes less time compared to other modes of transport,” he said. He pointed out that Mumbai-Chennai takes only 28 hours, Mumbai-Shalimar (Kolkata) 36 hours and Mumbai -Azara (Assam) takes 50 hours. The tariff offered for parcel loaders is much less compared to road transport. “Bhiwandi is a strategic location as the warehouses are located in close vicinity of the station and hence the first mile charges are reduced to an extent. Export for Bangladesh can also go directly as railways are already sending automobiles from Kalamboli to Bangladesh,” CR officials said. It is the connecting point of the North-South railway traffic and also connects the JNPT port with Railways. Bhiwandi is an industrial town and a textile and warehousing hub. Bhiwandi Road station has multiple advantages like proximity to Mumbai and Thane City, adequate parking space for trucks and tempos.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bhiwandi-turning-into-biggest-parcel-terminal-in-india-922369.html

The Western Railway (WR) on Tuesday announced to restore from December 3 the timings of four special suburban locals, that are currently being run for emergency services staff, to their original schedules which were effective before the coronavirus-induced lockdown came into force in March. Currently, the first local train from Dahanu in Palghar district is departing at 4.40 am and reaching Churchgate in south Mumbai at 7.04 am. As per the restored timings to come in effect from Thursday, the train will leave from Dahanu at 5.40 am and reach Andheri in western suburbs at 7.34 am. Upset over the change in timings, some commuters started a 'rail roko' agitation at Palghar station and sat on tracks there around 5.15 am on Wednesday, a Government Railway Police (GRP) official said. A number of commuters also staged similar protests at Kelve and Safale stations in Palghar district around 5.30 am, the official said. Train movement later resumed after the GRP and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel RPF removed the agitating commuters from the tracks, he said. The agitation at Palghar station ended around 5.45 am and at the other two stations it ended at 6.30 am, he added. WR's chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said train services on the suburban network are normal now. He said the Western Railway has just decided to restore the special suburban services to their original timings which were effective before the COVID-19 lockdown. "We are reviewing the demand of passengers, but we have just restored the original timetable of Dahanu locals and haven't made any change in the timetable," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/commuters-stage-rail-roko-over-change-in-local-train-timings-922396.html
02-12-2020||West||Gujarat HC orders state to implement community service for mask rule violators||The Gujarat High Court on Wednesday passed an order directing the state government to make a rule for sending mask rule violators to 5-10 days mandatory non-medical community service at coronavirus care centres in order to strictly implement the rules of mask in public places. This will be in addition to a fine of Rs 1,000 for such violators. The court order came a day after the state government showed reluctance to implement such a rule citing logistical issues. The division bench of chief justice Vikram Nath and justice J B Pardiwala passed the order on a set of petitions including a suo motu public interest litigation concerning measures being taken by the state government to contain the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. The bench ordered the state to issue a notification stating that, '' Any person found to be not wearing or using a face mask/covering in a public place and/or violating the Covid protocol of social distancing, shall be mandated to do community service at any Covid Care centre run by the local authorities."   The order states that such "duty should be non-medical in nature and can include activities such as, cleaning, housekeeping, help in cooking and serving the food, preparation of record, data feeding, etc." The duties should be assigned considering the age, qualifications, gender and health status of the violators. The court has suggested that such services should be for at least four to six hours a day for a period ranging from 5 to 15 days. The bench headed by chief justice Nath noted that " A violator not wearing a face cover/mask is not only putting himself to risk but is also putting people near and around him or in close contact with him to risk. Such others could be his acquaintances, relatives, friends or strangers. In effect, he is putting the community at risk and therefore, in line with the concept and in principle of community service, the said violator must extend services to the community which is put at risk."   The bench also commented that it was "unfortunate" that the state government declined to address the issue of mass violation of mask rules. The state government had told the court that community service was not viable due to several logistics issues. The bench has noted, "Such stand of the State is unfortunate considering that it is the State which is required to act in the most proactive manner in such times. The stand of the State has left us with no option but to issue certain directions, considering the gravity and enormity of the situation."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-hc-orders-state-to-implement-community-service-for-mask-rule-violators-922408.html
02-12-2020||West||Goa Forward Party promises compulsory siesta hour if it wins in 2022 elections||Goa Forward Party (GFP) leader Vijai Sardesai said at a press conference that if he becomes the chief minister, he would enforce a “compulsory siesta hour” between 2 pm and 4 pm. Siesta is a Spanish word, which means a short nap in the afternoon after a midday meal. Calling on the relaxed and laidback image of the state of Goa in the country, Sardesai is quoted in an Indian Express report as saying that the compulsory siesta is a significant part of Goa and its ‘sussegad’. “Sussegad is derived from the Portuguese word 'sossegado', which means a relaxed, carefree, chilled-out attitude that is associated with Goa. The word means peace and mind you, an afternoon nap is an integral part of sussegad. It is clinically proven that a short nap or siesta boosts your memory, improves job performance, lifts your mood and makes you more alert,” Sardesai told IE. This is a way for the GFP to promote the ‘Goan identity’ which it will be pushing during its campaign for the 2022 elections. It is not uncommon for Goan shops and businesses to be shut during the afternoon to have a siesta hour. It is a general belief that lunch should be followed by this relaxing time, and people return to work only by 4 pm. “My father, I recall, would take this siesta very seriously and so did the older generations. You see the difference in how Goan establishments remain shut between 1.30 and 4.30 pm, while their counterparts from Gujarat and Rajasthan remain open all day,” he said. Sardesai clarified that the sussegad concept has nothing to do with inactivity or laziness. On the contrary, he said that the state is not unresponsive to social and environmental issues. But Sardesai has warned against overloading a small state like Goa with the massive infrastructure it cannot handle. Throughout the state, big railway and road projects are underway at present. “All this is basically to turn Goa into a corridor. This doesn’t suit our way of living,” Sardesai said, commenting on the train routes to Goa. Sardesai is a former Bharatiya Janata Party ally, who was part of the NDA government when late Manohar Parrikar was chief minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-forward-party-promises-compulsory-siesta-hour-if-it-wins-in-2022-elections-922473.html

The bank, in which the Statue of Unity management held two accounts, had hired an agency to collect cash daily from authorities at Kevadia in Narmada district and deposit it the next day, Deputy Superintendent of Police Vani Dudhat told reporters. "However, some staffers of the agency prima facie didn't deposit an amount of Rs 5,24,77,375 into the bank accounts of the statue management between November 2018 and March 2020," said Dudhat. The officer said an FIR was lodged by manager of the private bank against unidentified persons working with the cash collection agency at Kevadia police station on Monday night. Police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Dudhat said, adding that police are yet to make any arrest in the case. Meanwhile, the Statue of Unity management said the issue lies between the bank and the cash collection agency concerned. A senior official of the management said the bank has deposited Rs 5.24 crore into their accounts. The imposing monument of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, called as the Statue of Unity (SoU), is located at Kevadia in Narmada district. The statue has been a major tourist attraction since it was inaugurated in October 2018. A Children Nutrition Park and a Cactus Garden are among other attractions, including river rafting, located in the vicinity of the monument. Before the lockdown, people had the option to buy tickets online or over the counter in cash at the spot. In December last year, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel informed the Legislative Assembly that the statue management earned a revenue of Rs 82.51 crore between November 1, 2018, and November 16, 2019. Data of revenue from November 2019 to March 2020 was not released by the government. As per the FIR, the bank has been using services of the agency since 2003 for cash collection and deposition. The bank had appointed the same agency to collect cash generated from the sale of tickets at the Statue of Unity and other connected tourist attractions and deposit it into the two bank accounts of the State of Unity authorities, Dudhat said. "In a recent audit, the State of Unity officials found a mismatch in the amount mentioned in cash deposit slips, given by the agency staff after collecting the cash, and the actual cash deposited into the bank accounts between November 2018 and March 2020," she said. After it was informed by the statue management about the mismatch, the bank conducted a probe which revealed that some staff members of the agency allegedly did not deposit Rs 5.24 crore, following which the bank authorities lodged the FIR, the dy SP said. "We need to check several records of the agency to find out who were involved in the cash collection exercise at Kevadia," the officer said, adding that no one has been identified or arrested yet. The monument was shut for tourists for almost seven months since March due to coronavirus-induced lockdown, before it was reopened for visitors from October 17 with staggered timings. Limited tickets are sold online. Offline sale of tickets at the counter has been stopped, an official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rs-524-crore-of-statue-of-unity-s-ticket-sale-money-not-put-in-bank-fir-lodged-922526.html

A beat constable has also been suspended as he didn't inform his senior about the event," Tapi district superintendent of police Sujata Majmudar told DH. She added, "The event organisers had not taken any permission for the event." These developments came after a division bench of the high court with Justice Vikram Nath and Justice J B Pardiwala took cognisance of the video clip which has gone viral since Tuesday and said that it was "shocking" to see such an event in the middle of a pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-bjp-leader-cops-caterer-among-arrested-for-organising-engagement-party-amid-covid-19-922582.html
02-12-2020||West||Maharashtra: No caste based names of localities||In a landmark decision, Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra on Wednesday decided to abolish caste-based names of hamlets and localities. Places such as Brahmanpada, Dhorpada, Maligalli, Maharpada will now be a matter of past. The move aims to curb caste-based discrimination and establish social harmony in both villages and cities. “All these bastis will be named after social reformers or names such as Samta Nagar, Bhim Nagar, Jyoti Nagar,”  Minister for Social Justice and Special Assistance Dhananjay Munde said.   The proposal was put up by Munde, an NCP leader. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had suggested the renaming of the caste-based colonies earlier.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-no-caste-based-names-of-localities-922620.html
