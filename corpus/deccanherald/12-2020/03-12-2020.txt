In addition to meeting Nepal’s top leaders and officials, when he is said to have discussed a range of bilateral issues including the boundary dispute as well as trade, transit, connectivity, infrastructure, energy and agriculture, Shringla handed over essential medicines, ventilators, test kits and PPE material as part of India’s support for Nepal’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Bilateral relations have frayed significantly in recent years, especially over the past year with Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli stirring anti-India Nepali nationalism to deflect attention away from his poor governance and failure to tackle the pandemic and the economic crisis. Among other things, he accused India of encroaching into Nepali territory and even got a constitutional amendment passed that showed Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani as part of Nepal. As Oli’s political credibility declined in Nepal, his needling of India rose. He has been cosying up to China in recent years. Understandably, it led to a perception in India that he was raising territorial claims on India at China’s behest. Nepali opposition politicians have been drawing attention to China’s encroachment of Nepali territory in Humla district. Politicians in the ruling Nepali Communist Party too are opposed to his excessive tilt to China. India-Nepal relations became so frayed that the two sides had suspended high-level interactions. Visits by the Indian Army chief Gen M M Naravane and RAW chief Samant Goel to Kathmandu, which preceded Shringla’s visit, seem to have set in motion normalisation of relations. In a speech at a think-tank in Kathmandu, Shringla underscored the “intrinsic and symbiotic” bond between the two countries. India’s development and modernisation depends on that of Nepal and vice versa, he pointed out.  Whether New Delhi’s outreach will translate into Nepal taking concrete steps to correct its excessive tilt to China remains to be seen. To wrest back its position of Nepal’s primary partner, India will have to put in sustained diplomatic effort. Success in this regard will not come quickly given the enormous influence China wields over Nepal. The Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi has been mediating in the ongoing political crisis in Nepal and Oli and his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be heeding only her words - so complete is China’s control over the ruling party. Chinese Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe visited Nepal, close on the heels of Shringla’s visit. Beijing’s unprecedented political interference in Nepal is accompanied by strengthening economic and defence co-operation. Can India match that?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bettering-ties-with-nepal-922684.html

According to police, four bike-borne youths reportedly assaulted Nagesh, resident of Ashok Nagar, and fled the spot. He sustained injuries on his nose and he was taken to a private hospital in the city immediately. He is currently out of danger. After the incident, a group reportedly attacked three merchants in Chore Bazar, an area run by a minority community in the city and this led to communal tension in the city. It is said that Nagesh is a frontline leader of the right-wing group. Following the incident, all shops in the area have been closed down and police security beefed up. Superintendent of Police Shantaraju visited the area and appealed to people to maintain peace. Speaking to DH, Additional Superintendent of Police Shekhar Naik said, "The situation is under control. It is a communal attack. But nobody has been arrested in this regard so far." Eastern Range IGP Ravi said some untoward incidents have taken place in Shivamogga and they are posing threat to communal harmony. "I have come here to take stock of the situation. I appeal to people not to give heed to rumours and join hands with police to maintain peace," he said. After Bajrang Dal activist Nagesh was attacked, some miscreants damaged parked autorickshaws in communally sensitive areas of the city. There was a duel between two groups of different religions in Azar Nagar in the city. Fear has gripped Ravi Varma street in the city. Two Karnataka State Reserve Platoons had been deployed in Amir Ahmed colony and Lashkar Mohalla in the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/tension-grips-shivamogga-after-attack-on-bajrang-dal-activist-922829.html

The public notification was issued by the Revenue Inspector of Moodbidri on November 26. The notification has urged the members of the public to submit their objections within 15 days of the publication of the notification. About 50 acres of the 88.73 acres of land in survey number 88/1 in Niddodi village has been identified for setting up of the mega seafood park. The objections with supporting documents should be submitted to Moodbidri Tahsildar. Objections filed after 15 days will not be considered. If there are no objections, then the proposal will be taken forward. Bannur caseIt may be recalled that officials had issued a notification on November 11 inviting objections from the public for the proposed seafood park on 40 acres of land in Bannur that was earlier reserved for building a government medical college. Many residents feared that the proposed sea food park in Puttur would lead to depletion of groundwater, contamination of water and pollution of the environment. Over 400 villagers from Bannur village had submitted their objections against the setting up of the sea food park. They had opposed the diverting of land meant for government medical college and had demanded that medical college should be set up. The DYFI had staged a protest in Puttur and former Puttur MLA T Shankuntala Shetty had also opposed the move to divert the land. According to sources, even Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC) were not in favour of the seafood park project in Bannur due to feasibility factors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-govt-invites-public-objection-for-seafood-park-in-bannur-922833.html

03-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Political parties consider GP polls as prestige issue in Mysuru region||Though the gram panchayat elections, the largest in terms of number of seats and candidates, are held not on party symbols, the political parties in the region have taken the election as a pride. The elections for GP is scheduled for December 22 and 27. With the frontline leaders taking a plunge into GP elections, the elections are taking taluk panchayat (TP), zilla panchayat (ZP) and Assembly elections way. The political parties are backing the candidates and campaigning in party’s name. The political parties - JD(S), Congress and BJP - are preparing for the election and planning out strategies to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. Compared to the JD(S) and the Congress, the BJP has taken the election as a challenge and the party leaders, including ministers and state-level leaders have started campaigning through Grama Swarajya conventions. The BJP leaders had organised the conventions much before the announcement of the elections. District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar and other ministers had participated in the convention. Somashekar said, “BJP has taken the election as a prestige and the election is an opportunity to strengthen the party at the ground level. We are making all the possible efforts to strengthen the party. The candidates backed by BJP will win the polls.” Like the BJP, the Congress and the JD(S) leaders are also working out strategies to win the polls and state-level leaders will campaign for the candidates. The Congress party is planning to launch the campaign in a big way and is planning to bring state leaders for election campaign. Former chief minister Siddaramaiah, former minister Dr H C Mahadevappa and others will campaign for the candidates. Similarly, regional party, JD(S) is also gearing up for the polls. The party leader H D Kumaraswamy recently opined that the BJP’s ‘Gram Swarajya’ will not work out in the GP elections. “GP election system is different than others. I will give an opportunity to the party workers to elect their leaders in GP level,” he said. The farmers associations and organisations are planning to field their candidates for the GP polls. Farmer leader Badagalapura Nagendra said, “We want to show our strength and are planning to field candidates. Farmer’s association along with Raitha and Dalit Sangarsha Samiti has planned to field candidates.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/political-parties-consider-gp-polls-as-prestige-issue-in-mysuru-region-923003.html

The representatives of more than ten organisations have decided to stay away from the bandh as they are just returning to normalcy from Covid-19. Mysuru Travel Association president B S Prashanth said, “We are not ready to close business as we have incurred a huge loss due to Covid induced lockdown. As we have started recovering, it is highly difficult to close business. Meanwhile, we are not against the organisations. We will express our protest by wearing a black band.” Mysuru Hotel Owners' Association president C Narayanagowda said, "Hotel business is one among the others which was severely affected due to Covid-19.

03-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka will have law against 'Love Jihad', officials asked to look into UP ordinance: Home Minister||Karnataka will have a law against "love jihad", and officials have been directed to gather information regarding an ordinance promulgated in Uttar Pradesh in this regard, state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday. Uttar Pradesh had recently promulgated an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, which provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 50,000 under different categories. "Love jihad" is a coinage used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. "...when Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh governments started mulling over it (a law), we too started thinking about it- how to do it, how to ensure that there was pressure or force involved (in conversion)- it is the main thing," Bommai said. Speaking to reporters in Udupi, he said, Uttar Pradesh has recently promulgated an ordinance in this regard and our officials have been directed to get a copy of it. "After gathering information from other states also regarding the measures taken there, in Karnataka too we will have a law against love jihad for sure. The chief minister has agreed to it...," he added. Last month, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had said that the government will take strong measures to put an end to religious conversion in the name of love and marriage. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel too on Wednesday had asserted that a stringent law against 'Love Jihad' will be enacted in Karnataka. However, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy on Tuesday had said there was no proposal of enacting a law against religious conversion for the sake of marriage before the government for now. "...Being the scrutiny committee chairman, I can say that no such proposal has come before me yet," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-will-have-law-against-love-jihad-officials-asked-to-look-into-up-ordinance-home-minister-922864.html

03-12-2020||Main Article||Regulation by stealth||In a welcome, rapid response to widespread and intense criticism, the Government of Kerala withdrew the controversial new Section 118A of the Kerala Police Act on November 25, 2020, just a few days after the state’s Governor had signed it into law.  The vaguely drafted law was disturbingly reminiscent of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act and an earlier Section 18(d) of the Kerala Police Act, both of which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015. Pushed through without even a debate in the state Legislative Assembly, it was ostensibly meant to tackle cyber bullying and online abuse, especially of women and children.  However, it triggered public apprehension and outrage because it clearly went well beyond the stated objective. Legal experts, free speech activists, media professionals and a wide range of political leaders described it as draconian, inimical to freedom of expression (including media freedom), and prone to misuse.  The only positive aspect of the regrettable episode is that better sense eventually prevailed and the ill-conceived amendment is now history.  Nevertheless, this incident underlines the urgent need for the critical issue of media regulation in public interest to receive more serious attention from all concerned, especially the media and civil society.   This is by no means the first time a government has attempted to exert control over media – disclaimers aside – and it is unlikely to be the last such effort. The vital, so far largely ignored issue of media regulation, requires urgent, critical consideration – all the more now because it has, in recent years, become ever more vexed and complex. The old separation of mass media into print, audio and audio-visual/electronic is clearly outdated. Digital and social media, not to mention all that lies ahead with constantly evolving communications technologies, are becoming increasingly pervasive and influential.  Social media, in particular, has thrown up some serious challenges, including online abuse and fake news.   Under the circumstances, the apparent confusion that prevails among even justices of the apex court and legal luminaries, not to mention government officials as well as media leaders, about regulation of even traditional media, is disconcerting.  The seeming lack of clarity was revealed most recently in the ongoing Sudarshan News and Tablighi Jamaat cases in the Supreme Court.  The Sudarshan News case has also exposed many faultlines in India’s existing, chaotic and ineffective media regulatory system. A major problem is the role of the government:  if regulation here is inevitably associated with government interference, if not control, there are valid reasons for that.   To begin with, India still lacks a public service broadcaster, unlike most mature democracies around the world.  The Prasar Bharati Corporation, set up in 1997 as a statutory, supposedly autonomous body, has not lived up to its original mandate to ensure independence for Doordarshan and Akashvani/All India Radio, which still function as state broadcasters, answerable to the government of the day.  Radio news remains a government monopoly, with private and community radio stations allowed to broadcast only AIR news bulletins.   It is true that private “news and current affairs” television channels have proliferated over the past couple of decades.  According to the latest available official data, they constitute just a little less than half of the over 900 “permitted private satellite TV channels.”  Holding sway However, the jurisdiction of the two supposedly “self-regulatory” bodies governing news channels – the older News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) and its new rival, the News Broadcasters Federation Authority (NBFA), is limited.  They hold sway, if at all, only over members of the News Broadcasters Association and the 2019-born News Broadcasters Federation respectively, and these together make up just a fraction of the total number of news channels. Sudarshan News, for example, is not a member of either. Under the circumstances, the majority of private, so-called news channels are answerable to no regulatory authority – except, again, the government. This is clearly an unsatisfactory situation which calls into question the legitimacy and effectiveness of “self-regulation” by broadcasters in its present form.   The various draft Broadcasting Services Regulation Bills floated by the government in the interim (most recently in 2007) have been unacceptable because they were clearly intended to institutionalise government control over the media. Yet, all these years later, in both the Sudarshan News case and the Tablighi Jamaat case, Supreme Court justices appear to assume that the answer to fake news and bigotry on air lies in media regulation by the government and, failing that, by themselves and/or committees set up by them.   This is all the more incomprehensible since there are many, readily available past and current studies of non-governmental media regulation systems and practices across the democratic world, to learn from and draw on. According to a recent overview of journalistic self-regulation in Europe (undertaken as part of a project titled Media Councils in the Digital Age), “The basic idea behind all media councils is the same: a truly independent media system requires self-regulation, for the simple reason that having government regulation would threaten the freedom of the press.”  It is, of course, convenient for governments to profess, pretend and procrastinate. The prevailing regulatory vacuum, disagreements among media enterprises and public apathy together serve to strengthen their hands. It is significant that, despite protestations in court about respect for freedom of the press, several recent moves by the Central government suggest accelerated action to extend control over digital media, including online news and current affairs publications.   The speech by the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javdekar at a National Press Day function in mid-November was a classic example of speaking with a forked tongue – asserting that the government did not wish to step into the regulatory domain while saying it is thinking of developing a common code of conduct for TV channels. And, contrary to what he implied, the Press Council of India is no model of self-regulation.  The PCI’s recent, uncalled-for advisory on the publication of “foreign content” in Indian newspapers is only the latest among its many sins of omission and commission over the years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/regulation-by-stealth-922683.html

The minister exhorted scientists of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to scale up their sewage treatment technology and install it at all their campuses across the country. Vardhan was virtually addressing CSIR scientists after inaugurating the eco-friendly and efficient Phytorid Technology Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (NCL)-Pune, developed by CSIR- National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, and CSIR-NCL. "Union Minister of Science & Technology, Earth Sciences and Health & Family Welfare Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that treatment of sewage water is essential to meet the challenge of water scarcity in coming years," an official statement said. The minister appreciated sewage treatment using Phytorid Technology by the CSIR scientists and said it was a natural treatment method by which treated water could be utilised for various purposes, including for drinking. Phytorid is a subsurface mixed flow constructed wetland system developed and internationally patented by CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur, with successful demonstration in the field for more than 10 years of continuous operation as a stand-alone sewage treatment system. It is a self-sustainable technology for wastewater treatment that works on the principle of natural wetland. It uses certain specific plants which can absorb nutrients directly from wastewater but do not require soil. These plants act as nutrient sinker and remover, the statement said. Using Phytorid Technology for the treatment of sewage, it is possible to recover and reuse the treated water for gardening purposes, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/treatment-of-sewage-water-essential-to-meet-challenge-of-water-scarcity-in-coming-years-vardhan-922645.html

The Ministry of Electronics and IT has issued an order under Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000 directing Wikipedia to remove the link, they added. The matter had been flagged by a Twitter user, who highlighted that the Wikipedia page on the India-Bhutan relationship had incorrectly depicted the map of Jammu Kashmir, and asked the government to take action. Sources said taking cognizance of the matter, the ministry issued an order on November 27, 2020 directing Wikipedia to remove the map as it violated the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India. They added that the government can take legal action against the company, including blocking access to the entire platform, in case it does not make the changes. Last month, the government had issued a notice to microblogging platform Twitter for showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir instead of the Union Territory of Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-orders-wikipedia-to-remove-link-showing-incorrect-map-of-india-922647.html
03-12-2020||National||Modi govt indulging in 'divisive agenda' to break farmer unity: Protesters in letter to Narendra Singh Tomar||The leaders of the protesting farmers wrote to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday, demanding a special session of Parliament to repeal the new farm laws and asking the government to not "indulge in divisive agenda" to break farmers' unity. The letter comes a day before the second round of talks is scheduled to take place between the Centre and leaders of farmer unions to resolve the ongoing standoff over the new agriculture laws. "We ask the government not to indulge in any divisive agendas with regard to the farmers' movement which is united in its demands at this point of time. This was clear from the meeting proceedings yesterday (Tuesday)," Samyukt Kisan Morcha Coordination Committee, which is spearheading the protests, said in the letter. According to the letter, the leaders asked the Centre to ensure that representatives of various farmer organisations and their alliances are decided by the farmers and not by the government and that the all-India alliances that have been at the forefront of the agitation get representation in the consultations.  Critical talks between three Union ministers and farmer groups ended in a stalemate on Tuesday after they rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into the issues raised by the agitating farmers. The two sides, however, have decided to meet again on Thursday. In its letter, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha Coordination Committee asked the government to ensure that all consultations happen at the same time without any parallel talks with different organisations at different times and locations. "We once again put forward our demand that Parliament be convened immediately to repeal the three farm acts, and give in writing that the government would not introduce the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 in the Parliament," it stated. It also stated that thousands of farmers including mothers, children and the elderly have been sitting peacefully and patiently on the national highways leading into Delhi for the past seven days, braving the chill with determination.  Three deaths have already been reported, it said, adding that it would be inhuman on the part of the Union government to not resolve the farmers' genuine and legitimate demands immediately and bring normalcy at the earliest. "The Expert Panel proposal is not acceptable to us. Given the failure of earlier such efforts, we see no point in this. The lack of sincerity of the government makes it use this tool of expert panels that it sets up, with government itself inevitably deciding the constitution and terms of reference, and also not adopting, inevitably again, the recommendations that come out of such panels. Therefore, farmers can see through the ploy of meaningless expert panels," it added.

Vardhan was charing the inaugural session of the annual conference of the India-Sweden Healthcare Innovation Centre under the Sweden-India Nobel memorial week, the Health Ministry said in a statement. "No conversation on healthcare today is complete without underlining the massive challenge that the planet has faced in the last 10 months on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, each challenge also has a silver lining to it," Vardhan was quoted as saying. The pandemic has taught "us that our shared challenges also require shared responsibilities. Collaborations and synergies have become the order of the day. We can no longer work in silos. We have to create global synergies like never before," he said. The cooperation in the field of health between the two countries has been long-standing, for which the 10th year celebration took place last year with much adulation, according to the minister. Expressing happiness that the cooperation between the two countries bloomed into a multi-stakeholder relationship, Vardhan said: "The inclusion of policy makers, academia and industry will play a key role in innovation, and I look forward to the synergies being created in the process." Vardhan added that it was on the same lines that the prime ministers of the two countries expressed the desire to enhance cooperation. The minister said he looked forward to hearing about the strategic plans emerging from the joint working group, set up under the MoU, which is going to meet next week to further increase health cooperation between the two countries. "The India Sweden Healthcare Innovation Centre is also in the process of setting up a Centre of Excellence at AIIMS Jodhpur on Cancer Care," he said. Vardhan was also invited to witness the announcement of the winners of the first innovation challenge of the Centre. As many as eight problem statements across therapy areas, including non-communicable diseases and Covid-19, were identified and start-ups across India and Sweden were invited to apply, the statement said. "In India we have a lot of innovation, the challenge is to scale these ideas, and we support the vision of the Centre towards supporting the scale up within and outside India," Vardhan said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/can-no-longer-work-in-silos-dr-harsh-vardhan-stresses-on-collaboration-between-countries-922657.html

Shaheen Bagh in South Delhi was the hub of the agitation against the citizenship amendment act earlier this year, before the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Tiwari, in a statement, said alleged slogans in favour of Khalistan and threat to the Prime Minister by some protesters among the farmers showed that it was a "well planned conspiracy"  to create "unrest" in the country. “Presence of individuals and groups who opposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and CAA at Shaheen Bagh clearly establishes that the 'tukde-tukde' gang is trying to experiment with Shaheen Bagh 2.0 and create unrest under the grab of farmers' protest,” charged Tiwari. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and other states are camping on Delhi's borders demanding that the Centre withdraw the three new agriculture laws. The Singhu and Tikri borders neighbouring Haryana have been blocked by the protesters for the last one week.   Tiwari said he hoped that the real farmers protesting against the farm laws will understand the reality and thwart the "intentions" of the alleged 'tukde-tukde' gang.  “The conspirators of riots, who had succeeded in Delhi, are preparing to incite nationwide riots in the name of farmers. It is the responsibility of every citizen of this country to defeat them,” he claimed further. Tiwari's North East Delhi Parliamentary constituency was engulfed by communal violence in February this year, claiming over 50 lives and resulting in injuries to hundreds of people and massive destruction of property.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tukde-tukde-gang-turning-farmers-stir-into-shaheen-bagh-protest-bjps-manoj-tiwari-922678.html

While a letter in August by the Railway Board indicated that the colonial-era practice of appointing 'khalasis' will be completely done away with, the current order issued on December 1 indicated that it would be continued, albeit with no fresh appointments, but posted from among the existing pool. "The policy for appointment of TADK will henceforth be as under Engagement of fresh face substitute as TADK is discontinued with effect from 6.8.2020," the order stated. "As regards posts of TADK that are currently vacant: General Managers may review requirement/necessity for continuing with such posts, keeping in view operational and functional consideration. "Such posts may be filled from substitute TADKs available in Indian Railways. Alternatively, these posts may also be filled by regular employees, from any unit in Indian Railways, subject to willingness of the employee and the officer concerned. The lien and seniority of above employees shall be protected in their parent cadre," it said. The order stated that existing posts of incumbent TADKs would continue and their employment would be governed by existing rules. Upon joining the Railways as temporary staff, TADKs become Group D staff following a screening process after a period of around three years. In earlier days, officers posted in remote areas or working in the field during odd hours would be provided a TADK to ensure security for his family, as well as do odd official work like take phone calls or ferry files. These TADK staff would usually become ticket examiners, porters, mechanics for air-conditioned coaches and cooks in the running room. However, over the years, the role was relegated to that of domestic helps and then to office peons, officials said. Amid complaints of abuse and ill-treatment, the Railways had ordered a review of the post, and in 2014, constituted a joint secretary-level committee of nine members of the Railway Board to review the policy. A TADK staff, who have a minimum educational qualification of up to Class 8, are paid around Rs 20,000-22,000 per month and given benefits akin to Group D staff of the Railways.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-fresh-appointments-in-indian-railways-for-khalasi-post-to-be-filled-with-regular-employees-order-922679.html

Speaking at a virtual press conference organised by various civil groups to express their solidarity for the farmers movement, Sainath said trade unions and workers had already shown the way during their "massive strike where lakhs and lakhs of workers endorsed the demands of the farmers". "We thought it is time now that the other non-farmer classes of society stand up and be counted," he said. "The workers have already shown us the way and it is time for us to be counted and we have to be counted as standing for the unconditional repeal of these three laws." Hundreds of farmers are staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh over various demands, including the repeal of the three contentious new legislations. They have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. Sainath termed the decision of the Centre to introduce the laws amid the pandemic a "bad miscalculation". "The reason was simple. They believed that if you could smash through these laws at this time, all these guys, the farmers, the workers will be in no position to organise and resist. It was really a bad miscalculation," he explained. Sainath pointed out to the clauses 18 and 19 of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act and Contract Farming Act, explaining how it provides no legal recourse whatsoever for farmers or anyone for that matter. He described the new laws as an "incredibly sweeping, deadly exclusion" of legal recourse. "Article 19 in the Indian Constitution is about freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, but here it (farm laws) is about exempting any cog in the govt machinery of legal scrutiny," Sainath said. "And it does not specify that farmers could not do it. It says nobody can. You are going to see these clauses in every law that comes in." Professor Praveen Jha from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Annie Raja from the National Federation of Indian Women and Kavita Krishnan from the All India Progressive Women's Association were among the other notable speakers in the conference. The various groups condemned the "brutal repression" of the peaceful struggle and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all cases against on farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/time-for-non-farmer-section-to-stand-up-be-counted-p-sainath-922680.html

Tributes poured in from different corners with Delhi's deputy CM Manish Sisodia calling him one of the country's most inspiring entrepreneurs. Mahashay Dharampal, born on March 27 in 1923 in Sialkot (Pakistan), was a pioneer to India's spice industry. The face of MDH for almost a century has been a personality of many dimensions and achievements. His immense modesty and down-to-earth charm have been actively spoken of by all. In 1947, Gulati, a school dropout with just Rs 1,500 in his pocket, purchased a tonga for Rs 650 and drove it from New Delhi Railway Station to Qutab Road and Karol Bagh to Bara Hindu Rao at do-aana per sawari for few days. With the money he saved from this, Gulati bought a small wooden khokha (shop/hatti) measuring 14 ftx9 ft at Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi for his family business of ground spices and again raised the banner of Mahashian Di Hatti of Sialkot "Deggi Mirch Wale". Gulati, who came to India after the partition, with the help of his father in 1937 set up a small business of mirrors. Thereafter he set up a soap business and went about doing carpentry jobs, working as a cloth merchant, conducting hardware business and rice trading. Somehow these petty businesses did not hold him for long and he again joined hands with his father in his parental business of spices under the name of Mahashian Di Hatti, popularly known as ‘Deggi Mirch Wale‘ people. His brand, MDH, which finds a place in cabinets of many households, reflects his philosophy: “Give to the world the best you can, and the best will come back to you automatically”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rip-dharampal-king-of-masalas-sultan-of-spices-922743.html

The protesting farmers had on Wednesday threatened to block other roads of Delhi if their demands were not met. “The local police has closed the routes on NH-9 and NH-24 from Ghaziabad to Delhi. On NH-1, both sides of the route have been closed near Shani Mandir,” the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted. At the Chilla border, one carriageway - from Delhi to Noida - has been opened for traffic. However, the other carriageway - from Noida to Delhi - is still closed. The Delhi-Haryana border at Jharoda, Jhatikra remained closed for traffic movement. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheeler traffic. However, people can travel to Haryana through Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri, NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera border points, the traffic police said. The police also kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic for the eight day on the trot. “Singhu border is still closed from both sides. Lampur, Auchandi & other small borders also closed. Please take alternate routes. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK Road,” the traffic police tweeted. “Traffic is very heavy. Please avoid Outer Ring Road from Signature Bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu, Auchandi & Lampur borders,” it said.' As traffic spilled over to alternate routes, it led to long jams there as well. On Wednesday, their seventh day of protest, the farmers demanded that a special Parliament session be convened to repeal the new farm laws. The farmer unions also called for a nationwide protest on Saturday to oppose, what they claimed as, the corporatisation of farming.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-more-routes-connecting-up-delhi-closed-922804.html

Gulati was inarguably the face of the brand, the second-largest group in the Indian spice industry. Originally established by his father Mahashay Chunni Lal Gulati in 1919 in Sialkot, Mahashay Di Hatti Deggi Mirch Wale (red chili powder sellers) wasn't a household name as it is today until it shifted to Delhi. Having arrived to Delhi after the partition, Gulati started off as a tonga driver, eventually earning enough to set up his own spice store in Karol Bagh. Within five years, he expanded his business, setting up a second branch in Chandni Chowk. In the following year, he started a retail store by the name of 'Roopak Stores', where he sold all his powdered spice products. The success that accompanied this venture, led 'Mahashayji' to set up a factory to manufacture a variety of spices. In 1959, 'Dadaji' purchased a plot of land in Delhi's Kirti Nagar, where he set up the first of five production facilities that they own today. As necessary as it was to update the infrastructure, MDH, as a brand, would not have gotten to where they presently are if not for their diversified, consumer-oriented product range. The approach to push blended spice mixes for a variety of Indian dishes and curries proved successful, alongside the catchy jingle that made their advertisements hugely popular. The King of spices, too, through the advertisements became an almost immediately recognisable face, a fitting tribute to his rise from tonga driver to the highest earning FMCG CEO in 2017, and Padma Bhushan awardee in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-tonga-to-telly-trail-of-spice-king-dharampal-gulati-922805.html

In an Orange notice issued to all 194 member countries on Wednesday, the Lyon-based international police cooperation body warned agencies to prepare for potential criminal activity in relation to "the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 and flu vaccines". "It also includes examples of crimes where individuals have been advertising, selling and administering fake vaccines," a statement from the Interpol said. The Interpol issues an Orange notice to warn of an event, a person, an object or a process representing a serious and imminent threat to public safety. The CBI, which is the national central bureau for India, is tasked with coordination with the Interpol. The warning came on the day the UK became the first Western nation to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, vaulting past the US and the European Union in the race to approve a vaccine. The Interpol has asked police organisations to ensure "the safety of the supply chain" and said "identifying illicit websites selling fake products will be essential". "Criminal networks will also be targeting unsuspecting members of the public via fake websites and false cures, which could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives," Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock said in a statement. "It is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine, which is why INTERPOL has issued this global warning," the official said. The Interpol cybercrime unit has analysed that of 3,000 websites associated with online pharmacies suspected of selling illicit medicines and medical devices, around 1,700 contained cyber threats, especially phishing and spamming malware making such operators even more potent of causing financial and health harms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/criminal-networks-could-try-to-sell-fake-covid-19-vaccines-physically-and-on-internet-warns-interpol-922809.html

The UK on Wednesday became the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 with the UK regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)granting a temporary authorisation for its emergency use. "Right now we are in discussions with many governments around the world and remain committed to engaging with the Government of India and explore opportunities to make this vaccine available for use in the country," a Pfizer spokesperson said in a statement. Pfizer is committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to have access to the vaccine, and is working closely with governments, it added. "During this pandemic phase, Pfizer will supply this vaccine only through government contracts based on agreements with respective government authorities and following regulatory authorisation or approval," the statement said. The UK regulator, MHRA has granted a temporary authorisation for emergency use of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine. This constitutes the first Emergency Use Authorisation following a worldwide phase 3 trial of a vaccine to help fight the pandemic, Pfizer said on Wednesday. "As we anticipate further authorizations and approvals, we are focused on moving with the same level of urgency to safely supply a high-quality vaccine around the world,"  Pfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said on Wednesday. In November, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul, who also heads the National Task Force on Covid-19, had said the arrival of the Pfizer vaccine in the country might take some months. "The arrangement of cold-chains for storing the vaccine developed by Pfizer at a low temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius is a big challenge and it will not be easy for any nation. But then, if at all it has to be obtained, we are examining what we need to do...and will work out a strategy," he had said. Currently in India, Pune-based Serum Institute of India has said that it will apply for emergency use licensure for AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine in two weeks. Phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is also underway. While vaccine candidate of Zydus Cadila has completed the phase-2 clinical trial, pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories has started the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India. Another domestic firm Biological E Ltd has also started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/committed-to-engaging-with-indian-govt-to-make-vaccine-available-in-country-pfizer-922811.html

Addressing a press conference on the eve of Navy Day, he said the Navy has a standard operating procedure in case there is any infringement in the Indian Ocean region, in a veiled reference to the Chinese challenge. Referring to the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the Navy chief said the Indian Navy's surveillance aircraft P-8I and Heron drones are deployed in the region. "Whatever we are doing is in close coordination with the Army and the Indian Air Force," he said. India and China are locked in a border row in eastern Ladakh for nearly seven months which was triggered by the Chinese military's aggressive behaviour. On the overall challenge facing the country in the maritime domain, Admiral Singh said the Indian Navy is determined to stand steadfast in these testing times. Talking about the proposed maritime theatre command, he said work is in progress and its shape will come out after sometime. The Navy chief said enhancing the underwater capability of the country has been a focus of the Indian Navy. On induction of a third aircraft carrier, he said the Navy is absolutely clear about its requirement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/navy-alive-to-various-threats-in-maritime-domain-admiral-karambir-singh-922817.html

As soon as word broke of his sad demise, users took to various social media platforms to mourn his demise, and send their condolences. One tweet in particular, stood out as it drew parallels between Mahashay Dharampal Gulati and the Diamond comics character of Chacha Chaudhry.  On the face of it, both Chacha Choudhary and Gulati bear an uncanny resemblance, and one would be forgiven if they were to think that they are the same. So who is Chacha Choudhary, and how did he come about to be associated with the MDH owner? Chacha Choudhary is an Indian comic character, created by cartoonist Pran Kumar Sharma in 1971. He is described as a frail, elderly, and highly intelligent middle-class Indian who uses his intelligence and wooden stick to fight evil and find solutions. The Chacha Choudhary comics, which are made and sold by Diamond Comics, have over the years, been sold in millions, and have been adapted as a cartoon series, twice, in 2002, and 2019. Gulati, on the other hand, rose to fame while appearing on television advertisements for his spice products in the mid-90s, well into the previous decade. 'Dadaji', as he is fondly called, was the face of his products during this period. His presence in the advertisements, and the catchy jingle that made them popular among a majority of Indians. Another factor that adds to their uncanny resemblance is their attire. Gulati's attire has remained the same for over decades, sporting his white moustache and red turban. Choudhary's attire too is quite similar. He too sports a long, white moustache, covers his head with a red turban, and looks the same age as 'Dadaji'. However, the two have no links, barring their identical appearances. Perhaps, in a parallel universe, they might have been the same person.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chacha-choudhary-and-mdh-dadaji-not-quite-the-same-922818.html

His reaction comes in view of the meeting between Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to work out a solution to the farmers protest against the Centre's agri-marketing laws. "Accepting anything less than a complete repeal of the three black agriculture laws would be a betrayal with India and the farmers," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. As part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march, farmers have been staging protests at four busy border points of the national capital - Singhu, Noida, Ghazipur and Tikri - to press their demands for repealing the agri-marketing laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/accepting-anything-less-than-complete-repeal-of-new-farm-laws-would-be-betrayal-with-india-rahul-gandhi-922819.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said the issue was being dealt with by the Delhi High Court and there is no point in entertaining this plea in the apex court. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for IMA, said the salary for April and May was paid after the high court's intervention but no salary was paid again from June to October. The bench said the high court had already passed its order on July 29 and it is monitoring the issue.   Singh submitted that doctors are termed as frontline warriors and they have to be paid salary on time but there was no substantial hearing in the high court. He said that after the contempt application was filed in the top court, salaries for the months of June to October were paid to the doctors. Singh contended that doctors should be paid their salary on time to which the bench said that there is no doubt that salary has to be paid and Union of India has already passed an order in this regard.   On July 29, the Delhi High Court had told the AAP government to release to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NrDMC) the funds it requires to pay the stipends of the resident doctors in the six hospitals run by the civic body. The high court had asked the Delhi government to release within 15 days an amount of Rs 8 crore, as was done by it earlier, to NrDMC without waiting for completion of paperwork so that the resident doctors can be paid. It had observed that the resident doctors do not get a regular salary and instead they are only given stipends or emoluments which ought not to be denied to them. It had made it clear that the amount being released was meant solely for the purpose of paying the stipends or emoluments of the resident doctors in the six hospitals of NrDMC. It had also directed the corporation to complete all the paperwork in relation to the Rs 8 crore that would be released by the Delhi government and warned that failure to complete the formalities would lead to action against the officials concerned. The high court order had come while hearing a PIL initiated by it based on news reports that doctors of Kasturba Gandhi Hospital have threatened to resign as they have not been paid salaries since March this year. The news reports have also stated that recently the doctors of North MCD-run Hindu Rao hospital had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over non-payment of their salaries for the months of March, April and May. In its status report, filed in response to the plea, the corporation has said that salaries up to May of all resident doctors in hospitals run by the civic body have been paid. The corporation has also said in its report that the salary upto April of all of its regular doctors have also been paid.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-imas-contempt-plea-over-non-payment-of-salaries-to-doctors-922822.html

However, the Karnataka government is yet to take a call on the request by the Council.  In a statement released to the media, CISCE said allowing partial reopening of schools will help students physically attend the classes and utilise the time for practical work, SUPW work, project work and for getting doubts cleared by the teachers.  The Council said, if allowed to open, the schools will adhere to the Covid-19 safety guidelines issued by the governments and adopt SOPs of the respective state health departments.  This apart, CISCE has sought details on any possible election dates from the Election Commission, to schedule the annual examinations for classes 10 and 12 of the ICSE board, for 2021.   Commenting on the ISCE board's request, an official from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education told DH that even the state technical advisory committee had recommended partial reopening of schools. "But the committee has also cautioned about the possible second wave of Covid in January-February," the officer said.  However, the department said that a decision will be taken towards the end of December. "A high-level meeting presided over by the CM towards the end of this month will decide on the reopening of schools. We (the government) are also keen on resuming classes for classes 10 and 12 of all the boards in January. However, everything is subject to CM's approval," the officer explained.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/allow-partial-schools-reopening-from-january-for-class-10-12-cisce-writes-to-all-cms-922831.html

Special NIA court judge P R Sitre had earlier directed all the accused in the case, including BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, to remain present in the court on Thursday. However, Pragya Thakur, Ramesh Upadhayay, Sudhakar Diwedi and Sudhakar Chaturvedi did not appear in the court. Thakur had appeared before the court in June last year after it ordered the seven accused to remain present once a week. She later sought exemption from appearance on various occasions since then. Lt Col Purohit, Sameer Kulkarni and Ajay Rahikar were present before the judge on Thursday. The lawyers of the other four accused told the court that their clients were absent due to the Covid-19 situation. The court then directed all the accused to be present before it on December 19. It said the trial in the case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), will resume from Friday. Six people were killed and over 100 others injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town about 200 km from Mumbai in north Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008. The court had framed terror charges against Purohit, Thakur and five other accused in October 2018. The trial in the case could not proceed since March this year as normal functioning of the courts was hampered due to the Covid-19 situation. Responding to a plea seeking day-to-day trial in the case, the probe agency had earlier told the court that it was making all efforts to expedite the case. The trial in the case was also delayed due to retirement of the previous judge V S Padalkar, it had said. As per the NIA, around 140 witnesses out of 400 have been already been examined in the case. Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court on Thursday clarified that it has not stayed the trial in the Malegaon blast case, and said the trial must go on. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing a plea filed by Lt Col Prasad Purohit, seeking that charges against him be quashed. Purohit's lawyer sought adjournment on the ground that senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi was not available on Thursday. The court then adjourned the matter till December 14. The bench sought to know at what stage is the trial before the special NIA court. NIA's advocate Sandesh Patil told the HC that the trial will commence on a day-to-day basis from Thursday and the accused persons and some witnesses have been summoned. "We have never said that the trial is stayed. The trial must continue," Justice Shinde said. The court noted that there are 400 prosecution witnesses, of whom only 140 have been examined so far. Purohit, in his plea filed in September this year, sought that charges against him be quashed, since the NIA had failed to get a prior sanction under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 197. Section 197 of the CrPC lays down the procedure for prosecution of public servants and mandates that a prior sanction be sought from the government. Purohit said in the absence of prior sanction, the trial court couldn't have taken cognisance of the charges. As per the plea, Purohit was working for the Indian Army's military intelligence unit and had attended the alleged conspiracy meetings before the blast as part of "discharging his duties". The NIA had opposed the plea, saying Purohit attended the meetings in his personal capacity and not as part of discharging his duties. Purohit, who was arrested in 2009, was reinstated in the Army in 2017 after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court. The accused in the case have been charged under Sections 16 (committing terrorist act) and 18 (conspiring to commit terrorist act) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). They have also been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 153 (a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups), and relevant provisions of the Explosive Substances Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/malegaon-blast-case-bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-fails-to-appear-in-court-922840.html
03-12-2020||National||India-Bangladesh border talks to be held outside Delhi for first time||India and Bangladesh are expected to hold their Director General-level border talks in Guwahati later this month, the first time the biannual meeting will be held outside Delhi, official sources said. The 51st edition of these high-level talks will be held between the Border Security Force (BSF) and its counterpart Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) beginning December 22. Discussions on curbing a variety of border crimes and enhancing cooperation between the two countries are expected to be held for four days. Assam's capital is the base for BSF's Guwahati frontier headquarters whose troops guard 495 km of the 4,096 km-long India-Bangladesh border that runs along the state and some parts of West Bengal. A special BSF water wing that keeps vigil along the riverine border areas including Dhubri in Assam is under the command of this frontier of the border force. This is the first time since these biannual talks began in 1993 that they are being held outside Delhi, the sources said. The meeting being held near the border may also give an opportunity for the brass of the two sides to jointly visit some border areas in Assam, they said, stating the reason behind moving the talks outside Delhi. The Director General-level talks were held annually between 1975 and 1992 but they were made biannual in 1993 with either side alternatively travelling to the national capitals of New Delhi and Dhaka. A delegation led by BSF Director General Rakesh Asthana had visited Dhaka for these talks in September. Asthana will lead the talks again with his BGB counterpart Maj Gen Shafeenul Islam, the sources said. The current relations between the two countries and the forces are very good and both sides will take them forward during these talks, officials said. While the Indian side is expected to take up the issue of joint border security management, fencing of unfenced areas and undertaking effective steps to curb cross-border crimes, the Bangladeshi border force is expected to take up issues related to the killing of its people along the front. During the last meeting, Asthana had said the killing of criminals along the front will be "made to reduce significantly" even as he reiterated that his troops only fire when their lives are endangered by cross-border miscreants. He had said death or apprehension of criminals on the border was "irrespective of nationalities". "BSF personnel fire with non-lethal weapon only in self-defence when they are surrounded by a large number of miscreants armed with dah (cleaver-shaped knife), sticks, etc., and their lives are endangered," he was quoted as saying by a BSF spokesperson. The two sides are also expected to firm up new standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of the crossing over of a "significant" number of mentally challenged Indian nationals to Bangladesh, a plan mooted by the BSF chief. The two forces, after the Dhaka talks in September, had also decided to "share real-time information" with each other expeditiously through formal or informal channels regarding smuggling of narcotics and human trafficking. It was also decided to share information regarding fake Indian currency notes, cattle, arms, ammunition, explosives, anti-social elements, activities of Indian Insurgent Groups and breach or damage of the border fence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-bangladesh-border-talks-to-be-held-outside-delhi-for-first-time-922843.html

The question of the boundary along the LAC is complicated and has been under negotiation for many years. He added that bilateral ties, which are built on the predicament of mutual peace along the LAC, were disturbed by China, adding a hurdle to the relationship between the two countries. “We have bilateral agreements that commit both countries not to amassing a large number of forces along the LAC. Without credibly explaining why the Chinese have chosen to violate that compact. Our bilateral ties have been very much predicated on peace and tranquillity along the LAC. If that is disturbed, as has been the case this year, the rest of the relationship cannot be unaffected,” Jaishankar said. The External Affairs minister added that India balances its global relationships while approaching China bilaterally, whereas the Chinese are more affected by third parties whether in Asia or otherwise. On the issue of ties with Pakistan, Jaishankar made it clear that India has been making efforts from the start, with the Pakistani Prime Minister being invited to the swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting the neighbor. “The ball is very much in Pakistan’s court because they have to make up their mind on what they are going to do on the issue of cross border terrorism,” he said. Jaishankar also did not find it challenging to defend some of India’s domestic policy decisions that were highly contentious in the past two years, like Article 370, the Citizenship Amendment Act and India’s exit from RCEP. "These changes make perfect sense," he said. He claims they have brought with them a “much more grounded India, a much less elitist India” and steps have been taken to strengthen the country’s economic interests. As the US readies for the incoming Joe Biden presidency, Jaishankar is certain there will be some continuity in the policies and some change. With Biden on the helm, there are sure to be changes in the modality of dealing with other countries but India has no reason to worry, he believes. “There are no very sharply different policy views so I am reasonably confident that we will pick up and carry on,” he said. Defending India against China’s rising trade, investment and infrastructure in the South Asian region, Jaishankar said that India is also progressing on many parameters. He added that we have to be competitive and keep abreast of the global landscape with respect to education, trade and institutional linkages among other things.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/negotiations-with-china-could-take-years-s-jaishankar-922849.html

Jhilmili (Bhaiya Thana) in Chhattisgarh, Sanguem in Goa, Kalighat in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kanth (Moradabad) in Uttar Pradesh, Khanvel in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Jammikunta Town in Telangana's Karimnagar district were also in the top-ten police stations in that, the MHA said. The government selects best performing police stations across the country every year, to incentivize more effective functioning of police stations and bring healthy competition among them, a statement said. The MHA had started giving awards to best police stations following a suggestion from Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the Directors General of Police during the 2015 Conference in Gujarat's Kutch. Modi had then said that parameters should be laid down for grading police stations and assessing their performance based on feedback. The statement said this year's survey for best police stations was conducted under challenging circumstances due to Covid-19 and it was difficult to access police stations located in remote areas due to various restrictions on movement. Home Minister Amit Shah has said that a vast majority of police stations short-listed from the thousands of police stations in the country were located in small towns and rural areas. "This is also true for those police stations which have been ranked among the top 10. This indicates that while the availability of resources is important, more important is the dedication and sincerity of our police personnel to prevent and control crime and serve the nation," Shah was quoted as saying in the statement. The objective was to rank the top 10 out of 16,671 police stations in the country through data analysis, direct observation and public feedback. The ranking process commenced with shortlisting of the best-performing police stations in each state on the basis of addressing property offence, crime against women, crime against weaker sections, missing persons, unidentified found persons and unidentified dead bodies. Following this, 75 police stations were shortlisted from which 10 police stations were chosen on the basis of 19 parameters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nongpok-sekmai-in-manipur-chosen-as-countrys-best-police-station-922871.html

This comes on a day when HDFC Bank announced that the RBI has temporarily barred it from launching new digital banking initiatives or issuing new credit cards in view of service outages over the last two years. In a message to its customers, SBI said the YONO app has been impacted due to a system outage. Steps are being taken for restoration of uninterrupted service, it added. The lender requested customers to use net banking and the YONO Lite application for their banking needs. "We request our esteemed customers to bear with us as we work towards restoring YONO SBI app to provide for an uninterrupted banking experience," it said. The country's largest lender had to face the ire of customers earlier this week as well due to technical glitches and transaction failures. Last month too the bank's services were hit due to server issues. In a tweet on November 24, SBI had said, "We regret the inconvenience caused. There are intermittent connectivity issues with our Servers. Kindly bear with us as our team is on the job to resolve the issue at the earliest.  In the meantime, we suggest you to use our other digital channels." Meanwhile, some customers of another public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) too faced problems on Thursday while using its digital channels. "Dear customer, we regret for the inconvenience caused to you. Our Internet Banking, UPI, APP service(s) are facing glitches due to some technical difficulty. However, our team is working on the same and it will be resolved soon," PNB said in a message to customers. According to a senior official of PNB, the bank recently completed IT integration of all branches of erstwhile Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with itself, leading to some technical issues which are being addressed. Usually, system upgradation or integration causes some initial hiccups, the official said, adding the problem was very limited.

Addressing the UN General Assembly session on 'Culture of Peace' on Wednesday, First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma said that in today's world, intolerance, hatred, violence and terrorism have almost become the norm. There can be no doubt that terrorism, which is a manifestation of intolerance and violence, is the antithesis of all religions and cultures, he said. "If Pakistan changes its current culture of hatred against religions in India and stops its support of cross-border terrorism against our people, we can attempt a genuine culture of peace in South Asia and beyond," Sharma said. "Till then we will only be mute witness to Pakistan driving away their minorities by threat, coercion, conversion and killing. Even people of the same religion are not spared due to encouragement given to sectarian killing,” he said, referring to the reports of atrocities against religious minorities in the neighbouring country. He said India was troubled by the increase in resources, financial and otherwise, that are being made available to violent and terrorist groups that misuse religion to justify and propagate their agendas. "We need to be clear that abetting or condoning terrorism is like feeding a monster that will turn around to consume us,” he said. India called on the UN member states to fight such negative forces together, rather than separately. “Let us build a culture of peace together, rather than fail separately,” Sharma said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-must-stop-supporting-terrorism-to-promote-cultural-peace-in-south-asia-india-922886.html
03-12-2020||National||China plays down its plan of creating dam over Brahmaputra river, says will have good communication with India||China on Thursday played down its plan to build a major dam in the lower reaches of the Brahmaputra river in Tibet, saying there is no need to have "any anxiety” over the project and Beijing will continue to have "good communication" with lower riparian states - India and Bangladesh. China’s plan to build the dam over Brahmaputra river, reportedly at Medog in Tibet, which borders Arunachal Pradesh, was disclosed by Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China, at a conference recently. The over 3,800-km-long Brahmaputra, one of the longest rivers in the world passes through China, India and Bangladesh and has several tributaries and sub-tributaries. Yan said China will "implement hydropower exploitation in the downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo River (the Tibetan name for Brahmaputra) and the project could serve to maintain water resources and domestic security”, the Global Times reported on Sunday. Asked about China’s plans to build the dam over the river near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) near Arunachal Pradesh where the Brahmaputra enters India, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing on Thursday that the "hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right. When it comes to use and development of cross border rivers, China always acts responsibly." "We have a policy featuring development and conservation and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment giving full consideration to impact downstream and accommodating the interests of upstream and downstream regions," Hua said. "The development of lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo is in the early stages of planning and assessment. There is no need to read too much into that," she said. As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas. "For a long time, China, India and Bangladesh have had good cooperation in sharing hydrological information, flood and disaster reduction and contingency management. We will continue communication through existing channels," the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said. Asked whether China will discuss the future course of action with India and Bangladesh, she said, "actually, for a long time the three countries - China, India and Bangladesh - have been in close communication on sharing hydrological information, flood prevention and disaster reduction and contingency management." "Going forward China, India, Bangladesh and other concerned countries will continue to have good communication. There is no need for any anxiety on this matter," she said. India and China established Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) in 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers. Under existing bilateral Memorandums of Understanding, China provides hydrological information of Brahmaputra River and Sutlej River to India during the flood seasons. Under the arrangement, China provides flood season data of the Brahmaputra river between May 15 and October 15 every year. The report raised concerns in India as China has already operationalised the USD 1.5 billion Zam Hydropower Station, the largest in Tibet in 2015. The dams in Tibet are a cause of concern for India as besides controlling the flow of the water, they could release large volumes of water in times of war. Yan said the project was clearly put forward in the proposals for formulating the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and its long-term goals through 2035 made by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC). The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) was adopted by Plenum - a key policy body of the CPC in October this year. Details of the plan were expected to be released after the formal ratification by National People's Congress (NPC) early next year. "There is no parallel in history. It will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry," Yan told the conference organised to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the China Society for Hydropower. He said that the hydropower exploitation of the Yarlung Zangbo River downstream is more than a hydropower project. It is also meaningful for the environment, national security, living standards, energy and international cooperation. According to the Global Times report, the mainstream of the Yarlung Zangbo River has the richest water resources in Tibet Autonomous Region, about 80 million kilowatt hours (kWh), while the 50-kilometer section of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon has 70 million kWh that could be developed with a 2,000-meter drop, which equals more than three Gorges power stations in Hubei province. Tibet has about 200 million kWh of water resources, accounting for 30 per cent of the total in China.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-plays-down-its-plan-of-creating-dam-over-brahmaputra-river-says-will-have-good-communication-with-india-922887.html

His assertion comes amid Pfizer-BioNTech's anti-coronavirus vaccine getting emergency clearance in the UK, paving the way for mass vaccinations against the deadly novel coronavirus from as early as next week. Dr Guleria pinned his hopes on the five Covid-19 vaccine candidates which are in advanced stages of a clinical trial in India, stating they are logistically feasible for distribution in both urban and rural areas. According to sources, global pharma giant Pfizer had talks with the Indian government in late August, but since then there has been no development. During a briefing, last month, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul, who also heads the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, said that sufficient doses of the Pfizer vaccine as required for the Indian population will not be available but the government is examining the possibilities and will work out a strategy (for its procurement and distribution) in case the vaccine gets regulatory approvals.  The requirement of an extremely low temperature of -70 deg C for storing the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer poses a big challenge for its delivery in a developing nation like India, especially in its smaller towns and rural areas where maintaining such cold chain facilities would be very difficult, Guleria said. "Five vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of a clinical trial in India and no significant serious adverse effects have been seen so far. Also, they are logistically feasible for distribution in a large country like India, both in its urban and rural parts.   "Hopefully, by the end of this month or early next month, at least one of them should get emergency authorisation from the Indian drug regulator for its distribution among the Indian population," he said. The five vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting the phase-3 trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine, while the indigenously developed vaccine by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR has already started the phase-3 clinical trial.  Another indigenously-developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has also completed phase -2 clinical trial in the country.   Dr Reddy's Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Tuesday announced the start of adaptive phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India. Also, Biological E. Ltd has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aiims-director-hopeful-of-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-december-end-922906.html

Here are the top stories of December 3, 2020: The farmers from Uttar Pradesh protesting at the Delhi border points against the Centre's new farm laws on Thursday threatened to intensify their stir and called for forming a commission to look into their grievances. Expressing their full support to the protesting farmers of Punjab and Haryana, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu group) cautioned against moves to divide the farmers' protest. Karnataka Agriculture Minister B C Patil on Thursday said the farmers who commit suicide are cowards. "The farmers who commit suicide are cowards. Only a coward who can't take care of his wife and children commits suicide. When we have fallen (in the water), we have to swim and win," Patil said addressing farmers at Ponnampet in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. The minister was explaining to bamboo growers of Ponnampet how profitable the agriculture business is, but some cowards do not realise that and commit suicide. The Enforcement Directorate on Thursday conducted raids at 26 premises linked to the Popular Front of India in nine states, including those belonging to its Chairman O M Abdul Salam and Kerala chief Nasarudheen Elamarom, in connection with a money-laundering probe. The Popular Front called it a "politically motivated" action while claiming that such raids usually happen whenever the government in power comes under the pressure of popular anger and it wants to divert national attention from it through "gimmick", referring to the ongoing protest by farmers against three agriculture sector laws. Karnataka will have a law against "love jihad", and officials have been directed to gather information regarding an ordinance promulgated in Uttar Pradesh in this regard, state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Thursday. Uttar Pradesh had recently promulgated an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, which provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 50,000 under different categories. Mahashay Dharampal Gulati, the MDH owner, and CEO passed away at the age of 98, on Thursday morning. As soon as word broke of his sad demise, users took to various social media platforms to mourn his demise, and send their condolences.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-uttar-pradesh-farmers-threaten-to-intensify-protest-922929.html

The Brahmaputra river, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in China, originates from Tibet and flows into Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the Chinese side has conveyed to India on several occasions that it was only undertaking run-of-the-river hydropower projects, which do not involve diversion of the waters of the Brahmaputra. He was asked about media reports that China will build a 'super dam' on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangbo river in Tibet. "We have taken note of some media reports in this regard. Government carefully monitors all developments on the Brahmaputra river," Srivastava said. Noting that issues relating to trans-border rivers are discussed with China under the ambit of an institutionalised expert level mechanism which was established in 200 as well as through diplomatic channels, the MEA spokesperson said,"we intend to remain engaged with China on the issue of trans-border rivers to safeguard our interests." The MEA spokesperson also said that "as a lower riparian State with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream States are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas." In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry said there is no need to have "any anxiety” over the project and that China will continue to have "good communication" with lower riparian states - India and Bangladesh. On China’s plans to build the dam over the river near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) near Arunachal Pradesh where the Brahmaputra enters India, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing that the "hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right. When it comes to use and development of cross border rivers, China always acts responsibly." "We have a policy featuring development and conservation and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment giving full consideration to impact downstream and accommodating the interests of upstream and downstream regions," Hua said. "The development of lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo is in the early stages of planning and assessment. There is no need to read too much into that," she said, and added that "going forward China, India, Bangladesh and other concerned countries will continue to have good communication. There is no need for any anxiety on this matter."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-carefully-monitors-all-developments-on-brahmaputra-mea-on-chinas-plan-to-build-major-dam-922947.html

Sisodia, who is also Delhi's education minister, said while efforts were being made to provide online education as schools remain closed, providing access to these classes to students who lack internet facilities or devices continues to be a challenge. "Soon, the corona vaccine will be released around the world, and this pandemic would be a matter of history. But the loss of education that our students are facing today cannot be compensated by any vaccine. To minimise this loss, we are consistently working on solutions," Sisodia said at an event, where tablets were distributed among students of Class 11 of Delhi government schools. "Due to the closure of schools, efforts were made to provide online education in Delhi government schools. However, it continues to pose a challenge to the students who lack access to the internet or devices to study," he added. Sisodia said that due to a slowdown of economic activities, the revenue of the Delhi government has significantly reduced. "This is why we urged companies to help the students under their CSR initiatives. We are happy that Tata Power-DDL has given 1,059 tablets, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) 543 and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) 300 tablets to the schools," he said. Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in infections. The teaching learning activities have moved online during the period.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-vaccine-may-become-reality-soon-but-students-loss-of-education-cannot-be-compensated-sisodia-922959.html
03-12-2020||National||Talks between farmers' leaders and Centre conclude; next meet to be held on Dec 5||Talks between three union ministers and a representative group of thousands of agitating farmers failed to yield any resolution on Thursday, as the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of new farm laws and even refused the lunch, tea and water offered to them during almost eight-hour-long hectic parleys. On its part, the government assured the group of nearly 40 farmer leaders that all their valid concerns would be discussed and considered with an open mind, but the other side flagged several loopholes and deficiencies in the laws, which they said were passed hastily in September. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who led the government side at the fourth round of talks at Vigyan Bhawan, later told reporters that the next meeting will take place on Saturday at 2 pm which he hoped would take the matter to a decisive stage and towards a resolution. He also said there is "no ego involved" and the government has agreed to "discuss and consider with an open mind" some major points of concerns among farmers about the three new laws, including on strengthening of the APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee) mandi system, tax parity with proposed private mandis and freedom for farmers to approach higher courts for any dispute resolution.   Tomar said the government will also consider all these issues on Friday and so will the union leaders, before coming to the table again on Saturday. Asked whether the government is ready to amend the three contentious laws, Tomar said, "I am not a fortune teller. When we will meet the day after, we hope to move towards a resolution."   The government will also be open to looking into farmers' concerns related to an ordinance on stubble burning and an electricity-related law, Tomar said. He said the Narendra Modi government is committed to continuing, improving and expanding the procurement process at MSP (Minimum Support Price). "There should not be any doubt in anyone's mind. Still, if farmers have any worries on that front, we would want to assure them that the new laws do not present any threat to the MSP system," he said. The minister also assured that the government is ready to make it clearer, if required, that there is no threat of farmers losing their land to corporates. A government source said the meeting would resume on Saturday as no final outcome could be reached due to paucity of time.   Union leaders, who came out of the meeting venue shouting slogans, said the talks remained deadlocked and some of them threatened to boycott any further meetings if no solution was found at Thursday's meeting. "Discussions are over from our side. Our leaders have said they will not attend further meetings if a solution is not given today by the government," said Pratibha Shinde, AIKSCC (All India Kishan Sangharsh Coordination Committee) working group member and president of Lok Sangharsh Morcha, which represents farmers of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Another farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said the government made many proposals including on MSP and procurement system, which would be discussed among the farmer organisations on Friday, before the next meeting with the government on Saturday. AIKSCC General Secretary Hannan Mollah said the main demand of the unions remains the repeal of the three Acts and the government also listened to the 8-10 specific deficiencies pointed out by the farmer leaders. "We do not want any amendment. We want the Acts to be repealed," he said. Mollah said all farmer organisations would meet on Friday at 11 am to take a collective call for the next round of talks with the government. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ambarta) President Rishipal said, "The government noted all points. Ministers assured that they will look into them and sought one day's time." However, the farmers' unions stuck to their demand of repealing all three farm laws, else they will intensity the protest, he said. The government gave a detailed presentation on the three laws and asserted its intent towards the welfare of the farmers. However, union leaders rejected the government's position. Besides Tomar, the government side included Railways, Food and Consumer Affairs, and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal; and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is also an MP from Punjab. The 40 farmer leaders present at the meeting refused the lunch offered by the government and preferred to eat the food ferried in a van from the Singhu border, where thousands of their colleagues are sitting in protest against the new agri laws. They also did not accept tea and water offered to them during the meeting, which began around mid-day. The previous round of talks had taken place on December 1, but had ended in a stalemate even after three hours of discussion as farmers' groups rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into their issues. The government had rejected the demand for repealing the laws and asked the farmers' bodies to identify specific issues related to the newly enacted Acts and submit those by December 2 for consideration and discussion on Thursday. Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. On Wednesday, agitating farmers had demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the new farm laws. During their marathon meeting on Thursday, farmers' leaders also told the government to focus on resolving the issues instead of trying to be a good host by offering lunch at the meeting when their fellow farmers were sitting on roads. Thousands of farmers have been camping at various borders of the national capital for eight days as part of their protest against the laws. But protests have been continuing for much longer in other parts, especially in Punjab. While the first two rounds of talks were with representatives of Punjab farmers, the third round saw participation from Haryana and two nationwide organisations also. The fourth round included representation from more states including Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. After the meeting, Tomar said, "Discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere where the union leaders presented their side and the government also gave its views. A few major points of concern among farmers have emerged after the four rounds of talks." Asserting that the government is fully committed to farmers' welfare and will remain so, Tomar said, "There is no ego involved on the government's side and we have been discussing each and every issue with the farmer unions with an open mind." He said farmers and their unions are worried that the new laws will end the APMC system. "The government will consider ways to strengthen the APMC framework and make it of greater use. As far as new Acts are concerned, there are provisions for private mandis outside the purview of the APMC. Those private mandis would be set up and we will discuss how there could be a tax parity between these private ones and those set up under the APMC Act," he said. We will also ensure that all traders are registered for operating outside the APMC mandi system, the minister said. "The new Acts also have a provision that any dispute will go to SDM (Sub-Divisional Magistrate) court, but the unions want freedom for going to higher courts. The government has also agreed to discuss and consider this point with an open mind, as unions stressed a lot on this issue," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/talks-between-farmers-leaders-and-centre-conclude-next-meet-to-be-held-on-dec-5-922962.html
03-12-2020||National||SC grants anticipatory bail to former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh in 1991 murder case||The Supreme Court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to ex Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in a case related to alleged abduction and murder of a junior engineer Balwant Singh Multani in 1991, saying the FIR was filed after 29 years after the incident. "Many a time, the delay may not be fatal to the criminal proceedings. However, it always depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, at the same time, a long delay like 29 years as in the present case can certainly be a valid consideration for the grant of anticipatory bail," a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said. The court ordered in case of arrest, Saini would be granted bail on a personal bond of Rs one lakh and two sureties of the same amount. The bench said the appellant has made out a case for anticipatory bail, as he has retired in 2018 as Director General of Police, Punjab after 30 years of service and the alleged incident is of 1991. The court also pointed out in the present FIR, initially there was no allegation for the murder and there were allegations only for abduction and destruction of evidence among others. Subsequently, the offence under Section 302 (murder) IPC has been added on the basis of the statements of Jagir Singh and Kuldip Singh approvers only. Saini said that the FIR was registered against him this year in a mala fide manner, as now he is a retired person.  He further alleged that the Punjab government was after him because he had filed two charge sheets, naming current Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh as the accused. Saini, a 1982-batch IPS officer, who was the youngest DGP in the country, was booked along with six others on May 6 this year at Mataur police station in Mohali for the alleged kidnapping of Multani, wrongful confinement, among other charges in 1991. In August, the murder charge was added to the FIR, after two co-accused had turned approvers. In their statement, they claimed to be witnesses to the torture meted out to Multani, under the custody of former DGP Saini, who was then the SSP of Chandigarh. Multani worked with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (Citco) and was picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini, who was injured in the attack and three policemen were killed. A plea by Saini was quashing the FIR is pending separately before the top court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-singh-in-1991-murder-case-922969.html

It also said that ban on bureaucrats for life in case of conviction cannot be equated with a similar restriction on convicted lawmakers, as MPs and MLAs are not governed by any service condition. They, instead, are bound by an oath of office. "There are no specific service conditions laid down in respect of elected representatives albeit, the fact that the people’s representatives are public servants. The elected representatives are ordinarily bound by the oath that they have taken, to serve the citizens of their constituency in particular and the country in general," the Law Ministry said. The Centre said public servants are debarred from service for a lifetime if convicted of an offence punishable under provisions of various laws, but a convicted legislator is disqualified only for a period of six years as specified in the Representation of People Act. The lawmakers' conduct is bound by propriety, good conscience and they are expected to generally work in the interest of the nation; and they are not above the law, they said. The government's response came on a plea by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay who sought an amendment to his PIL. He asked the court to issue a direction to the Centre to debar convicted persons uniformly from the legislature, executive and judiciary for life in the spirit of Article 14 read with Article 15 and 16 of the Constitution. The Centre also pointed out that a five-judge Constitution bench had in the case of Public Interest Foundation (2019) said that criminalisation in politics was a bitter manifest truth but it cannot make the law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-opposes-life-ban-on-convicted-lawmakers-922974.html
03-12-2020||National||Pakistan trying to link Jadhav matter with another Indian's case, says MEA||A lawyer appointed by India in Pakistan was forced to exceed his brief in an apparent attempt to link another case with that of the former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav at a court in the neighbouring country. New Delhi on Thursday alleged that Imran Khan’s government forced the lawyer Shahnawaz Noon to present before the Islamabad High Court that India’s acting envoy to Pakistan, Gaurav Ahluwalia, would like to appear before the court and explain the position of the Government of India in connection to the hearing on Kulbhushan Jadhav’s plea for review of the death sentence awarded to him in April 2017. But Noon was not appointed to represent Kulbhushan Jadhav or the Government of India in the case involving the former Indian Navy officer. The High Commission of India in Islamabad in fact appointed him to represent Mohammad Ismail, another citizen of India incarcerated in Pakistan. Ismail completed his sentence but continues to be in jail in Pakistan. The High Commission of India in the neighbouring country’s capital appointed Noon to appear in the case for release and repatriation of Ismail, Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said in New Delhi. But the attorney general of the Pakistan government referred to the case of Jadhav during the hearing on the plea for release and repatriation of Ismail. Noon then told the court that Ahluwalia would like to appear before it and explain the position of the Government of India in connection with the plea on review of the death sentence awarded to Jadhav. Srivastava said that Noon made the statement in the court without the authorization of the High Commission of India in Islamabad. “He appears to have acted under pressure from the Pakistani establishment to make such statements for which he has no authorisation. He has misrepresented the position of the High Commission. He was clearly told by the High Commission that he had no authority to represent either the Government of India or Kulbhushan Jadhav,” the MEA spokesperson said in New Delhi. Jadhav has been in the custody of the Pakistan Army at least since March 2016. He was accused and convicted of being involved in espionage and sabotage in Pakistan on behalf of an external intelligence agency of India. A military tribunal awarded him a death sentence in April 2017. New Delhi moved the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which on July 17, 2019, concluded that Islamabad had violated Article 36 of the Vienna Convention of Consular Relations 1963, and the death sentence awarded to Jadhav would remain suspended till the review of the conviction. To implement the ICJ judgment, Pakistan on May 20 last promulgated an ordinance called the “International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020”, which mandated that a petition for review and reconsideration of conviction by a military tribunal could be made to Islamabad High Court through an application within 60 days from the day it was brought into force. New Delhi recently alleged that Khan’s government in Islamabad not only failed to provide the High Commission of India in the capital of Pakistan “unimpeded” consular access to Jadhav but also declined to hand over the copies of the documents related to the case to a lawyer in the neighbouring country after he was appointed by the Government of India to seek review of conviction and sentencing of Jadhav in the High Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-trying-to-link-jadhav-matter-with-another-indians-case-says-mea-922979.html

"There is no such issue as Kashmir issue and Jammu & Kashmir is as similar and as much a part of India as any other state or Union Territory," he said. Referring to a resolution of Parliament passed in 1994 wherein it was unanimously accepted by all parties that Pakistan has to vacate the areas of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, the minister said these areas continue to remain under illegal occupation of the neighbouring country even after so many years. “India stands committed to retrieving Pakistan occupied Jammu & Kashmir and that is the only issue outstanding between India and Pakistan,” he told PTI. Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, addressed a series of public meetings during the District Development Council (DDC) election campaign along the International Border (IB) in Khour, Pargwal and other areas in Jammu district. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it possible to take decisions like abrogation of Article 370 and holding of DDC elections which were earlier considered impossible. "Similarly, this task of retrieving PoJK will also be accomplished by the Modi government," the minister said. Singh claimed the people of PoJK have been for a long time deprived of the benefits of democracy, and it is the government's commitment to them that it will make them a beneficiary of India's democratic system with grassroots empowerment. It is during the Modi government, said Singh, that two years back 4 per cent reservation was provided to the residents of IB on the same lines as to those living along the Line of Control (LoC). He accused the earlier governments of playing vote bank politics and giving reservation to LoC areas "because they were getting their MLAs and ministers elected from those areas" but denied the same benefit to the children living in the adjacent part of the border because they did not constitute their vote bank. “The Modi government has corrected this inhuman injustice to the youth of this area,” the minister added. Singh also claimed that work of construction of bunkers and roads bridges which had been pending for the last seven decades in the border areas has been taken up only in the last 5-6 years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-committed-to-retrieving-pojk-union-minister-jitendra-singh-922983.html
03-12-2020||National||India slams UN for failing to acknowledge 'growing hatred' against Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism||India has questioned the “selectivity” practised by the United Nations, alleging that the international organization has failed to acknowledge the rise in hatred and violence against Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism although it had been condemning attacks against Christianity, Judaism and Islam. India stated that it firmly condemned “anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anti-Christian acts”. “However, (the) UN resolutions on such important issues speak only of these three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam and Christianity) together. This august body (UN General Assembly) fails to acknowledge the rise of hatred and violence against Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism also,” Ashish Sharma, First Secretary of the Permanent Mission of India to the UN in New York, said. Sharma, who joined the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) in 2009, was delivering the statement on behalf of the Government of India at a conclave on “Culture of Peace” at the UNGA in New York on Wednesday. “Why is this selectivity? Overall, Hinduism has more than 1.2 billion, Buddhism has more 535 million, and Sikhism around 30 million followers. It is time that attacks against these religions are also added to the earlier list of the three Abrahamic religions when such resolutions are passed (by the UN),” he said, adding that the culture of peace cannot be only for Abrahamic religions. "As long as such selectivity exists, the world can never truly foster a culture of peace,” Sharma said. New Delhi cited the example of the demolition of the 6th century Buddha statues in Bamiyan in Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2001. It also referred to the killing of Sikhs in an attack on a Gurdwara in Kabul on March 26 this year as well as the “destruction of Hindu and Buddhist temples and minority cleansing” in some countries. “The United Nations is not a body which should take sides when it comes to religion. If we are indeed selective, we will only end up proving Samuel Huntington’s ‘clash of civilizations’. What we are trying to build here is an ‘alliance of civilizations’, not set up a clash,” said the young diplomat representing India. New Delhi also slammed Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), with regard to that the Imran Khan government's recent decision to transfer the management and administrative control of the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib --  the final resting place of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak. The management and maintenance of the Gurdwara were handed over from the Pakistan Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee (PSGPC), a body run by the minority Sikh community, to the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, a non-Sikh body. India alleged that Pakistan had already violated the resolution on Culture of Peace passed last year by the UNGA, by arbitrarily transferring the management of the holy shrine from a Sikh community body to the administrative control of a non-Sikh body. “This act goes against the Sikh religion and its preservation and protection. You will recall that this holy Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara finds mention in that earlier resolution. That resolution stands violated by Pakistan,” Sharma said at the UN General Assembly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-slams-un-for-failing-to-acknowledge-growing-hatred-against-hinduism-sikhism-buddhism-922993.html

Nadda would assess the party's plans and preparations on December 8 and 9 in Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas districts, a state BJP leader said on Thursday. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh had last month said that Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Nadda would be visiting the state every month till the Assembly elections are over. Nadda had paid a day-long visit to north Bengal in October, while Shah was in the state for two days in November. After having a limited presence in the politically polarised Bengal for decades, the BJP emerged as the main rival of the ruling TMC in the 2019 general election, winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. With the saffron party growing from strength to strength in the state over the last few years, its leaders are upbeat that the party will be able to end Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's 10-year rule. Elections to the 294-member state Assembly are likely in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/j-p-nadda-to-be-in-west-bengal-for-two-days-from-december-8-922997.html
03-12-2020||National||SC upholds GST on lotteries, betting, gambling||The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the provisions under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 empowering the authorities to put a levy on lotteries, betting, and gambling.  “When 2017 Act defines the goods to include actionable claims and included only three categories of actionable claims, i.e, lottery, betting and gambling for purposes of levy of GST, it cannot be said that there was no rationale for including these three actionable claims for tax purposes," a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy, and M R Shah said. The bench noted that lottery, betting, and gambling are well-known concepts. Those have been in practice in this country since before independence and were regulated and taxed by different legislations.  “When the Parliament has included the three for purpose of imposing GST and not taxed other actionable claims, it cannot be said that there is no rationale or reason for taxing above three and leaving others," the bench added. The court dismissed a plea by Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd, an authorised agent for the sale and distribution of lotteries organised by the Punjab government, against the imposition of the GST.  "The inclusion of actionable claim in definition ''goods'' as given in …CGST Act is not contrary to the legal meaning of goods and is neither illegal nor unconstitutional,” the bench held. The company sought a declaration that the levy of tax on the lottery was discriminatory and violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 301, and 304 of the Constitution.  The bench did not agree with the company's contention that the inclusion of “actionable claim” in the definition of goods in Section 2(52) of the CGST Act was contrary to the legal meaning of goods.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-upholds-gst-on-lotteries-betting-gambling-922998.html

In the north, the weatherman said rain and snowfall are likely to occur in the mid and high hills of Himachal Pradesh starting December 4 as well as at isolated places in Kashmir. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the storm is all set to cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban and Kanyakumari. Union Home Minister Amit Shah also spoke to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his counterpart in Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan and asserted that the Narendra Modi government is committed to providing all possible help to the people of both the states in the wake of the cyclone. Vijayan also held a review meeting with officials even as the IMD said 'Burevi' may make its landfall in Kerala on December 4, and issued a red alert and cyclone warning for south Tamilnadu and south Kerala coasts. In Delhi, the minimum temperature settled at 8.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday and the maximum was 27.2 degrees Celsius. The city's air quality remained "very poor" and it is likely to remain so for the next two days. The air quality index (AQI) of the national capital was recorded at 342 at 9 am. Further north, most places in Kashmir registered sub-zero temperatures with Pahalgam being the coldest recorded place in the valley at a low of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius. Shopian district recorded a low of minus 3.4 degrees Celsius while Gulmarg in north Kashmir recorded a minimum temperature of minus 2.5 degrees Celsius. The mercury in Srinagar, which had recorded a minimum temperature of minus 2.2 degrees Celsius last Friday, settled at a low of minus 1.4 degrees Celsius. The weatherman also predicted rain and snowfall in the mid and high hills of Himachal Pradesh starting December 4. However, the weather in plains and low hills will remain dry till December 9. Rain and snowfall are also likely to occur at isolated places in high hills as well on Friday and from December 7 to 9, and in mid-hills from December 7 to 9 of the state.

Muzaffarnagar was the coldest place in Uttar Pradesh with a low of 6.6 degrees Celsius as the weather remained dry over the state with shallow to moderate fog being recorded at isolated places with no change in day temperatures. In the south, heavy rains lashed several parts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry starting from last night with cyclonic storm 'Burevi' all set to cross the state's south coast between Pamban and Kanyakumari, the IMD said. Under the influence of the weather system, regions, including those falling under the Cauvery delta zone like Kodavasal in Tiruvarur district, Nagapattinam, Vedaranyam, Karaikal, Tiruthuraipoondi, and Mudukulatur in Ramanathapuram received rainfall between nine cm and a maximum of 20 cm since last night and till this morning. Normal life was also disrupted in Puducherry as torrential downpour influenced by the storm pounded several parts of the union territory. PWD sources told PTI that during last twenty four hours ending 8.30 am. Puducherry and its suburbs recorded 7.6 cm rainfall. During a telephonic conversation, Union Home Minister Amit Shah conveyed to Palaniswami and Vijayan that the Narendra Modi government is committed to providing all possible help to the people of both the states in the wake of cyclone Burevi's impending landfall. Shah said several teams of NDRF are already deployed in both the states. Vijayan also held a high-level meeting as the IMD said Burevi may make its landfall in Kerala on December 4.

On the issue of Rahul Gandhi’s criticism by former US President Barack Obama in his memoir ‘A Promised Land’, he said: “There is no need to accept everybody’s view…I do not comment on the performance of heads of foreign countries.” The 79-year-old Pawar, a four-time Maharashtra Chief Minister and two-time Union Minister, also reiterated that while his daughter and Baramati MP Supriya Sule would be in national politics, his nephew and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar would be involved with state affairs. Asked whether Supriya Sule would be the first woman Chief Minister, Pawar said: “Supriya has received many awards at the national level. She likes to work at the national level…everyone has some passion, she is interested in work at the national level.” On Maharashtra, he said: “There are several leaders… Ajit Pawar, (state NCP President and Water Resources Minister) Jayant Patil and (Social Justice Minister) Dhananjay Munde.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-lacks-consistency-sharad-pawar-on-his-leadership-skills-923019.html

Airpower at sea is required here and now. If you have an aspiration to become a $ 5 trillion economy and have one-fifth of the world’s population you would have to go outward and seek the world. For that airpower is required at a longer range and is absolutely necessary,” Admiral Singh said ahead of Navy Day. Indian Navy currently functions with a solitary carrier INS Vikramaditya whereas a second aircraft carrier – an indigenous ship that would be named INS Vikrant post-induction – is undergoing trials. “We have not yet gone to the government (seeking approval and funds) for the third carrier as we first want to get certain parameters right. But we don’t want to be a Navy tethered to the shore,” he said. The assertion from the Navy Chief comes months after reports quoting unnamed sources with the government that the Centre wasn’t keen on having a third aircraft carrier because future battles were thought to be land-centric. For its carriers, the navy plans to buy 57 multi-role carrier-borne fighters in order to replace the existing MiG-29K fleet that flies from the decks of INS Vikramaditya and will also take off from INS Vikrant. But the Russian-origin combat platform met with three accidents in the last one year. A second option has been provided by Defence Research and Development Organisation and Aeronautical Development Agency that have offered to develop a twin-engine deck based fighter aircraft on the basis of the lessons gleaned from the LCA Navy project. This, Admiral Singh hoped, could enter the service by 2030.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/third-aircraft-carrier-is-absolutely-necessary-indian-navy-chief-karambir-singh-923021.html

The government side, led by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, assured the group of nearly 40 farmer leaders that all their valid concerns would be discussed and considered with an open mind, but the other side stuck to their demand of repealing the three "hastily-passed" farm laws, saying there were several loopholes and deficiencies. After the eight-hour-long meeting, Tomar said the government will consider all issues on Friday and so will the union leaders, before coming to the table again on Saturday. Asked whether the government is ready to amend the three contentious laws, he said, "I am not a fortune teller. When we will meet the day after, we hope to move towards a resolution." "There should not be any doubt in anyone's mind. Still, if farmers have any worries on that front, we would want to assure them that the new laws do not present any threat to the MSP system," he said. Meanwhile, Akali Dal stalwart and former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal returned his Padma Vibhushan award in protest against the Centre's new farm laws. Dissident Akali leader and Rajya Sabha member Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa also said he will return the Padma Bhushan conferred on him last year. Earlier, some former Punjab sportsmen too have threatened to return their awards. Badal's move follows over two months after his Shiromani Akali Dal pulled out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre, protesting against the three laws which deregulate the sale of crops. Stepping up their stir, thousands of protesting farmers from Uttar Pradesh blocked National Highway-9 near the UP Gate, while thousands from Punjab and Haryana stayed put at other points of the national capital. The protesters had on Wednesday threatened to block other roads of Delhi in the coming days if the new agriculture laws are not scrapped soon. Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Naresh Tikait held a 'maha panchayat' at the protesting site -- Gazipur border. He said that there is no midway for settlement on the issue of MSP, adding that the government must give assurance in writing to farmers. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh made an appeal to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the protesting farmers to find an early resolution to the impasse, saying the agitation was affecting Punjab's economy and the nation's security. Singh met Shah at the latter's residence here. "I came to meet the Home Minister to reiterate our position and to make a request to him and the farmers to resolve this soon because this (agitation) affects the economy of my Punjab as well as the security of the nation," he said. Asked if he was trying to mediate between the agitating farmers and the central government, Singh said a discussion was going on between the two sides. Farmer leaders, who came out of the meeting venue shouting slogans, said the talks remained deadlocked and some of them threatened to boycott any further meetings if no solution was found at Thursday's meeting. "Discussions are over from our side. Our leaders have said they will not attend further meetings if a solution is not given today by the government," said Pratibha Shinde, AIKSCC (All India Kishan Sangharsh Coordination Committee) working group member and president of Lok Sangharsh Morcha, which represents farmers of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Another farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said the government made many proposals including on MSP and procurement system, which would be discussed among the farmer organisations on Friday, before the next meeting.   AIKSCC General Secretary Hannan Mollah said the main demand of the unions remains the repeal of the three Acts and the government also listened to the 8-10 specific deficiencies pointed out by the farmer leaders. "We do not want any amendment. We want the Acts to be repealed," he asserted. Mollah said all farmer organisations would meet on Friday at 11 am to take a collective call for the next round of talks with the government. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ambarta) President Rishipal said, "The government noted all points. Ministers assured that they will look into them and sought one day's time." However, the farmers' unions stuck to their demand of repealing all three farm laws, else they will intensity the protest, he said. Besides Tomar, the government side included Railways, Food and Consumer Affairs, and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal; and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is also an MP from Punjab. The farmer leaders present at the meeting refused the lunch offered by the government and preferred to eat the food ferried in a van from the Singhu border, where thousands of their colleagues are sitting in protest. They also did not accept tea and water offered to them during the meeting, which began around mid-day. The previous round of talks had taken place on December 1, but had ended in a stalemate even after three hours of discussion as farmers' groups rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into their issues. Farmers from several districts of western Uttar Pradesh continued their sit-in demonstration at the Chilla Border between Noida and Delhi amid heavy deployment of security personnel. The protest also led to partial closure of a key road connecting Noida and Delhi. One carriageway of the Delhi-Noida Link road - from Delhi to Noida- was open for commuters, while the other side - Noida to Delhi - remained closed, causing inconvenience to travellers. The Delhi-Haryana border at Jharoda and Jhatikra remained closed for traffic movement. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheeler traffic. However, people can travel to Haryana through Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri, NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera border points, the traffic police have said. The police also kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic for the eighth day on the trot. In Chennai, the DMK said its chief M K Stalin will lead party-sponsored demonstrations in different cities of Tamil Nadu on Saturday in support of farmers. Stalin will participate in the protest at Salem, the native district of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, according to a party release. The BJP's coalition partner JJP in Haryana demanded withdrawal of cases registered against farmers who participated in 'Delhi Chalo' march. Jannayak Janta Party leader Digvijay Singh Chautala said the cases against farmers must be withdrawn to ensure that the situation does not worsen and no mistrust is crated between farmers and the government. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-agitation-talks-fail-next-round-on-december-5-parkash-singh-badal-returns-padma-award-923024.html

A senior officer of the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, however, said no one was lathi-charged, and the demonstrators, who were staging the protest near the education department headquarters, simply left the venue after being asked to do so. Members of the SFI from various city colleges assembled near Presidency University in College Street area, condemning the "assault" on hundreds of School Service Commission (SSC) candidates by the police. "We condemn the attack on candidates waiting for recruitment to upper primary schools. There were brutally lathicharged. Even the women were not spared. This is an attack on democracy by the TMC government," Debnil Paul, an SFI leader of the Presidency University, said. Around 100 SSC candidates, awaiting appointments for a long time had been holding protests outside Bikash Bhavan since Tuesday. A delegation on Wednesday met Education Minister Partha Chatterjee, who cited pending cases in court over SSC appointments as a reason for the delay. Once the court issues an order, the government will act in a prompt manner, he said. A spokesman for the agitating SSC candidates said, "We were evicted from the protest venue, next to Bikash Bhavan and right in front of Anandalok Hospital. We were protesting peacefully but lathi-wielding policemen drove us away. We will again resume our stir soon, this time more fiercely."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sfi-takes-out-rally-to-protest-lathi-charge-on-ssc-candidates-923034.html
03-12-2020||National||Farmers' protest receives support from across the nation||The unhappiness of farmers from Punjab and Haryana over farm sector reforms is now finding resonance across several states, a week after protestors knocked at the gates of the national capital. Farmers organisations from states such as Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh have come out in support of their comrades from Punjab and Haryana, where the key crops of wheat and paddy are largely purchased through markets run by Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at minimum support price fixed by the Centre. "Punjab is the biggest gainer as 95 per cent of its market arrivals of wheat and paddy are procured at MSP by state agencies on behalf of the Food Corporation of India," said Ashok Gulati, former Chairman of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. In neighbouring western Uttar Pradesh, sugarcane is the key cash crop and farmers there are mostly unaffected by the farm sector reforms as most of their produce is supplied to privately-run sugar mills. The wheat grown in the region also makes its way to private traders. “The primary cash crop of the farmers in the western and many other districts in the central Uttar Pradesh is sugarcane, which is bought directly by the private mills....the cane growers do not take their produce to the markets and hence are unaffected by the laws,” said Rakesh Tikait, President of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, which has considerable influence in western Uttar Pradesh. Tikait, however, said that hundreds of farmers from UP had joined the protests to support the farmers of Punjab and Haryana. The farmers in Punjab and Haryana had begun their protests on Sept. 24, when Parliament passed the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Their protests caught the national attention when the farmers’ organisations, under the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, marched to the national capital last Thursday demanding removal of the laws. As the farmers dug in their heels at various border points in the national capital, they have started getting support from farmers’ groups from other states. “They understood the detrimental factors in the new farm laws quickly, while our farmers are beginning to understand it now,” said Kondal Reddy, convenor, Telangana, Rythu Swarajya Vedika, an NGO operating in the farm sector. Sporadic protests were also seen in West Bengal, where the CPI(M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha, led the agitation, making attempts to win back its one time support base of farmers who shifted allegiance to the Trinamool Congress in 2011. The ruling Trinamool Congress has also decided to hit the streets with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee demanding a repeal of the farm laws. In Gujarat, farmers’ organisations are silent over the agitation as they believe that the reforms initiated by the Centre would allow them to sell their produce anywhere in the country. “At least in Gujarat, I can say that the farmers were unhappy with APMC. Whenever the farmers would directly transact with traders, the APMC inspectors would appear and would charge the traders cess,” said Sagar Rabari, President of the Khedut Ekta Manch. In Karnataka, farmers groups in different districts have begun staging demonstrations in solidarity with the farmers in Delhi. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar said that at least 10,000 to 15,000 farmers across the state would protest in front of the Vidhana Soudha on Dec. 7 when the winter session begins. Bihar, which abolished APMC markets in 2006, has not witnessed any agitation by farmers against the farm sector reforms. “First, unlike Punjab, there are a few big farmers here. Secondly, instead of commercial farming, Bihar witnesses sustenance farming. Third, there is no organised union or unity among the farmers here,” A K Singh, a Gaya-based farmer, told DH. In Kerala, the All India Kisan Sabha cadre was busy with the local body elections and hence could not participate in the agitation in Delhi. However, demonstrations against the new laws are being carried out even at the grassroot levels and it is one of the key issues that is being discussed during election campaigns. In Assam, at least 10 farmer organisations staged protests in different parts of the state on Monday demanding a rollback of the new farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-receives-support-from-across-the-nation-923037.html

Addressing media after the marathon meeting that lasted for almost eight hours, the minister said there is no threat to farmers' land from corporates and the government is ready to make it clearer, if needed. Tomar, who led the government side at the fourth round of talks at Vigyan Bhawan, said the next meeting will take place on Saturday at 2 pm which he hoped would take the matter to a decisive stage and towards a final resolution. He also appealed to the farmer bodies to end their protest, keeping in mind the cold weather. He also said there is "no ego involved" and the government has agreed to "discuss and consider with an open mind" some major points of concerns among farmers about the three new laws, including on strengthening of the APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee) mandi system, tax parity with proposed private mandis and freedom for farmers to approach higher courts for any dispute resolution. Tomar said the government will also consider all these issues on Friday and so will the union leaders, before coming to the table again on Saturday. Asked whether the government is ready to amend the three contentious laws, Tomar said, "I am not a fortune teller. When we will meet the day after, we hope to move towards a resolution." Union leaders, however, said they want nothing but repealing of the contentious laws. "The government wants amendments, but we do not want that. We told them that we want the laws to be repealed," a union leader said after attending the meeting. A statement issued on behalf of the unions said the government offered to consider some amendments to the three Central Farm Acts, but the offer was rejected. "Farmers told the government that it had only two options -- either repeal or use force on the protesting farmers to remove them." Tomar said the government will also be open to looking into farmers' concerns related to an ordinance on stubble burning and an electricity-related law. He said the Narendra Modi government is committed to continuing, improving and expanding the procurement process at MSP (Minimum Support Price). "There should not be any doubt in anyone's mind. Still, if farmers have any worries on that front, we would want to assure them that the new laws do not present any threat to the MSP system," he said. "Discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere where the union leaders presented their side and the government also gave its views. A few major points of concern among farmers have emerged after the four rounds of talks," he said. The minister said the government has always maintained that it is fully committed to farmers' welfare and will remain so. "Farmers and their unions are worried that the new laws will end the APMC system. The government will consider ways to strengthen the APMC framework and it becomes of greater use. As far as the new Acts are concerned, there are provisions for private mandis outside the purview of the APMC. Those private mandis would be set up and we will discuss how there could be a tax parity between these private ones and those set up under the APMC Act," he said. Tomar said the government will also ensure that all traders are registered for operating outside the APMC mandi system. "The new Acts also have a provision that any dispute will go to SDM court, but the unions want freedom for going to higher courts. The government has also agreed to discuss and consider this point with an open mind, as unions stressed a lot on this issue," he said. Meanwhile, government sources also shared several "success stories" of farmer producer organisations (FPOs) in agriculture and allied sector across the country after the new laws came into place. They said the creation of additional trading opportunities outside the APMC market yards will help farmers get remunerative prices due to additional competition, besides supplementing the existing APMC based trade in commodities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protests-centre-says-open-to-address-key-concerns-hopes-for-resolution-in-next-meeting-923042.html

The notice was sent by advocate Harpreet Singh Hora on behalf of the committee member Jasmain Singh Noni. The notice said that when Ranaut's premises (in Mumbai) were demolished, she used social media "to gather solidarity" from her fans, stating that the action was an attack on her fundamental rights. "Similarly, the right to peacefully protest is part of the farmers' rights under the Constitution of India and she cannot claim a right to demean and insult the farmers," the notice said. As per the notice, Kangana had shared a tweet alleging that the 'Shaheen Bagh dadi', who made international headlines during the anti-CAA protests earlier this year in the Delhi neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh, also joined the farmers' agitation over the new agri laws. The notice stated that the actor said in her tweet that the "same Dadi" who featured in Time Magazine was "available in 100 rupees". The legal notice also said that several news reports claimed that the said two women were not the same. "And even otherwise, she has no right to defame any old woman for her political mileage," it said. "This is a clear example of a hate tweet andneeds to be tackled at the earliest," the notice said. Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi's gateways to demand a repeal of the Centre's three new farm laws.

The Pentagon said that the proposed sale ensures the previously procured aircraft operates effectively to serve the needs of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the Army and the Navy transport requirements, local and international humanitarian assistance, and regional disaster relief. This sale of spares and services will enable the IAF to sustain a mission-ready status with respect to the C-130J transport. India will have no difficulty absorbing this additional sustainment support, it said. According to the Pentagon, the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be Lockheed-Martin Company, Marietta, Georgia. In a major move in 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner" intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-approves-sale-of-90-million-worth-military-equipment-services-to-india-923057.html

Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the opposition party said while he had announced that every Indian will get vaccinated against the novel contagion, the Health ministry later announced that everyone in country need not be immunized. "The Prime Minister said every Indian will get the Covid vaccine. But, the Prime Minister's statement was turned into a 'jumla' after the Health ministry said the entire country will not be inoculated," the Congress said on its official Twitter handle. "Can the Indian people get some clarity? Will they be getting a vaccine or do they have to be Atmanirbhar when it comes to surviving this deadly virus," the party asked in another tweet. The Congress accused the government of being a 'U-turn sarkar', alleging that while the Prime Minister announced that every Indian will get the Covid-19 vaccine, a few days later the Health ministry said the government never spoke about vaccinating all citizens in the country. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had on Tuesday said at a media briefing that there may not be a need to vaccinate the country's entire population against Covid-19 if a critical mass of people are given a shot to break the chain of the virus transmission. He made it clear that the government had not spoken about inoculating everyone in the country. "I just want to make this clear that the government has never spoken about vaccinating the entire country. It's important that we discuss such scientific issues based on factual information only and then analyse it," Bhushan had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/govt-making-u-turn-on-pms-assurance-that-every-citizen-will-get-covid-19-vaccine-congress-922652.html

Today when he has lost more than his honour, I see no point in holding on to the Padma Vibhushan honour,” the Shiromani Akali Dal leader said. “Parkash Badal today returned the Padma Vibhushan award in protest against the betrayal of the farmers by the Government of India and against the shocking indifference and contempt with which the government is treating the ongoing peaceful and democratic agitation of the farmers against the three farm Acts,” a SAD statement said. Badal said the farmers are waging a bitter struggle in the severe cold just to secure their fundamental right to life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/award-wapasi-again-ex-punjab-cm-parkash-singh-badal-returns-padma-vibhushan-in-protest-against-farm-laws-922797.html

Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of 35 farmers' unions at the Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital. On December 1, talks between both the sides ended in a stalemate after farmers' groups rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by farmers protesting against the new laws. The government had rejected the demand for repealing the laws and asked the farmers' bodies to identify specific issues related to the newly enacted Acts and submit those by December 2 for consideration and discussion on Thursday. Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the new farm laws as they threatened to block roads in Delhi and "take more steps" if it failed to do so.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/union-ministers-meet-farmers-groups-to-break-deadlock-922801.html

Singh also made an appeal to the farmers to find an early solution to the deadlock with the Centre as the protests are adversely impacting the state’s economy and also posed a danger to national security. “My appeal to farmers is that they just urgently find a solution to this problem. It is impacting national security and Punjab’s economy,” he told reporters after a meeting with Shah that took place as farmer leaders met a panel of Union ministers to seek redressal for their demands. “The two sides should not take rigid positions and a meeting ground must be found,” Singh said. The chief minister also urged Shah to address the concerns of the farmers quickly as an early resolution is vital for the interest of both Punjab and the country. Stressing the need to protect the MSP and continue with the APMC system, Singh urged the Union Home Minister to listen to the farmers with an open mind to resolve the standoff quickly, so that farmers from Punjab and other states, including a large number of women, can return to their homes. The chief minister and the Congress have been supporting the farmers’ stir and the Punjab Assembly had also passed a set of bills aimed at negating the Centre’s farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-meets-amit-shah-appeals-to-centre-farmers-to-resolve-impasse-soon-922812.html

Chowdhury, the Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, said thousands of farmers have been agitating on the Delhi- bound roads for over a week and the "food-givers" of the country should be given their due honour and dignity.

03-12-2020||National Politics||Sushil Modi may become the first BJP leader to represent all four Houses||With December 3 being the last day for filing nominations, and the Mahagatbandhan as well as the LJP deciding not to field any candidate for the Rajya Sabha bypoll in Bihar, the election of senior BJP leader Sushil Modi as the Rajya Sabha member now looks almost certain. But more than this achievement, Modi will be attaining one more rare feat. He will be the first BJP leader from Bihar to become a member of all the four Legislative Houses – State Assembly, Legislative Council, Lok Sabha and now the Rajya Sabha in his three-decade-long political career. Modi, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, who could not join the Nitish Kumar Cabinet this time, won his first Assembly poll in 1990 when he was elected from Kumhrar constituency in Patna. In 2004, he won the Lok Sabha election from Bhagalpur. However, soon after taking over as Bihar’s Deputy Chief Minister in November 2005, he preferred to become a member of the Legislative Council (MLC) in 2006, instead of contesting an Assembly election. On December 2, 2020, he filed his nomination papers for the sole Rajya Sabha seat, which fell vacant after the untimely demise of former Union Minister and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan. Though the Mahagatbandhan had initially proposed to back Paswan’s widow Reena Paswan for the RS seat, it backed out after Paswan’s son Chirag politely turned down the RJD offer. “Bihar wants to get rid of Sushil Modi. And we don’t want to be seen as an obstacle for the person who is all set to move to Delhi,” said RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwary. Incidentally, RJD chief Lalu Prasad was the first politician from Bihar who became a member of all the four Houses. He won the Lok Sabha poll in 1977, Bihar Assembly in 1980, Legislative Council in 1990, and Rajya Sabha in 2002. Later, another Union Minister Nagmani too achieved this feat as he was MLA from Kurtha in Bihar (1977), Rajya Sabha (1994), Janata Dal Lok Sabha MP from Chatra (1999) and MLC in 2006.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sushil-modi-may-become-the-first-bjp-leader-to-represent-all-four-houses-922852.html

Rajasthan has set an example in the management of the disease with its strong will, sensitivity, humanitarian attitude and vigilance, he said here. Gehlot was speaking to a central team that is in the state to review the Covid-19 situation. He said Covid-19 was being treated under different "protocols" in different states which was causing confusion among patients and the doctors.  The chief minister requested that the central government should take an initiative in this direction and through ICMR, prescribe a uniform medical protocol for the country. He said Rajasthan gave the 'Bhilwara model' to the country and was able to break the chain of coronavirus transmission by imposing strict measures, including enforcement of the containment zones. "We have managed to keep the death rate consistently below one per cent, along with keeping the recovery rate good. The result of this is that Rajasthan is in a better position on all parameters," Gehlot said. He also spoke about the lockdown and subsequent steps taken by the state government to control the disease. The chief minister said 60,000 tests are being conducted in Rajasthan daily and facilities are available in all districts. According to an official statement, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul appreciated the Covid-19 management in Rajasthan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/different-protocols-for-covid-19-treatment-across-country-causing-confusion-gehlot-922671.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor'||Delhi's air quality remained “very poor” on Thursday, and it is likely to remain so for the next two days. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 342 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 373 on Wednesday. It was 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The predominant wind direction will be northerly and the maximum wind speed 6 kmph on Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department. The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.   The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said air quality is likely to remain in the "very poor" category till Saturday. There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it had said earlier. The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 3,000 m2/s on Thursday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-922775.html

The high court asked Tiwari’s counsel to file legible copies of certain documents as also the physical copies of judgements relied upon by him. Justice Anu Malhotra listed the matter for further hearing on December 7. During the hearing, senior advocate Pinky Anand, representing Tiwari, argued that the summoning order of the trial court was based on legally inadmissible evidence so it was illegal. She further claimed that the trial court’s November 28, 2019 order was bad in law and it should be quashed. BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, represented through senior advocate Sonia Mathur, has also challenged the trial court’s order summoning him as an accused in the defamation complaint. Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra submitted that several documents placed by Tiwari are not legible and the leader be asked to file typed copies. The high court found the submission to be correct and asked the petitioner’s counsel to file legible copies of the documents. It also asked the high court registry to ensure that before the matter is listed for hearing, legible copies of the documents are placed on record. Both the BJP leaders have challenged the trial court’s November 28, 2019 order summoning them and others as accused in the criminal defamation case filed by Sisodia. Sisodia had filed the complaint against BJP leaders -- Members of Parliament Manoj Tiwari, Hans Raj Hans and Pravesh Verma, MLAs Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Vijender Gupta and BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana -- for allegedly making corruption charges against him in relation to Delhi government schools’ classrooms. The accused were earlier granted bail after they appeared before the trial court. The AAP leader had filed the complaint under section 200 of CrPC for commission of offences under Section 499 and 500 read with Sections 34 and 35 of the IPC for making false and defamatory statements in print, electronic and social media. Sisodia had stated that all the allegations made by the BJP leaders jointly and individually were false, defamatory and derogatory with an intention to harm and damage his reputation and goodwill. If convicted, the offence of defamation entails a maximum punishment of two years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mp-manoj-tiwari-seeks-quashing-of-summons-in-sisodia-s-defamation-plea-hc-asks-for-legible-docs-922792.html

Only one of the two carriageways on the Noida Link Road (also known as the Chilla road) was open, allowing commuters coming from Delhi to enter Uttar Pradesh via Noida, they said. The Noida Traffic Police had issued an advisory informing people about route diversions on Thursday and suggested them to take the DND or the Kalindi Kunj routes instead of the Noida Link road to reach Delhi. Some farmers continued their protest at the Delhi-Noida border amid security deployment, with some of them sitting on a demonstration at the Dalit Prerna Sthal near the Chilla border on Thursday morning. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Rajesh S said, “The law and order situation is under control although some farmers are still continuing their protest.” Farmers from western UP districts and belonging to groups like Bharatiya Kisan Union, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) and Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) are protesting at the border here. Some farmers' group leaders had claimed detention by the police during the demonstration here on Wednesday, a charge denied by the DCP Noida. Hundreds of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-on-at-noida-delhi-border-chilla-route-partially-opened-922800.html

The police in Bareilly district, about 250 kilometres from Lucknow, arrested a Muslim youth Uvaish Ahmed on charges of allegedly trying to force a married Hindu girl to convert and marry him. The police were on the look out for Uvaish after a case was registered under the new law a few days back. He was arrested from near a level crossing in Deorania in the district on Wednesday night, police said in Lucknow. Based on a complaint from Tikaram, a resident of Sharif Nagar village in Devarniya, the case was registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-conversion law. "This is the first arrest under the new law. Accused Owais Ahmad was arrested from the Richha railway gate in the Bahedi area here on Wednesday. He was produced before a local court and was sent to 14 days judicial custody," Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, Bareilly, Rajesh Kumar Pandey said. According to the complaint, Tikaram's daughter and Ahmed studied together in Class 12. The youth, who was a classmate of the girl, had also threatened her parents with serious consequences if they did not allow their daughter to convert and marry him. Three years ago, the accused started pressuring her to undergo religious conversion and perform 'nikaah' (marriage) with him, according to the complaint. Cases of alleged 'Love Jihad' have been reported from Muzaffarnagar and Lucknow also. A case was registered in Muzaffarnagar district against the Muslim youth, who was a resident of the neighbouring Uttarakhand state, for allegedly trying to woo a Hindu girl into conversion. In the state capital, the police on Wednesday evening stopped an inter faith couple from marrying even though their parents had consented to the same and the bride had converted also. Police said that the girl, under the new law, must apply at least two months in advance intimating him about her desire to convert. ''The marriage can take place only after the permission of the district magistrate is obtained,'' a police official said here.   The new law provided for a maximum imprisonment of ten years and also a fine for religious conversion through deceit, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage. Under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.   (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-police-make-first-arrest-under-new-anti-conversion-love-jihad-law-as-cases-pour-in-922806.html

A trial court has granted him three-day custody parole -- December 4, 5 and 7 -- to appear in compartment/ supplementary exams of BA Persian (Hons).

Tanha was directed to be taken to a guest house in Lajpat Nagar as suggested by the police and agreed by his counsel. The court said it would be the responsibility of the jail superintendent that from the guest house, the accused be taken to the examination centre at JMI university at 8:30 AM on December 4, 5 and 7 and brought back. He will be brought back to jail after the three exams are over. The court also allowed Tanha to make a phone call to his counsel for 10 minutes once a day during his stay at the guest house. A trial court has granted him three-day custody parole -- December 4, 5 and 7 -- to appear in compartment/ supplementary exams of BA Persian (Hons). However, he was not satisfied with it on the grounds that his entire day will be wasted and he will not be able to study and approached the high court seeking interim bail for the purpose. His interim bail was opposed by Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, representing the state, who stated that no such relief ought to be granted to Tanha and suggested that he can be permitted to stay in a guest house under judicial custody till his exams get over on December 7. The state, also represented through advocate Amit Mahajan, suggested four places which will be guarded by security officials and the petitioner's counsel accepted the guest house in Lajpat Nagar. Advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, representing Tanha, had said the accused was ready to give an undertaking to surrender immediately after the exams and that he would not seek benefit of the full court’s Covid-19 orders in which interim reliefs were granted to prisoners and regularly extended. Besides granting custody parole, the trial court had also directed the Jail Superintendent to provide necessary assistance in terms of the teaching material for the examinations of the accused. It had said that clearing the exams was necessary for Tanha to pursue MA in Persian, and that leniency must be shown to the accused by allowing him to appear for the said exams. Tanha was arrested on May 19 in the case for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-hc-asks-jail-officials-to-shift-jamia-student-to-guest-house-for-exams-922828.html

Over 5.38 lakh patients recovered from the disease. Chaudhary said that protests were held at nearly 75 places across the city against the Kejriwal government. The AAP government has "failed" to make arrangements to fight Covid-19, he said. Jain on Wednesday had said that Covid-19 severity is coming down in Delhi and positivity rate declined to five per cent. The minister had last Monday attributed the high Covid-19 death rate in the city to the pollution caused by stubble-burning and expected a downtrend in it in the next two-three weeks. He had said that pollution caused problems in breathing and Covid-19 patients inhaled the smoke, which aggravated the seriousness.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aap-govt-has-failed-to-make-arrangements-to-fight-covid-19-congress-922830.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi sees slump in Covid-19 positivity rate in the last 7 days; steady rise in number of containment zones||The Covid-19 positivity rate in the national capital has slumped in the last one week, dropping from 8.65 per cent on November 26 to 5 per cent on December 2, even as the count of containment zones has grown steadily in the same period, according to official data. In this duration, nearly 100 containment zones have been added each day, rising to 5,772 on Wednesday. Delhi recorded 3,944 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the tally to over 5.78 lakh, while 82 new fatalities pushed the toll to 9,342. These fresh cases came out of a record 78,949 tests conducted on Tuesday, including 36,370 RT-PCR tests, while the positivity rate dropped to 5 per cent, according to the latest bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. This is the highest number of tests conducted in a day till date and also the first time when over 70,000 tests were done. The positivity rate has been steadily dropping since November 26 till date, except on November 29 when it marginally rose to 7.64 per cent compared to 7.24 per cent on November 28, as per the official figures shared by the Delhi health department. The positivity rate was 8.65 per cent on November 26 when 5,475 fresh cases were recorded, and 8.51 per cent on November 27 when 5,482 cases were reported. On November 30, the rate again dropped to 7.35 per cent; 6.85 per cent on December 1 and 5 per cent on December 2, as per the data. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the Covid-19 positivity rate in the national capital is falling rapidly and it should drop to below 5 per cent level in the next few days. However, the number of containment zones has steadily risen in the last one week, from 5,156 on November 26 to 5,772 on December 2. The count of zones on intervening days were -- 5,229 (November 27), 5,331 (November 28), 5,441 (November 29), 5,552 (November 30) and 5,669 (December 1), according to official data. When asked about the rise in count of containment zones, Jain had said, as per the government policy, any place where three or more cases are reported are converted into a containment zone. "So, this is our effort to contain the spread of the virus and so the numbers are increasing, and thus not a matter of concern," he said, adding, that the rapidly falling positivity rate is a "satisfactory" trend. The positivity rate was 15.26 per cent on November 7. There has been a reduction of nearly 55 per cent since early November, Jain had said on Tuesday. Eighty-two fatalities were recorded on Wednesday, pushing the toll in the national capital to 9,342. The active cases tally on Wednesday had dropped to 30,302 from 31,769 on Tuesday. The Wednesday health bulletin said that the total number of cases has climbed to 5,78,324, while the recovery rate stood at over 93 per cent. The highest single-day spike till date -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-sees-slump-in-covid-19-positivity-rate-in-the-last-7-days-steady-rise-in-number-of-containment-zones-922860.html

Expressing their full support to the protesting farmers of Punjab and Haryana, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu group) cautioned against moves to divide the farmers' protest. Talking to media on Wednesday, BKU UP chief Yogesh Pratap Singh and General Secretary Shailendra Pal Singh said that apart from revocation of the new farm laws, the farmers have also been demanding forming a Farm Commission comprising agricultural scientists and farmers. The BKU leaders said that more farmers from surrounding districts are expected to join them in the coming days.

03-12-2020||North and Central||Plea filed in Supreme Court against ordinance on 'Love Jihad'||Pleas have been filed in the Supreme Court against the Uttar Pradesh's Ordinance, issued on November 24 to check incidents of 'love-Jihad' and similar law passed by Uttarakhand in 2018, saying it was against the public policy and society at large, besides curtailing fundamental rights of the citizen. The move by the two state governments was also against the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the petition filed jointly by two advocates and a law researcher claimed. The plea challenged the validity of the 'Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020' and 'the Uttarakhand Freedom Of Religion Act, 2018'.  The petitioner's advocates Vishal Thakre and Abhay Singh Yadav and PhD student Pranvesh claimed such laws would create fear in the society.  "This would also become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to falsely implicate anyone. It would also harm the public at a large and will create a chaotic situation in the society," the plea claimed. They asked the court to declare the Ordinance and law as ultra vires of the Constitution and ensure those were not implemented. A separate petition filed by advocate Neeraj Shukla questioned the validity of the UP government's Ordinance, saying the right to live with a person of his or her choice, irrespective of religion professed by them, was intrinsic to right to life and personal liberty. The Yogi Adityanath government's Ordinance carried a maximum punishment of 10 years jail for conversion brought on fraud, deceit and misrepresentation of facts, for the purpose of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/plea-filed-in-supreme-court-against-ordinance-on-love-jihad-922866.html

The state government has passed the National Law School of India University Amendment Act, 2020 on April 27. The HC, however, had declared it as ultra vires and contrary to provisions of the parent law as the NLSIU had independent identity having all India national character. In a special leave petition, the Karnataka government contended the NLSIU was created by the state legislature and fell within its control. It also maintained that the object of the amendment was to promote legal education and enrich the profession by allowing students from the state to get admission and serve its interest and cause of profession and academia. The NLSIU has been provided 23 acres of land on lease at concessional rate, besides the annual aid, the state government said, seeking stay of the HC's judgement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/karnataka-govt-approaches-sc-against-hc-order-quashing-25-domicile-quota-922868.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||'Delhi Chalo' march: Key routes connecting UP-Delhi closed amid farmers' protest||Police on Thursday closed routes on two national highways connecting Ghaziabad to Delhi as farmers remained adamant on their demand for scrapping of the Centre's agriculture reform laws and stayed put at the national capital's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The protesting farmers had on Wednesday threatened to block other roads of Delhi if their demands were not met. "The local police have closed the routes on NH-9 and NH-24 from Ghaziabad to Delhi. On NH-1, both sides of the route have been closed near Shani Mandir," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted. The crowd of farmers continued to swell at Ghazipur, prompting the police to close the Delhi-UP border on NH-24. "The Ghazipur border on NH-24 is closed for traffic from Ghaziabad towards Delhi due to farmers' protests. People are advised to avoid NH-24 for coming to Delhi and use Apsara/Bhopra/DND instead," the traffic police said. It said NH-44 is closed on both sides and asked people to take alternate routes via NH-8, Bhopra, Apsara border, and Peripheral expressway At the Chilla border, one carriageway — from Delhi to Noida — has been opened for traffic. However, the other carriageway — from Noida to Delhi — is still closed. People commuting from Noida to Delhi are advised to avoid Noida link road, the traffic police said. The Delhi-Haryana border at Jharoda and Jhatikra remained closed for traffic movement. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheeler traffic. However, people can travel to Haryana through Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri, NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera border points, the traffic police have said. The police also kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic for the eighth day on the trot. "Singhu border is still closed from both sides. Lampur, Auchandi & other small borders also closed. Please take alternate routes. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK Road," the traffic police tweeted. "Traffic is very heavy. Please avoid Outer Ring Road from Signature Bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu, Auchandi & Lampur borders," it said. As traffic spilled over to alternate routes, it led to long jams there as well. On Wednesday, the farmers had demanded that a special Parliament session be convened to repeal the three agriculture reform laws which were enacted in September. The farmers' unions also called for a nationwide protest on Saturday to oppose what they claimed was "corporatisation" of farming.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-march-key-routes-connecting-up-delhi-closed-amid-farmers-protest-922879.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' groups refuse government food, arrange own lunch at Delhi's Vigyan Bhawan||Farmer leaders on Thursday refused the lunch offered by the government during their meeting with three Union ministers here and preferred to eat the food ferried in a van from the Singhu border, where thousands of their colleagues are sitting in protest against the new Agri laws. The fourth-round of talks began around noon amid ongoing protests by farmers seeking repeal of the laws. During the lunch break, a small van carrying food for around 40 people was seen outside the Vigyan Bhawan, where the meeting is underway. "Our farmers' representatives did not accept the lunch offered by the government and we arranged it from the Singhu border," Lok Sangarsh Morcha president Pratibha Shinde told PTI. Farmers' leaders told the government to focus on resolving the issues instead of trying to be a good host by offering lunch, she said. "How can we have lunch offered by the government when our fellow farmers are sitting on roads," said Shinde, whose organisation is among the 40 farmers' groups engaged in the talks. Thousands of farmers have been camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders of the national capital for the last eight days as part of their protest against the laws. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of the farmer groups at the Vigyan Bhawan. The government said that the meeting started in the afternoon and discussions are being held in a cordial atmosphere. On December 1, talks between both the sides ended in a stalemate after farmers' groups rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by the protesting farmers. The government had rejected the demand for repealing the laws and asked the farmers' bodies to identify specific issues related to the newly enacted Acts and submit those by December 2 for consideration and discussion on Thursday. Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-groups-refuse-government-food-arrange-own-lunch-at-delhis-vigyan-bhawan-922885.html

District Magistrate Savin Bansal released Rs 10 lakh recently to the chief medical officer to arrange 500 "dolis" or palanquins for rural areas to bring pregnant women to the nearest road head or hospital for delivery. The arrangement has been made, especially for the villages located in hill development blocks of Dhari, Ramgarh, Okhalkanda, Betalghat and Bhimtal.            Nainital has become the first district in Uttarakhand where such a step has been taken to address the plight of rural women. Bansal often goes to remote areas of the district on foot and understands the inconvenience suffered by residents in times of a medical emergency. Some money will always be kept at the hospital and Rs 2,000 will be given to any person who is instrumental in bringing a pregnant woman in a palanquin to the hospital, Bansal said. This service will be offered to villages located at a distance of more than one km from the nearest road head. The step is meant to alleviate the plight of women in need of medical care in rural areas and also to reduce the mother-child mortality rate in the long run.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pregnant-women-in-rural-areas-of-nainital-to-be-brought-in-dolis-to-hospitals-922903.html

Speaking on the 36th anniversary of the incident, Chouhan also announced the immediate resumption of a pension of Rs 1,000 for the women who lost their husbands due to the gas leak from the now-defunct Union Carbide plant. "A memorial will be built to commemorate the people who lost their lives due to the toxic gas leak from a pesticide plant on the night of December 2-3, 1984," Chouhan said at an all-religion prayer meeting held here. "Besides, pension to the widows which had stopped in 2019 (during the Congress government) would be given forthwith," he said. Many of these women were suffering from various ailments themselves and needed help as they had suffered a lot, he noted. The memorial would remind people that "no city in the world should become another Bhopal," the chief minister said. "We need to save the world that God has given us for the next generation," he said. Elsewhere, the tragedy survivors and their kin led by four NGOs working for the gas leak victims formed a human chain near the abandoned Union Carbide plant while following COVID-19 precautions, said Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information & Action. "They also burnt an effigy of Dow Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling," she said. The NGOs condemned evasion of alleged legal liabilities by Dow Chemical, USA, which took over Union Carbide years ago, for the health consequences suffered by the survivors and pollution of the soil and groundwater. The state and central governments failed to make the corporation pay adequate compensation, the press statement issued jointly by the four NGOs alleged. Dhingra also claimed that the Madhya Pradesh government downplayed the number of survivors who died due to Covid-19. Nawab Khan, president of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha, said, "In the last ten years officials of the state and central governments have promised in writing that they would revise the figures of death and health damage in the curative petition before the Supreme Court for additional compensation from the American corporations. These promises remain to be kept." All official research on the long-term health impact of the disaster has been stopped or suppressed, he alleged. Out of 518 persons who died due to Covid-19 in Bhopal district as of December 2, 102 were gas tragedy survivors, 69 of them above 50 years of age, Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Director Basant Kurre had said on Wednesday. But NGOs claimed that as many as 254 survivors have succumbed to the coronavirus infection. Over 15,000 people were killed after methyl isocyanate leaked from the pesticide plant of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) on the outskirts of the city on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984. More than five lakh people were affected in one way or the other due to the leak of the toxic gas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/36-years-after-bhopal-gas-tragedy-mp-cm-announces-memorial-922921.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||Punjabi singers play new tunes, reflect farmers’ mood||Punjabi singers are doing their bit for the farmers’ cause, coming up with catchy new numbers to help keep their protest going at Delhi's borders. "Murrde ni laye bina haq, Dilliye" (Delhi, we aren’t turning back without getting our rights) is one of them, reflecting the mood of Punjab farmers seeking repeal of the new laws enacted at the Centre. These songs, which primarily centre around the farmers' agitation, are gaining immense popularity among the protesters at the Singhu and Tikri borders. Noted Punjabi singer and actor Harbhajan Mann who has been supporting farmers' protests for the last several months said that he had come out with a new song on Wednesday. "I have come out with a new song 'murrde ni laye bina haq, Dilliye'... It is all about how farmers carrying ration for six months are protesting and how the safety of their field is very important. It is a fight of their existence,” said Mann on Thursday. The video of the song also shows how farmers braved water cannons and broke the police barriers while en route to Delhi. About a month back, Mann had released another song "Anndataa, Khet Saadi Maa, Khet Saadi pagg" (fields are our mother, fields are our pride). Singer Kanwar Grewal's song "Ailaan, tennu Delhiye ekath pareshaan karuga, par faslan de faisley kisan karuga' (Delhi, this gathering will trouble you but farmers will only decide the price of crops) is also getting popular among the protesters. Grewal's another song 'Pecha' has also gone viral on the social media. The singers said they were also children of farmers and it is natural for them to stand shoulder to shoulder with the peasants in their struggle against the laws. “When farmers are facing tough times, it is our responsibility to stand with them. Farmers feel that these laws are not in their favour. We should support them in their agitation,” said Mann. Another famous singer Jasbir Jassi said it is good that Punjabi artists are supporting the farmers. “They are composing as well as singing songs in farmers' support,” said Jassi. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan thanked Punjabi artists and singers for standing in solidarity with the protesting farmers against the “black laws.” “It is a historical fact that artists are very important for the success of any struggle. We hail the singers for standing with the farmers,” he said. Several Punjabi singers, including Sidhu Moosewala, Babbu Maan and Harf Cheema, have already lent their support to the farmers' cause. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other areas have stayed put at various Delhi border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjabi-singers-play-new-tunes-reflect-farmers-mood-922940.html
03-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protests gain momentum in Rajasthan||Protests against the Centre's new farm laws gained momentum in Rajasthan on Thursday as farmer organisations blocked roads and held demonstrations and rallies in solidarity with thousands gathered at the national capital's borders as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. A group of farmers, under the banner of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, held a protest at Jaipur's Surajpole mandi and blocked the Jaipur-Delhi highway for nearly an hour to demand a repeal of the laws. Another group staged a protest on the Rajasthan-Haryana border in Alwar district and said their numbers would rise if the Centre failed to fulfil their demands. Thousands of farmers are now camping at the border of Delhi, demanding the repeal of the three Acts that they say will lead to the phasing out of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which the government denies. Farmer unions have also called for a nationwide protest on Saturday. "The Centre should withdraw the farm laws immediately. Such a large number of farmers are raising their voices against the anti-farmer laws but the government is taking no step to fulfil the demands," CPI(M) leader Ravindra Shukla said. Congress Seva Dal members, led by state unit president Hem Singh Shekhawat, submitted a memorandum to the collector, urging the President of India to abolish the three farm laws. Shekhawat termed the laws "anti-farmer" and said the Centre wanted to favour industrialists, and therefore, the laws were brought. In Alwar, agitating farmers were joined by Rashtriya Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat.   "We are waiting for the outcome of the meeting being held in Delhi. If there is no positive result, farmers will be mobilised from here," Jat said. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of 35 farmers' unions at the Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital. Hundreds of farmers from 27 tehsils of the four districts of Kota division held a rally against the farm laws and submitted a memorandum to the district collector. The farmers, some of them on tractors-trolleys and two-wheelers, marched through the main roads of the city, raising slogans and holding banners and placards in their hands.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protests-gain-momentum-in-rajasthan-922941.html

After seven hours of marathon talks, 40 farmer leaders agreed to meet the ministerial panel led by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again on Saturday to deliberate on their demands.  "We rejected the proposal of the government for amendments to the three farm laws. We stuck to our demand for the repeal of the three laws," Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), told DH. Kulwant Singh Sandhu of the Jamhuri Kisan Sabha said the approach of the government was different and appeared to accept certain flaws in the farm sector reforms. The farmers’ organisations were scheduled to meet on Friday to decide their approach to further deliberations with the government. The farmers’ siege of the national capital entered the eighth day on Thursday and received support from farmers’ organisations from several states. Interacting with reporters, the agriculture minister reiterated that the government was committed to the continuation of the minimum support price regime and had no plans to scrap it. Tomar also expressed readiness to consider ways to further strengthen the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets and consider the farmers’ demand for registration of traders outside the APMC system. The new farm laws allowed any person with a PAN card to trade in agricultural commodities, a provision objected to by the farmers. The government also expressed readiness to consider the farmers’ demands to allow settling of disputes in courts instead of the sub-divisional magistrate level. "The government does not have any ego. We are willing to discuss all issues with farmers," Tomar said, renewing his appeal to farmers to end their agitation. The Congress and AAP joined the farmers in demanding immediate convening of the Parliament to discuss the farmers’ protests and their demand for repeal of the farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/centre-budges-but-farmers-firm-on-repeal-of-farm-laws-923051.html
03-12-2020||Oasis||Lives in a life||One way of living with full awareness, remaining positive and seeing one’s actions as having a purpose, is to break up life into stages. Just as one anticipates the seasons and makes preparations to greet them, life’s stages must also be anticipated and welcomed. Even as it sounds good to remain eighteen forever it is just not possible.  The first stage even today is that of learning. This may be formal or informal. The infant’s initial enthusiasm gets a bit distracted as the journey proceeds, but the norms are not different from those laid down traditionally. If the period is dedicated to earnest enquiry, cultivation of modesty through the respectful treatment of teachers, and pleasant behaviour, there is a lot to look forward to. The skill and confidence developed go a long way in the creation of wealth in the next stage. The motivation for the wealth creator even in modern times comes from the desire to become independent, a householder responsible for, and caring for, dependants. In the process wealth is created not just for oneself but also for society. There is both pleasure and prosperity in doing so. The life goals remain kama and artha. With success comes the anticipation of the next stage. This is to retire from the rat race and spend time doing what one always wanted to do. In this time of reduced responsibility one also has the joy of contemplating on what one has learnt, mentoring the young, coming to terms with limitations, and withdrawal from the desire to exercise power and control. The life goal here is to cultivate higher values. Society benefits from the aspirations generated by such ethical and sophisticated behaviour and learns to respect it. One lives by dharma, that is as one ought to live. The last stage, of renunciation, is not really rooted in society. Having completed the earlier three stages, the joys of renunciation derive from the wisdom of not wishing or pretending to be young, of detachment from things beyond one’s control, and being motivated more by inner good. Here one can choose actions which lead to an eventual end which is desirable because it is intrinsically good.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/lives-in-a-life-922689.html
03-12-2020||Opinion||Biden wants America to lead the world, it shouldn’t||By Peter Beinart There’s a lot we still don’t know about how President-elect Joe Biden and his foreign policy team will approach the world. But this much is clear: They believe in American “leadership.” In a 2015 speech, Antony Blinken, Mr Biden’s choice to be secretary of state, employed some version of the word 21 times. This spring, Mr Biden wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs titled “Why America Must Lead Again.” Last week, when he introduced his national security nominees, he said that “America is back, ready to lead the world.” Let’s hope not. In the post-Trump age, “leadership” is a misguided, and even dangerous, vision for America’s relationship with the rest of the globe. For the past four years, foreign policy elites have trumpeted American “leadership” as the safe, bipartisan and benign alternative to the Trump administration’s belligerent America First nationalism. But look up the word “lead” in a dictionary and you’ll find definitions like “the first or foremost place,” being “at the head of” and “to control a group of people.” Leadership doesn’t mean motherhood and apple pie. It means being in charge. Mr Biden has offered two justifications for why America deserves this privileged role. The first is hereditary: “For 70 years,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs, “the United States, under Democratic and Republican presidents, played a leading role in writing the rules” that “advance collective security and prosperity.” In other words, America should lead the world now because it has done so effectively in the past. Between 1945 and 1989, according to Dov H. Levin’s book “Meddling in the Ballot Box,” the United States interfered in foreign elections 63 times. So Mr Biden’s cheery history of American Cold War leadership leaves a lot out. But even if you romanticize the post-World War II era, it is long gone. Seventy years ago, as James Goldgeier and Bruce W. Jentleson recently noted, the United States accounted for roughly half of the world’s gross domestic product. It now accounts for just over one-seventh. Collectively, the European Union’s G.D.P., adjusted for purchasing power parity, is almost as large as the United States’. China’s is already larger, and the coronavirus pandemic is likely to only widen the gap. The phrase “leadership” assumes a power hierarchy that, at least economically, no longer exists. Mr Biden’s second justification is moral. As he wrote in 2017, “other nations follow our lead because they know that America does not simply protect its own interests, but tries to advance the aspirations of all.” But it’s hard to survey America’s behaviour in recent decades and glean some special commitment to global welfare. According to a study by Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, America’s post-9/11 wars have displaced 37 million people. And even before Donald Trump entered the White House, the United States had refused to ratify international treaties that ban land mines, cluster bombs and nuclear tests, regulate the global sale of arms, protect the oceans, enable prosecution of genocide and war crimes, and safeguard the rights of women, children and people with disabilities. Most countries on earth have ratified all or nearly all of these agreements. No other nation has spurned every single one. Mr Trump has added to this litany of noncompliance by withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, the Iran nuclear deal, the World Health Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Treaty on Open Skies and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. This isn’t the record of a country that has earned the right to global leadership. It’s the record of a country that should work on global membership first. Unfortunately, even Mr Biden’s advisers — who are multilateralists by American standards — have trouble imagining cooperation without dominance. “Whether we like it or not, the world simply does not organize itself,” Mr Blinken has said. But the United States has discovered what happens “when some other country tries to take our place or, maybe even worse, no one does, and you end up with a vacuum that is filled by bad events.” But it’s not true that international cooperation collapses without America calling the shots. After the United States announced that it was leaving the Paris climate agreement, not a single other signatory followed it out the door. To the contrary, the European Union, China, Japan and South Korea have recently pledged to make their economies carbon-neutral by at least 2060. This summer, after the Trump administration threatened to leave the World Health Organization, France and Germany promised to increase their contributions. The point isn’t that American participation in common global efforts is unnecessary. To the contrary — it’s vital. But most of the time, America best serves these efforts less by dictating the rules than by agreeing to them. Choosing partnership over leadership may strike some as un-American. But it’s what most Americans want. For 20 years, Gallup has been asking Americans whether the United States should play “the leading role,” a “major role,” a “minor role” or “no role at all” in world affairs. By large margins, “major role” always comes in first. This September, when the Chicago Council on Global Affairs asked Americans whether they preferred the United States to play a “dominant” or a “shared” leadership role, “shared” prevailed by almost three to one. It’s not ordinary Americans who believe the United States must “sit at the head of the table,” as Mr Biden said last week. It is foreign-policy elites, who often slander public opposition to American primacy as isolationism. But there is a dissident foreign-policy tradition, often championed by those at the forefront of America’s domestic struggles for justice. In his 1967 speech opposing the Vietnam War, the Rev. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. called the United States government “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” Such a government, he insisted, should not pretend “it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them.” Rather than seeking to dominate the world, Dr King argued, the United States should show “solidarity” with it: first, by curbing its own contributions to global misery and second, by joining with others to battle “poverty, insecurity and injustice.” The Biden team should make solidarity — not leadership — its watchword for approaching the world. In so doing, it would acknowledge that while the United States can do much to help other nations, its first obligation — especially after the horrors of the Trump era — is to stop doing harm.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/biden-wants-america-to-lead-the-world-it-shouldn-t-922722.html
03-12-2020||Opinion||A Turkish-German couple may save us from the coronavirus. So why is Germany uneasy?||By Anna Sauerbrey When the German company BioNTech and Pfizer announced last month that they had very promising results for a vaccine against the coronavirus, my Twitter feed went wild. Alongside the flood of congratulations and expressions of joy, there was cause for special jubilation: Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, the couple who founded and run BioNTech, are Germans of Turkish descent. Their story promised to challenge the resentment against immigrants that over the past decade has become pervasive in German public life. If anything could unseat anti-migrant sentiment, surely a Turkish-German couple saving the world from a deadly virus would do it. But nothing is so simple. In heralding the pair as an exceptional “migrant success story,” many unwittingly repeated the central tenets of anti-migrant thinking — that migrants are fundamentally apart from the rest of German society, that a special few may earn their place but the rest should be rejected. The dissonance was jarring, but perhaps not surprising. When it comes to immigration, Germany is uneasy even with its most spectacular successes. Even so, the invention of a vaccine by a couple with Turkish names seemed to come at the right time. Ten years ago, in a book titled “Germany Abolishes Itself,” a formerly high-ranking Social Democrat, Thilo Sarrazin, claimed that the educational gap between immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and Germans was rooted in genetic differences (“intellectual deficits,” he called them). Immigration, Mr Sarrazin warned, was threatening Germany’s economy by decreasing overall education standards. The book became a best seller and still sits on many middle-class bookshelves. Alternative for Germany, the far-right party formed in 2013 that has exploited and intensified anti-migrant feeling, picked up on the narrative, stigmatizing immigrants as a dangerous drain on the nation’s resources. The party never stops pounding the drum. In 2018, for example, Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the party, called immigrants “Kopftuchmädchen” and “Messermänner” — head scarf girls and knife men — from the floor of Parliament. Political debate, in no small measure because of the party’s success, often focuses on the problems supposedly linked to immigration: religious zealotry, crime, poverty. Against this backdrop, Mr Sahin’s and Ms Türeci’s success felt like a welcome opportunity to celebrate the benefits of immigration, to recognize how migrants enrich and deepen our society. Their stories — Mr Sahin, the son of a Turkish labourer, came to Germany as a child while Ms. Türeci, the daughter of a Turkish doctor who moved from Istanbul, was born in Germany — brought to light the often hidden history of postwar immigration to Germany. Starting in the 1950s, to fuel its postwar industrial boom, Germany recruited labourers mostly from Italy and Turkey. Called “Gastarbeiter” — “guest workers” — they were not meant to stay. But many did, and today their children and grandchildren are an integral part of the country’s society. Yet they are often overlooked. Championing in particular the success of Dr. Sahin, the son of a Ford factory worker, felt like a necessary corrective to such condescension. But singling out works both ways: It can offer much-needed recognition, but it can also make immigrant success look like an exception and mark migrants out as “not one of us,” as a colleague of mine pointed out. When I called a few Germans of Turkish descent, many expressed a similar ambivalence. “Finally, here was something we have missed for a long time: appreciation,” Hatice Akyün, a friend and a columnist for the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel (where I work), told me. As a fellow child of “guest workers,” she felt a connection to the couple — “a biographical pride, if you will.” But she was also uncomfortable with the focus on their biographies. “I’ve played the role of a poster child for successful integration myself for a long time,” she said. “But it can be tiring and frustrating to be seen through that lens all the time.” Naika Foroutan, a professor at Humboldt University in Berlin, seemed to share this feeling. “I think it is right and important and gratifying that their descent is stressed,” she wrote in an email. But she, too, has had enough of the focus on role models. “This type of framing reproduces the idea of exceptionality — that it’s always an exception when migrants rise in society and achieve something big,” she wrote. Not only does that overlook the essential role migrants play in society generally; it’s also far from the truth: Studies show that migrants tend across time to move up the social strata. But migrants remain underrepresented in the top echelons of society and their opportunities for advancement, generally, are limited. For Cem Özdemir, a member of the Green Party who in 1994 was the first child of a Turkish “guest worker” to be elected to Germany’s Parliament, that’s what makes it important to highlight stories like those of Dr Sahin and Dr Türeci. “In Germany, where you come from still plays a major role in determining where you’re going to go,” Mr Özdemir told me. So it’s especially important to elevate inspiring examples, as an encouragement for those navigating the difficulties of German society. “I know from my own experiences that with a Turkish name,” he said, “you will always have to do better, be watched closer.” It’s a sad truth. More than a half-century after the parents of Mr Özdemir, Ms Akyün and Dr Sahin came to Germany, the country is ill at ease with its immigration history — and far from providing everybody with the same chances. That’s why, for now, Dr Sahin and Dr Türeci’s story is essential. It shows that Germany’s successes are inseparable from the migrants who — in 1960 or 2020 — come to call the country home.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-turkish-german-couple-may-save-us-from-the-coronavirus-so-why-is-germany-uneasy-922723.html
03-12-2020||Opinion||Covid-19, political turmoil double impact on Kashmir's women||The history of the Kashmir valley has been vivid with decades of violent conflicts, extremist insurgencies and militarisation. Along with these recurrent conflicts, is the deeply ingrained patriarchal nature of Kashmiri society. Both these characteristics have contributed towards negatively impacting the status of women in Kashmir. However, given that the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the measures to contain it come bearing a risk of exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and to some extent deepen them, women in Kashmir are now likely to bear greater stress and disproportionate burden of both the health emergency as well as the widespread political crisis in the region. For Kashmir’s women, the Covid-19 induced nationwide lockdown came at a time when the valley was already experiencing months of residual restrictions from the abrogation of Article 370, which granted a special autonomous status to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). These restrictions included heavy military deployment with night curfews, communication blackouts, and closure of markets. As a result, the outbreak of the pandemic combined with strengthening of the pre-existing restrictive measures have made matters extremely difficult for the women residing within the region. Rise in gender-based violence One of the most unfortunate developments in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is the rise in gender-based violence against women in Kashmir. Although, gender based crimes such as rape, torture, sexual assault, etc. have been endemic features of Kashmir’s conflict zones as well as the overall socio-political landscape, the upsurge in domestic violence against women in the current Covid-19 scenario is rather alarming. Owing to the extended lockdown and restrictions on movement — along with the problem of communication blockade — women have now been trapped with their abusers and have limited or no access to mobile clinics, counselling services and platforms to protest. In fact, since the women’s commission was shut down in  August 2019, victims of domestic violence no longer have a dedicated avenue working solely for their assistance. As the per the government’s social welfare department, 16 rape cases and 64 molestations were reported in J&K during the first month of the Covid-19 lockdown, i.e. from 20 March to 29 April, 2020. These statistics, however, have been widely under-reported for two main reasons — either due to the fear of social ostracism or due to the prevailing confusion about how to report the cases of gender-based violence post the closure of the women’s commission. One possible outcome of escalation in gender-based violence is an increase in the number of unwanted pregnancies. This will have come at a time when Kashmir’s already scarce health resources have all been diverted towards combating the virus, thus, disrupting the provision of adequate prenatal and sexual reproductive services. The overwhelmed healthcare systems and women’s reduced access to medical care could potentially result in rising infant mortality as well as maternal mortality rates. Toll on mental health Besides, it is no secret that decades of living in the climate of conflict, crisis and fear has imposed enduring psychological impacts on the women in Kashmir with many of them suffering from depression and constant anxiety of not knowing when their husbands or sons would return, while the others grieving over the loss of their loved ones. According to the Kashmir Mental Health Survey Report 2015, 50 per cent of women suffer from probable depression in comparison to 37 per cent men and 36 per cent of women suffer from anxiety-related disorders in comparison to 21 per cent men. In this regard, the Covid-19 pandemic has further had a detrimental impact on the mental health of Kashmiri women as it has added yet another layer of fear of being infected with the virus, exacerbated financial insecurity, has locked up women in houses and limited their development opportunities. Adding to this is the ongoing communication blockade, which makes matters worse as these women, unlike the rest of the world, are neither able to gather information about how to combat the virus nor have they been able to connect with their loved ones in distant places, further causing worry and distress. Moreover, the lockdown measures have denied women access to psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in the face of the pandemic. However, as the nationwide lockdown is now being slowly lifted, bringing life back to normal for the rest of the country, Kashmir continues to face a political lockdown and escalating border tensions, thereby intensifying conflict and posing myriad challenges for its women for times to come. Thus, instead of focusing on the strict enforcement of the lockdown, communication blackout and heavy military deployment, the priority must be to develop a gendered response to the pandemic, which will not only assist in effectively dealing with the health crisis but will also empower its women. Moreover, facilitating women’s involvement in the Covid-19 response strategy can also open up new venues for Kashmiri women to participate in conflict resolution and formal negotiations to bring about long-lasting peace within the region.

03-12-2020||Opinion||How India’s romance with Bharat’s farmers faded||Among urban Indians, it was the usual left-liberal suspects who stood out in their support for the recent farmers’ march to Delhi. The rest, the majority, were either indifferent or riled, unmoved by visuals of elaborate bandobasts designed to block protesting co-citizens from reaching the national capital.  The protestors’ grit has moved the needle now. The government has initiated a dialogue. No thanks to urban Indians who struggled to muster solidarity. The scramble for daily bread may have checked less fortunate urban dwellers from acting on their sympathies, but others, people like us, remained inert for another reason. We, given our luxury of getting heard via back channels, have never quite gotten, or perhaps long forgotten, the point of street protest. The noise of the aggrieved masses must never disturb the peace of us privileged, we reckon, and it’s been good to see laws and the courts come around to our view over time. Meanwhile, the riled ones, in yet another display of touching faith in propaganda spewing from news channels and social media, were clear that the farmers had been misled, either by the political opposition or anti-national forces or possibly both in cahoots. The idea that individual agency and collective grievance can prompt street protest seemed beyond their grasp.  The visible presence in the march of Sikhs from Punjab, a currently Opposition-ruled state which once saw a separatist movement, was enough to sniff mischief. No longer the same respect The generally unsympathetic attitude to the march then is a reflection of our present, a time where the larger idea of street protest stands delegitimised and any protest that threatens to discomfit the government comes to be portrayed as motivated, a conspiracy to shame the government and, by (illogical) extension, harm the nation. This, however, may not be the sole explanation for the manner in which the protest by farmers, a group long eulogised as the nation’s providers and routinely placed alongside the soldier in the national pantheon, was received in cities. Truth is that India’s romance with Bharat’s farmers has been fraying for a while, overtaking respect for the hard yards served in the nation’s quest for food self-sufficiency and ending the humiliating ship-to-mouth days of the initial post-Independence decades. Before we get to how this respect dimmed, let us acknowledge that it was never unalloyed respect to begin with, not even in the late sixties to mid-seventies period when the fruits of farmers’ labours and the successes of the Green Revolution were fresh.  This was for two reasons. One: Gratefulness does not come easily to the privileged. The best their sense of entitlement allows is an offhand nod in recognition of exertions made in their service. Two: The farmers’ capacity for toil was not enough to change his overall image as a poor creature lacking ambition and intelligence and shackled to caste and the worst of tradition.  It is difficult to pinpoint when even this half-hearted ardour began to chill, but the rural-urban chasm had widened enough for farmer leader Sharad Joshi to speak of a Bharat versus India divide by the late seventies.  A changing relationship This formulation was a jolt for the urban elite who till then had imagined the farmer as a selfless provider, never a competitor for political power and state resources. True, they had registered the rural unease over lack of land reform and inadequate public investment in agriculture, but neither was supposed to bear on their own status, not after they had scuttled the land reform agenda early on and been assured of status quo by politicians’ mastery in compensating substance with rhetoric. In the eighties, the Bharat versus India formulation got echoed in a new and energetic phase of farmer movements, notably silent on land reform, vocal on output prices, and aggregated by larger farmers (but drawing participation from others too).  India could sense Bharat shedding its old diffidence, no longer coy about claiming what it believed were its just dues. The Mahendra Singh Tikait-led 1988 siege of Delhi would remove any doubt on that account, in case earlier assertions in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu had gone unnoticed. Post the economic liberalisation of the nineties, urban India accumulated enough wealth and confidence to overcome its apprehensions of farmer raj (a “humble farmer” did become prime minister in 1996 but that owed to a wider constellation of factors). This would have been nice, but for the irritation that has replaced it.  A problematic trope Deluded into thinking that its affluence is entirely a function of its superior drive and enlightenment and embarrassed and frustrated at the country’s unflattering development indicators and delayed global superstardom, the urban elite has found a scapegoat in the farmer. (The farmer is not the only one. Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims, organised workers, unorganised workers, essentially anyone who can be othered, is on it.)  In the current set of farmers’ concerns – concerns around widened input cost-output price mismatches, skewed terms of engagement with new actors in the food chain, growing water and land availability constraints, and policy and investment priorities unresponsive to these – the urban elite doesn’t spot a thread of apathy and exploitation but a tale of farmers’ inefficiency and reluctance to embrace change, especially the warmth of the market.  The stereotype of the sluggish farmer sure has been sticky, nourishing itself on the urban elite’s inflated notions of itself. The romance, if you want to believe in it, was short and insincere. No surprise that farmers found themselves alone before the barricades and barbed wires, barriers and tear gas shelling, water cannons and lathis.

03-12-2020||Panorama||The need to give importance to proactive problem-solving||From time immemorial, mankind has shown curiosity in understanding the secrets of the working of nature. The Indian scientists, mathematicians, philosophers and surgeons of the Golden era of Indian science (400AD-1500AD) did exactly that and succeeded beyond expectations. That is science. Mankind has also applied scientific knowledge to develop methods and principles to overcome limitations of nature. That is engineering. That is how world has made material progress. For example, by the latter part of the 19th century, scientists had understood that wave attenuation causes sound not to be heard beyond a certain distance. These scientists wanted to overcome this limitation of nature. Maxwell came out with his theory of electromagnetism in the middle of the 19th century. Scientists developed the science behind converting sound waves into electromagnetic waves and vice versa. Engineers and technologists designed the telephone system using these scientific principles. Similar story with television. In other words, it is the combination of scientific and engineering research that makes overcoming the limitations of nature possible. The result is material progress. Fundamental or basic research is what makes huge leap in material progress possible. It is Einstein’s Theory of Relativity that has made GPS and harnessing of photon energy in PET scanners possible. It is the theory of quantum mechanics of Neils Bohr, Dirac, Schrodinger, Heisenberg and others that made DVDs, laser surgery and laser printers possible. It is the fundamental work of Gödel, Church, Turing and Shannon that made this world a hugely connected planet with a high per-capita density of information, thanks to computers and data communication technologies. Therefore, a country like India which has a huge population and which has problems of healthcare, water, air pollution, nutrition, education, shelter and many other major problems, needs basic research. Where are we today in our research accomplishments? India has shown success in areas which require reactive problem-solving.  Software services, green revolution and ISRO initiatives are good examples of this. But there is a common thread, barring perhaps some exceptions, in the progress we have made. That is, we have operated as disciplined and intelligent professionals in taking ideas that succeeded elsewhere and used reactive problem-solving to apply these ideas to solve our problems in many areas. This is highly laudable but we have to go beyond this to solve problems unique to India. That is where proactive problem-solving becomes important. Let me cite just two problems unique to India. We have 16% of the global population but only 4% of the global water availability. Soon, we will get into serious problems with water availability. Indian cities have a high rate of air pollution. Given our huge population and low per-capita GDP, we cannot use the ideas of the west to solve these problems. Those ideas are expensive to implement. We have to arrive at inexpensive solutions to solve these problems. How do we attempt to introduce proactive problem-solving? Reactive problem-solving is deeply embedded in the Indian culture for over 500 years and will not go away in a jiffy. Therefore, this transformation from reactive problem-solving to proactive problem-solving will have to be attempted in a gradual manner without hurting our economy. The need of the day is to concurrently experiment with two paradigms. The first paradigm is to become more disciplined, more hard working and more team-oriented to get better dividend out of our reactive problem-solving capability and make the country economically stronger in the short and medium term. The second paradigm is to conduct a controlled experiment in research based on proactive problem-solving, achieve success, and use discipline, hard work and team work to scale it up so that it becomes the norm for research in India, replaces the current reactive problem-solving mindset and solves problems unique to India. Rote learning Parallelly, we have to revamp our education system since it is a feeder to the research system. We have to reorient our education system to encourage curiosity, independent thinking and proactive problem-solving. We have become a nation of rote learning. However, there is a small percentage of exceptions to this. Such rote learning has not helped us solve our problems and will not help us make this nation stronger. One of the ways of helping independent thinking is to encourage open book examination as early as possible in the career of a student. Second is to encourage Socratic method of learning in the classroom. I am sure our education experts can offer many other tools to improve proactive independent thinking among Indian students.  What is the role of corporates in this task of improving our education system? Corporates can institute scholarships, fund training of teachers in new methodologies, fund experiments in teaching proactive problem-solving and honour outstanding researchers. Infosys has done all these. The Infosys Science Foundation has instituted Infosys Prize in six categories to encourage our researchers to become role models for our young researcher community. There are many Indian researcher leaders, including some from among the Infosys Prize winners, who are building proactive problem-solving mindset among young researchers in India. Let me cite just two examples. Prof Ashok Sen is a good example of such role models who have done the majority of their work in India and won global recognition. There are other researchers like Prof Sudhir Krishna who are developing a community of young researchers with independent proactive problem-solving mindset and solving problems relevant to India. In the area of software, I know several young Indian researchers who are trying to solve extremely difficult research problems in software using proactive problem-solving. They may even create new branches of studies. If we encourage such proactive problem solvers, I am sure that these researchers will transform the profile of basic and applied research in India in the years to come.  (The writer is President, Infosys Science Foundation)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/the-need-to-give-importance-to-proactive-problem-solving-922687.html
03-12-2020||Panorama||Pay attention to Asha workers' strike||Accredited Social Health Activists (or Ashas) are women community health workers under the National Health Mission (2005). Ashas are the link between the community and the healthcare infrastructure in rural India, and in disadvantaged communities in urban slums. They have diverse responsibilities that include spreading awareness on diseases, promoting government schemes, delivering basic medicare like first aid, conducting door to door health surveys and assisting other primary healthcare workers. They play a significant role in maternal and child health, particularly in immunisation programmes. They also play a key role in Disease Control Programs like the National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the National Leprosy Eradication Programme and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme for malaria, dengue. The work profile of Ashas is diverse, and they play a crucial role in achieving positive health outcomes for the marginalised and disadvantaged communities. Despite the essential and risky nature of their work, Ashas are not a part of the salaried and formal workforce. They are ‘volunteer’ workers who receive honorariums and performance-based incentives. Most states pay around  Rs 2000-4000 monthly, along with incentives upon completion of specific tasks. In the Guidelines on ASHAs, it was suggested that Asha’s work would be flexible, that us, 2-3 hours per day around 4-5 days a week. The rationale behind the honorarium was that it would be an additional source of income for the women, and therefore would not interfere in her routine source of livelihood. However, we now know that it is the only and primary source of income for many of them and that they work for much longer hours. In the course of their work, they also face many challenges like travelling long distances between villages in remote areas (often paying from their own pockets), and working in the understaffed and sub-par primary health infrastructure ( i.e the sub-centers and Primary Health Centres). They also have to work alone in risky and unsafe work environments of largely male-dominated communities. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ashas were given the high risk and herculean task of contact tracing and community surveillance. This was to be an additional duty alongside their usual work without additional incentive initially. In the initial months when a lot was not known about Covid-19, Ashas were going door to door to carry out their duty without protection, often using only their dupattas for a face cover. They often worked without protective gear and security, and there were many reported cases of Ashas getting attacked due to the Covid-19 stigma and panic. We do not have a centralised database to identify how many ASHAs were infected, and how many have succumbed to the infection. However, it has been reported that around 100 Ashas had died till August 2020. In April 2020, a Rs 1000 incentive to perform Covid-19 related duties was announced. However, many Ashas were not even given their honorarium, let alone the incentives. This resulted in protests for their basic rights of livelihood and safety, with the latest protest in November 2020. Ashas have been demanding that they be given the status of a government employee with a minimum wage of Rs 21,000 along with benefits.  Even before Covid-19, Ashas were working for prevention, tracking and ensuring treatment for high-risk diseases like Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, etc. They have also been the reason behind the success of India’s immunisation program. Our healthcare infrastructure is still poor in many rural areas, and remains out of reach for many even in the urban disadvantaged communities. In such a scenario, Ashas can play a significant role in dispensing information, facilitating accessibility, enabling preventive healthcare and if trained properly, providing primary medical care. Moreover, we have a shortage of trained healthcare workers in rural areas. By improving the training given to ASHAs, fixing their work hours and effectively utilising them, we can better the quality of preventive and primary health care provided in rural India. Currently, many ASHAs drop out as they are not able to cope with the heavy workload for meagre pay. Formalising the job would incentivise women to apply and help retain them.

03-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Moving then and now ||I have moved many times in the past as part of a family of five girls and one son, I was the youngest and my brother a little older than me. My father was Controller of Defence Accounts and was transferred frequently—I remember his telling us that on one transfer, as he was getting down from the train, he was given orders of transfer to another place! Travel was only by train as there were no planes. As children, we had great fun. However, for my sisters, particularly, changing schools, new uniforms, proved difficult. I remember when we were travelling in two adjacent compartments, my mother tried to make the money go a long way. She carried many things with which we could make some food in the compartment to feed her ever-hungry kids. She had a little kettle to boil hot water over a small stove to make tea or coffee. I compare this with the days of anxiety that I had while shifting my stuff from Thiruvananthapuram to Bengaluru a year ago. We had lived in Kerala for 40-50 years or more. Our house was spacious enough for conducting many family get-togethers, as my mother stayed with me after my father passed away. There was space to accommodate many relatives. Some of their stuff was left with us when they shifted from India to settle abroad. So, when I had to move, the plan we had was to make was to securely pack and load everything by experienced loaders into two huge trucks from a moving company that would travel to Bengaluru, which they would do in less than a day and a half. They would unload it for us at our premises, unwind (open) everything and make it easy for us to arrange as wanted. Believe me, even for those who are experienced, strong, sturdy and tough, this was a herculean task. The two Godrej Almiras were very heavy and a lot of the boxes containing god pictures had to be handled carefully. Even many boxes with clothes were not light at all. There were heaps of books which could not be thrown away— stuffed into heavy boxes. Did I mention winter clothes—also heavy—which we had used in Delhi winters and abroad. And what about vessels needed for us to make food for us and many guests. You have to grant that it was a huge job that required patience, experience and a great sense of responsibility. The movers did it fast, with great care, and what’s more, they did it with a smile. We, in the house, are still working hard to “unpack” the stuff.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/moving-then-and-now-922686.html
03-12-2020||Second Edit||Graffiti can create unrest||Mangaluru, the headquarters of Dakshina Kannada district, is tense after pro-terror inflammatory graffiti were found scribbled on walls on two occasions in a span of three days recently. One of the graffiti proclaims, “Do not force us to invite Lashkar-e-Taiba and Taliban to deal with Sanghis and Manuvedis #LashkarZindabad.”  While it is too early to conclude if there is a larger, sinister motive behind the graffiti or if it is the handiwork of mischief mongers, such provocative messages which have the potential to create unrest in the society, need to be condemned in no uncertain terms. While the police should act fast and bring the guilty to book, politicians should refrain from adding fuel to fire by giving the incident a communal tinge. The coastal districts are communally sensitive and the police are expected to keep an ear to the ground at all times. That the graffiti were found on two occasions within three days, point to an intelligence failure while the inability to quickly apprehend the culprits is a reflection on the poor networking and investigating skills of the district police. Even a day’s delay in cracking such sensitive cases can lead to rumour-mongering, leading to catastrophic consequences. One of the main reasons for the poor intelligence gathering and networking abilities is the frequent transfer of police officers and the politicisation of postings. Often, a police officer is transferred just as he is about to come to terms with the underbelly of his jurisdiction. As long as the present system of posting police officers based on political recommendations and other extraneous considerations, rather than on merit, does not end, criminals and anti-social elements will continue to have an upper hand. Studies worldwide have indicated that frustrated, unemployed or socially excluded youth often give vent to their pent-up feelings through graffiti and street art. There is certainly something seriously wrong with Mangaluru and the neighbouring Udupi district. Once known for their entrepreneurial spirit and academic exploits, they are now constantly at a boiling point, easily provoked by even seemingly minor incidents. Having clad their progressive image, the districts now stand marred by their regressive thinking, acute drug menace and attacks on pub-going girls. While there is no denying that communal elements have contributed in no small measure to the steady deterioration of the coast in the recent past, the government should immediately commission a socio-economic study by an eminent panel to delve deeper into the matter and identify what exactly ails these districts. Mangaluru and Udupi have always been the pride of Karnataka and their further decline cannot and should not be allowed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/graffiti-can-create-unrest-922685.html
03-12-2020||South||Rajinikanth to float his political party in January 2021||Six months before Tamil Nadu goes to its most crucial Assembly elections in recent times, Tamil superstar Rajinikanth on Thursday announced that he will launch his political party in January next year, declaring that the time has come to "change the state’s fate". The announcement not just ends the decades-long suspense over his political entry, but also makes the contest for the 2021 Assembly elections interesting. It makes the polls a crowded affair with too many players vying for the hot seat at Fort St George, the seat of power of the Tamil Nadu government. Rajinikanth, who will turn 70 on December 12, promises to usher in "spiritual politics" which he says is "clean and corruption-free governance" but his critics view it as a "soft version" of Hindutva, espoused by the BJP. The speculation that the BJP is behind Rajinikanth’s political entry – the saffron party’s every move to make inroads into the Dravidian land has so far failed -- gained credence with the actor appointing Ra Arjunamurthy, who was the head of Tamil Nadu BJP’s intellectual wing until Wednesday, as his new party’s chief coordinator. For the record, the BJP issued a statement saying his resignation from the party has been accepted and asked its cadres not to have any truck with Arjunamurthy, who seems to have good relations with top DMK leaders too. Adding to the speculation was RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy, who went all out to give media interviews to say that people against the DMK and AIADMK will certainly vote for the actor’s party. Gurumurthy has been advising Rajinikanth on his political entry.  The superstar, who enjoys a demi-god status among his fans, is likely to project himself as an alternative to the Dravidian majors – the DMK and the AIADMK – who have been dominating the Tamil Nadu’s political landscape since 1967. But AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselvam welcomed his entry into politics and went to the extent of saying an "alliance with him is possible if there is a chance", fuelling speculation, while the DMK said his entry will not dent its base in the state. In true filmy style, Rajinikanth put out a terse statement on Thursday afternoon promising "political and regime change" in the 2021 elections on his verified Twitter page and followed it up with an impromptu press briefing. Promising an "honest, transparent, casteless, non-corrupt administration and ushering in of spiritual politics", Rajinikanth said he would even be happy to give his life for the people of Tamil Nadu. "Political and regime change is the need of the hour. It is very important. If not now, never. I am just a small tool in achieving the change. If I win, it is people’s victory, and if I lose, it is people’s loss...Like individuals, every state has a fate. Tamil Nadu also has fate and time has come to change the fate," Rajinikanth said. While Rajinikanth may be a charismatic face and might command a base among his fans, there is no clarity on his policies and where he stands politically. "The decision by Rajinikanth to take the political plunge itself is delayed. And in my opinion, it is too early to talk about the impact he will make because his party structure is still not in place and he has not yet spelt out his ideology," political analyst P Ramajayam told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rajinikanth-to-float-his-political-party-in-january-2021-922783.html

While sources said that the raids were in connection with allegations that PFI funded the anti-CAA protests, PFI maintained that it was a political ploy to divert attention from farmers' stir. Raids were conducted at the residences of PFI chairman O M A Salam, Kerala state president and national secretary Nasaruddin Elamaram, national vice chairman E M Abdul Rahiman, national executive committee member P Koya and former state president Karamana Ashraf.

Laptops, pen drives, books and some other documents were learnt to be seized by the ED officials from the houses. According to sources, ED had earlier sought many documents and details regarding financial transactions of PFI. The raids were sequel to that. Elamaram told DH that the raids were part of a political ploy to divert attention from the ongoing farmers' stir. The ED had sought certain details from PFI several months back and all those were submitted. Now they have seized some laptops, pen drives and some books, which were quite common gadgets in most houses where students are studying, he said. Earlier, there were reports that the ED had submitted a report to the Home Ministry in which the role of PFI in funding anti-CAA protests was mentioned.

The Popular Front called it a "politically motivated" action while claiming that such raids usually happen whenever the government in power comes under the pressure of popular anger and it wants to divert national attention from it through "gimmick", referring to the ongoing protest by farmers against three agriculture sector laws. The ED is investigating Popular Front's "financial links" on charges of fuelling the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (anti-CAA) protests in the country, the Delhi riots that took place in February and a few other instances. It is also probing the "financial links" between the Popular Front and Chandrasekhar Azad-led Bhim Army in its money laundering case registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. According to the ED, it has conducted searches in Chennai, Tenkasi and Madurai (Tamil Nadu), Bengaluru, Darbhanga and Purnea (Bihar), Lucknow and Barabanki (Uttar Pradesh), Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Kolkata and Murshidabad (West Bengal), Jaipur, Shaheen Bagh area in Delhi and in Kochi, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala.Raids were conducted at the residences of Sala, Elamaram, Vice Chairman EM Abdul Rahman, National Executive member P Koya and former state president Karamana Ashraf in Kerala. Sources said laptops, pendrives, books and some other documents were seized by the ED officials from these premises. The ED had earlier recorded the statement of Salam, a Senior Assistant in the Kerala State Electricity Board, besides other office bearers in Delhi. In a statement, the Popular Front, which was formed in 2006, said, "the Modi government has always used national agencies against its political opponents and to crush dissent in the country to the point that the credibility of these agencies has come under question." It said the Centre has come under immense pressure following the Centre coming under "immense pressure" following the farmers' protests blocking Delhi and the ED raids are nothing but a "gimmick" to divert the issue. Elamaram told DH that the raids were part of a political ploy to divert attention from the ongoing farmers' stir. ED had sought certain details from the Popular Front several months back and all those were submitted. Now they have seized some laptops, pen drives and some books, which were quite common gadgets in most houses where students are studying, he said. Demonstrations were also held at various places in Kerala. The Popular Front has been under the ED lens since 2018 and the agency had claimed that at least Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in several bank accounts linked to the organisation between December 4 last year and January 6 this year in various parts of the country, which were used for fuelling anti-CAA protests. It had also said that around Rs 120 crore in accounts linked to Popular Front were also under the ED scanner.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ed-carries-out-raids-at-26-premises-linked-to-pfi-leaders-in-nine-states-922888.html

Vijayakumari is contesting as an independent candidate against her elder daughter Mini Krishnakumar, who is the BJP candidate of Ward no.18 of Koppam in Palakkad municipality. Vijayakumari, who has the backing of AAP, alleges that she and her younger daughter Sini have been facing severe physical and mental torture from Mini over the last many years because of family property disputes. Vijayakumari and Sini alleged that Mini and her husband Krishnakumar, who is a BJP leader, siphoned off about Rs. 15 lakh deposit of the family and are also trying to take possession of their house. Civil and criminal suits in this regard are pending. Vijayakumari said that she has decided to contest the election to let the people know that Mini who does not take care of her mother would not take care of the people as well. Meanwhile, Mini told DH that she did not want to comment on the allegations as the cases are pending before the court. She, however, alleged that Vijayakumari is not just backed by rival political parties, but other vested interest groups also. She also said that she is filing cases for defamation against them and would also approach Election Commission as they are gravely flouting the election code of conduct by distributing pamphlets raising personal allegations. The Palakkad municipality election is significant for the BJP as it is the lone municipality in Kerala where the saffron party is in power. Polling in the municipality is on December 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mother-takes-on-daughter-to-settle-personal-scores-in-kerala-local-body-polls-922904.html

The NGT principal bench headed by  Adarsh Kumar Goel said, "With a view to ensure the availability of air quality data, at least one air quality monitoring station must be set up at every district headquarter at the earliest. "Where no such monitoring station exists, atleast a manual monitoring station. This should not exceed three months in any case. This will be the responsibility of the State Pollution Control Board. The air quality data may be placed on the website of the District administration and also at prominent locations in the towns, in the form of AQI, PM2.5 and PM10," the bench added. The Tribunal passed this order after hearing a plea seeking a ban on crackers in NCR due to the rising air pollution and fear of increasing Covid-19 cases. "The fact remains that there are 740 Districts in the country and above 4000 cities It is absolutely necessary that atleast at every District Headquarter in all the 740 Districts, there should be an air quality monitoring station," the order said. "Any victim of pollution, apart from other remedies, can approach the District Magistrate for compensation, by showing evidence of individual damage and the person responsible for the damage," the order said. The Bench took note of a report filed by Central Pollution Control Board which maintained that overall, this year's Diwali had witnessed higher background levels of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ngt-asks-states-to-set-up-air-quality-monitoring-centre-in-every-district-922908.html

From then till 2017, the speculation on his impending political entry was non-stop. On the last day of 2017, however, he ended the speculation saying his entry into politics is certain. But he seemed to have developed a cold feet after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections which the DMK-led alliance swept, by putting the onus on his political entry on the people. On Thursday, he finally announced that he will launch his political party in January. Here is the chronology of the two-decade long suspense: 1996: Rajinikanth comes out in the open against the then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa saying “even god cannot save Tamil Nadu if she comes back to power again”. He backs the DMK-TMC alliance, which sweeps the polls. 1998: Rajinikanth backs the DMK-TMC alliance yet again in the 1998 Lok Sabha polls. The alliance bites the dust. 1999-2003: Rajinikanth refrains from supporting any political party or combine 2004: Rajinikanth asks his fans to vote out PMK candidates in Lok Sabha polls in May 2004 by covertly supporting the AIADMK dispensation. DMK-Congress-PMK alliance wins all 39 Lok Sabha seats. 2004-2017: Rajinikanth goes into “silent mode” December 31, 2017: Rajinikanth announces his entry into politics.

During a short discussion on Direct Benefits Transfer schemes, the House witnessed heated exchanges between the ruling YSR Congress and the TDP members. The TDP members protested and demanded that they be allowed to speak. As they trooped into the Well of the House, seven TDP legislators, including their deputy leader K Atchannaidu, were suspended from the House for a day. This was the fourth consecutive day during the ongoing winter session that the opposition members were suspended from the House. Following this, the other TDP members too walked out in protest. Earlier, tension prevailed in the House as some ministers rushed menacingly towards the TDP benches after a verbal duel between Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and TD Legislature Party deputy leader Nimmala Rama Naidu. The Chief Minister alleged the TDP leader was "deliberately misleading the House by telling lies." "I am moving a privilege motion against him," Jagan told Speaker T Seetaram. Rama Naidu, though off the mike, sought to hit back at the Chief Minister, but the Speaker said it would not go into the record. The Speaker then announced that he was referring to the Chief Minister's privilege motion to the "privilege motion" (committee). "You have misled the House by telling lies. Don't mislead the House," Seetaram told the TDP MLA. As the TDP members sought to raise a protest over this, the ministers rushed towards the opposition benches but some of the senior YSRC MLAs intervened and pulled them back. The TDP members then staged a walkout from the House. The ministers then took turns to lash out at the TDP after which a video film of Jagan's political rallies on the election eve last year was screened in the Assembly, to 'place on record' the various promises he made to the people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/uproar-in-andhra-pradesh-assembly-7-tdp-legislators-suspended-for-a-day-922935.html
03-12-2020||South||The unpredictability of Rajinikanth and his politics||Naan eppo varuven, eppadi varuvenu yaarukkum theriyathu, aana vara vendiya nerathula correcta varuven (No one knows when and how I will come, but I will come at the right time) - Rajinikanth in and as 'Muthu' Tamil superstar Rajinikanth truly lived up to this very famous punch dialogue that he delivered in his 1995 movie Muthu on Thursday when he announced that he will launch his political party and contest the 2021 assembly polls in Tamil Nadu. Only in October, the actor had given mixed signals. He termed a letter that was doing the rounds in his name as “fake” but admitted that portions relating to his health were “true.” After that statement, many concluded, the actor may wriggle out of his decision to launch a political party, but yet again, he proved he is unpredictable. The speculation about Rajinikanth taking the political plunge dates back to 1995 when he openly declared that the then AIADMK regime led by J Jayalalithaa should be voted out of power. In 1996, he supported DMK-TMC led by late Congress veteran G K Moopanaar, and the combine swept the polls trouncing Jayalalithaa and her AIADMK. However, Rajinikanth’s next two political statements supporting or denouncing a party did not create any magic among the people. The DMK-TMC combine which he supported in 1996 did not win in 1998 despite his lending voice and the PMK, against which he spoke in 2004, won all the six Lok Sabha seats it contested in 2004. And, the man kept up the suspense on his political entry for over two decades. He made a definite announcement on his plunge on the last day of 2017, but gave mixed signals in the three years that followed. Besides his age, Rajinikanth has to come clean on speculation that he is being backed by the BJP, which has no considerable base for now in Tamil Nadu, and what he means by ‘spiritual politics’. Prof. Ramu Manivannan, Head of the Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Madras, feels Rajinikanth’s political entry may ruffle the feathers but may not create any major impact. “The only thing that is consistent about Rajinikanth is that he is inconsistent. He has always said something, and done something quite opposite. And it is clear that he is a pawn in the hands of the BJP which has not been able to make any inroads here in Tamil Nadu,” Prof. Manivannan told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/the-unpredictability-of-rajinikanth-and-his-politics-922972.html

Though the run-up to the poll saw a high pitched campaign by the parties, the turnout of the voters on December 1 was an unimpressive 46.55 per cent (34.50 lakh) out of the total 74.67 lakh voters. Elaborate arrangements have been made for the counting process which would begin at 8 am on Friday. Counting centres have been set up at 30 places and the total number of personnel engaged in counting is 8,152, official sources said on Thursday. The entire counting process would be recorded with CCTV cameras installed at every counting table, they said. Ballot papers were used for the poll and consequently, the results are likely to be known only in the evening or in the night. The Telangana State Election Commission had decided to conduct the election with ballot papers after obtaining the views of major political parties, health department in view of Covid-19 and taking into consideration various relevant issues, the SEC said earlier. The lead up to the polling witnessed a vociferous campaign by the parties. Bolstered by its victory in the recent bypoll to Dubbak Assembly constituency, the BJP conducted a spirited campaign to win the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls to boost its chances in the 2023 Assembly polls. It has drafted its General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who has been its in-charge for Bihar, to supervise the poll preparations in Hyderabad. Top leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, party president J P Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar, Smriti Irani and MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy, who is Lok Sabha member from Secunderabad, party MP and BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya participated in the campaign. The BJP highlighted the TRS's "alliance" with the AIMIM and sought votes to provide clean and transparent administration in the city. The TRS, however, denied any alliance with the AIMIM. The TRS's campaign was led by its working president and state Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao, while party supremo and Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao addressed a public meeting. The state's ruling party has deployed several state Ministers and legislators for canvassing in the city. The Congress's poll battle was led by its state president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and Working President A Revanth Reddy (both MPs) and other senior leaders. The TDP, once a major force in the state, sought to revive its fortunes highlighting the development witnessed in the city, including in the IT sector, during N Chandrababu Naidu's regime as Chief Minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh. The TRS and BJP leaders were engaged in a war of words. BJP's Telangana president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar found himself in a row following his comments that his party would conduct a "surgical strike" in the old city here, if necessary, to send away Rohingyas and Pakistanis after it wins the post of Mayor in the polls. AIMIM's Akbaruddin Owaisi in a poll campaign earned the wrath of his opponents by asking whether the 'samadhis' of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and TDP founder N T Rama Rao, built on the Hussain Sagar lake bank, would be removed as he questioned the eviction drive against "poor people" residing near water bodies. The polls in the city also assume political significance as 24 Assembly segments fall under the GHMC limits.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-civic-poll-counting-of-votes-begins-on-friday-922984.html
03-12-2020||South||GHMC exit polls: TRS set to retain civic body; big gains for the BJP||Various exit polls have shown that the TRS is set to retain the mayor seat of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Most of the pollsters say that the ruling party in the state could win 78 or above seats.  The latest civic body polls were held two months ahead of the normal course by the Telangana election commission, which the opposition parties alleged was at the behest of CM Chandrasekhar Rao to suit his electoral interests. The striking point however is the dramatic rise of the BJP's influence in the city, where it was confined to only four wards five years back. The BJP could win anywhere between 25 to 35 seats, most of the surveys predict. The least that any projection gave to the saffron party is 12 seats. Contesting in 51 wards, AIMIM could win around 35-40 seats. All the exit polls are unambiguous about the rout of the Congress party in the civic body polls. The party is given a maximum of around five seats. The counting for the ballot based GHMC polls held on Tuesday would take place on Friday. The GHMC has a total of 150 wards, each represented by a councillor/corporator. While polls for the 149 wards were held on Tuesday, a re-poll was conducted in Old Malakpet on Thursday. Polls of this one ward were canceled midway as it was found that CPI(M)'s symbol was printed on the ballot papers instead of the CPI's. The BJP which complained of rigging in two wards of the old city has approached the Telangana High Court asking for a re-poll. The Tuesday voting percentage of 149 wards was marked at 46.5 per cent, over one percent above the 2016 turnout and setting the highest polling record in the GHMC's three-time elections history. The previous GHMC polls held in February 2016 saw the TRS sweep with 99 wards, while Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM was elected in 44 wards. The BJP was elected in four seats, Congress 2 and TDP 1. The civic body polls were held two months ahead of the normal course by the Telangana election commission, which the opposition BJP etc parties alleged was at the behest of CM Chandrasekhar Rao to suit his electoral interests. The poll process confined to two weeks saw the BJP engage in the electioneering of an unprecedented scale, with several of its prominent national leaders descending for campaigning for the municipal polls. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the state unit chief Bandi Sanjay after the polls, to take stock of the party prospects. Following the Dubbaka by-poll victory, the BJP took the Hyderabad civic body polls, encompassing 24 constituencies out of the total 119 MLA seats, as its groundwork to spread its sway in the state for the 2023 Telangana assembly polls. The GHMC poll results are expected to offer the public perception of the K Chandrasekhar Rao government, which completes two years of its second term this month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ghmc-exit-polls-trs-set-to-retain-civic-body-big-gains-for-the-bjp-922988.html

Though the daily number of pilgrims on weekdays and weekends were initially fixed at 1000 and 2,000, it has now been increased to 2,000 and 3,000 respectively, considering the plea of the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages temple citing the steep fall in revenue from the temple.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-temple-sees-an-increase-in-covid-19-cases-923022.html

The party chose the occasion to take a swipe at the "dynastic politics" of archrival DMK and urged its cadres to strive hard and ensure a spectacular victory in next year's assembly polls by defeating all the inimical forces. "We should strive hard together to fulfil her dreams and goals and ensure a big win for the AIADMK (in the 2021 assembly elections)" party Coordinator O Panneerselvam and Co-coordinator K Palaniswami said in a statement. Palaniswami is the chief minister of Tamil Nadu while Panneerselvam is his deputy. The party cadres should light clay lamps in front of a portrait of the "revolutionary leader" who ushered in numerous welfare schemes for the people, at 6 pm on December 5, and take a solemn pledge to fulfil the late leader's dreams and goals, they said. In an apparent reference to the DMK, they said, "dynastic politics" perpetrated by a "group of conspirators" should be uprooted and Jayalalithaa's rule should be extended by another term. The party has been in power since 2011. Jayalalithaa died on December 5, 2016, here after 75 days of hospitalisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/light-lamps-take-pledge-to-fulfill-jayalalithaas-dreams-aiadmk-923048.html

For the past 25 days, women, men and young farmers are staging a sit-in protest against the move of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) to acquire 1,277 acres of agricultural land. Their demand is “Return our land to us.”  These farmers take turns and around 100 farmers hold a peaceful demonstration at a designated place every day, which is also the entry point to the villages from National Highway 75.  “This is irrigated land and we grow a variety of crops - from paddy and finger millet to coconut, arecanut and vegetables. We have clearly objected to the KIADB notice and refused to give away our land. Why is there no action from the government yet?” says 50-year-old Gowramma. She has been participating in the protest every day. “We are small farmers. This year I might lose my crop, but this is the question of my land and life. This is the only source of livelihood for us and I can’t afford to lose it,” she says.  In August 2020, the state government notified 1,277 acres of land in four villages - Channapura, Hatna, Bilagunda and Beechanahalli, as industrial area and served notice to the villagers. Shocked, villagers contacted the officials and registered their dissent. They also held a mass protest, blocking NH 75 briefly. Soon the government announced that there won’t be any hasty action in this regard.  However, Krishna, one of the protesters, says, “KIADB officials came to the village for the initial land survey (joint survey) last month which angered us and that was when we decided to symbolically block the road to the village till the government denotifies the land.” Social activist V Gayathri, who recently visited the protesters, said the entire area has ecological significance considering its proximity to the Adichunchanagiri Peacock Sanctuary and Markonahalli Dam, where a drinking water project is underway. Along with the protests, the villagers are also meeting officials and lawmakers to resolve the issue. “We have only seen conflicting statements. Everyone says they won’t cause injustice to farmers. But we don’t see any action in this regard,” says Mahesh, another protester. B C Shivananda Murthy, Assistant Commissioner, Pandavapura, who visited the protesters on November 30, says, “The law doesn’t require KIADB to discuss with the farmers before notifying the land. The land is identified based on various parameters including access and resources. If the government decides to revoke the decision, it will take time and there is a procedure to be followed. I will inform the farmers’ views to higher officials.”  K M Suresh Kumar, Special Land Acquisition Officer, KIADB, Mysuru, told DH: “As per the new government circular, we should produce the final notification (after the completion of the joint measurement survey/certificate) within two months of notifying the land. The farmers here haven’t allowed us to enter the village. We have submitted the status report to the government. We haven’t got direction from the government to withhold the survey.”   As the government is taking its own time to take action, farmers fear politics is being played out to fizzle out the campaign and acquire the land.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/nagamangala-farmers-stand-guard-against-land-acquisition-protest-enters-25th-day-922693.html

The agenda was approved in the Council meeting chaired by MCC Deputy Mayor Janaki alias Vedavathi on Wednesday. The two buildings with vegetables and fish stalls (on T S number 180, 181, 181 B and 182 in Kasba Bazar) were in a dilapidated condition. “The market buildings were beyond repair and keeping public interest in mind there is a need for a new market complex with all basic facilities,” Chief Whip of the Council Premananda Shetty said. Notices had been served to traders in the building. MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said many were not satisfied with PWD’s report submitted on the stability of building. A third-party agency too, in its report, had claimed that the building was fit for demolition. There are 31 legal traders who have trade licences in their name and are carrying out businesses in the building after the High Court order. A few traders had appealed to the MCC on rehabilitating them and many had declared on making their own arrangements, the Commissionersaid. Opposition leader Abdul Ravoof said over 470 traders were carrying out businesses in the market complex prior to the shifting of traders to APMC yard in Baikampady. More than 3,000 people are dependent on Central Market for their livelihood. All traders in the Central Market should be rehabilitated, he stressed. There is a proposal under Mangaluru Smart City Mission Limited (MSCML) to develop the new market on PPP (public private partnership) mode at a cost of Rs 145 crore. Traffic congestion Congress Corporator Praveenchandra Alva, raising the issue of traffic congestion and lack of parking areas in the city, accused police of creating confusion by notifying no parking areas without consulting the MCC. Due to the ongoing road works in different parts of the city, the towing of vehicles for parking in no parking areas should be stopped temporarily. Further, the mayor should also convene a meeting with the police to discuss traffic woes. Not potable water Raising the issue of poor quality of water supplied to the citizens, Congress corporator A C Vinayaraj said that he had samples of water tested in fisheries college laboratory. The report had confirmed presence of fecal coliform in the water supplied to residents. BJP corporator Sudheer Shetty said water for testing should have been collected in the presence of officials. MCC Commissioner assured that the quality of water will be tested by an independent authority.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mcc-council-approves-demolition-of-central-market-922856.html

"The farmers who commit suicide are cowards. Only a coward who can't take care of his wife and children commits suicide. When we have fallen (in the water), we have to swim and win," Patil said addressing farmers at Ponnampet in Kodagu district of Karnataka. The minister was explaining to bamboo growers of Ponnampet how profitable the agriculture business is, but some cowards do not realise that and commit suicide. To buttress his point, Patil cited an example of a woman who was wearing gold bangles. "When I enquired with her how her hands were full of gold bangles, You know what she said? She said, "This mother earth has given me for my 35 years of toil." "Doesn't this please you all after listening to this?" Patil told the gathering. He said when a woman who had depended herself entirely on agriculture and achieved big why other farmers cannot do it. Reacting to this, Congress Karnataka unit spokesperson V S Ugrappa condemned the Minister's statement, saying he has shown disrespect to the farming community. "It's a disrespect to the farmers. He should apologise for it," Ugrappa told PTI. He said the Minister should have gone into the subject to find why some farmers commit suicide. "No farmer wishes to end life. There are many reasons such as floods and droughts, which have not been understood and solved yet. Instead of understanding the gravity of the problem, the Minister gives such an irresponsible statement," Ugrappa said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/farmers-who-commit-suicide-are-cowards-karnataka-agri-minister-b-c-patil-922882.html

According to the complaint, they got to know about it only after the miscreants sent a friend request to a few contacts who are already in the friends’ list of Santhosh’s original account. On November 30, the miscreants sent messages to many persons in messenger asking them to send him money citing some emergency, Vinod said in the complaint.  One of the friends, identified as Ajith Shetty Kiradi, believed that the message was sent by Santhosh and responded to the message. The miscreants sent him a mobile number and asked him to transfer the money to that number through UPI transaction. Kiradi sent Rs 15,000. When many people got such messages, some of them alerted Santhosh and his assistants, Vinod said in the complaint.   All others in Santhosh’s friends’ list were immediately alerted about the fraud and were requested not to entertain any such messages on social media, he said. An investigating officer said, “We have registered a case under the Information Technology Act and cheating under IPC section. Efforts are on to nab the miscreants.” The miscreants impersonate the prominent personalities having accounts on social media, so that they can make quick and easy money. Recently, the CID officials had arrested a gang which was into similar fraud, the officer said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/complaint-over-fake-social-media-account-of-b-l-santhosh-923013.html

03-12-2020||State||Karnataka pushes for rural-to-urban shift amid slack progress||Eyeing a grant of Rs 1,000 crore from the Centre, Karnataka has offered to urbanize 90 more rural pockets across the state, close on the heels of the government upgrading nearly three dozen gram panchayats as urban local bodies.  The state government has asked the Centre for additional funds through the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission, under which eight rural clusters are being urbanized at present. Each cluster, like a gram panchayat, will have geographically contiguous villages with smaller populations.  “Typically, rural areas that are tending towards urbanity, such as villages near a district headquarter, are formed into a cluster,” Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) principal secretary L K Atheeq said. “We have now asked the Centre to take up 90 new clusters in the state, for which we’ve sought Rs 1,000 crore.”  This works out to Rs 10-12 crore investment per cluster. The government will go with any rural cluster the Centre wants to select. “There are guidelines followed by the Centre to select clusters. So, for the 90 new clusters that we’ve proposed, we haven’t identified them on our own,” an official said.   The Centre’s Rurban Mission, which was launched in 2016, has already selected eight rural clusters for urbanization in the scheme - Kangrali (Belagavi), Haragadde (Bengaluru Urban), Hulkoti (Gadag), Gurugunta (Raichur), Dhanapura, Toranagallu, Holalu and Moka (Ballari). According to officials, the idea is to pump money into such clusters for infrastructure development - water supply, livelihood, agriculture and so on - and prep them to be upgraded into municipalities.  Last month, Karnataka decided to bring 33 rural areas under urban limits. This includes many gram panchayats being upgraded as town municipal councils or town panchayats as well as villages located on the outskirts of Bengaluru.  But, authorities have expressed concern over the progress achieved under the Rurban Mission so far. The eight clusters in the state have an outlay of Rs 575.46 crore this fiscal, against which expenditure is Rs 175.93 crore - just 30%.  “Progress is slow indeed,” former RDPR minister H K Patil, who got his native Hulkoti in Gadag selected under the Rurban Mission, said. “Maybe the slowness was because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But things have to movefast.”  One reason for the slackness is administrative. “Administratively, it becomes a very small scheme. We need to give separate staff for it,” an official said. “Also, while the Centre provides funds, a lot of the money is dovetailed from existing central and state schemes.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-pushes-for-rural-to-urban-shift-amid-slack-progress-923028.html

The gullible and hapless sections of the society, particularly the youth, are falling prey to online gambling and betting in the midst of a pandemic situation, the petition said.   The petitioner claimed that the High Courts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have directed their respective jurisdictional state legislatures to explore the possibilities of regulating the regime. “The state has no mechanism to monitor whether any online game or activity is a game of chance or involves skill. For instance, it is well-settled today that the Game of Rummy is a game of skill. However, what holds good for the game in the offline mode may not be true for the online mode. The state has not bothered to create any monitoring mechanism to ascertain whether the online Rummy offered by various virtual gaming platforms,” the petition said.

The NCB top brass was rattled when TV celebrity couple Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa secured bail easily from the Magistrate's court in Mumbai even though they had during their interrogation admitted consuming and possessing ganja. Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone's manager Karisma Prakash, who was interrogated by the NCB several times and later refused to respond to summons, had also managed to secure an anticipatory bail. The residences of Bharti-Haarsh and Karishma were raided by the NCB. NCB's Mumbai Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede had ordered a departmental inquiry. On October 27, the NCB had recovered 1.7 grams of marijuana and some bottles of CBD oil from Karishma's residence. The custodial interrogation of Karishma would have been very important as she knows several Bollywood A-listers. When the flat of Bharti-Haarsh was raided on November 21, the NCB had seized 86.50 gm of ganja. They could secure bail as the officers were not present in court when the bail application was taken up. Meanwhile, the NCB has moved the Sessions Court in Mumbai, seeking cancellation of the celebrity couple's bail. Among the celebrities questioned earlier include Arjun Rampal, Rakul Preet Singh, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. The NCB is carrying out two investigations – one into the drug angle vis-à-vis Sushant Singh Rajput's death case and the other the larger Bollywood drug-cartel nexus. Nearly 25 persons, including Sushant’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik, were arrested. Subsequently, Rhea and Showik were granted conditional bail by the Bombay High Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bollywood-drug-cartel-nexus-2-ncb-officials-suspended-922813.html

A bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the order was disproportionate and could lead to health problems. The court, however, asserted that masks were compulsory and violators should be penalised as per the law. "The people not wearing masks are violating the fundamental rights of other persons," the bench said. "The Centre comes out with SOPs and guidelines but what about their implementation? People are gathering for marriages, 1000s of people," the bench said. "People are roaming in malls. People are getting together. What about the implementation?'' the bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who agreed that strong measures were required. Mehta mentioned the matter sought an urgent hearing. The Union government had challenged the order by the HC passed on Wednesday. "Though the problem of people not wearing mask is serious, this is not the solution," Mehta said, referring to the punishment to them, which included serving in Covid wards. He highlighted that the harm done by not wearing masks was lesser than sending such persons to a Covid-19 centre. "This is very difficult to execute, you are right," the bench said, adding "however, there is a lack of will though so far as implementation is concerned and the HC has taken note of it". Mehta agreed that the problem must be addressed on a war footing. "Social distancing and masks are the only available options for citizens. That is the only solution available to humanity," he said. Mehta also said "perhaps, it was in our culture, to be indisciplined, hanging masks have also become the norm''. He also said a fine of Rs 1,000 was being imposed on those not wearing masks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sc-stays-gujarat-hc-order-to-send-people-not-wearing-masks-to-serve-at-covid-centres-922832.html
03-12-2020||West||Javed Akhtar submits statement in defamation case against Kangana Ranaut||Bollywood lyricist Javed Akhtar on Thursday recorded his statement through his lawyer before a metropolitan court here in connection with the complaint of defamation filed by him against actor Kangana Ranaut. Akhtar had last month filed a criminal complaint against Ranaut before the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate, for allegedly making defamatory and baseless comments against him in television interviews. He had sought action against the actor under relevant sections of the IPC. As part of the process, the veteran poet-lyricist recorded his statement through his lawyer before the magistrate for verification of the complaint. The court is slated to hear the matter on December 19. The complaint said that Ranaut had made baseless comments against Akhtar, which caused damage to his reputation. It added that Ranaut dragged Akhtar's name while referring to a "coterie" existing in Bollywood following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June this year. She had also claimed that Akhtar had threatened her to not speak about her alleged relationship with actor Hrithik Roshan, it said. All these statements made by Ranaut have garnered views in lakhs and thus tarnished Akhtar's reputation, the complaint said.  Reacting to the development, Ranaut tweeted, "Single woman/lone warrior fighting against Bullywood suicide gang, drug mafia, fascist government, tukde gang all at once, I may have chosen a difficult life but it’s an honour to awaken my nation to all the threats we face against our unity and integrity."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/javed-akhtar-submits-statement-in-defamation-case-against-kangana-ranaut-922874.html

A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik perused a medical report submitted by the Nanavati hospital here where Rao was admitted on November 18. "There is some slight improvement. He shall continue to remain admitted there till December 14," the court said. The HC will hear the petition filed by Rao seeking bail on medical grounds and another filed by his wife Hemalata seeking that he be shifted to Nanavati hospital from jail for medical treatment on December 14. On November 18, the high court had noted that Rao was 81 years old, suffered from neurological ailments and also needed post-Covid-19 care after recovering from the viral infection. A person was on death bed and in such circumstances, the state government cannot say that he should be treated in the jail, the court had said. Following the court's observations, the Maharashtra government had on November 18 agreed to shift Rao from Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai to the Nanavati hospital and also to bear the expenses of his treatment. The HC on Thursday said that the lawyers of the petitioners as well as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) -- which is probing the case -- shall go through the medical report, and posted the matter for further hearing on December 14. Rao had been in and out of the state-run JJ hospital in the city and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018. On July 16 this year he tested positive for coronavirus and was shifted to the Nanavati hospital. He was discharged on July 30 and sent back to the prison. His and his wife's petitions claimed that he was suffering from several ailments. Rao and a few other left-leaning activists were arrested for alleged links with Naxals following the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune on December 31, 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/varavara-rao-to-stay-at-private-hospital-till-december-14-bombay-hc-922884.html

Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who ordered re-investigation by the state CID, had no power to do so as the previous probe by the Alibaug police in Raigad district had been closed last year, it said. Goswami, one of the accused in the case which is being re-investigated, was arrested by Alibaug police last month before the Supreme Court granted him bail. Stating that his arrest on November 4 was illegal, Goswami in his plea also urged the HC to transfer the investigation to the CBI or any other independent agency. The Maharashtra government in May this year ordered a reinvestigation out of vendetta, the petition alleged. "The Home Department...or any other government authority does not have the power to order a reinvestigation or fresh investigation in a case where an `A summary' report (clsoure report) is filed and the same is accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate," the petition said. Deshmukh announced at a press conference in November that a "strong charge sheet" would be filed against Goswami, which showed that the state machinery was interfering in the case with a "malafide premeditated diktat to the law and order officers", it said. The re-investigation could not have been ordered without a judicial sanction and hence, the CID probe is illegal and "abuse of the process of law", Goswami said. The announcement of reinvestigation reeked of the "malice, spiteful nature and vendetta of the political dispensation" in Maharashtra, the petition claimed. Goswami also sought permission to amend his main petition seeking quashing of the FIR. He wanted to add arguments against the state home department's letter of May 26 which announced re-investigation and about which he learnt only last month, he said. Interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud Naik committed suicide in 2018, allegedly because of non-payment of dues by firms of Goswami and two others. After the alleged abetment to suicide case was reopened, Goswami and other two were arrested on November 4, but the Supreme Court granted them bail on November 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-seeks-to-stay-filing-of-charge-sheet-in-suicide-case-922928.html
03-12-2020||West||The MVA govt has four wheels not three: Uddhav Thackeray||Rejecting the BJP charge that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is a “three-wheeler autorickshaw”, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that there are actually four wheels - which political opponents failed to notice. BJP leaders including Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar, and state BJP President Chandrakant Patil often describe the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress and allies as a “three-wheeler autorickshaw” or “three-wheeler vehicle”. Without naming BJP, Thackeray said, “We are often described as three-wheeler vehicle…but let me tell you…we do not have three wheels but actually four….the fourth being the faith of the people….this is a ‘rath’ of ‘janata’ with four wheels,” Thackeray said in presence of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who is the architect of the MVA dispensation that prevented BJP from returning to power in Maharashtra.  Pawar said that there is no doubt that the government will run for 5 years but now lay the foundation for 25 years. Thackeray further said that there is “total coordination” among the three parties and its smaller allies. “Pawar saheb guides us regularly ....(Congress President) Sonia Gandhi speaks to me over the phone on a regular basis,” he said. Referring to the BJP charge and criticism that he works from home, he said, “There is absolute teamwork…everyone knows what has to be done…my colleagues move around….I also admire Pawar saheb…he regularly moves across the state.” In a lighter vein, he said, “I need not have to tap the phones of others…..anyway the Home department is not with me…but on a serious note...we have mutual faith and respect for each other. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and state Congress President and Revenue Minister also spoke on the occasion. “From the day the MVA came to power there have been talks that this government will fall…don’t believe in all that…we will complete a full term, let me assure…even though we have different ideologies, we work on the basis of a common minimum program,” said Ajit Pawar. On the occasion a booklet ‘Maharashtra Thambla Nahi, Maharashtra Thambnar Nahi’ (Maharashtra Never Stopped, Maharashtra Will Never Stop’ – highlights the achievements of one year. “Let me add….Maharashtra has never been afraid or frightened and we will never be afraid or frightened,” added Thackeray as MVA leaders unveiled the booklet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/the-mva-govt-has-four-wheels-not-three-uddhav-thackeray-922933.html

The monument was formally unveiled by Maharashtra Tourism, Environment and Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray in the presence of  Rear Admiral V Srinivas, Flag Officer Commanding Maharashtra Naval Area. Located at the popular junction of Bandra Bandstand, the monument stands tall and proud next to the Arabian Sea, reminding the city of the heyday of the aircraft's illustrious service towards safeguarding the maritime frontiers of the nation. Built by the British Aerospace, India was only the second country to fly the Sea Harrier when it was inducted in 1983. The Sea Harrier, a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing/Vertical Take-Off and Landing (STOVL/ VTOL) jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft, was operated from the deck of INS Viraat. It operated from Viraat for the last time on March 6, 2016. The monument showcases the Indian Navy's aviation capabilities as also keeping the legacy of aircraft carrier Viraat alive. The aircraft formed part of the INAS 300 squadron popularly known as "White Tigers" whose legacy is being continued by the latest MIG 29 K fighters onboard INS Vikramaditya. “Dedication of this monument to the citizens of Mumbai is the reassurance of devotion and commitment of the Indian Navy towards safeguarding our maritime boundaries,” an Indian Navy spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/indian-navys-sea-harrier-gets-a-dedicated-memorial-in-mumbai-922944.html

Disale (32) works with the Zilla Parishad Primary School at Paritewadi in Madha in Solapur district. "I am overwhelmed…it is a great honour for me and India," Disale told DH over the phone from his home in Solapur hours after the awards were announced at the Natural History Museum in London in a virtual ceremony. "One of the major aspects of the award is that it reposes faith in education in government’s schools," he said, adding that he had been teaching for nearly a decade. "Teachers were game-changers, are game-changers and will remain game-changers," he said. The Global Teacher Prize is an annual award given away by the Varkey Foundation, in partnership with UNESCO, to a teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession. The award carries a purse of US $1 million (Rs 7.37 crore). Disale has decided to share half the prize money with the nine other finalists. This is the first time in the Global Teacher Prize's six-year history that the overall winner has shared the prize money with other finalists. Disale initially wanted to be an IT engineer, but after engineering college did not work out as he anticipated, his father suggested teacher training as an alternative. Disale enrolled himself in a teachers' training college after he gave up on engineering dreams. He saw that teachers are the real change-makers in the world, and decided to become one. The first school he taught in was in a dilapidated building, sandwiched between a cattle shed and a storeroom. Most of the girls were from tribal communities that did not prioritise girls’ education, and the practice of teenage marriage was common. Additionally, the curriculum was in Marathi and not in the students' primary Kannada language, which meant that many students were unable to achieve expected learning outcome. Disale learned Kannada and redesigned all the textbooks of Grades 1 to 4 for better comprehension, along with unique QR codes that embedded audio poems, video lectures, stories and assignments in Kannada. "The impact of Ranjitsinh (Disale's) interventions has been extraordinary: there are now no teenage marriages in the village and 100% attendance by girls at the school. The school was also recently awarded the best school in the district with 85% of his students achieving A grades in annual exams. One girl from the village has now graduated from a university, something seen as an impossible dream before Ranjitsinh arrived," says the official citation on the GTP website. In terms of his wider impact, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has recognized Disale’s work as one of three stories from India in his book Hit Refresh. The central government had named Disale as Innovative Researcher of the Year 2016. He also won the National Innovation Foundation's Innovator of the Year award in 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/solapur-zilla-parishad-teacher-ranjitsinh-disale-bags-1-million-global-teacher-prize-2020-922968.html

The comments by the religious figure come at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government is facing flak from the Opposition, as well as civil society groups over three projects being pushed by the Central government related to the rail, road and power sectors. "There are so many ways in which we can spread the light of our faith in our community and society. For example, the environment is our common home. It is our responsibility to defend it. But when we witness so much bad multiplying around us -- we witness a situation in which the earth, the environment is being sullied, we are witnessing plans which will bring bad to the society," the Archbishop said in his sermon at a religious event. "In such a situation, when there are plans that instead of bringing good, they will only lead to more pollution, will only put our lives and future in jeopardy, then we cannot afford to say I do not care or that this does not matter to me," said Ferrao. 50,000 trees in and around Mollem, a village located along the Goa-Karnataka border, have been slotted for felling for three Central government projects. The projects which primarily deal with doubling of the South Western Railway tracks, widening of the National Highway 4A and setting up of a private power plant, have already been cleared by the National Wildlife Board for Wildlife in April this year. Activists, as well as Opposition parties, fear that the projects are aimed at facilitating increased transportation of coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port Trust to the steel mills in Karnataka’s Bellary district and nearby areas. The Archbishop's comments are inadvertently expected to provide a fillip to the protestors as well as the Opposition, which has been targetting the BJP-led coalition government over the issue. Ferrao in her sermon also said, that the Spanish Saint Francis Xavier, who is revered as the patron saint of Goa, also spoke against injustices and urged the people of Goa to speak out "when the environment is likely to be polluted when intergenerational equity is not being enhanced and preserved".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/speak-up-against-projects-which-damage-environment-goa-archbishop-923017.html
