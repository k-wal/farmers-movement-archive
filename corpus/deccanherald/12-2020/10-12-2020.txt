Preliminary investigations conducted by AIIMS have revealed traces of lead and nickel in blood samples of patients suffering from the disease. Experts say that lead and nickel content in drinking water and milk could have caused the disease, which since evening of December 5, has left over 561 people sick and one person dead. Patients have complained of a variety of symptoms, including headache, vomiting, dizziness, anxiety, memory loss and convulsions. Doctors have been struggling with multiple challenges. Foremost among these is the lack of information on the cause of the disease. Consequently, doctors were treating patients for their symptoms.  Besides, the sudden outbreak of the disease and the large number of cases put hospitals under immense pressure. The ‘mystery disease’ has also struck at a difficult time; health infrastructure is already under severe strain from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many patients had to be shifted to hospitals in nearby cities for treatment. While the AIIMS study revealed presence of heavy metals in patients’ blood samples, this finding needs to be confirmed by more studies. We need to know whether this was indeed the trigger for the disease and why it led to an outbreak now. Were there other triggers that caused the heavy metals in people’s blood to react the way they did?  The immediate focus of health authorities should be on treatment of patients and ensuring that there is no relapse of symptoms. Besides, there has been a crowding of patients in hospitals in recent days. A surge in Covid-19 infections is possible and health authorities must step up testing to contain any spread. If the cause of the ‘mystery disease’ is indeed the presence of lead and nickel in water and milk, then the Eluru outbreak should serve as a wake-up call. Several studies, including the ones conducted by government bodies like the Central Water Commission, have been drawing attention to the high contamination of India’s water bodies by one or more heavy metals such as chromium, lead, nickel and iron. Although the presence of these metals in drinking water is known to slowly trigger muscular and neurological degeneration in our bodies, we have not acted robustly to reduce such contamination. A part of the reason for this laxity is that such degeneration often happens slowly. The outbreak of the ‘mystery disease’ at Eluru shows that the degeneration can be sudden and swift as well. It’s a warning we must heed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/warning-signals-from-andhra-pradeshs-eluru-925555.html
10-12-2020||In Perspective||What doomed India’s RCEP entry||Mid-November, 15 Asian nations signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the largest free trade agreement, creating the world’s largest trading bloc. All 10 members of ASEAN, plus Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea became signatories.  After eight years of delicate negotiations, RCEP aims to cut tariffs across the Asia-Pacific and strengthen supply-chain linkages regionwide. Conspicuously absent was India, world’s fifth-largest economy. In 2019, New Delhi had conveyed its apprehension to the members of the RCEP bloc, including Japan, suggesting that the agreement would create an uncontrollable influx of cheap Chinese goods.  India’s fractured relationship with Beijing stood out among its chief concerns, exacerbating tensions by exploiting its massive trade gap with China, which is now only second to the United States. India has defended its decision not to join the RCEP on a number of grounds, including that farmers and agricultural producers will be at a disadvantage, in addition to anticipated losses to its MSME and dairy sectors.  The primary apprehension for India stems from the fact that farmers and small to medium-sized industries are not well integrated to the global supply chain and being a party to RCEP would have amounted to putting the cart before the horse for these crucial sectors. India has alleged that China has engaged in a number of unfair trade practices, keeping entire sectors of the Chinese economy off limits to Indian companies, including India’s vast information technology sector. Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, Beijing’s trade gap has widened, to almost $49 billion in 2019-20. Exports to China were about $17 billion while imports stood at $65 billion.  In June 2019, almost all of RCEP’s eventual entrants opposed India’s insistence on strict criteria to determine the source of entry of a product. Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed to the free flow of goods making their way into the country via the South Asia Free Trade Pact and the Duty-Free Quota-Free window via Bangladesh.  India raised objections to the elimination of import duties by up to 90% which economists feared would have exacerbated the flood of imports across borders and widened India’s trade deficit with China. Earlier on, India had complained about the lack of availability of most-favoured-nation (MFN) obligations, which would have forced India to provide similar benefits to RCEP countries that it used to provide to others. Prior to the arrival of Modi, India had already opened its markets to most of ASEAN countries but felt lack of reciprocity, evidenced by Indonesia’s only partial opening to India.  Part of India’s RCEP failure is domestic. Since Modi took power in 2014, India has struck a protectionist tone, clinging to both a “Make in India” campaign that sought to increase manufacturing domestically and encourage foreign direct investment and a policy of self-reliance (atmanirbhar), which aimed to support domestic industries.  A recent legislation allowed farmers to sell directly to private buyers and enter into contracts with private companies, a move that the Modi government hoped would stimulate growth. Farmers claim it leaves them vulnerable to free market pressures. RCEP, some suggested, would have disadvantaged low-income farmers.  Ill-timed For example, RCEP could have done irreparable damage to India’s small family farms as they would be vulnerable to competition from more industrialised and modern industries in Australia and New Zealand. India’s agricultural sector comprises about 15% of the $2.9 trillion national economy and employs more than 600 million people. As India’s economy has suffered greatly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of free trade to people whose livelihoods depend on a degree of protectionism appeared ill-timed.  In the near term, India will have to sit on the fence of RCEP and negotiate with signatories on a bilateral basis, where it hopes to have more leg room for negotiations while preserving national interests. However, ignoring a trading pact that includes almost half the world’s population is arguably short sided. First, as India seeks to become a more entrenched power in the wider Indo-Pacific region, not being active in the largest partnership allows other powers like China to shape trade without it, limiting New Delhi’s ability to shape RCEP’s architecture.  Minus RCEP, India’s trade options are limited. While it has firmed up its Indo-Pacific alliances as evidenced by the Quad, it has distanced itself from Asia-centred trade agreements and focused its energies on the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.  This isolationism, regionalism, and experiment with self-reliance have left India vulnerable. Being a formidable regional power also means learning to live with the costs. While RCEP would have forced India to make a number of concessions, the consequences are that New Delhi doesn’t get to play a leading role in shaping trade norms in an increasingly interconnected Indo-Pacific.

T V Shivakumar Sharma, K S Lakshmi Narayana Somayaji, K S Ganesh Somayaji, Nagaraja Adiga flew to the national capital from Sringeri, while Raghavendra Bhat and Rishyasringa from Delhi Branch of the Math joined them. The rituals and pujas were conducted as per Hindu traditions since 8:00 a.m. Priests performed Guru Puja, Ganapathi Puja, Punya Vachana, Adikesha Puja, Anantha Pooja, Varaha Puja, Vastu Puja,  Kshethrapala and  Bhuvaneshwari Puja. The Prime Minister placed a silver brick sent by Bharathi Teertha Swamiji of Sharada Peetha at 1 pm. Later a ‘sarva dharma prarthana’ (all-religion prayer) was also conducted. Religious leaders of different faiths recited prayers and gave their blessings for the new building. Soon after the date for the event was fixed, the Prime Minister had asked Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi to arrange the priests from to conduct the ceremony. “I contacted Bharathi Thirtha Swamiji and he agreed to send experienced priests,” Joshi said. During his address, the prime minister also recalled Anubhava Mantapa set up by 12th century social reformer Basavanna. He said Basavannat had set up the Anubhava Mantapa in the 12th century much before the Magna Carta was granted by the King of England in 1215. “Basavanna also said Anubhava Mantapa will work for development and welfare of people and country. Its work will inspire everybody. This is also one kind of democracy,” Modi said in Kannada quoting Basavanna.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/sringeri-priests-perform-puja-for-new-parliament-building-925822.html

Speaking to media persons here on Thursday, he said, "let him make such statements only when the Congress party comes to power. The State government has passed the anti-cow slaughter bill in the Assembly, and the people of the State have welcomed it. Our government would complete its full term and it would implement development works," he added. He also thanked the JD(S) legislators who backed the bill. JD(S) legislators too have now realised the other face of Congress party. "Let us wait and see what happens in future," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/congress-wont-come-to-power-to-withdraw-anti-cow-slaughter-law-byrathi-basavaraj-925860.html

10-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Congress stages walkout as Council approves APMC Bill||The controversial Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (Regulation and Development) (Amendment) Bill was passed in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, amidst a rousing dissent by Opposition leaders.  A heated debate ensued in the Legislative Council on Wednesday with opposition leaders alleging ulterior motives behind the move. The session ended with Congress leaders staging a walkout, even as the Bill was passed in the Council.  Defending the state government’s move, co-operation minister S T Somashekar said the proposal was taken up at the state-level only after visiting all the APMCs. “We visited the APMCs and studied how the auction was done. We have held meetings with APMC committees. The chief minister has also met with farmers. There were no objections about the legislation,” he said. He added that unlike popular perception, MSP for produce would not cease to exist with the proposed amendment.  Supporting the protesting farmers across the country, Opposition leaders questioned why the government was in haste to bring in the legislation without holding any debate with stakeholders.  Congress MLC B K Hariprasad alleged that the legislation would threaten the food security in the country, handing over control to private entities.  With farmers across the country protesting against the legislation, the Centre will likely be forced to roll it back. In such a situation, what is the point in passing the Bill in Karnataka, questioned Congress MLC R Thimmapur.  If corporate entities have control over the produce market, the prices of essential commodities will skyrocket. The government should give clarity on who will fix the MSP and how it will control corporate bodies, Thimmapur sought to know.  JD(S) legislator Marithibbe Gowda alleged that instead of solving the problem of middlemen, the government was paving way for a new problem through the APMC amendment, while, Congress MLC Basavaraj Patil Itagi suggested that the government should strengthen Raitha Samparka Kendras, strengthen marketing and solve ground-level issues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-stages-walkout-as-council-approves-apmc-bill-925534.html

Speaking to reporters at Vidhana Soudha, he said that the government will not allow repeated protests in the state. “It is questionable if such protests are held daily. There is no opportunity to organise bandhs again and again. Please cooperate with the government. If you have any reservations (on farm Bills), come let’s discuss them,” he said. “Modiji is making special efforts to double farmers’ income. At such a juncture, holding such agitations that unnecessarily inconvenience people is not right. People will not appreciate it,” he said, urging farmers to withdraw all protests and padayatras. Farmer groups in the state launched an indefinite stir against the controversial farm laws from Monday. The protests intensified after the BJP government got the controversial Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, passed in the Legislative Council with backing from JD(S).||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/drop-protests-come-for-talks-cm-bs-yediyurappa-tells-farmers-925538.html
10-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||SCP-TSP: Minister withdraws reply on Assembly floor||In an embarrassment to the ruling BJP, Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu had to withdraw an answer he made on the floor of the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday following push back from legislators, including those from the saffron party.  During Zero Hour, BJP legislator P Rajeev raised the issue of funds under the SC/ST Special Component Plan (SCP) and Tribal Sub Plan (SCP-TSP) being diverted for infrastructure projects.  Under the sub-plans, 17.15% and 6.95% of the total budget allocation is set aside for SC and ST welfare, respectively. Funds are allocated to various departments for spending. “I have discussed with the Finance Department on considering the SCP-TSP money as ‘deemed expenditure’. For the works that are taken up by various departments, I have said several times that the entire amount shouldn’t be considered as ‘deemed expenditure’. There’s no clarity right now on how much should be taken as ‘deemed expenditure’ and use the remaining for SCP-TSP. I will discuss with the chief minister and decide on this,” Sriramulu said.  This angered many SC/ST MLAs with BJP’s M P Kumaraswamy and N Y Gopalakrishna entering the well of the House. In no time, Congress MLAs, including Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, jumped into the well.  When the Congress members jumped into the well, Law Minister J C Madhuswamy convinced Kumaraswamy and Gopalakrishna to return to their seats.  “This ‘deemed expenditure’ is misleading. I wanted to remove it when I was CM. The entire amount should be spent only on SC/ST welfare,” Siddaramaiah said. “Last year, the SCP-TSP had Rs 30,000 crore. This year, it is down to Rs 26,000 crore. If this ‘deemed expenditure’ continues, it will come down to Rs 15,000 crore,” he warned.  Finally, Sriramulu withdrew his answer. “The existing system will continue. Let’s discuss ‘deemed expenditure’ again in this House,”he said.  In 2013, Karnataka became the second Indian state after Andhra Pradesh to enact the sub-plans law, which also allows for officers to be penalized if they fail to ensure utilization of funds for SC/ST welfare.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/scp-tsp-minister-withdraws-reply-on-assembly-floor-925579.html
10-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka: Empty Opposition benches mar Thursday’s Assembly||The Siddaramaiah-led Congress boycotted the Legislative Assembly proceedings on Thursday and the Opposition benches were empty since even the JD(S) did not show up. The Congress boycotted the Assembly in protest against the manner in which the BJP government tabled the anti-cow slaughter Bill on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, Siddaramaiah chaired the Congress Legislature Party meeting after which he led his MLAs towards Freedom Park by walk-in support of farmers protesting there. In the Assembly, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and Law Minister JC Madhuswamy requested the Congress to attend the session. The Congress claimed that the Bill was tabled even as nothing about it was discussed in Tuesday’s Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting. “I want to clarify that it was decided to take up ordinances already promulgated and other important Bills. So, it’s wrong to say that it was not discussed. Also, since the government said it was an important Bill, the same was included in the supplementary agenda,” Kageri said. But Madhuswamy was more candid. “In the BAC, I said there will be two-three Bills that will be tabled. It’s true that we didn’t specify that the anti-cow slaughter Bill was one of them,” he said. “We pushed for it because we were convinced that the Legislative Council might be adjourned abruptly on Thursday and we had to get this Bill passed there also,” he added. The four-day session ended with Kageri adjourning the House sine die. Congress will undo amendments  Addressing agitating farmers at Freedom Park, Siddaramaiah said that the Congress would "undo" the controversial amendments to laws related to the APMCs, land reforms and labour if the Congress came to power. "If we win the next election, we will undo the amendments. This is my commitment," Siddaramaiah said, adding that the Congress "fully supported" the farmers' protest. He also took a dig at his arch-rival HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S). "I don't know with what mouth Kumaraswamy defends the land reforms amendments. His father (HD Deve Gowda) and brother (HD Revanna) claim to be pro-farmer," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-empty-opposition-benches-mar-thursday-s-assembly-925818.html
10-12-2020||Main Article||The right of the married woman||In Satish Chander Ahuja Versus Sneha Ahuja in a civil appeal, the Supreme Court on October 15, 2020 laid down that wife has the legal right to stay in the shared household, where she stays in the domestic relationship, that is, in her in-law’s house irrespective of the fact whether the husband is member or has share in the household in the context of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. If we examine how the Domestic Violence Act has evolved, we get to know that the Act is a remedy in civil law which protects women from being victims of domestic violence. And to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the society, the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act 2005, was enacted. Also, if a woman is subjected to cruelty by husband or relatives of the husband, the same is an offence under Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. What does this Act prescribe? Section 2(s) of the Act defines a shared household as a household where aggrieved person is presently staying or has stayed either singly, or jointly, owns house or tenanted, is a joint family house. This, irrespective of whether aggrieved person has right, title or interest. The underlying ingredient here is “stay”. According to Section 17, (i) Every women shall have a right to reside in a shared household irrespective of having any right, title and beneficial interest in the property; (ii) Aggrieved person shall not be either evicted or excluded from the shared household except in accordance with the law. What was the earlier view of the Supreme Court with regard to 'shared household right of the wife’? In S R Batra (2007), Justice Markandeya Katju held that the wife is entitled only to claim a right under Section 17(1) to residence in a shared household. That shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or the house which belongs to the joint family in which husband is member. In B R Mehta’s judgement in 1987, the Supreme Court visualised the act of violence happening with the women in domestic life and thus gave a very meticulous observation: “...It may be that with change of situation and complex problems arising, it is high time to give the wife or the spouse a right of occupation in a truly matrimonial home, in case of marriage treating up or in the case of strained relationship husband and the wife.” Justice Sabyasachi Mukherji and Justice G L Oza visualised the need to provide the right of occupation to married women in view of the complex and strange situation in a matrimonial relationship. This resulted in the 2005 Act whose preamble said: “An act to provide for more effective protection of the rights of women guaranteed under the constitution, (women) who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” The legal turbulence created by the S R Batra judgement stood corrected and settled by the pronouncement in the case of Satish Ahuja case by a three-member bench consisting of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice M R Shah. The bench dealt with the issues relating to the (i) Meaning of shared household: does it belong to joint family; or the household where the husband of the aggrieved party has the share. The verdict of the Supreme Court under (i) Section 2(s) read with Section 17 and 19 of the Act granted entitlement in favour of the woman of the right of residence under the shared household irrespective of her having any legal interest in the same or not. The observation in S R Batra that Section 2(s) that `shared household’ is not happily worded which may lead to chaos in society, has been declared bad in law. It was not approved by the Supreme Court in the Satish Chandra Ahuja judgement where it held that shared household meant the household where the woman resides in a domestic relationship even though the house can be of husband or relative of the husband. The object and purpose of the Act is to grant the right of residence to the aggrieved person in a shared household and thus a married woman has right to stay in the domestic household of her husband and her-in-laws, irrespective of the fact that the husband owns the house or has share in it. In conclusion, it can be said that by upholding the right of residence for the woman in the shared household, where she stays in a domestic relationship (irrespective of the nature of the property), the apex court re-affirmed the honour of the married woman. It further sent a clear message to the society that institution of marriage is sacrosanct and that institution can be preserved when the woman is not allowed to remain vulnerable in any troubled circumstances in relation to matrimonial discord. The judgement is an impetus to married women who underwent domestic violence and is a legal command which secures and strengthens the right of residence of the married women in the shared household where she stays.

10-12-2020||National||DH Deciphers | Why hasn't there been a second Covid-19 wave so far||It's been more than a month since the Dasara-Deepavali-Chhath festivities and the Bihar elections that were feared to trigger a second wave of the pandemic. The fear was so great that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to address the nation to warn of it. But the second wave hasn't yet arrived although there was barely any Covid-appropriate behaviour beyond the big cities. Even scientists are puzzled. What went right?  Is it possible that the SARS-Covid-2 lost its virulence?     It is unlikely that the circulating virus strain has changed much in terms of its virulence, which is biologically modest to begin with. There hasn't been enough selection pressure on it as yet for major changes in virulence to get selected. Maybe, enough people have been exposed to the virus without any disease, and the pool of the vulnerable has shrunk.  This is the most plausible theory but there isn't enough data to back it up. The first ICMR sero-survey done in May-June showed a prevalence of just 0.73%. The second survey in August-September found a prevalence of 7.1%, a 10-fold jump. The current prevalence is likely to be about 20%. If the pool of susceptible people shrinks, the probability of a second surge also comes down.  Is India doing enough testing? While the number of tests remains high, it's the distribution that matters. The question is are we testing people in places that matter as there is now evidence of the disease spreading to the hinterland. For instance, Bihar and UP account for more than 20% of the tests carried out nationally, but they produce very few positive cases. The tests are largely concentrated in urban areas while experts suggest that people in villages should also be tested, taking a syndromic approach.  Is the data from the states suspect?  Yes. States are trying to keep their numbers down to look good. This is why test numbers vary greatly from place to place and time to time. Besides, less sensitive rapid-antigen tests are being done, again quite variably. All of this is likely to confuse the data quite a bit and contribute to the pool of people who are exposed to the virus but have escaped the radar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-why-hasnt-there-been-a-second-covid-19-wave-so-far-925569.html

10-12-2020||National||Western critics of Modi govt could not come in terms with 'deep democratization' of India, says Jaishankar||India is drawing flak for purported rise of illiberalism during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule because the critics in the west were not being able to come to terms with the “very deep democratization” that took place in the country, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday. “A lot of problem today, you must understand, is those in the west looking at India and writing about India are not able to come to terms with the changes taking place (in the country),” Jaishankar said during an online discussion hosted by the Lowy Institute of Australia. “What are the changes? You have a very deep democratization of India.” The comment by the External Affairs Minister came a day after NITI Ayog Chief Executive Officer, Amitabh Kant, triggered a controversy saying that it was difficult to introduce tough reforms in India as it was “too much of a democracy”. Jaishankar was asked by the moderator Michael Fullilove, the Executive Director of the Lowy Institute, if he was concerned about criticism from the west, particularly by the western media, about the “dip in rule of law, freedom and civil liberty” in India. Fullilove referred to the article titled “India’s Diminishing Democracy” on the November 28 edition of The Economist magazine and asked for the reaction of the External Affairs Minister. He asked Jaishankar if he, being the External Affairs Minister of India, was concerned over the perception in the west that the country was going towards “an illiberal direction”. Jaishankar said that the “political biases” of the magazine Fullilove referred to had been “pretty evident, including in the elections” over the past few years. “Seventy years ago, when you looked at what was India’s leadership, there would be much more English speaking, there would be much more big city (people), there would be much more people like us,” said the External Affairs Minister, adding: “So, I would suggest to you that a large part of why we get this kind of analysis is that you have people looking at India and saying ‘Oh! These are not the people we know, they talk a different language, we are not sure what their thought processes (are), their social habits are different. So, they are not the nice Indians we used to know. They are different’. And they don’t make an effort to really to understand this.” “In a sense, it comes down to kind of a globalisation and elitism problem. We are also having a cultural shift in India,” said Jaishankar. He said that the “bigger issue” was how “this changing India” would “communicate better” with the world and how it would “make the world make the effort to understand” it. “And, frankly, to me, as the Foreign Minister, this is a challenge I need to focus on very strongly”. Jaishankar, who served as India’s ambassador to China and the United States, retired as the Foreign Secretary in January 2018. When Modi commenced his second term as the Prime Minister in May 2019, he chose Jaishankar as a successor to Sushma Swaraj in the office of the External Affairs Minister. The diplomat-turned-politician led New Delhi’s effort last year to defend the Modi Government against criticism from the United States and the Europe over the restrictions and the shutdowns imposed in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) as well as the detentions of the political leaders and activists after the erstwhile state was stripped off its special status and reorganized into two Union Territories. He also led the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to counter international criticism against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) enacted by the Modi Government in December 2019 to ensure citizenship to people of six non-Muslim communities – Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian – if they had to migrate to India from Muslim-majority Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on or before December 31, 2014, in order to escape “persecution on the ground of religion”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/western-critics-of-modi-govt-could-not-come-in-terms-with-deep-democratization-of-india-says-jaishankar-925580.html

He was speaking at the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), a platform comprising 10-nation ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its eight dialogue partners including India and China. Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe was among those who attended the virtual meeting, officials said. In his address, Singh talked about "the current regional environment with visible strains", and appreciated the central role of ASEAN-led forums, including ADMM-Plus in promoting dialogue and engagement towards a pluralistic, cooperative security order in Asia. "As we enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region," he said. Singh's comments came amid the seven-month-long military standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh and Beijing's increasingly expansionist behaviour in South China Sea and Indo-Pacific.  The defence minister also said that the ability of the grouping to collectively respond to challenges based on the fundamentals of freedom, inclusivity and openness in the region will define its future. "Threats to the rules based order, maritime security, cyber related crimes and terrorism, just to name a few, remain the challenges that we need to address as a forum," Singh said at the virtual meeting. The defence minister also talked about the outlook on the Indo-Pacific, saying it underscores the impetus to cultivate strategic trust and continuously promote ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture. "The concepts of 'vasudhaive kutumbakam' – 'the whole world is one family' and 'sarve bhavantu sukhinah' – 'all be at peace' are the core of the Indian civilisation. Therefore, inclusivity, equality and openness are the principles underlining this concept," he said. The defence minister also called for sustained efforts to address the threats of bio-terrorism, transnational trafficking and pandemics, and emphasised on building capacity to address shared security challenges. "Our composition is another pillar of our strength as it includes defence ministries of 18 key countries that are major stakeholders in the regional security dynamic," he said. In his address, Singh also underlined the need for confronting the challenges emerging from the coronavirus pandemic. "Amongst the new challenges that have emerged, COVID-19 has changed the world and left us many hurdles to overcome. Unfortunately the disruptive effect of the pandemic is still unfolding," the defence minister said. "The challenge is, therefore, to make sure that the world economy moves on the path of recovery and when it does gather steam, to ensure that the recovery leaves no one behind," he added. The inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in 2010. The defence ministers then had agreed on five areas of practical cooperation to pursue under the new mechanism, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations. The ties between India and ASEAN have been on an upswing in the last few years with focus being on ramping up cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence. Besides 10 ASEAN countries, the ADMM-Plus includes Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/need-to-continue-efforts-against-bioterrorism-pandemics-rajnath-singh-925603.html

Krishnan, one of the organisers of the farmers' agitation that is rocking the national capital, was invited to speak on 'Agrarian Crisis and Rising Resistance: Farm Bills 2020 and Their Impacts' at 7:30 pm on Wednesday. As Krishnan was invited to speak and minutes into his lecture, a group of 4-6 people who were attending the online lecture unmuted themselves and started shouting, making others unable to comprehend what the speaker was saying. As the disruptors kept on interfering with Krishnan, the organisers stopped the webinar and shifted to an alternative meeting with a restricted audience and streamed it live on Facebook. Krishnan told DH, "the talk was disrupted by cyber goons belonging to the Sangh Parivar, who cannot tolerate voices of dissent. They cannot engage in a discussion democratically." He said, "they created ruckus and shared pornographic content. That is the level to which they stoop. They are mistaken if they feel such acts and threats can cow down protests." Asked who was behind the disruption, a member of the study circle said it was obvious who was behind it. In a statement, the study circle said a "group of Sanghi fringes" created a ruckus in the online lecture event. "The act by the hooligans shows how shaken they are by the farmer protests, and how desperately they want to contain even a discussion on this topic," the Study Circle said. It said the specific web conference software used for the event "lacked certain host privileges" and it was "extremely difficult" for them to tackle it. "However, we managed to work out an alternative meeting with a restricted audience and streamed it live on our Facebook page," it said adding that it will invest more thought in sorting out logistics to ensure the viewers an environment robust to these undemocratic fringes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/online-lecture-by-kisan-sabha-leader-vijoo-krishnan-disrupted-925620.html

Over the last four days, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech have applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation (EUA) for their Covid-19 vaccines. Here is why the expert committee has set aside emergency approvals: Bharat Biotech As for Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, the SEC recommended that the firm should present the safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase III clinical trial in the country for further consideration. "The SEC on Covid-19 of the CDSCO held a detailed deliberation on both the applications for around four hours. The recommendations by the SEC have been approved by the DCGI," an official source told PTI. The committee noted that as per the condition of the permission to conduct phases II and III clinical trials in the country, the clinical data generated in the trial shall be considered along with the data from the Oxford clinical trial outcome. Further, it stated that the proposal for grant of EUA is currently under evaluation with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  Bharat Biotech presented their proposal for grant of EUA of its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin along with the interim safety and immunogenicity data of phases I and II clinical trials carried out in the country before the committee. Serum Institute of India While considering the Serum Institute's application, the SEC recommended that the firm should submit an updated safety data of phases II and III clinical trials in the country, immunogenicity data from the clinical trial in the UK and India. Pfizer The CDSCO has said that the application by the Indian arm of Pfizer was not taken up as the company sought more time for making a presentation before the committee. Bharat Biotech had applied to the DCGI for emergency use authorisation for Covaxin on December 7, while the SII sought the nod for the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, on December 6.

10-12-2020||National||All India Radio all set for rebranding, streamlining of services||All India Radio is all set for a "re-branding" with the state broadcaster Prasar Bharati proposing streamlining of 43 'Vivid Bharati' channels to nine language-specific entertainment services and combining region-specific channels to a single common regional public service in every state. Local radio stations, which broadcast programmes generated with city-specific flavour apart from Vividh Bharati service, would be re-designated as part of FM Rainbow network and can have local iconic names as part of branding to deepen the local connect. These stations would carry city-specific programming and a mix of public service broadcasting and entertainment from national and regional services like Vividh Bharati, AIR Live News 24x7, Regional Vividh Bharati channel among others. The proposals got a green signal in two meetings on September 29 and October 14 held at the Prasar Bharati Secretariat, according to the minutes of the meeting. The decision came as a need was felt to rebrand AIR radio services to "position itself distinctively in the current competitive market scenario, keeping the balance between public service broadcasting, and commercial concerns that focus more on quality than content". It was also felt that the delivery platforms should be service-agnostic; and that any transmitter should be able to take any service based on the need of the service area it caters to. Rationalising Vividh Bharati services and for streamlining the broadcast of songs, it has been decided to have only nine language-specific entertainment services based on the pattern of the Vividh Bharati National Service. These regional entertainment services will be in Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odiya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu and Vividh Bharati National Service being originated from Mumbai will be treated as Entertainment Service in Hindi Language for the entire country. With multiple primary channels in states "carrying content of similar nature resulting in duplication of efforts", Prasar Bharati now plans to have a common regional public service in each state and union territory except for Jammu and Kashmir as well as Chandigarh. Citing reasons for the move, the minutes said that region-specific languages and dialects are localised to individual transmitters and are not accessible across the state. "This is resulting in very poor appreciation of linguistic diversity within a state. Also with economic mobility the audience for a language/dialect are no longer limited to a single local physical region. With the advent of smartphones and digital platforms there is an expectation to listen to content anywhere in the state or even in other states," it said. This would help in optimal utilisation of resources and ensure the entire diversity of content is accessible anywhere and at any time. These common regional public services will have contributions from the primary originating studios within the state and the common Fixed Point Charters, which is the schedule of the programmes to be aired, for these services will cater to the linguistic and cultural diversity across that state. These services can be utilised by all stations across the states/regions to their programme requirements along with a provision for contribution to the common service.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-india-radio-all-set-for-rebranding-streamlining-of-services-925631.html

The draft Bill seeks to amend relevant sections of the IPC, CrPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for the proposed law's application in the state. The cabinet approved the draft Bill at a meeting here and it will be tabled in the state legislature during its upcoming winter session, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh told reporters after the meeting. A two-day winter session of the legislature begins in Mumbai from December 14.  He said the Bill, to be called the "Shakti Act", will come up for discussion and approval in both houses of the legislature. It provides for completing probe in a case within 15 days and trial within 30 days, Deshmukh said. After getting the house nod, the bill will be sent to the Central government for approval and Presidential assent, Deshmukh said. The provisions of the new law aim to control heinous sexual offences against women and children, the minister said. It provides for completing investigation and trial within a stipulated time-frame and stringent punishment, including the death penalty and heavy fines, for the culprits, Deshmukh said. Special police teams and separate courts will be set up for investigation and trial of cases against women and children, according to the draft bill. The perpetrators, if found guilty, will be punished with imprisonment for life for not less than ten years but may extend to the remainder of natural life or with death in cases which have characteristics of being heinous in nature, it said. Under the proposed legislation, a sum of Rs 10 lakh will be given to an acid attack victim for plastic surgery and facial reconstruction and the amount will be collected as fine from the convict. The investigation shall be completed within a period of 15 working days from the date of registration of an offence. Reasons for not doing so shall be recorded in writing by the investigating officer concerned and these may include the inability to identify the perpetrator, it said. Then the probe period will be extended up to seven working days. After a charge-sheet is filed, the trial shall be conducted on a day-to-day basis and completed within a period of 30 working days, according to the draft bill. Some cases will be tried in-camera for recording of evidence of victims and witnesses who are vulnerable, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/death-penalty-speedy-trial-features-of-maharashtras-shakti-act-925644.html

The police also advised people to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience. Tikri and Dhansa borders are still closed for traffic movement, while Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrian movement, it said. Those travelling to Haryana can take Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said in a tweet. The closure of borders has also resulted in heavy traffic on alternative routes. On Wednesday, farmer leaders rejected a government proposal to amend the new agri laws, and announced they would intensify their agitation by blocking the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra expressways by Saturday, and escalating it to a nationwide protest on December 14. This comes after the sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was cancelled. The farmer leaders have been adamant on their demand to scrap the laws, which they say will lead to dismantling of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism and mandis that ensure earning. The government has been defending these laws, saying they will benefit the farmers in the long run and raise their incomes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-delhi-traffic-police-informs-commuters-about-closed-routes-925645.html

India calls for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific, based upon respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international rules and laws, First Secretary and Legal adviser in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Yedla Umasankar said on Tuesday. "India’s concept of the Indo-Pacific is inclusive in nature, and supports an approach that respects the right to freedom of navigation and overflight for all in the international seas," he said. "India’s Indo-Pacific vision is premised upon the principle of ‘ASEAN-Centrality’. India’s approach is based on cooperation and collaboration, given the need for shared responses to shared challenges in the region," Umasankar said. Speaking in the UN General Assembly on ‘Oceans and the Law of the Sea’, Umasankar said "we cannot allow our seas to turn into zones of contention. Secure and open sea lanes are critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development.” India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region. China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea. India also reiterated the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight on the high seas, unimpeded lawful commerce, as well as resolving maritime disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). “We have seen instances where decisions of international judicial bodies are not being respected or given effect to by countries. This is clearly unacceptable. We call on all member states to respect rule of law at the international level,” Umasankar said, apparently referring to China. In 2016, an arbitration tribunal under the UNCLOS ruled that there was no evidence that China had historic rights to the waters or resources in the South China Sea that fell within its "nine-dash line", and was violating the Philippine's sovereign rights with its operations there. Beijing has rejected the ruling by the tribunal. Umasankar also stressed that terrorism and transnational crimes such as drug and weapons smuggling, human trafficking and piracy could also have a similar impact on maritime activities. “Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and natural disasters are other issues that could have a catastrophic impact on all maritime activities and the environment as such. It would be evident that no nation however powerful or rich would have the resources to meet all the above tasks alone,” he said. Emphasising that oceans are a common concern of mankind, Umasankar said cooperation between all stakeholder nations to ensure peace and stability in the seas is essential to safeguard common maritime interests and in furthering human development. “Trust and confidence between nations are essential to ensure cooperative security,” he said. Voicing concern that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the implementation of ocean-related work programmes, Umasankar said the work of international tribunals involved in the settlement of maritime disputes and various capacity-building activities has been affected. “In this context, Covid-19 shows us the importance of preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, and marine biodiversity is no exception,” he said. India, with a vast coastline of more than 7,500 km and over thousand islands whose one-third population lives along the coast, has a longstanding maritime tradition and abiding interest in ocean affairs. A seafaring nation with a large coastal economy, India is acutely aware of the challenges and opportunities that oceans represent and recognises Blue Economy as a driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development, he said. “We must work towards innovative technologies for offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, deep seabed mining and marine biotechnology which provide a new source of jobs. The need for ‘greening’ the ocean economy is also gaining importance,” Umasankar said. He noted that India is concerned with the illegal fishing practices and those relating to maritime safety and security, including the acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea. “India is strongly committed to protecting its coastal and marine environment and attaches special importance to prevent and significantly reduce marine debris and litter by 2025, through global action and collective efforts of all stakeholders. We have also undertaken the commitment to eliminate single-use plastic in India by 2022,” he said. The General Assembly postponed action on the omnibus draft resolution ‘Oceans and the law of the sea’ to enable its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) to review its programme budget implications. That text would, among other things, have the world body reaffirm the unified character of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the vital importance of preserving its integrity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indo-pacific-approach-based-on-cooperation-collaboration-india-tells-un-925665.html

The ceremony, in the Parliament premises, was attended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri, industrialist Ratan Tata. Governors, Chief Ministers of various states and presiding officers of state assemblies joined through a video link. Addressing the function, the Prime Minister recalled that the democratic traditions in India dated back to the 10th century through the Kudumbu system of governance was practiced in the Chola empire and the Anubhava Mantapam established by Saint Basaveshwara in the 12th Century. “The history of democracy is seen in every nook and corner of the country,” Modi said. He said while across the world democracy is identified with elections, the election process, elected members, governance administration, in India it was a way of life and part of the value system. The Prime Minister said the new building will be an amalgamation of the new and the ancient, and reflect the spirit of fostering change by adapting to the changing circumstances. “We, the people of India, will together build this new building of Parliament. This new building will be an inspiration when India will celebrate its 75 years of independence,” Modi said. The Prime Minister said if the existing Parliament House gave direction to post-Independence India, the new building will be witness to the creation of a self-reliant India. On Monday, the Supreme Court had allowed the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new Parliament building, on the pre-condition to keep in abeyance the construction or demolition of buildings and re-location of trees till it gave its judgment on the petitions challenging government’s plans to redevelopment of the Central Vista. The new building, constructed by Tata Projects at a cost of Rs 971 crore, will have an area of 64,500 square metres and would be completed in 22 months, to coincide with India’s 75th year of Independence. The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-of-new-parliament-building-925667.html

The central government is taking this attack very seriously. The Bengal government will have to answer to the peace loving people of the state for this sponsored violence,” tweeted Shah. केंद्र सरकार इस हमले को पूरी गंभीरता से ले रही है। बंगाल सरकार को इस प्रायोजित हिंसा के लिए प्रदेश की शांतिप्रिय जनता को जवाब देना होगा। “Bengal has gone into an era of tyranny, anarchy and darkness under the Trinamool rule. The manner in which political violence has been institutionalised and brought to the extreme within West Bengal under TMC rule is sad and worrying for all those who believe in democratic values,” tweeted Shah. तृणमूल शासन में बंगाल अत्याचार, अराजकता और अंधकार के युग में जा चुका है। टीएमसी के राज में पश्चिम बंगाल के अंदर जिस तरह से राजनीतिक हिंसा को संस्थागत कर चरम सीमा पर पहुँचाया गया है, वो लोकतांत्रिक मूल्यों में विश्वास रखने वाले सभी लोगों के लिए दु:खद भी है और चिंताजनक भी। Nadda said that he remained unscathed in the attack as he was traveling in a bulletproof vehicle. Addressing BJP workers at a party rally in Diamond Harbour, he described the incident as “shocking” and alleged that “utter lawlessness and anarchy” was prevailing in Bengal. “The police and the administration have been politicized. Lawless is prevailing in Bengal and goonda raj is going on under the TMC regime… I am able to reach here due to Maa Durga’s blessings. If this is what happens to senior leaders, I can imagine the plight of BJP workers,” said Nadda. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, however, questioned the authenticity of the incident. “Why were there 50 vehicles with you? If so, there can be an accident while one tries to overtake another. So who was watching? Was it planned? Who threw the stones? Who took the photos and videos of a brick hitting a tail car? How was it done so quickly?” asked Banerjee. The West Bengal police, in a series of tweets, stated that “nothing happened to his (Nadda’s) convoy” and he reached his destination safely, adding that few bystanders threw stones in Debipur at vehicles far behind his convoy. It stated that an investigation was on to find out what actually happened. Shri JP Nadda, National President, BJP reached safely at the venue, Diamond Harbour, South 24 Pgs. Nothing happened to his convoy. Few bystanders at Debipur, Falta PS, Diamond Harbour PD, sporadically and suddenly threw stones towards vehicles trailing long behind his convoy. 1/2||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/j-p-nadda-s-convoy-attacked-in-west-bengal-centre-seeks-report-from-state-govt-925671.html

The Union home ministry's communication to the West Bengal government came after BJP state unit chief Dilip Ghosh wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday. In his letter, Ghosh alleged that a "mob" of over 200 people with sticks and bamboos were demonstrating raising black flags in front of BJP's state unit office in Kolkata. He also claimed that some of the protesters climbed on cars parked outside the party's office and raised slogans, and the "police did not intervene to stop them and casually allowed them to come within a close perimeter of Nadda ji's vehicle". The ministry has sought a report from the West Bengal government on the alleged "serious security lapses" during the BJP president's visit, the circumstances and what action has been taken on it, a home ministry official said. In his letter on Wednesday, Ghosh had also said, "Today during his different engagement in Kolkata, it was observed that there was serious lapses on security arrangements, purportedly due to negligence and/or casual approach of the state police department." Nadda is on a two-day visit to West Bengal, where assembly election is due next year, and on Thursday, stones were hurled at his convoy when it was on its way to Diamond Harbour in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district from Kolkata.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-seeks-report-from-west-bengal-govt-on-security-lapses-during-bjp-chief-j-p-naddas-visit-925686.html

"The old Parliament building gave a new direction to India after independence. The new building will be a witness to the building of Atmanirbhar Bharat. In the old building, work to fulfil necessities of the nation was done. In the new building, ambitions of India of the 21st century will be realised," said PM Modi at foundation stone laying ceremony of new Parliament building.  Stating that it is a day of pride for over 130 crore Indians, PM Modi said, "The new Parliament building is an example of the co-existence of the new and the old. This is an effort to make changes within oneself in accordance with the time and needs." He further added that the current Parliament building was nearly 100 years old and it was upgraded many times, but now it needs rest.  "It is a very historic day. Today is a milestone in India's democratic history," he said. "We, the people of India, will together build this new building of Parliament. This new building will be an inspiration when India will celebrate its 75 years of independence," Modi said. Recalling his first entry into the Parliament building, the prime minister said he can never forget the moment when he for the first time in 2014 entered the Parliament as an MP. "Then before stepping into this temple of democracy, I had owed my head and saluted this temple of democracy," he said. "Democracy is a culture in India. Democracy is a life value, a way of life and the soul of the life of the nation for India. Democracy of India is a system developed with the experience of centuries," PM Modi said.  Priests from the Sringeri Math Karnataka did the rituals for the 'bhoomi pujan' at the new Parliament building site and it was followed by a 'sarva dharma prarthana' (inter-faith prayer). Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh also offered prayers during the ceremony. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.

10-12-2020||National||Delhi HC seeks Centre, DGGI reply on plea challenging constitutionality of sections of CGST Act||The Delhi High Court has sought the Centre and DGGI's reply on a plea challenging the constitutional validity of various provisions of the Central Goods and Service Tax (CGST) Act, relating to the power of arresting a person. A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula issued notice to the central government and the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) on the plea seeking to declare sections 69 and 132 of the CGST Act as unconstitutional, illegal, unenforceable and ultra vires to the Constitution. Section 69 of the Act relates to power to arrest a person and section 132 deals with punishment of certain offences where a person commits or abets commission of an offence. The court was hearing the petition by Arun Gupta, director of Transline Technologies Pvt Ltd, also seeking direction to the authorities to comply with the mandatory procedure under the CrPC for valid commencement of investigation into any offence qua him. The DGGI has accused Gupta of issuing fake invoices without the supply of goods and having allegedly committed offences under the CGST Act amounting to Rs 13 crore. Gupta has sought direction to the authorities that no coercive action be taken against him in relation to the investigation pending against Transline Technologies. During the hearing, advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing Gupta, showed a video clip to the court claiming that the DGGI, New Delhi, officials were allegedly slapping and manhandling the employee of the petitioner and an audio clip of the call recording was also played. The high court directed the authorities not to arrest Gupta till the next date of hearing, December 22 and to de-seal his house and godown. It also directed the petitioner to appear before the Deputy Director, DDGI, on December 11 for recording of statements and that he shall continue to appear and cooperate in investigation as and when directed by the officer. “Keeping in view the peculiar facts of this case, in particular the audio visual tapes placed on record as well as the ‘no coercive steps’ orders passed by the Apex Court in..., this court directs that till the next date of hearing the petitioner shall not be arrested,” the high court said. The petition, filed through advocates Yugant Sharma, Nagesh Behl and Deepanshu Choithani, challenged the investigation on the grounds that it was conducted by the GST officers in gross non-compliance of the ‘procedure established by law’ as contemplated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, claiming it to be in violation of Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. "The vires of sections 69 and 132 of the CGST Act, 2017 were also challenged on the ground that an arrest cannot be made under the said Act, as there is no constitutional backing to the same,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-seeks-centre-dggi-reply-on-plea-challenging-constitutionality-of-sections-of-cgst-act-925689.html
10-12-2020||National||Government proposes new Space-based Remote Sensing policy along with draft||The government has proposed to come out with a new space-based remote sensing policy to enable enhanced participation of the Indian industry and ease of data access with simplified procedures. The Department of Space has published a draft "Space-based Remote Sensing Policy of India (SpaceRS Policy 2020)" along with a draft "Norms, Guidelines and Procedures (SpaceRS NGP 2020)" for its implementation. "We have put it (the drafts) in the public domain and after getting comments, that will go (the policy will come into effect after Cabinet approval)," the Department's Secretary and Chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), K Sivan, told PTI. SpaceRS Policy 2020 is aimed at enabling wider stakeholders' participation and ease of data access. It was noted that India has made tremendous progress in the field of space-based remote sensing by building and launching satellites operating from various orbits, encompassing imaging and non-imaging observation in optical, infrared, and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The new draft policy has taken into consideration the global trends, advancement of technology, wide ranging demand for remote sensing data - both within and outside the country -- and the recent initiative of the government towards 'self-reliant' India. It aims at encouraging various stakeholders in the country to actively participate in space-based remote sensing activities to enhance commercialisation of space technology. "An easy access of space-based remote sensing data and information shall enable unfolding of knowledge-based solutions, addressing many planning and monitoring requirements of the nation," according to the draft. "The government shall promote Indian industries to carry out space-based remote sensing activities within and outside India, and enable easy access to space-based remote sensing data, except for sensitive data and information," it said. It shall also provide a timely and responsive regulatory environment for the commercial Indian industry to establish and operate space-based remote sensing systems. In order to unlock the immense potential of remote sensing data, easy dissemination of data and services originating from space-based remote sensing systems in the country will be enabled, the draft said. Any service provider will be free to provide remote sensing data and services to any user in the country, it added. However, a simple process of registration/authorisation of space assets is envisaged to keep the government informed about the space assets whose data and services are being offered to the users in the country. Due to national security considerations, a category of data will be identified as 'sensitive' and a different mechanism for dissemination of such data is envisaged, it was stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-proposes-new-space-based-remote-sensing-policy-along-with-draft-925690.html

He said the government has decided to go in for a tendering process to give government technology centers comprising tool rooms to successful private players who have an excellent track record. The minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and Road Transport and Highways said "we are now launching Flex engines where 100 per cent ethanol or petrol can be used," highlighting its significance in lowering crude oil imports. Addressing a webinar organised by All India Management Association, the minister said "this is the time for the industry, for the government to identify the things important for the future which we are presently importing, how we can manufacture here". He urged the IITs and engineering colleges to provide innovative solutions in this regard. The minister observed that to realise the Prime Minister's dream of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat or a Self-reliant India, "we need to increase our exports and GDP growth, create more employment potential and jobs, and should accord the highest priority to the rural, agricultural and tribal sectors."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gadkari-bats-for-innovation-in-import-substitute-products-925697.html

10-12-2020||National||Not without India: World's pharmacy gears up for Covid-19 vaccine race||India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, is getting set for the massive global blitz to contain the coronavirus pandemic with its pharmaceutical industry and partners freeing up capacity and accelerating investments even without firm purchase orders. India manufactures more than 60% of all vaccines sold across the globe, and while its $40 billion pharmaceutical sector is not yet involved in the production of the expensive Pfizer Inc and Moderna shots, the nation will play a pivotal role in immunizing much of the world. Indian companies are set to produce eight, more affordable vaccines designed to fight Covid-19, including AstraZeneca's Covishield, called the "vaccine for the world " by its developers. "There are many vaccines being produced in countries around the world but there's only one nation that has the manufacturing capacity to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of citizens in every country, and that's India," said Australia's ambassador to India, Barry O'Farrell, after touring vaccine manufacturing sites in India with many other diplomats. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot, even as it awaits emergency-use approvals from both British and Indian authorities. SII plans to make a total of 400 million doses of Covishield by July and is setting up new production lines to roll out roughly one billion shots a year.  Pharmaceutical packager Schott Kaisha, meanwhile, is stepping up production of vaccine vials and Deutsche Post's DHL is working out how best to distribute the shots within the country and around the world. "Because of the large volumes coming out of India and of course the affordable vaccines, there is no other country that will contribute more towards ending the pandemic than India," SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters at the company's sprawling campus in the western city of Pune. Here, automated machines fill and seal thousands of vials with the AstraZeneca shot every hour before they are moved to a vast, high-ceiling cold room. But much of India's vaccine production could be, at least initially, for domestic use. With nearly 10 million infections, the world's second-highest after the United States, India's government is likely to order a huge chunk of the vaccines for its 1.3 billion people. CALCULATED RISK Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to specify how much India will require, but his government has said some vaccines may be approved in the next few weeks and that it was "committed to partnering with all interested countries in vaccine-related efforts". Poonawalla said he expects to sell hundreds of millions of doses at home. Even as immediate local demand is met, nearly half of its production would go overseas, the company has said. India's Bharat Biotech, which has also sought emergency approval for its government-backed vaccine candidate, is in discussions with more than 10 countries in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe to sell its product. Russia, meanwhile, has signed deals with Indian companies to make the country the production and export hub for its Sputnik V vaccine, starting with more than 100 million doses a year. Many companies in India's vaccine supply chain are laying out investments without deals in hand. "We've taken a calculated risk," said Rishad Dadachanji, a director at Schott Kaisha that is in supply talks with around 10 vaccine makers at home and abroad. It is increasing its annual manufacturing capacity by 300 million to 1.5 billion vials by November. Executives at rival firms SGD Pharma India and Piramal Glass said they were expanding their production base, or re-allocating manufacturing lines to focus on vials. SGD plans to add 100 million units to its current capacity of 350 million glass vials, while Piramal says it can double its specialised vial capacity at just a month's notice "to meet any unforeseen demand." SYRINGES AND COLD STORAGE Others that are likely to benefit from an expected surge in demand are: pharmaceutical firms Dr Reddy's Laboratories , Cadila Healthcare and Hetero; logistics company FedEx; cold chain storage specialist Snowman Logistics and Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices, among others. Hindustan Syringes says it will increase capacity by 42% to 1 billion units by the first half of next year. It has already shipped some 140 million syringes that disable themselves after one use for the global vaccine distribution program COVAX. But because the Indian government has not yet signed any contracts with vaccine suppliers, some ancillary companies have been left guessing what kind of products they should prepare for as specifications may vary from vaccine to vaccine. Vial maker SGD's managing director, Sardar Akshay Singh, warned that a last-minute rush to secure vaccines for India could hit exports - similar to the way officials stalled shipments of masks and sanitizers early in the pandemic to meet local demand. "We have been feeding the government a lot of information but they've not come up with a plan so far," said Sunil Nair, CEO of India's biggest cold chain operator, Snowman. The company's ongoing expansion will nevertheless double its vaccine handling capacity to 200 million doses by March. It operates some 500 trucks fitted with containers refrigerated by Carrier Global, has vendors on standby if more are required, and says it can deliver vaccines from production site to inoculation centres within hours thanks to its countrywide reach. SII, which also has Covid vaccine tie-ups with U.S. biotech firm Codagenix, Novavax and Austria's Themis, has scaled back production of shots for other diseases and is readying more cold rooms, buying more trucks and hiring more workers. For DHL, the world's largest courier and logistics company, vaccine transportation work has already begun in India. It recently brought in Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for trials and says it will play a crucial role in exporting vaccines, and distributing them within the country. "The next 12-24 months are going to be significantly exciting and there's going to be a lot of capacity issues, but I think it's a positive headache to have," DHL Express India head R.S. Subramanian said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-without-india-worlds-pharmacy-gears-up-for-covid-19-vaccine-race-925722.html

The wrestler, who had won a bronze medal in an international event, also accused Chief Sports Officer Khajan Singh and coach Surjit Singh of running a "sex scandal" in the force with the help of "many (woman) accomplices" who were earlier their victims. Khajan Singh, who won a silver medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games in the 200-metre butterfly event, has denied the allegations against him while the coach was unavailable for comments. Khajan Singh's was the first medal in swimming in Asian Games, which started in 1951. The complainant claimed that she had earlier written to the then Home Secretary Rajiv Gauba, who is presently the Cabinet Secretary, and the then CRPF Director General Rajeev Bhatnagar complaining about the harassment of the duo but no action was taken. She claimed she did not mention rape in her complaint to the CRPF fearing "shame" but now wants to press charges against them in her police complaint. In serious allegations, she also claimed several CRPF officials, including a previous head of the Internal Complaints Committee probing sexual harassment cases at workplace, pressurised her to withdraw complaints. She even wrote letters to withdraw it this June but Inspector General (Srinagar) Charu Sinha assured her justice and she decided to go ahead with her complaints. She said she was forced to withdraw a complaint she filed with the CRPF against the duo in 2014 following pressure. She claimed she approached police as she received fresh threats to withdraw her complaint. Police registered the FIR on December 3 after it received the complaint on November 26. CRPF spokesperson Moses Dhinakaran said the CRPF has taken "serious note" of the complaint and has already constituted an Internal Complaint Committee headed by an Inspector General level officer to conduct an enquiry". The complainant, who had joined the CRPF in 2010, claimed that she was not the lone victim of the duo. She said she joined the central wrestling team of the CRPF in 2012 and sexual harassment started immediately. Taking advantage of being the coach, she claimed, Surjit Singh touched women wrestlers, asked them to meet him individually and used to send lewd messages, including seeking nude photos. She also accused him of forcing them to give sexual favours to Khagan Singh. "They sexually harass female constables and later use them as their accomplice. They secretly took my nude photos while having bath. I was blackmailed...and threatened that if I do not talk to them they would circulate my photos and make it viral on the internet," the FIR quoted the complainant as saying. She also accused them of sending her their nude photos. She also claimed that she used to record the calls from the duo and once they came to know about it, they allegedly got her phone stolen two-three times by five women constables who were their accomplices. Her personal diary in which she used to record her life was also stolen in the later years. The victim also lodged a complaint to the Inspector General about sexual harassment in March 2014 but later was "forced" to withdraw it later by threatening her with dismissing her from the job. In October 2014 when she was participating in a wrestling competition, she alleged that the coach started blackmailing her by showing her nude photographs and took her to a flat. She claimed that both Khagan Singh and Surjit Singh raped her in a south Delhi flat first and the ordeal continued for three years. She also alleged that the duo also asked to extend sexual favours to senior officers in the CRPF who was present in the Vasant Kunj flat. After returning from an international event in 2017, she said she stopped acceding to their demands but it ended up in show cause notices being issued to her. She claimed they used one of the junior officers to send her the message to fall in line. She also deposed before an Internal Complaints Committee as a witness in a complaint filed by another woman personnel during which she again pointed fingers at the two officers. However, she claimed, her statement was not recorded while the Internal Complaints Committee head persuaded her to withdraw the complaint when both were posted in a West Bengal unit. The victim also faced trouble in a sports camp in Neemach in 2018 when she wanted a duty change. Surjit Singh and another personnel asked her to meet Khagan Singh and when she objected, she was manhandled. The next day also, she was assaulted when she raised the issue. She claimed she once again filed a complaint but no action was taken besides breaking her phone. However, an enquiry was conducted against her and she was transferred. The Internal Complaints Committee proceedings on her 2018 complaint have started now but the duo have threatened her once again, she alleged. She initially wrote to the Inspector General (Srinagar) Charu Sinha seeking to withdraw her complaint but the latter assured her of justice and she decided to go ahead with her complaint. However, she claimed, she received threatening calls from Khagan Singh October this year too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/crpf-constable-accuses-khajan-singh-of-rape-chief-sports-officer-dismisses-charge-925724.html

They also demanded that the Kejriwal government clear dues of the three municipal corporations -- the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). The BJP's city unit on Wednesday, citing a video, had lodged a complaint with the police against Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Durgesh Pathak alleging a "conspiracy to kill" leaders of the municipal corporations. Pathak has rubbished the allegations, saying the BJP has a habit of mixing random audios with random videos to "defame and malign" people. "We protested against the conspiracy to kill our mayors, and issued a warning that BJP workers know how to give answer to such challenges," Delhi BJP vice president Ashok Goel Devraha said. The protesters, including members of the BJP's youth and SC wings, tried to get past a police barricade near Sisodia's residence on Mathura Road, after which a few of them were detained. Devraha, who led the protest, claimed that four to five BJP workers were detained by the police and taken to the Mandir Marg Police station. He asserted that mayors and other leaders of the municipal corporations were fighting for justice for the people of Delhi and employees of the civic bodies. "Mayors and other corporation leaders are sitting outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence on an indefinite dharna for the past four days in the cold because the Delhi government is not paying Rs 13,000 crore dues. This is posing problems in payment of salaries to sanitation workers, doctors and nurses, who served people as 'Corona Warriors'," Devraha said. The BJP complaint cited a video clip circulating on social media purportedly showing Sisodia and Pathak outside Kejriwal's residence where the mayors and municipal corporation leaders are staging the dharna. "A Delhi BJP delegation filed a complaint at the DCP office against Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and AAP leader Durgesh Pathak for the conspiracy to kill the mayors," the Delhi BJP had said in a statement on Wednesday. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, who was part of the delegation, has alleged, "Entire Delhi has seen the video in which AAP leader Durgesh Pathak is publicly saying that he will kill the corporation leaders and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia standing next to him is calming him saying that there is media around."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-bjp-workers-stage-protest-outside-deputy-cm-manish-sisodias-residence-925726.html
10-12-2020||National||Fatty residues on ancient pottery reveal meat-heavy diets of Indus Civilisation: Study||An analysis of fat residues in ancient ceramic vessels from settlements of the Indus Civilisation in present-day Haryana and Uttar Pradesh suggests that the prehistoric people of the time consumed meat of animals like cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat, and pigs as well as dairy products. The study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, involved extraction and identification of fats and oils that have been absorbed into ancient ceramic vessels during their use in the past. Based on the analysis, the scientists, including those from the University of Cambridge in the UK, unravelled how these ancient vessels were used and what was being cooked in them. "Our study of lipid residues in Indus pottery shows a dominance of animal products in vessels, such as the meat of non-ruminant animals like pigs, ruminant animals like cattle or buffalo, and sheep or goat, as well as dairy products," said study co-author Akshyeta Suryanarayan former PhD student at the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge. Suryanarayan, who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at CNRS, France, said her team found a predominance of non-ruminant animal fats in the vessels -- even though the remains of animals like pigs were not present in large quantities. "It is possible that plant products or mixtures of plant and animal products were also used in vessels, creating ambiguous results," she added. Despite the high percentages of the remains of domestic ruminant animals found at these sites, the archeologists said there is very limited direct evidence of the use of dairy products in the vessels. "The products used in vessels across rural and urban Indus sites in northwest India are similar during the Mature Harappan period (c.2600/2500-1900 BC)," said Cameron Petrie, senior author of the study from the University of Cambridge. "This suggests that even though urban and rural settlements were distinctive and people living in them used different types of material culture and pottery, they may have shared cooking practices and ways of preparing foodstuffs," Petrie said. The scientists believe the findings highlight the resilience of rural settlements in northwest India during the transformation of the Indus Civilisation, and during a period of increasing aridity. "There is also evidence that rural settlements in northwest India exhibited a continuity in the ways they cooked or prepared foodstuff from the urban (Mature Harappan) to post-urban (Late Harappan) periods," Petrie said. He said this was particularly during a phase of climatic instability after 2100 BC, suggesting that daily practices continued at small rural sites over cultural and climatic changes. "These results demonstrate that the use of lipid residues, combined with other techniques in bioarchaeology, have the potential to open exciting new avenues for understanding the relationship between the environment, foodstuffs, material culture, and ancient society in protohistoric South Asia," Suryanarayan concluded.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fatty-residues-on-ancient-pottery-reveal-meat-heavy-diets-of-indus-civilisation-study-925731.html

Meat and beef traders in the state have now expressed apprehension, that the expansion of the definition of the word 'cattle' in the new law, which now covers “cow, calf of a cow and bull, bullock, and he or she buffalo below the age of thirteen years” would lead to a massive shortage of beef in Goa. Beef is a regularly consumed commodity in Goa, where minorities account for more than a third of the state's population. Beef is also routinely served in restaurants in the coastal fringes of the state, which are frequented by nearly eight million tourists every year. More than 25 tons of beef is consumed in Goa every day. “We have been doing this business for generations. This bill brought forth by the Karnataka government will bring a complete stop to our business. We will take this up with the Goa government,” Anwar Bepari says a beef seller, who operates from Panaji. Goa Quraishi Meat Traders Association Manna Bepari believes that the impact of the new law will not just be felt adversely on people who consume beef, but also on families involved in meat trade.“Thousands of families depend on the meat trade besides even Goa’s reputation as a tourism destination especially for foreign tourists is supported by the availability of beef,” Bepari told DH.“The new law prohibits even the transport of cattle with a jail term. This will make it almost impossible for us to bring live cattle to Goa for slaughter. In Maharashtra, the law was already strict, but now in Karnataka the law has changed too. It will be a massive setback for us,” the association head said. Representatives of the Association are now expected to knock on the doors of Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to find the way out of the deadlock beef traders in Goa have found themselves in.Beef trade in the state has been in the firing line over the last few years, especially with gau rakshak groups in the state targetting beef consignments brought via road from Karnataka, derailing regular availability of the red meat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/karnatakas-new-anti-cattle-slaughter-law-will-impact-beef-sale-in-goa-traders-925735.html

Addressing reporters along with his cabinet colleague Piyush Goyal, Tomar also said he is hopeful of a resolution. "The government is keen and ready for further discussions with protesting farmers," he said, a day after the farmer unions rejected the government's written proposal, offering a written assurance on MSP and amendment to few provisions in the new farm laws enacted in September. The farmer unions also said on Wednesday they will intensify their agitation and start blocking all highways linking the national capital. Thousands of farmers have been protesting on various borders for almost two weeks seeking repeal of the new laws, which they claim were aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce. Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table. "We gave our proposals to farmers after meeting them and therefore we urge them to consider those. If they want to discuss those proposals also, we are ready for that too," he said. When asked whether the government would consider a new bill on the MSP system, the minister said the new laws do not impact the MSP system and that will continue. At the same media briefing, Goyal said, "We appeal our farmer brothers and sisters and the union leaders to end their protest and engage in dialogue with the government to resolve their issues." He said the government is very open and flexible to find an amicable solution for the benefit of India's farmers. "The government is ready to consider with an open mind any provision in the new laws where farmers have any issues and we want to clarify all their apprehensions," Tomar said. "We kept waiting for suggestions from farmers' leaders to address their concerns, but they are stuck on the repeal of laws," he said, while virtually ruling out conceding to the key demand with which thousands of farmers are protesting. Tomar said the government has always been ready for dialogue with farmers and it remains so. "We are concerned about the farmers protesting in cold weather and during the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. Farmers' unions should consider the government's proposal at the earliest and then we can mutually decide on the next meeting if required," the minister said. The government fad on Wednesday proposed to give a "written assurance" that the existing Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime for procurement will continue. However, the farmers' unions rejected the proposal and said they would intensify their agitation until the government accepts their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws. The government has also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the mandi system. Tomar, who along with his cabinet colleague Piyush Goyal had met senior party leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday night, said the government is ready to provide all necessary clarifications on their concerns about the new farm laws enacted in September, which he said were passed after detailed discussions in Parliament. Goyal, who was also present at the media briefing, said the new laws do not affect the APMC and that would remain protected. Farmers are only being given an additional option to sell their produce at private mandis. The farmer leaders had said on Wednesday there was nothing new in the government proposal and they will continue their protest. Shah, in a Tuesday night meeting with 13 union leaders, had said the government would send a draft proposal on key issues raised by the farmers regarding the three farm laws, even though the meeting had failed to break the ice with farm union leaders who are insisting for repealing these laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was also cancelled. In the proposal, sent by Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal, the government said is ready to consider with an open heart the objections which farmers have on the new farm laws. "The government has tried to address the concerns of farmers with an open heart and with respect for the farming community of the country. The government appeals the Kisan unions to end their agitation," it said. On farmers' fears that mandis would weaken after the new laws, the government said an amendment can be made wherein state governments can register the traders operating outside mandis. States can also impose tax and cess as they used in APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) mandis on them. On concerns that farmers may be duped as anyone having just a pan card is allowed to trade outside APMC mandis, the government said to rule out such apprehensions, the state governments can be given the power to register such traders and make rules keeping in mind the local situation of farmers. On the issue of farmers not getting the right to appeal in civil courts for dispute resolution, the government said it is open to making an amendment to provide for an appeal in civil courts. Currently, the dispute resolution is at the SDM level. On fears that big corporates will take over farmlands, the government said it has already been made clear in the laws, but still, for clarity's sake, it can be written that no buyer can take loans against farmland nor any such condition will be made to farmers. On attaching farmland under contract farming, the government said the existing provision is clear but still it can be clarified further if required. On fear about the scrapping of the MSP regime and shifting of trade to private players, the government said it is ready to give a written assurance that the existing MSP will continue. On demands to scrap the proposed Electricity Amendment bill 2020, the government said there won't be any change in the existing system of electricity bill payment for farmers. On farmers' demand to scrap the Air Quality Management of NCR Ordinance 2020, under which there is the provision of penalty for stubble burning, the government said it is ready to find an appropriate solution. On farmers' demand to provide registration of farming contracts, the government said till state governments make an arrangement for registration, an appropriate facility will be provided at the SDM office wherein a copy of the contract can be submitted 30 days after its signing. On Constitutional validity of farm laws, the ministers said it has the power under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List to pass laws on contract farming and intra- and inter-state trade, and prohibit states from imposing fees/cess outside APMC areas. It had followed legal provisions while enacting the laws and earlier for bringing ordinances, the ministers said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-open-to-amend-provisions-in-new-farm-laws-says-narendra-singh-tomar-as-farmers-intensify-protests-925744.html

"He left us in the early hours of December 10, at his home in Mumbai, after a brief illness, bravely borne," Deboo's family announced on Facebook. "He leaves behind a formidable legacy of unforgettable performances combined with an unswerving dedication to his art, matched only by his huge, loving heart that gained him thousands of friends and a vast number of admirers," the statement added. During a career that spanned half a century, Deboo consistently pushed boundaries, combining Indian classical dance forms such as Kathak and Kathakali with Western techniques to create a style that was indisputably modern. He performed with artists ranging from British rock band Pink Floyd, German dancer Pina Bausch and choreographer Alison Becker Chase, and appeared on stage in over 70 countries according to local media reports. He also collaborated with Indian artists including painter M.F. Hussain, Bollywood film-maker Vishal Bharadwaj as well as Tamil director Mani Ratnam. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2007. The Astad Deboo Dance Foundation, established by him in 2002, provided free training to poor and disabled students while Deboo himself worked with deaf students in India, Mexico and Hong Kong since the 1980s. Despite his success, Deboo felt financial sponsors were hard to come by for modern dance. "My journey has been full of ups and downs. Even today after 50 years, or 40 years, its difficult to get a sponsor for contemporary dance," he told Indian newspaper The Hindu in 2018. "You are always dancing on the edge."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-dance-pioneer-astad-deboo-passes-away-after-brief-illness-at-73-925749.html

In his address at the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), Singh also said terrorism remains a major scourge for the region and the world. The structures that support and sustain terrorism continue to exist, including in India's neighbourhood, he said in an apparent reference to terrorism emanating from Pakistan. He called for stronger commitment and need to strengthen international mechanism to fight terrorism, "jointly and vigorously". Talking about key geo-strategic issues, the defence minister highlighted India's vision for an open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific region based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations and peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue. Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe was among those who attended the virtual meeting of the ADMM-Plus, a platform comprising 10-nation ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its eight dialogue partners-- India, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States. "As we enhance mutual trust and confidence, exercising self-restraint in the conduct of activities and avoiding actions that may further complicate the situation, will go a long way in bringing sustained peace to the region," Singh said. Singh's comments came amid the seven-month-long military standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh, and Beijing's increasingly aggressive military behaviour in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific region. A number of ASEAN member nations have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. The defence minister also said the ability of the grouping to collectively respond to challenges based on the fundamentals of freedom, inclusivity and openness in the region will define its future. "Threats to the rules based order, maritime security, cyber related crimes and terrorism, just to name a few, remain the challenges that we need to address as a forum," he said. The defence ministry, in a statement, said Singh also emphasised that the Indo-Pacific region confronts numerous traditional and non-traditional security threats. It said he recalled the launch of the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during last year's East Asia Summit and mentioned the commonality between the IPOI and ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific. He also reiterated India's support to freedom of navigation and overflight for all in international waters in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In his address, Singh talked about "the current regional environment with visible strains", and appreciated the central role of ASEAN-led forums, including ADMM-Plus in promoting dialogue and engagement towards a pluralistic, cooperative security order in Asia. "The conduct of field training exercises and table-top exercises amongst the ADMM Plus countries are important tools for us to understand each other, cooperate to enhance security and maintain peace in the region," he said. The defence minister said the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific underscored the impetus to cultivate strategic trust and continuously promote ASEAN centrality in the regional architecture. "The concepts of 'vasudhaive kutumbakam'--'the whole world is one family', and 'sarve bhavantu sukhinah' -- 'all be at peace'-- are the core of the Indian civilisation. Therefore, inclusivity, equality and openness are the principles underlining this concept," he said. The defence minister also called for sustained efforts to address the threats of bio-terrorism, transnational trafficking and pandemics, and emphasised on building capacity to address shared security challenges. Singh underlined the need for confronting the challenges emerging from the coronavirus pandemic. "Amongst the new challenges that have emerged, Covid-19 has changed the world and left us many hurdles to overcome. Unfortunately the disruptive effect of the pandemic is still unfolding." "The challenge is, therefore, to make sure that the world economy moves on the path of recovery and when it does gather steam, to ensure that the recovery leaves no one behind," Singh said. The inaugural ADMM-Plus was convened in Hanoi in 2010. The defence ministers then had agreed on five areas of practical cooperation to pursue under the new mechanism, including maritime security, counter-terrorism, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping operations. "A special commemorative 10th anniversary celebration was conducted which was attended by Prime Minister of Socialist Republic of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Raksha mantri was extended the privilege to address the celebratory session as a special gesture reflecting India's recognition by the forum," the defence ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/asean-need-to-avoid-actions-that-may-complicate-situation-says-rajnath-in-veiled-dig-at-chinese-aggression-925755.html

In a resolution, the executive committee of the SCBA called upon all concerned governments to uphold and protect the constitutional right of all citizens to peaceful protest, honorary secretary Rohit Pandey said. "The executive committee of the SCBA has been dismayed to read reports in the media about the use of brute force to break up peaceful protests, where citizens raise their voices against State actions which they believe denigrate their basic rights," said a press release.  The recent legislation on farm produce, which excluded the jurisdiction of civil courts, followed by use of force to prevent the farmers from holding non-violent protests for their rights is a case in point, it added. "The farmers have sought to present their views on the legislations which in their opinion infringe their rights. This Association emphasises that the right of citizens to discuss, debate, criticise or protest against such Bills or Acts is sacrosanct.  Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our Constitution, and the bedrock of human rights," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-stir-scba-condemns-use-of-force-against-protesters-925765.html

Here is the top news of December 10, 2020: India's government is open to amending some provisions in new farm laws, the Union Agriculture Minister said on Thursday, after farmers rejected proposed changes to the controversial laws they said would harm their interests and help big food retailers. Farmers have been demonstrating since late last month over reforms enacted in September that loosened rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce, which had protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades.   Describing the laying of foundation stone of the new Parliament building as a "milestone in India's democratic history", Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said if the old Parliament house gave direction to the country post-independence, the new one would be a witness to making of a self-reliant India. Addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone of the new building and performing the ground-breaking ceremony, Modi said many new things were being done in the new Parliament House, which will increase the efficiency of the MPs as modern methods will be incorporated in the work culture.   The Karnataka Assembly on Thursday passed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Bill, which promises a new governance structure for the city besides increasing its municipal area. At present, Bengaluru is governed under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act. That the city should get a separate law was a long-pending demand. The Bill was passed with the Opposition benches empty as the Congress had decided to boycott the proceedings whereas the JD(S) did not show up. The Bill proposes ‘constituency consultative committees’, which are expected to give MLAs more say in the way the city is run.   West Bengal has become a state of "lawlessness and intolerance", said BJP chief J P Nadda at a party workers' meet after an attack on his convoy. If I have reached here for the meeting, it's due to Maa Durga's grace, he added. Nadda said he was not hurt as he was travelling in a bulletproof car, but others in the convoy were assaulted. When such a thing can happen to senior leaders of the BJP, the plight of common party cadres can be easily imagined, he said.

CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury described the new parliament building as a “colossal waste of resources” at a time when people need three meals a day, there was no clarity on the vaccine, jobs were being lost and farmers were on the streets. “Is this the priority this time,” Yechury asked. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said history would record that when farmers were fighting for their rights by protesting on the streets, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building. Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Manish Tewari found similarities in the design for the new Parliament building with the Pentagon, the heardquarters of the US Department of Defence, in Washington. Ramesh said the existing Parliament building built by the British bears a remarkable similarity to the Chausath Yogini Temple in Morena in Madhya Pradesh, while the new 'Atmanirbhar' Parliament building bears an eerie likeness to the Pentagon in Washington DC. He also shared pictures of the old and new Parliament buildings and that of the Pentagon and the Morena temple to draw a comparison. “Well, the existing Parliament building built by the Brits bears a remarkable similarity to the Chausath Yogini Temple in Morena in Madhya Pradesh, while the new ‘Atmanirbhar’ Parliament building bears an eerie likeness to the Pentagon in Washington DC,” Ramesh said. Meanwhile, Congress leader Udit Raj organised a protest march to demand that the new building be named after B R Ambedkar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-parliament-on-ruins-of-liberal-democracy-congress-925810.html

Nadda who was addressing a press conference in Kolkata, said the attack on his convoy spoke a lot about the "mentality and frustration" of the Mamata Banerjee government in the state. Nadda's convoy was pelted with stones by alleged Trinamool Congress workers when he was travelling to Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district from Kolkata to address a rally there. "What will be the plight of the common man when elected members are not safe? There is total lawlessness. Bengal is suffering from lawlessness, the administration has crumbled," Nadda said. Claiming that "cut money has become the order of the day in Bengal under the Trinamool Congress dispensation", Nadda said the "anarchic" TMC government will be removed "lock stock and barrel" in the state election due in April-May 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-chief-jp-nadda-takes-a-swipe-at-mamata-banerjee-govt-says-bengal-suffering-from-total-lawlessness-925837.html

The meeting was attended by the Director Generals of Police and other senior officials of the state governments and Union Territory administrations. The union home secretary reviewed the arrangements for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out and asked the state and UTs to prepare a database of the frontline workers who will receive the vaccine during the initial stages, a home ministry official said. Bhalla told the state government officials to prepare the database of police, home guards, and civil defence and fire brigade personnel. The meeting came days after three vaccine manufacturers sought emergency approval for rolling out their vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on November 28 visited Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune to review the development and manufacturing process of coronavirus vaccines at facilities in these cities. The central government has been putting in place measures for quick and effective distribution of coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available. An estimated one crore frontline health workers will also receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine whenever it becomes available, with around 92 per cent of government hospitals and 55 per cent of private hospitals across all states and UTs providing data identifying the workers. Police's role while enforcing the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown, help provided to the common people and facilitates given to the migrant workers in different parts of the country was praised by all across. According to an estimate, about 80,000 police and paramilitary personnel were infected by the Covid-19 in the country and over 1,000 of them succumbed to the virus. Among the infected are about 35,000 paramilitary personnel and 25,000 policemen in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India. The deaths included 100 paramilitary personnel and about 300 in Maharashtra Police, almost all of them while playing different roles during the pandemic. India's Covid-19 caseload climbed to 97,67,371 with 31,521 fresh infections, while the total number of recoveries surged to 92.53 lakh, pushing the national recovery rate to 94.74 per cent, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Thursday. The death toll rose to 1,41,772 with 412 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed. The Covid-19 case fatality rate stands at 1.45 per cent. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 92,53,306.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/union-home-secretary-ajay-kumar-bhalla-discusses-with-states-possible-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-925845.html

After discharging the BJP MP from East Delhi, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh sent the file back to the District Judge to transfer the matter to the court having jurisdiction as the magistrate's court was constituted exclusively to deal with matters in which MP/MLAs were an accused. The police had filed a supplementary charge sheet in September last year in the case against Gambhir and several others under various sections, including 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 34 (criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention), of the IPC. Over 50 flat buyers have filed the complaint alleging that they booked flats in a real estate project in Ghaziabad's Indirapuram in 2011 but it did not take off. Gambhir was a director and brand ambassador of the joint project of Rudra Buildwell Realty Pvt Ltd and H R Infracity Pvt Ltd, against which a case was lodged in 2016 for allegedly duping people of crores of rupees on the pretext of booking apartments in the housing project. In its charge sheet, the police had alleged that "the developers executed Builder Buyer Agreement with the victims in June-July, 2014 even after the expiry of sanctioned building plan on June 6, 2013. Developers have been demanding and collecting money from the victims unauthorisedly even after June 23, 2013." "Investors have been deliberately kept in the dark about the litigations involving the proposed site of land. Authorities cancelled the sanction/ approval etc. for the project on April 15, 2015 due to default of payments of requisite licence fees etc. and non-compliance of other formalities," the final report had said. Besides Gambhir and the firm, the charge sheet also included the names of its other promoters -- Mukesh Khurana, Gautam Mehra and Babita Khurana -- as accused. The complainants have alleged that "the project was extensively promoted and advertised and Gambhir, as the brand ambassador, helped in attracting and inviting buyers to invest in the project".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-court-clears-gautam-gambhir-of-all-charges-in-cheating-case-925846.html
10-12-2020||National||SC pulls up Jharkhand govt over delay in filing plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up the Jharkhand government for filing a petition about one year after the judgement was passed by the High Court in a case related to a private company in the state. "The state government as usual has walked into the Supreme Court after a delay of more than a year seeking to raise the issue of the importance of the matter! Applications do not disclose reasons for the delay," said a bench presided over by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, stating that the apex court cannot appreciate such kind of delays. The Jharkhand government's appeal against Shri Rani Sati Foods and Grains Private Ltd came a year after the High Court had declared its verdict.  Taking a serious view of the matter, the court directed the state government to fix responsibility on the officers concerned and recover Rs 50,000 as the cost from them. "We do believe that there is something to be said in the matter but we do not appreciate the kind of delays with which the petitioner-state has approached this court. Responsibility must be fixed for such delays," the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said. The court told Jharkhand's Additional Advocate General Arunabh Choudhary that the cost must be deposited along with the certificate of recovery in four weeks. It decided to consider the matter only after compliance with its direction. The top court's bench led by Justice Kaul had the time and again expressed displeasure over delay in filing of petitions by the state governments, beyond the period of limitation. The bench had said such kind of cases is filed to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the SC to save the skin of officers. In such cases, "the object appears to be to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue and thus, say that nothing could be done because the highest court has dismissed the appeal. It is to complete this formality and save the skin of officers," the court had earlier said in a different case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-pulls-up-jharkhand-govt-over-delay-in-filing-plea-925852.html
10-12-2020||National||Mamata Banerjee compares BJP leadership to Hitler, Mussolini||West Bengal Chief Minister hit out at the BJP on Thursday comparing its leadership to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and claimed that the party is indulging in false propaganda. Banerjee, who is among the vocal critics of the saffron party, said it has a "prepared script" to break the movements against it and is trying to do so with the farmers' movement. The TMC supremo criticised BJP national president J P Nadda's outreach programme in her constituency Bhawanipore in the city on Wednesday and said it was poorly attended. Likening the BJP leadership with dictators Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Nicolae Ceausescu, Banerjee told a protest rally by the party's farmers' wing here that "Narendra Modi's party (BJP) is indulging in false propaganda to further its agenda". She that the BJP has a "prepared script" to divert the attention of people, break the movements against it and is trying to do so with the ongoing farmers' movement too. "The Narendra Modi government is not abiding by the principles of democracy or the federal structure or the Constitution and is encroaching upon the jurisdiction of a state government," she said. Banerjee claimed that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had not "dared" to do such things though he had the support of 400 MPs. "But BJP with around 300 MPs is enforcing whatever laws it wishes to and is hurting the interests of the common man". Attacking the BJP-led government at the Centre for seeking accounts of the relief fund given to the state after the Amphan cyclone, she said "We first want to know what happened to the PM Cares Fund". Claiming that she has inputs about "many happenings", the chief minister said that she does not indulge in personal attacks. "If anyone in my family commits any wrong, he will be punished. I am for upholding of law, peace and against any kind of violence," Banerjee said. Describing the laying of the foundation stone for a new Parliament building by the prime minister on Thursday as a "stunt", she said that the money allotted for this could have been given to farmers for their benefit. "The present Sansad Bhavan can suffice for now," she added. Demanding withdrawal of the contentious agri laws by the Centre, Banerjee said that the legislations will hurt the interests of farmers and result in disastrous effect on prices of food items. Claiming that the rights of the farmers have been taken away by the new farm laws, Banerjee said that their produce will be "bought by force" by corporates and people will have to buy food items at high prices. "People must unite for protection of the interests of farmers," she said at the rally held in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue here. Potatoes, onions and edible oil must remain within the ambit of the Essential Commodities Act so that prices of these food items can be regulated for the benefit of the common man, the chief minister said. Referring to Nadda's programme, she said "I heard that he has said today that the Centre gives rice and the TMC eats away everything. Ask them (BJP) who takes away the money from the states and does not give back its dues." The chief minister said that the Centre takes away money from the states collected as income tax, customs duties, GST, but does not give back their dues, which is only 40 per cent of total collected amount. The TMC supremo claimed that the BJP is not a party of Bengal but that of Delhi and "more that of Gujarat". Alleging that the BJP is bringing strongmen from outside and sending them to West Bengal villages, she asked her party members to challenge them and file FIRs at local police stations when they come across any such persons. Claiming that Kolkata is the safest city in the country, Banerjee said "Bengal is such a nice place and they (BJP) are indulging in false claims against it." The chief minister said that political murders from May 2001 to May 2011 in the state during the Left Front rule numbered 663, while from June 2011 to June 2019, the number stood at 153. She claimed that during the TMC rule, all religious programmes were held peacefully, including Durga Puja, Bakri Eid and Kali Puja.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mamata-banerjee-compares-bjp-leadership-to-hitler-mussolini-925861.html

Badal also hit out at the central government for allegedly trying to project the protesting farmers as "anti-national" and demanded that the Centre repeal the new farm laws. "Farmers want these laws should be repealed. If farmers do not want these laws, why are you forcing upon them?" he asked. "This policy of forcing upon like earlier they (Centre) forced upon demonetisation and GST (goods and services tax), and now they want whatever decision they make while sitting in offices should be implemented forcibly," Badal told the media on Thursday evening. "This is a democratic country. If farmers do not want it (laws). You have seen all the farmers' organisations have joined hands. Bharat Bandh was observed. Farmers do not want these laws and then why they are keeping it (laws). I do not understand it," the SAD chief said. He alleged that it has become the attitude of the government to "confront and suppress" the voice. "You cannot suppress (voice) in a democracy. They are our countrymen," he said. "It is bad that the Centre is trying to project farmers as anti-national. If you are saying they are anti-national then why did you hold meetings with them. Because now your meeting has failed, you termed them anti-national," he alleged. "It has been an attempt of the central government that whosoever does not agree with it, be it a political party or a section of people, they try to project them as anti-national. These farmers are not anti-national," he said. Badal condemned the union government for not acceding to farmers' demand of repealing the new agri legislations. "The farmers do not want the black laws framed by Modi sahib (Prime Minister Narendra Modi). Democracy means that it is the duty of the government that it should not implement those things which the public do not want," he said. Farmers were being shown as "extremists" and "Khalistanis", said Badal, adding that they were also being shown having been associated with a particular religion. "Do not repeat Congress' blunders of divide and rule. Do nothing that weakens national unity or disturbs peace and communal harmony for which Punjabis, specially the SAD, have made supreme sacrifices," said a resolution of the party's core committee that met here. Harcharan Bains, principal advisor to Badal, said the SAD will observe the centenary of the party as "Sangharsh Samarpan Divas", with focus on farmers' interests and justice for them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-trying-to-thrust-black-laws-like-it-imposed-demonetisation-gst-sukhbir-singh-badal-925862.html
10-12-2020||National||Covid-19: India's mRNA vaccine receives approval for human trial||The Centre has approved the human safety trials of a homegrown Covid-19 vaccine that uses the same technology as the Moderna and Pfizer shots but promises to remain stable at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, making it more suitable for use in India. The Indian drug regulator, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, permitted Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals to conduct a phase-1/2 clinical trial of its mRNA vaccine on Wednesday with the condition that on completion of the first phase examining the vaccine’s safety, the company would submit its data for a review before starting the phase-2 to evaluate the vaccine’s immune response. The permission was granted on the basis of animal toxicity studies. While the first phase of the Indian trial would be carried out at two hospitals in Pune and Aurangabad, the vaccine would also undergo clinical trials in the USA. Developed by the Gennova Biopharmaceuticals in collaboration with the Seattle based HDT Bio Corp, the mRNA-based vaccine received approximately Rs 20 crore funding support from the Department of Biotechnology and $ 8.2 million (nearly Rs 60 crore) grant from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for clinical testing. “DBT’s role goes beyond seed funding. Using our vaccine expert group under the Indo-US Vaccine Action Programme, we gave them technical strength and scientific guidance. It's India’s first mRNA based vaccine, which if proven successful would be very good for us as it can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius temperature,” Renu Swarup, DBT Secretary told DH. “This is one of the projects receiving funds under the Rs 900 crore Covid-Suraksha Mission. We are supporting 12-13 vaccine candidates.” Though mRNA vaccines are new technology, they have several advantages over conventional vaccines including a faster pace of development as they don’t need any bacterial host to grow. “The vaccine is easily scalable and cost-effective,” she said. Thermal stability is an added advantage for the Gennova-HDT product unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots that are also based on the same technology but have ultra-low cooling requirements for storage and transportation. The mRNA platform was originally developed to create personalized cancer vaccines. When the pandemic hit the world, the two companies repurposed the platform to create a vaccine against the SARS-Cov-2, using the same approach, which the virus takes to invade the body. The vaccine candidate HGCO19 contains a short, synthetic version of a genetic material (mRNA) that mimics the spike protein of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. When the vaccine is injected, the mRNA is taken to muscle cells where it instructs the cells to make numerous copies of the mRNA mimicking the spike protein. Other immune cells would then take on the spike proteins and in the process learn to identify the coronavirus and protect the body if the person were ever to be actually infected.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-indias-mrna-vaccine-receives-approval-for-human-trial-925865.html
10-12-2020||National||Universities can set higher standards than the ones prescribed by AICTE, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said while universities cannot dilute the standards prescribed by AICTE, they certainly have the power to stipulate enhanced norms and standards for their colleges. "Ultimately, it is the universities which are obliged to issue degrees and whose reputation is inextricably intertwined with the fate and performance of the students, that may have to face the music and hence their role cannot be belittled," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said.  The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said though the AICTE had the power to conduct inspections and take penal actions against colleges, the students were mostly left in the lurch. "It does not mean anything and does not serve any purpose for the students who get admitted to colleges which have necessary infrastructure only on paper and not on site. The regulations of the AICTE are silent as to how the students will get compensated when penal action is taken against colleges which host false information online in their applications to AICTE," the bench said. The top court allowed an appeal by the A P J Abdul Kalam Technological University and set aside a judgement by the Kerala High Court which had held that a varsity cannot go beyond AICTE Regulations in granting recognition to an engineering college. "No state-run university can afford to have a laid-back attitude today when their own performance is being measured by international standards. Therefore, the power of the universities to prescribe enhanced norms and standards, cannot be doubted," the bench said. The court pointed out that at present, even the universities are being ranked according to the quality of standards maintained by them.  The Ministry of Human Resources Development, now Ministry of Education, launched an initiative in September 2015, known as National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), for the categorisation of institutions, including universities, in the country on the basis of parameters like teaching, earning and resources; research and professional practice; graduation outcomes; outreach and inclusivity; and peer perception.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/universities-can-set-higher-standards-than-the-ones-prescribed-by-aicte-says-sc-925868.html

The agitating farmers rejected Tomar’s appeal for further talks and announced that it would now also block railway tracks in addition to staging demonstrations in all districts, toll plazas on highways and protests in all the states starting Saturday. Addressing a press conference, Tomar and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal insisted that the three farm sector laws have been enacted by the government with the intention to liberate the farmers from the shackles of the mandi system by giving them an option to sell their produce anywhere and to anyone. “It is also unfair to intensify the agitation when the talks were still on,” the ministers said, adding that the government has an “open mind” and ready for discussion on “any forum”. Goyal and Tomar described the new farm laws as “biggest agricultural reforms” in the country so far and made it clear that the government is ready to make amendments to address the concerns of the farmers. Tomar said that he is “pained” to see that the farmers are not able to take a decision despite all their concerns being addressed by the government. “Every law is for the people of the country. There are many who believe that they will benefit from these laws,” Tomar said. Citing the adverse weather conditions and the Covid-19 pandemic, Goyal urged the union leaders to allow the farmers to go to their villages, while they continue the talks with the government to clear their doubts on the reforms. “We are opposed to these laws in principle since they were brought to benefit traders and corporations. Before these protests started, the government did not pay heed to our concerns,” Darshan Pal Singh, President of the Krantikari Kisan Union, told reporters. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) President Balbir Singh Rajewal said that proposals sent by the government had been discussed several times before and there is nothing new in them. “The farmer unions have not shut the doors for talks, but the government must come with concrete proposals,” Rajewal said. The farmers have been agitating against the farm sector reforms since November 26 on the Delhi borders and insist that the government repeal the laws as they would benefit the corporate sector.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unfair-to-intensify-agitation-when-talks-are-going-on-centre-to-farmers-925869.html

10-12-2020||National Politics||PM Modi faces pressure as support for farm protests grows||India’s farmers have vowed to expand their protests across the country, buoyed by growing support from other key groups like military veterans, increasing the pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to scrap its new farm laws. Farmers’ issues are both emotive as well politically significant in the country of more than 1.3 billion people, where over 60% depend on agriculture either directly or indirectly. The added support, especially from retired soldiers, another widely respected group, makes it increasingly likely that the protests will spread beyond the Indian capital. Banking and IT workers, as well as a dozen opposition parties and 10 trade unions, also back the demonstrations that began a fortnight ago. “We stand in solidarity with the peacefully protesting farmers, empathize with them, and support their demands,” a group of retired army soldiers said in a press statement. Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping out near several entry points to New Delhi since Nov. 26 in protest against the legislation that they say will hurt farm incomes and leave them vulnerable to big corporations. After a nationwide strike call by farmers’ groups on Tuesday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah invited protest leaders for talks to try and break the impasse. The discussions ended inconclusively, like several previous sessions, and it now remains unclear when the next round of dialogue will be held. “We have rejected the government offer to our demands. If there is another offer then we will consider it,” Jangvir Singh, a farm leader told reporters at the protest site on Wednesday. The protesters said they will block at least two national highways on Dec. 12 and also protest outside the offices of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Modi has weathered several political storms since he came to power in 2014. His decision to repeal the constitutional autonomy of Indian Kashmir and enact a new religion-based citizenship law saw considerable resistance but the government was able to ride those out without significant cost. This time the situation may be different. “The Modi government is caught between a rock and a hard place. Now everybody has dug in their heels,” said Yamini Aiyar, president and chief executive of the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research. They’re “not sure how they will build consensus. Repealing will be a difficult decision.” The government is sensitive to the demands of farmers and talks are underway, Prakash Javadekar, the federal information and broadcasting minister told reporters Wednesday without giving any details. The Prime Minister’s Office didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. No Rollback Farmer leaders have said the government has so far ruled out any rollback of the legislation. “Shah told us that the government is willing to discuss and amend the law but we made it clear the stage for discussions is over and nothing short of repealing the laws and starting afresh will do,” said Shiv Kumar Sharma, a farm leader from Madhya Pradesh state. The three new laws -- pushed through in an abbreviated session of parliament in September -- seek to remove restrictions on marketing farm products and allow cultivators to engage with private companies to sell their crops. Farmers fear this will prompt the government to stop making direct purchases at minimum state-set prices. They argue the laws will hurt their incomes and make agriculture in India harder, while the government says the reforms will make farming more competitive. “All three laws are pro corporates and tinkering with amendments will not solve the problem,” said Ashok Dhawale, president of the All India Kisan Sabha, a group representing farmers, noting the support from veterans, fishermen, trade unions, and others. “Farmers organizations are unanimous in the demand that the only solution is to repeal the laws.” Modi himself has taken to social media and used his monthly national radio address to try and assuage the farmers’ concerns but to little avail. “The widespread support for farmers will make the government understand that the demand is beyond the boundaries of farmers,” said Avik Saha, organizing secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, another farmers’ group. “Widespread support means the government is doing something wrong.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-faces-pressure-as-support-for-farm-protests-grows-925655.html

If I have reached here for the meeting, it's due to Maa Durga's grace, he added. "What I witnessed today is shocking and unprecedented. West Bengal has become a state characterised by utter lawlessness and intolerance. The administration has completely failed and goonda raj prevails," he later told a meeting of party workers. Nadda said he was not hurt as he was travelling in a bulletproof car, but others in the convoy were assaulted. When such a thing can happen to senior leaders of the BJP, the plight of common party cadres can be easily imagined, he said. "If I have reached here for the meeting it is due to Maa Durga's grace...I can imagine how difficult it is for common party workers in Bengal," he said. Stones were pelted at BJP president J P Nadda's convoy in West Bengal's South 24 Paraganas district on Thursday. Vehicles belonging to the media were also damaged. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya's car was also completely ransacked in the melee, sources in the saffron party said.  "Does rule of law exist in Bengal at all? The convoy of our national president is being attacked. Our party cadres and leaders are injured. This is unprecedented in democracy," Vijayvargiya said. "The party will end this jungle raj in West Bengal. Is this a sign of democracy? The TMC government should be ashamed for letting loose such anarchy," Ghosh said. The situation was brought under control after the police intervened and cleared the road for the convoy to pass.

Initially, the service will start with one flight daily from each side between Delhi and Kathmandu, they said. The decision to resume the flight service comes two weeks after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited Kathmandu during which he held extensive talks with the political brass. Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali is likely to visit India in the next three weeks. "India and Nepal have decided to open flights under a bilateral bubble arrangement, as we have done with several countries," said a source. The flights between the two countries were suspended following the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. "We had proposed to Nepal some time back and Nepal has cleared it now," said a source. It is not immediately known when the flight service will be started. The sources said Shringla, during his visit to Nepal on November 26 to 27 had highlighted the importance of people-to-people connectivity in sync with the special relationship between the two countries. "We are starting the service with Indian and Nepalese nationals and holders of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) cards of all nationalities, and all valid Indian visa holders except tourist visa," the source said. From the Indian side, the flights will be operated by Air India which, in normal times, had a daily flight between Delhi and Kathmandu, the sources said. "Air bubble arrangement will follow medical protocols as is being done with other countries which includes RT PCR test report of 72 hours prior to travel," the source said. India has already started air bubble arrangement with several countries. The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it an "unilateral act" and cautioned Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it. Last month, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane too had visited Nepal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-nepal-decide-to-resume-flight-services-under-air-bubble-arrangement-925698.html

However, Khajan Singh has rubbished the allegations by the CRPF constable who has won several medals at national and international levels. No immediate comment was available from Surjit Singh. According to the FIR, the constable has also accused Khajan and Surjit of running a "sex scandal" in the force and alleged that they have "many accomplices". Khajan Singh, a DIG-rank officer in the force who won a silver medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, told PTI: "These allegations are absolutely false. This has been done just to spoil my image." In the FIR registered at Baba Haridas police station on December 3, the complainant, who joined the force in 2010, alleged that the two sexually harass female constables and later use them as "their accomplice". "They secretly took my nude photos while having a bath. I was blackmailed through these photographs and they threatened that if I do not talk to them, they would circulate my photos and make it viral on the internet," the constable alleged in the FIR. CRPF spokesperson Moses Dhinakaran said, "FIR of rape charges filed against Khajan Singh, DIG, by a constable woman. CRPF has taken a serious note of the complaint and has already constituted an Internal Complaint Committee headed by an Inspector General level officer to conduct an inquiry". "As far as FIR is concerned, the department will facilitate the investigation agency in all respects," the spokesperson said. Khajan Singh was given the Arjuna award in 1984. Hugely successful at the national level, Khajan held the 100m freestyle national record and also clinched multiple gold medals at the South Asian Games (then known as South Asian Federation Games) in 1984 and 1989. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka), Santosh Kumar Meena, said, "As per the complaint received, we have registered a case and an investigation is underway." Police said the statement of the victim is yet to be taken because she is currently out of station. "They threatened me (constable) with making my photos viral on the internet and used it for raping me continuously for over a period of three years," it has been alleged in the FIR. It also stated that the two allegedly harassed her through show-cause notices. The FIR also stated that in March 2014, the woman constable had filed a formal complaint with the CRPF Inspector General, but she was allegedly forced by the accused to withdraw it. It also stated that she had also written a letter to the National Commission of Women (NCW) chairperson seeking action against the two. In her complaint to the NCW chief, she had also sought protection for her life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/crpf-constable-accuses-khajan-singh-of-rape-singh-rubbishes-charge-925706.html

Thousands of farmers have been protesting on various borders of the national capital against the three farm laws enacted in September. "The new agriculture laws brought by the Centre will exploit the farmers," the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister told reporters here on Wednesday night. "This government is working aimlessly and it is going to ruin the entire country," he alleged. "The President gives suggestions to the central government. Now, it is for the central government to take a call. The government should try to understand the reality of the agriculture sector," Nath said in response to a query over opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, meeting President Ram Nath Kovind seeking repeal of the farm laws. "Our economy is agrarian and unless the farm sector grows strong financially, the economy will not improve," Nath added. "Our priority right now should be that farmers get justice and that they get fair prices for their produce," the former Union minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-trying-to-ruin-country-kamal-nath-on-new-farm-laws-925719.html

People are showing their hatred towards the AIADMK government and waiting for the elections to install the DMK government, Kanimozhi, who has been on a whirlwind tour of the district for the last two days, told reporters here. Stating that the AIADMK dispensation lacked ability to govern, she said the people she met during her tour were expressing displeasure on the government and were ready to oust it. On whether there could be a change in the DMK alliance, Kanimozhi said the existing alliance would continue and bringing more parties into the DMK-fold would be decided upon by its leader M K Stalin. Replying to a query on film star Rajnikanth's entry into politics, she said she does not want to comment on a person who has not floated a party yet. Anybody can start a party in the democracy but the DMK vote-bank would be intact, she said. On her tour of the western districts, Kanimozhi said almost all sections of society were talking against the AIADMK government be it industrialists, weavers and farmers. Tamil Nadu has the highest unemployment rate in the country, she said. Reiterating the DMK's support to ryots agitating for repealing the three farm laws, Kanimozhi said not only the farmers but also the common man would be hard-hit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-power-can-stop-dmk-from-coming-to-power-says-kanimozhi-925853.html
10-12-2020||National Politics||Centre, BJP furious over attack on J P Nadda; seek report, raise 'tyranny' charge against TMC||The Union home ministry sent the communication to the West Bengal government after the BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday alleging that a mob armed with sticks and bamboos was allowed to demonstrate in front of BJP's state unit office in Kolkata and there were serious lapses on security arrangements. The party, which had in last two years repeatedly raked up the issue of "the cult of political violence against BJP workers" in the Trinamool Congress-ruled state, on Thursday issued statements ranging from concern to warning to the Opposition ruled state as elections are just six months away. BJP is aggressively trying to expand in West Bengal, where it had won 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections, a nine-fold jump from the just two in 2014 and considers itself a serious contender for power in the state, where Congress is pale shadow of its glorious past and the CPI-M, which ruled the state for three decades, still tottering after having lost to Banerjee-led TMC in 2011. The attack from BJP was led by senior ministers like Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh as well leaders like Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia as the saffron party's condemnation of the attacked ringed loud across all BJP-ruled states. In October this year also when violent clashes marked a protest march of BJP in Kolkata, the saffron party top leaders raised the "tyranny" charge against Banerjee. Way back in 2018 itself, BJP tried to replicate its Kerala model of highlighting the violence against its leaders in West Bengal and went to the extent of organising a "pind daan" (post death ritual) for 80 slain party workers. The attack on the party chief gives the BJP an opportunity to deepen the campaign around the theme of political violence. Calling the attack a a reflection of the declining law and order in West Bengal, Rajnath Singh sought a through investigation and 'fixing of responsibility for the attack" while Shah said the state government will have to answer to the peace-loving people of the state ( voting in the next Assembly polls) for this sponsored violence, an euphemism. Going hammer and tongs, he alleged that the state has "descended into an era of tyranny, anarchy and darkness" under the Trinamool rule and ruled over the manner in which "political violence has been institutionalised and brought to the extreme" there. Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia said Banerjee will not return to power with such violence and anarchy adding that violence has no place in politics even as there may be ideological differences. The Bengal violence also had its echo at the joint press conference of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in the national capital, which was otherwise called to douse the fire of farm agitation. Calling the attack in Bengal, a "complete breakdown of law and order" and alleging that attempts have been made to muzzle democratic processes in the state, Tomar and Goyal demanded the strictest possible action against the "goons" behind the attack. In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Chouhan said "stones pelted on Nadda Ji's car will prove to be the last nail on TMC's coffin in West Bengal."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-bjp-furious-over-attack-on-j-p-nadda-seek-report-raise-tyranny-charge-against-tmc-925855.html

Hitting the campaign trail for the District Development Council (DDC) polls in Jammu and Kashmir, Thakur condemned the attack on the convoy of BJP president J P Nadda in West Bengal. Nadda's convoy came under attack by alleged TMC supporters in West Bengal on Thursday. "The Gupkar gang and Mamata Banerjee propagate anarchy and the death of democracy. They are hand in glove with those spreading fear, hatred and disruption to public life," Thakur alleged. "The brazen daylight attack on Nadda shows the level to which the law and order situation has stooped low in West Bengal. I condemn in the strongest possible words the attack by TMC workers on the president of the world's largest political party," he said. The minister accused Banerjee of misusing public machinery such as the police force for her political vendetta. Thakur went on to say, "Neither is her 'Mamata' visible nor is she behaving like 'didi' with her own people." "The Gupkar gang is no less, it has also used political machinery for political vendetta and benefits. It has encouraged those with the bullet instead of the ballot, however it's clear from the rising voter turnout that people have chosen the ballot," he added. Thakur said the "Gupkar gang's gundaraj" has no place in the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's good governance is here to stay. "How many terror attacks will it take for the Gupkar gang to stop its blind support for separatists? How many lives and livelihoods need to be lost for the Gupkar gang to forget self interest for people's interest in Jammu and Kashmir?" he asked. Thakur said the people of the UT are fed up with the politics of hate and want peace and prosperity. "They want progress and a progressive agenda for their future. The BJP has made it clear that this winter will bury the divisive politics of the Gupkar gang and next spring will be a new dawn of development under the BJP," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gupkar-gang-mamata-propagate-anarchy-says-anurag-thakur-925882.html

Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have also received a fresh spell of snowfall due to the western disturbance. "After the western disturbance withdraws, icy cold northwesterly winds blowing from snow-laden Himalayas will bring temperatures down in the plains," an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 29 degrees Celsius. Delhi's air quality was recorded in the "very poor" category, and is likely to improve over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed and light rain. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 304 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 358 on Wednesday.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union Territory government, for his part, made a statement that the petitioners do not seem to be illegal encroachers and they would not be disturbed. "Subsequent to the filing of this special leave petition here, the review petition by the UT and other beneficiaries is listed on December 21 at the High Court. Until and unless reviews are decided we can't do much," a bench presided over by Justice N V Ramana said. The top court adjourned the case for consideration in the last week of January. It also clarified that the pendency of this case will not come in way of any of the petitioners approaching the Jammu and Kashmir High Court in a review petition. The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, was dealing with a batch of petitions filed by Broadways Enterprises Pvt Ltd and others against October 9, 2020 judgement. The High Court had then held the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 (referred to as "Roshni Act") unconstitutional and further held the Jammu and Kashmir State Lands of Ownership to the Occupants) Rules, 2007 to be ultra vires and declared all actions taken pursuant to Roshni Rules, 2007 to be completely illegal and void ab initio. The High Court had also directed the CBI probe into the matter on illegal encroachment of hundreds of acres of public land. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the petitioners, contended that the High Court was looking at unauthorised encroachers of the land but they have been the lawful occupants. "So far as illegal encroachers are concerned, the government will oppose but for petitioners, we will do nothing without notice," Mehta said. He also said the UT administration was not against bonafide and common people who were not land grabbers. The bench also noted the common ground for challenge by the petitioners was that they have not been heard.  The court said since review petition has been filed by the State and others in the High Court, it should be better to avoid parallel proceedings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/roshni-act-supreme-court-asks-jammu-and-kashmir-high-court-to-decide-on-review-pleas-925652.html

Her husband, who was accompanying her while the couple was returning from the ‘Saaptahik Haat’ (weekly market), was held hostage at knife-point by five accused, while the others took turns to rape her. The victim, a mother of five, is a resident of Kathikund in Dumka. The Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Dumka, Sudarshan Mandal, said one person has been detained in this connection while raids were on to apprehend the other accused named in the complaint lodged by the victim. “The victim has identified one person. Meanwhile, she has been sent to the Dumka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for a medical check-up,” said Ambar Lakra, the SP. Sources in Dumka informed Deccan Herald that the victim’s husband told the police that the couple was returning from the weekly market at 8 pm on Tuesday when 17 persons waylaid them and held him hostage. “I was held hostage at knife-point, while the culprits took my wife to the bushes and gang-raped her. When I tried to free myself, and go to her rescue, I was mercilessly thrashed,” the husband told the Dumka police. “The woman is not consistent in her statements. She told me she was gang-raped by five persons when I quizzed her,” Lakra said. Meanwhile, the cops have launched a manhunt to nab the absconding accused based on the descriptions provided by the victim and her husband. In the meantime, the National Commission for Women (NCW) on Thursday sought a report from the Jharkhand government in the gangrape case.

The Delhi government told a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad that it has sanctioned funds for recruiting ministerial and group-C staff in the district courts, state legal services authority (DSLSA) and the Delhi Judicial Academy. Besides, funds for recruitment of junior judicial assistant and purchase of the webex licenses have also been sanctioned as was directed by the bench, the government has said in its status report filed through advocate Santosh Kumar Tripathi.

Subsequently, the file was withdrawn for reconsideration, the report said. The report was filed pursuant to the court's December 3 direction to the Delhi government to grant administrative approval and necessary sanctions for releasing Rs 1.44 crore to purchase 761 licences from Cisco Webex in order to continue with virtual court hearings in the district courts in the national capital. The bench had observed that "the continuing pandemic situation in Delhi requires virtual hearings in the district courts to be continued and the entire proceedings shall come to a grinding halt in the event funds are not released forthwith" for acquiring the licences. The Delhi government status report states that amounts of Rs 2.52 crore and Rs 8.54 crore have been sanctioned for recruiting ministerial and group-C staff, respectively.

10-12-2020||North and Central||India's iconic circular Parliament - where country began its 'tryst with destiny'||India's iconic circular Parliament building may be readying to abdicate its position of preeminence to a brand new complex, but its historical relevance remains immortal and it was from here that the country embarked on its "tryst with destiny". It was at this building where Bhagat Singh tried to "wake up the British masters", the Constitution came into being, the transfer of power from the British took place and the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowed before entering for the first time as an MP, and all of this cannot be forgotten, former Lok Sabha Secretary General Subhash Kashyap told PTI. Another former Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary said the historical significance and importance of the current building should be maintained even as a new building was needed going forward. He asserted that any attempt to "hide the building" with other surrounding buildings that would come up, will be "violence to history". Kashyap expressed confidence that the construction of a new building cannot take away the historical importance of the current Parliament building. "It is one of the best parliamentary buildings in the world. It should and I believe it will retain its historical importance," he said. The current building has been witness to historic and epoch-changing events -- be it revolutionaries Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt throwing bombs to "wake up" the colonial rulers, the meeting of the Constituent Assembly or the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru making his famous "tryst with destiny" speech on the midnight of August 14-15, 1947. The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921, and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927, by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin. The existing building marks a "glorious chapter" in the country's history and it was coming to an end with the new Parliament building set to come up, Achary told PTI. He said the current Parliament House cannot hold all the future MPs as their number would go up when the freeze on the number would be lifted in 2026 and it would not be possible to accommodate the members in the current establishment. "Finding a new place is inevitable. For that, the sooner the better. That does not mean the kind of publicity that is being given, which shows that this old Parliament House is of not much significance while the new Parliament will be something much bigger and grander. That projection is not correct," Achary said. "Building a new Parliament House is not a bad thing, but I have some reservation about the way it is being projected," he said. Emphasising on the need for a new building, Kashyap said there is only a temporary check on the number of MPs as after 2026 the number of MPs is likely to increase, and then there will be no seating space for them. "The needs of Parliament have to be taken care of. In the new technological age, the communication and info techniques call for a new building," he said. Achary also slammed critics who criticize the current building for having colonial baggage, saying if the issue of "imperial stamp" is taken, the first building that will have to be demolished is the Rashtrapati Bhavan because that was the viceroy's house earlier. "I believe that these buildings are some of the grandest buildings in the world and the whole layout of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the South Block and North Block and the Rajpath to India Gate, it's such a grand sight," he said. "I have seen many parliaments in the world but this building stands out as a unique kind of building," Achary said. The building has been witness to historic debates, momentous legislations and the growth of India's vibrant democracy. It also braved the 2001 attack by terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), in which nine people were killed inside the Parliament complex. The current Parliament House building is a massive circular edifice 560 feet in diametre and the open verandah on the first floor is fringed with a colonnade of 144 creamy sandstone columns, each of 27 feet. The focus of the building is the big circular edifice of the Central Hall. On the three axes radiating from this centre are placed the three Chambers for Lok Sabha (House of the People), Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the erstwhile Library Hall (formerly the Chamber of Princes) and between them lie the garden courts. The Supreme Court of India also functioned from the erstwhile Chamber of Princes after it was inaugurated on January 28, 1950, till it moved to the present building in 1958. The Central Hall is a place of great historical significance as the transfer of power on the midnight of August 14-15 from British to Indian hands took place in this hall. The Indian Constitution was also framed in the Central Hall. The Constituent Assembly met there from December 9, 1946, to January 24, 1950. Apart from the fact that the building was built with indigenous material and by Indian labour, the architecture of the building bears a close imprint of the Indian tradition. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres and is being built at an estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. The construction of the new building is estimated to take 21 months and the government expects it to be ready by the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/indias-iconic-circular-parliament-where-country-began-its-tryst-with-destiny-925721.html

Delhi recorded 2,463 new Covid-19 cases and 50 fatalities on Wednesday, the lowest number of deaths in a single day since November 1. As the positivity rate slipped to 3.42 per cent, Jain had on Wednesday tweeted that it was heartening to see that the national capital is "emerging victorious" in the battle against the coronavirus. "Cases are falling, and death count in a day is lowest in the last 40 days. The situation has improved, and we can definitely say the third wave of the pandemic here is on the wane. It is not over, but on the wane," he told reporters on Thursday. On plans of Covid-19 vaccination, he said, healthcare workers and frontline staff will be administered the vaccine first, followed by the elderly and then others. "If we have vaccine availability, we can vaccinate the entire population in a week's time, we have the preparations ready," he added. Asked about non-Covid-19 patients needing ICU beds, he said, "We will review the situation. But ICU beds can't be managed overnight, if cases suddenly increase, so we had to see the trend stabilise first". He asserted that over 13,000 beds are available for Covid-19 patients in Delhi, which is "not there in any city of the country", adding that 2,500 ICU beds are also available for them. Asked how many people have registered for the Covid-19 vaccine, he said, about two lakh till Wednesday. He reiterated that the overall positivity rate is is less than 5 per cent for the last seven days. Also, RT-PCR positivity rate is now down to 6 per cent, and since early November, a fall of about 80 per cent in positivity rate, which is a satisfactory trend, Jain said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/third-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-in-delhi-on-the-wane-jain-925763.html
10-12-2020||North and Central||Deputy CM Sisodia's residence attacked by BJP goons with help of Delhi police: AAP||The AAP on Thursday claimed that the house of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was "attacked by BJP goons". The Delhi BJP, however, refuted the allegations, saying their protest was peaceful. The BJP workers earlier staged a protest near Sisodia''s residence over an alleged conspiracy to kill mayors and leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations staging an indefinite dharna demanding payment of dues from the Kejriwal government. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also condemned the incident and wondered why the BJP was “getting so desperate by the day in Delhi”. "I strongly condemn the systematic, organised and violent attack on Dy CM Manish Sisodia's home. The goons entered his house in police presence when he was away. Why is BJP getting so desperate by the day in Delhi?" he tweeted. Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged that the police did not stop the goons from entering Sisodia's residence and even removed the barricades around the house. He also played a purported video of the outside area of Sisodia's residence where a group of people can be seen forcefully entering inside. "BJP goons attacked the house of deputy chief minister while he was not at home. The Delhi Police helped the BJP goons in this act," Bhardwaj added. No immediate reaction was available from the city police. AAP leader Atishi called it a "black day" in Delhi's political history. "This is a black day in Delhi's political history that the Union Home Minister is now using his party goons and Delhi Police to attack the family of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in his absence from his residence," she said at the press conference. Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP vice president Ashok Goel Devraha claimed AAP leaders were trying to divert attention from the 'conspiracy' to kill BJP mayors and other corporation leaders. "We protested outside Sisodia's residence to make it clear that the BJP workers are capable of answering any form of challenge," he said. The Delhi BJP had on Wednesday lodged a police complaint against Sisodia and AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, alleging that they were conspiring to kill leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations. Pathak had rubbished the allegation, saying the BJP has a habit of mixing random audios with random videos to "defame and malign" the image of people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/deputy-cm-sisodias-residence-attacked-by-bjp-goons-with-help-of-delhi-police-aap-925770.html
10-12-2020||North and Central||Will block train tracks if demands not met, say farmer leaders||Farmers agitating for the past two weeks against the new agri laws on Thursday announced that they will block railway tracks if their demands are not met by the government. Farmer unions, which held a meeting on Thursday, said they will soon announce a date for blocking tracks across the country. Addressing reporters at the Singhu border where they have been protesting for almost two weeks to demand a rollback of the law, the farmer unions also reiterated that they will intensify their agitation and start blocking all highways leading to the national capital. "We will block railway tracks if our demands are not met. We will decide on the date and announce it soon. The blocking of tracks will not be limited to Haryana and Punjab but it will be done across the country," farmer leader Boota Singh said at the press conference. The announcement by farmers came on the day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table. Tomar also urged farmer union leaders to consider proposals sent to them to break the deadlock over protests and said the government is ready for further discussions with them any time. "Centre has admitted that laws have been made for traders. If agriculture is a state subject, the central government does not have right to make laws on it," said Balbir Singh Rajewal, another leader. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points for almost two weeks seeking a repeal of the new Agri laws, which they claim were aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce. The government had on Wednesday proposed to give a "written assurance" that the existing MSP regime for procurement will continue. However, the farmers' unions rejected the proposal and said they would intensify their agitation until the government accepts their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws. The government has also proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including one to allay fears about the weakening of the 'mandi' system. "Five rounds of talks have already been held with the government, but they remained inconclusive. So far, the government has not sent us an invitation for another round of talks. If the government sends us a proposal for a meeting, we will decide it in our meeting," another farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka told PTI. Asked about the solution to the ongoing standoff with the government, Kakka said, "only God knows." "We are facing a lot of difficulties due to cold weather and the Covid-19 pandemic, but despite this, we will continue our protest until our demands are met," Kakka also added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-block-train-tracks-if-demands-not-met-say-farmer-leaders-925778.html

Alert BSF troops guarding the IB at a border outpost fired on the drone Wednesday night, forcing it to return back, the officials said. There have been instances of Pakistan, its army and intelligence agencies using drones along the IB and LoC to ferry weapons, ammunition, explosive material and narcotics into Jammu and Kashmir in the past six months. On November 29, alert security forces deployed on the International Border (IB) with Pakistan spotted a drone in Arnia sector of Jammu district. On November 21, drone movement was noticed in Mendhar sector along the Line of Control (LoC) amid a surge in ceasefire violations by the Pakistani Army, according to sources. Two drones were spotted and crossed the IB in Samba sector on November 20. On June 20, a Pakistani drone loaded with a sophisticated rifle and seven grenades was shot down by the Border Security Force along the International Border in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/drone-movement-spotted-over-border-in-jammu-bsf-925795.html

Scores of protestors belonging to Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) stayed put at the Chilla border, while those of BKU (Lok Shakti) continued to camp at the Dalit Prerna Sthal. The protesting farmers belonging to various districts of western Uttar Pradesh had blocked the Noida-Delhi Link Road that passes through the Chilla border but opened one carriageway on Wednesday evening after talks with the local police. “One carriageway of the Noida-Delhi Link Road is open while the other is closed. People can come from Delhi to Noida using that route but not otherwise,” a Noida Traffic Police official said. The official said commuters travelling to and fro Delhi can use the alternative Kalindi Kunj and the DND routes to avoid any hassle. "These two routes are completely open and the traffic flow is smooth,” the official told PTI around 5 pm. The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called chiefly by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-stir-key-road-connecting-noida-delhi-partially-open-925804.html

Fayaz Lolu, Mudasir Qadri and Junaid Rafiq also claimed that their equipment was seized by the policemen who took them to a police post after physically assaulting them. While the Kashmir Press Club (KPC) termed the incident at Srigufwara in Anantnag district as "unfortunate" and called for a thorough inquiry, the Kashmir Editors' Guild (KEG) expressed concern. Police officials refused to comment on the incident. "We hope strict action is taken against those found guilty in this act perpetrated in utter disregard of the freedom of the press. The KPC further urges the Chief Electoral Officer to take note of such incidents and initiate action against the concerned police official," the KPC said in a statement. "KEG is concerned over the recurrence of these incidents in which reporters are being subjected to violence while discharging their professional duties. Apparently, there is no reason for today's incident to happen," it said. "Why should a reporter be beaten when the officer has the right to not respond to a question? KEG hopes the LG Manoj Joshi administration will look into the incident and ensure that this practice of abuse of authority is put to an end," it said. Meanwhile, Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti took to Twitter to condemn the incident. "Three journalists thrashed by security forces in South Kashmir today after interviewing a PAGD candidate who wasn't allowed to cast his vote.

In order to attend the classes, the pupils will require to submit a medical certificate stating that their general health is fine and they do not have any coronavirus-like symptoms, the order said. Besides, both government and private schools will also resume for students of classes 9 and 11 from December 21, the state's Directorate School Education ordered on Thursday. For the students of classes 10 and 12 appearing for board examinations, each day the classes of government and private schools will be held for three hours between 10 am and 1 pm, it said. Before coming to schools, all the students will need to go for a medical check-up, which will be free, at their nearest Community Health Centre, Primary Health Centre or where a doctor will examine them and provide medical certificate, it said. The doctor needs to certify that they are free from Covid-19-like symptoms and their health is fine. The students will require this certificate, which should not be older than four days from date of coming to school, to gain entry into the educational institution, according to the order. The written consent of the parents will also be required by the students coming to schools. The schools will also follow all Covid-19 related protocols, the order said. Ami a rise in Covid-19 cases, the Haryana government had last month ordered the closure of all schools, which had earlier reopened for students of Classes 9th to 12th.

10-12-2020||Opinion||Pandya 2.0 has arrived and there's a Dhoni feel about him||In the unlikely event of anyone having forgotten, Hardik Pandya offered a telling reminder of what he brings to the Indian set-up at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday. Not last Sunday (Dec. 6), when he blazed an unbeaten 42 off 22 deliveries to muscle his team to another Twenty20 International series win, but the previous Sunday (Nov. 29), in the second One-Day International. With Australia in serious attack mode, a hapless Virat Kohli turned to his one-time all-rounder in desperation, hoping to eke out one or two tight overs in a bid to staunch the bleeding. The move came out of nowhere. Pandya hadn’t bowled in competitive cricket since July 2019, when India bowed out in the semifinal stage of the World Cup. He then underwent surgery on his lower back in London last October. Since his return to action in the Indian Premier League in September, Pandya had donned the role of a specialist batsman alone for the Mumbai Indians. His unfettered ball-striking was one of the driving forces behind Rohit Sharma’s team lifting a fifth title. And when he was picked for the white-ball leg of the ongoing Australia tour, it was as a batsman alone even though he had been working on a remodelled bowling action during the IPL alongside Zaheer Khan. Readily responding to Kohli’s plea, Pandya turned in four tidy overs at the SCG. There didn’t seem to be a discernible change in action, but in those 24 deliveries, he showed how much the team had missed this dimension to his game in his prolonged absence. Unwittingly, with his crafty mix of cutters and slower deliveries, he also offered Australia’s bowlers the blueprint for success on that surface. It’s not so much that Pandya took one for 24 – in a game where the going rate hovered around 7.25 – but the sudden illusion of balance that was noteworthy. Illusion, because those were the only overs the 27-year-old delivered Down Under. India’s white-ball fortunes don’t depend only on Pandya in an all-rounder role. There is too much quality around the man from Gujarat for India to be a one-man outfit but when Pandya bowls, there is a flexibility otherwise unavailable to Kohli because of the distinct lack of seam-bowling all-rounder resources in a country with nearly 1,000 active first-class cricketers. At the World Cup, Pandya completed his 10-over quota in six of India’s nine matches. Even if he isn’t a full-complement bowler going forward, he is a more than adequate backup/insurance for one of the five first-choice bowlers having an off-day. One of the reasons why India’s approach to 50-over cricket, in particular, has been old-fashioned of late is because no one in the top order can provide even one half-decent over at the crunch. If the said off-day comes in a contest of great import, as happened during the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan, no amount of batting riches can salvage the situation 99 times out of a 100. His one-off appearance at the bowling crease clearly wasn’t Pandya’s crowning moment in Australia. He was spectacular with the bat, displaying a hitherto unseen facet during the one-dayers when he assiduously built innings before switching gears seamlessly. There was enough indication that, in time to come, he will slip into the role of the consummate finisher occupied for so long and with so much distinction by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Any scepticism before this tour surrounding Pandya’s efficacy as a specialist batsman has been comprehensively exploded over the last fortnight. Which brings us to the question - is Pandya 2.0 a double-edged sword? In having made tremendous gains as a batsman, is there a possibility that Pandya the all-rounder might go out of fashion? Yes, and yes. For Pandya to return to bowling even in a semi-regular capacity, it will require sustained hard yards, an uncompromising work ethic and an unflagging zeal that can be daunting to most. Even if he is willing and able to invest in a remodelled action designed to reduce the stress on his lower back and side, there is no guarantee that he will remain injury-free for the rest of his career. His future as a cricketer lies ahead of him. If medical advice indicates even a 10% chance of a career-derailing injury if Pandya keeps bowling, common sense would dictate that he forsake that arrow in his quiver. Without being judgemental, it is more than probable that Pandya’s desperation to bowl could be in inverse proportion to his successes with the bat. That’s not to say that he will be looking for the easy way out. The world of pragmatic realism calls for compromises, if not downright sacrifices. India will be delighted to have the services of Hardik Pandya the all-rounder. If not, they’d rather have Pandya the batsman than no Pandya at all.

10-12-2020||Panorama||Tackling inflation and recession, a formidable challenge||In the last week of November, the government confirmed that India was officially in a recession, possibly for the first time in modern history. The technical definition of a recession is when the economy contracts for two successive quarters, that is, three month periods. Between April and June, India’s economy went down by 24% and between July and September, it shrunk by 7.5%.  These compression rates are as compared to the level of GDP one year ago. The first quarter contraction was explained mostly by the severe lockdown ordered by the Central government, to tackle the spread of the pandemic. The second quarter continued to be in the negative territory, although this contraction was less than what was feared. At this rate, the overall economy will shrink by around 8 to 10% overall for this fiscal year. This would translate into a loss of national income of about Rs 16 to 20 lakh crore, or between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 per person. This loss of income is because many services-business like hospitality, tourism, travel and retail shops have had to completely shut down.  Lack of demand has also meant the scaling back of production and employment in many other sectors. The most acute pain has been in the informal and unorganised sector, consisting of small businesses. These could be single person enterprises or a shop with four-five employees. The hit to this sector is most severe and will be fully known after a lag, because their data is not automatically captured in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, as it is for the larger and formal sector companies. Former Chief Statistician of India Pronab Sen has said that the small and medium enterprises (MSME) which contribute 45% of the country’s industrial output, could be affected very badly, resulting in Q3 and Q4 losses of GDP too, and this will be evident only later.  As such, the MSME guaranteed loan package offered by the government has not been fully subscribed, as small businesses are reluctant to take on more loans. They fear bankruptcy. The mudra loans already given out to small businesses are in danger of turning delinquent and adding to the non-performing loans of the banks.  Beyond the loss of national income is the loss of jobs. Since 90% of the workforce is in the unorganised sector, the workers in this sector work without a formal contract, without health insurance and pension and without other benefits. It is difficult to keep track of the status of this part of the labour force. One source is the weekly employment survey by CMIE, a private organisation. During April when the lockdown hit was most severe, nearly 122 million people became jobless.  That number has come down sharply, and since July the number of unemployed maybe in the range of 28 million. More tellingly, many workers may have dropped out of the labour force altogether, and more so the women. This will lower the denominator and misleadingly tell us that the unemployment rate is dropping. But what we need to watch for is the labour force participation rate, both for men and women. This is what provides incomes to families. As for the organised sector employees, the data from EPFO shows a decline in formal sector employment.  The CMIE also reported that by July nearly 20 million formal sector, salaried individuals had lost their jobs this year so far. In the preceding quarter, some of them may have found new employment, as recruiting picks up. Recession year As a result of the recession year, India’s potential growth rate has dropped to 4.5% as per the Oxford Economics Research Organisation. This is the medium-term attainable growth rate. Which means that for the foreseeable future, any growth in excess of this potential rate can cause inflationary pressures. But even now as the economy tries to recover from the depths of recession, there are worrying signs of inflation picking up. It is currently close to 7% and the outlook is that it will remain high.  Just a week after the GDP data release for the last quarter, came the announcement by the RBI on its latest monetary stance. The current policy rate, that is, interest rates at which liquidity is supplied to commercial banks is the lowest it has been. This policy rate is at 4% but even the RBI is worried about inflationary pressure building up.  The official statement of the RBI is a study in contrast. On the one hand it says it will pursue its accommodative policy as long as necessary to revive economic growth. So, money supply will be high and credit will remain cheap. But on the other hand, it is cautious about inflation, and it says GDP momentum is building up. Inflation calls for tightening money supply, and recession calls for loosening money supply. The RBI seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place.  Classical economics did not anticipate a co-existence of inflation and recession. When demand is down, naturally prices would go down, as producers offer discounts, faced with excess capacity. But when there are supply shocks, such as those caused by the pandemic and the lockdown, which reduces the potential growth rate, then we face the spectre of simultaneous recession and inflation.  Navigating out of this will need a fiscal stimulus to shore up consumer spending, an investment revival to increase the productive capacity of the economy, and a careful management of inflationary expectations. Concomitantly, the government will also need to pursue redistribution of income to reduce the widening disparity. This also calls for fiscal prudence to cut wasteful spending, find new revenue through asset sales, mining and spectrum auctions, and build investor confidence. All this will call for the most astute economic and expectations management. It’s going to be a busy budget season.

10-12-2020||Panorama||A pandemic of noises!||I work in an IT company in Bengaluru.  In the pre-pandemic world, we used to be seated in office cubicles. These cubicles offered some degree of privacy but did little for the constant auditory assault on the ears. Then, some management guru came up with the concept of new-age office spaces with their ‘agile work desks’ and ‘open seating’. No more cubicles. Just open desks. Everyone sees and hears everyone. Physically tear down barriers between workers and get them to interact more, collaborate more and improve efficiency. It did not work for me though! The unending telephone calls, loud conversations and endless chit chat of co-workers make it difficult for me to focus on work. I would constantly seek refuge in meeting rooms which offered some quiet and solitude. As a relatively senior associate in the company, I could manage to monopolize one of the meeting rooms on most days and shoo away any juniors lurking around. Then came the pandemic.  Almost overnight, we adapted fairly well to working from home. We were still efficient and got things done. I was quite happy with the prospect of avoiding the notorious traffic each day. I could work in my pyjamas. I would not have to endure the constant office noises any more. Things were not so gloomy after all! But I wasn’t prepared for what was to come next. ‘Home’ to me, had always been a calm and peaceful place one came back to after a day of frenetic action at the office and the crazy traffic on the roads. But now I was suddenly discovering my noisy neighbourhood that I had never quite registered before! Through the day, hawkers selling vegetables, fruits and everything else, create a constant racket outside! Hearing them bellow into their loud hailers and megaphones, I often wonder how they intend selling anything at all - after rendering everyone in the neighbourhood deaf! Then, there are the pet dogs in the vicinity who bark incessantly through the day and night. The ceaseless sounds of traffic, ambulance sirens and gratuitous honking of vehicles from the roads nearby. It goes on and on. As if that is not enough, I have next-door neighbours, where each family member takes pride in specializing in one form or the other of super-high decibel activity. There are the stone-deaf grandparents who don’t believe in useless devices such as hearing aids when the TV can be left blaring at full volume through the day and night.  Then, there is the 10-year-old grandson who starts screaming his head off from exactly 6 AM onwards each day. He has learnt how to collect stray cats. To keep things simple, each of the 30 odd cats that he has generously unleashed on the universe, is named “Puffy”! So, from the crack of dawn onwards, the kid begins a roll call of all the “Puffies” by hollering “Puffy” a zillion times till some new cats decide to join in as well! That is, till he gets bored by early afternoon and starts banging his cricket bat on the metal garage door. Later, for fun, through late afternoon till dusk, he yells at the top of his lungs at his nanny, the passers-by outside and the world in general. Finally, when the illusion of a peaceful night is just about building up between 1 and 3 AM, ripe avocado fruits from the tree in the same neighbour’s house decide to pluck themselves and come crashing down thunderously on the tin roof of their driveway. I have lost count of the times I have got up from sleep bolt upright with a minor heart attack! For several weeks, I barricaded myself behind closed doors and windows to shut out all these sounds. But then, it would get really stuffy and claustrophobic. Tried Zen Meditation. That did not work either. Installed wall-to-wall carpeting. This too proved to be a not-so-optimal solution. I was still not able to concentrate on work. Then one day, I achieved nirvana! I read somewhere about ‘Active Noise Cancellation’ (ANC) headphones and earbuds! I have now become an expert of sorts on the topic and possess an assortment of these devices. I know my Bose ‘QuietComfort’ Earbuds from my Apple ‘AirPods Pro’! I have become an authority on ANC products from Sennheiser, Jabra, Sony and JBL. Nowadays, my windows stay open, my ANC earbuds are firmly in place and I am working and sleeping peacefully!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/a-pandemic-of-noises-925560.html
10-12-2020||Panorama||Simple living and high thinking||He who believes in simple living creates problems neither for himself nor for others. One who engages in high thinking becomes a truly selfless person. Spirituality, the sublime character of men and women, has two facets: the internal and the external. The internal facet is positive thinking, the external facet is living in peace. Thus spirituality is in no way a kind of exalted state of feeling, indeed it is a non-material culture, which means giving more importance to values that are immaterial rather than material. In essence, it promotes the philosophy of simple living and high thinking – the moral mainstay of humanity. This is an essential ingredient in our endeavour to be spiritual. The simple principle to adopt is ‘simple living and high thinking’. One of the teachings of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is “simplicity is part of faith”. Man is considered as supreme creature and Crown of creation by virtue of being endowed with the power of thinking. This blessing of God can be used either for the most mundane things or for the higher things of life. It does not befit us to use this blessing from God for the sole achievement of our worldly or material needs. This is possible only when makes a conscious endeavour to keep life simple. Simple living is not a mere moral or ethical formula rather it is a key principle for a successful life. It is a safe device from all kinds of distractions, and saving oneself from distractions ensures that time, money, and energy are used in a better way to attain success in this world and the next after death. Simple live high thinking is an integral part of Islam. It reduces all your anxieties and negative thoughts. Simple living means according to your limited needs and not according to your unlimited greed. All stress and tension is a result of not following this formula. Spiritual life is nothing but simple living high thinking. Bhagwad Geeta says simple living and high thinking is the solution to economic problems. In Bhagavat Gita, Shri Krishna describes the ideal social system for simple living. Jesus Christ lived a very simple life. He never spoke of things he owned (who never boasted) Money, fashionable clothing, furnishings, etc. He lived a life of stark simplicity in regard to possessions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/simple-living-and-high-thinking-925561.html
10-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Mask charades||Recently parks have opened up once again in all cities. People who have been confined to their homes have re-started their routine walks, and are enjoying the lush green foliage and the fresh breeze. The only difference is that most of them are wearing masks and cannot see who they are crossing on their walking path. This has led to a new game of ‘mask charades’ -- a  method of communication between masked morning walkers. If the person crossing looks like the old uncle you have not seen for a long time, you bow a bit and do a half-hearted dive for the feet, without interrupting the stride of the walk. This translates to mean “due respect Dadaji !” On the other hand, if it’s a young friend who you were used to meeting every evening for coffee, the signal is a quick thumbs up. Done with sufficient energy, it communicates the hopeful “Aal izz well”  to your friend.  Older aunties shuffling along in over-tight salwar suits, shrug their shoulders and raise their eyes heavenwards while sighing dramatically to tell their friends “God knows when this blessed virus will let us have a kitty party again!” Lovers meeting on a park bench, maintain a safe distance and flutter their eyelashes at each other surreptitiously, hoping that vigilant aunty will not catch the undercurrents of romance being rekindled. Some friends meeting after ages, flap their elbows outwards to indicate weight gain. Yet others touch their index fingers to thumb to communicate the universal “looking good” sign. A brief wave of the hand or a crinkling of the eyes is sometimes the code to indicate recognition and a hello. One friendly neighbour who used to flash a toothy smile every round of the walk as he crossed me in the park, now touches his palm to his heart in a gesture of social solidarity. The smiles, the grimaces, the sulks, the words are all hidden – and we have evolved into a new means of communication.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/mask-charades-925558.html
10-12-2020||Second Edit||This teacher, a shining example||In these fraught and vitiated times, persons like Ranjitsinh Disale, a primary school teacher in a village school in Maharashtra, are not many, but their presence is a source of hope and inspiration. He is a role model for teachers and will be considered as an ambassador to the wide world from India’s field of education. Dosale was selected from thousands of candidates the world over for the Global Teacher Prize 2020 by a private foundation partnered by UNESCO. As a young teacher – Disale is 32 - he made a mark in his profession with devotion and dedication within a few years. With hard work and creative ideas, he promoted education among girls and underprivileged children who most needed it, in a place where many would not care to go to teach. He started his work in 2009 and has since then overcome many hurdles and turned his vocation into a mission.    As a young teacher, he realised that improving the schooling experience of children involved improving the school building and creating the necessary facilities, ensuring attendance of children, communicating better with them, monitoring their progress and attaining the best results. None of these was easy in a remote village with little institutional help coming and with many limitations to contend with. But he faced the challenges with determination and imagination. He got the dilapidated building redone, translated textbooks into the mother tongue of the children and embedded the books with unique QR codes to give the students access to audio poems, video lectures, stories and assignments. The school achieved 100% attendance of girls and the village does not have any teenage marriages now. He has also started a project ‘’Let’s Cross the Borders’’ to bring together young people from conflict-ridden areas of the world and to spread the message of peace. He also has a project that takes underprivileged children on virtual field trips.  It is not the teaching achievements that makes Disale special. He has announced that he would share half of his prize money with nine other finalists to support the ‘’incredible work’’ they have done as ‘’change-makers’’. He has also set apart funds from his prize money for the projects he has initiated. He believes that teachers should change lives with a mixture of chalk and challenges and should always believe in giving and sharing. He practised the idea in his life and that is what makes him exceptional. Education is a resource that increases with sharing. A good teacher is a good human being too and one who not only imparts knowledge to students but gives lessons to them and society with his conduct. They brighten up our environment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/this-teacher-a-shining-example-925570.html
10-12-2020||South||Second phase of local body polls gets underway in Kerala||The second phase of the local body polls which is crucial for the traditional fronts in Kerala -- the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front, Congress-headed United Democratic Front and BJP-NDA -- ahead of the crucial Assembly elections next year, got underway in five districts on Thursday. A total of 98,57,208 voters including 51,28,361 women and 93 transgenders, would exercise their franchise to elect representatives for 8,116 wards of 451 local bodies in Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad districts. There are 57,895 first-time voters and 265 non-resident Indians (NRIs) in these districts, according to the state Election Commission. Two Corporations-Kochi and Thrissur, 36 municipalities, 350 village panchayats, 58 block panchayats and five district panchayats are among the local bodies where the second phase polling is being held. Of the total 12,643 polling booths, 473 have been identified as sensitive and webcasting facility was arranged there, SEC said. The Election Commission deployed 63,187 officials at polling stations while 19,736 police personnel were on duty for the smooth conduct of the polls. According to an official update, 23.33 per cent polling was recorded in the five districts at 10 am. As the entire election procedure was in compliance with Covid-19 protocols, masks, sanitising and social distancing norms were made mandatory at all polling stations. Long queues of women voters could be seen in many wards of Ernakulam and Thrissur since the beginning of polling. Polling was generally peaceful in all the five districts so far and the voting procedure was smooth except for technical snag in voting machines reported in some districts. Voters, who have tested positive for the viral infection or those placed under quarantine after 3 pm on Wednesday, would be allowed to cast votes in their respective booths in the evening after all the voters have exercised their franchise, official sources said. Minister A C Moideen courted controversy when he cast his vote at a booth in Panagattukara in Thrissur district on Thursday. The opposition Congress party alleged that he exercised the franchise at 6.55 am, five minutes ahead of the official beginning of polling. However, the minister rejected the charges and said he did not violate any procedures. After the first phase of the polls, held in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Idukki on December 8, all the three traditional fronts including LDF, UDF and BJP-NDA have expressed confidence about their victory. The third phase in four districts-- Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod would be on December 14. The counting would be held on December 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/second-phase-of-local-body-polls-gets-underway-in-kerala-925654.html

The outcome will be announced soon with the concurrence of the Ayush Ministry, researchers involved in the project said. Nine other clinical trials involving Siddha medicine either as stand-alone or adjunct with allopathic medicine that was taken up throughout Tamil Nadu are in various stages of completion. Apart from studying the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and reducing the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic Covid-19 with Siddha formulation Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) compared to Vitamin C & Zinc (CZ) used as a supplement in allopathy, the randomized trial examined the changes in the immunological markers of the Siddha medicine against control. Also, the trial evaluated the safety of Siddha medicine and documented the clinical profile of asymptomatic Covid-19 as per principles of the Siddha system of medicine. "The randomized clinical trial at Stanley GH by Siddha and allopathy doctors has been completed and a detailed manuscript is ready. The outcome will be announced after approval and concurrence of the Ayush ministry," Dr K Kanakavalli, Director General, Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS), said. A total of 233 Covid-19 clinical trials, involving various systems of medicine, were registered from India with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) from March 1, 2020, to June 22, 2020, when the infection cases peaked. Out of these, 146 were interventional trials, 84 observational trials, and three post-marketing surveillance. Randomized control trials are higher in number than non-randomized. Nearly 20 per cent of the trials involved patients, and research institutions sponsored more than half of the trials, Dr P Sathiyarajeswaran, director in charge, Siddha Central Research Institute, said. In most of these trials, the interventional agent is either multiple drug combinations or compound drug formulations compared to single drug administration. "These are not normal clinical trials. These were taken up during the pandemic times involving the participation of patients. So, the outcome of the trials should be peer-reviewed before publication," Dr Sathiyarajeswaran told PTI in an interaction||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covid-19-randomised-clinical-trial-on-efficacy-of-siddha-medicine-completed-925673.html

What exactly happened? The first patients were admitted to hospital on Saturday in Eluru, a town in Andhra Pradesh state. By Sunday, according to the federal health ministry, there were more than 200 people hospitalised, suffering dizziness, headache and vomiting. Patients including children and women fainted, and that evening a 45-year-old man died. By Wednesday, the number of patients had jumped nearly three-fold. As of Thursday, over 85% of the patients had been discharged. The cause of their illness has yet to be identified. Tests ruled out Covid-19 infection. What are the potential causes? Eluru is home to over 200,000 people, and is known for its weaving industry. Investigations have focused on whether the illness could be linked to some groundwater contamination, excessive use of pesticides or mass application of chlorine as part of a coronavirus disinfection drive. Doctors have also found traces of lead and nickel in the blood samples of some patients. The elevated lead levels could have been a trigger, especially as the levels appeared to drop among patients a day after hospitalisation, doctors say. The state government says officials are also checking if dumping or burning of used batteries could have caused the illness, without elaborating further. They are also testing the area's drinking water and milk samples. A senior health official has also said exposure to organochlorides found in pesticides and used in mosquito control could be a potential cause. What are the effects of exposure to lead or chlorine? High levels of lead in the bloodstream can impair development of brains, nervous systems and vital organs such as heart and lungs. Organochlorides are banned or restricted in many countries after research linked them to cancer and other health risks. It was not immediately clear how extensively the chemicals are used in India, though they are found in DDT used in mosquito control. World Health Organization experts are surveying neighbourhoods in and around Eluru, collecting various information, including on food sources. Health authorities are running various tests and the state's chief minister has promised corrective measures once investigations are completed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mystery-illness-that-hospitalised-hundreds-in-india-925714.html

The woman, who lives with her father here, in a letter addressed to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday, requested intervention in the matter and help get justice. The woman stated that she married the Somalia national on January 25, 2015 while he was studying in Hyderabad. According to the woman, since then he used to visit Hyderabad every six months and he last visited her in February this year. Later, he proceeded to Boston in the US and was in touch with her and used to send money for her needs, she said. "Suddenly on October 7, my husband called on my father's phone number and pronounced talaq three times without any reason and since then he is not in touch with me," the woman said in the letter. "My mother-in-law, who lives in Dubai and my sister- in-law, who stays in London assured me of justice but later they blocked my number. Hence, I request you to interfere in this matter and help me get justice," the woman wrote. She further requested the External Affairs Ministry to ask the Indian Embassy in the US to speak to her husband and settle the matter as soon as possible as there is no one to look after her and she cannot re-marry without any authentic divorce papers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-woman-alleges-husband-gave-triple-talaq-from-us-over-phone-925725.html

The government has also prepared a list of five lakh health care workers who are likely to be the first to get vaccinated once the Centre begins distributing the vaccine to states. The vaccination will be carried out in a phased manner with healthcare workers, and frontline staff on the priority list. “What we have devised now is an anticipatory vaccination plan and a lot of fine-tuning will be done once the Centre starts distributing the vaccine doses to states. We are keeping the warehouses and facilities ready for the vaccination drive,” J Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary (Health), told Deccan Herald, adding that the plan is being done based on Centre’s guidelines from time to time. He said the government has identified 5 lakh healthcare workers, while the number of frontline workers who would be next on the priority list will be five to ten times higher than the above number. “Our next priority after the first two categories will be elderly and people above 50 who have comorbidities. This is how we plan to carry out the vaccination drive. Things also depend on the number of doses we get though we can store 2.5 crore vaccination does in our 51 warehouses that have been identified,” he added. Sources said the state has identified over 40,000 centres where vaccination will be given to the people identified by the district administration and other agencies. “The plan for the vaccination programme is being prepared in consultation with district authorities who will play a major role in implementing it. There will be systematic planning for the distribution of the vaccine like we did for pulse polio. We have enough expertise," the official said. The number of Covid-19 positive cases in Tamil Nadu has been witnessing a downward trend in the past one month. At last count on Thursday morning, Tamil Nadu had just 10,491 active cases.

10-12-2020||South||Verdict in Kerala nun death case to come after 28 years||Twenty-eight years after the mysterious death of a young nun in a convent at Kottayam district in Kerala, a CBI special court is expected to pronounce judgment in the case on December 22. Nineteen-year-old Sister Abhaya was found dead in the well of the Pius X convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992. First accused Father Thomas M Kottoor and third accused Sister Sephy are now facing trial at the CBI court in Thiruvananthapuram. Sister Abhaya was allegedly murdered after she witnessed the illicit affair of the accused. The second accused, Father Jose Poothrikkayil, was discharged earlier and the CBI would be filing an appeal against it. CBI special judge K Sanal Kumar on Thursday posted the case for pronouncing the judgment on December 22. So far, many investigation teams of the Kerala Police and the CBI have probed the case and have concluded that it was a case of suicide. The latest probe was initiated about 15 years ago following allegations of tampering with forensic test results of the case. The Catholic priests and nun were even subjected to narco-analysis tests to unearth the facts and were arrested in November 2008. The CBI had filed a chargesheet on July 17, 2009, mainly on the basis of scientific evidence like the narco-analysis tests. The CBI's finding was that Abhaya happened to witness the accused in a compromising position during the wee hours of the day she was found dead. Subsequently, an axe was used to murder her and the body was dumped in the well of the convent. A total of 49 witnesses were examined but during the course of the trial, many of them turned hostile. One of the witnesses even openly admitted the torture she faced for giving a statement against the accused. The accused also approached higher courts seeking discharge. But only the second accused, Poothrikkayil, was discharged in 2018 on the grounds that the CBI failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove his presence at the convent on the day of Abhaya’s death. The charges against the accused include IPC 302 for murder and IPC 201 for destroying evidence. Human rights activist Jomon Puthenpurackal has been pursuing the case relentlessly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/verdict-in-kerala-nun-death-case-to-come-after-28-years-925807.html
10-12-2020||South||Casting a vote is also taking part in elections: M K Alagiri||Expelled DMK leader M K Alagiri on Thursday continued to remain ambivalent on launching his political party ahead of the crucial 2021 assembly elections. A week after declaring that he will “certainly play” a role in the Tamil Nadu assembly elections due in 2021, he has now said that casting a vote also means participating in the polls. Speaking to reporters in Madurai on Thursday, the former Union Minister said he was “consulting his supporters” on when to hold consultations with them on his political stand. “I said my participation is certain. What kind of participation? How did you understand? Launching a party is one way, stitching an alliance is one way, and exercising my franchise is also participating in the elections,” he said when asked about his comments last week that he will play a role in the next elections. Alagiri, who congratulated Tamil super Rajinikanth last week for his announcement on launching a political party, said in a lighter vein that he will appear alongside the actor in a movie if given a chance. He was asked whether there was a possibility of an alliance with Rajinikanth. “We are consulting on the consultation process,” he said when asked when he will meet his supporters. Alagiri’s comments come weeks after reports emerged that he was planning to launch his own political party and align with the BJP to face the 2021 elections. It was also speculated that the former DMK strongman would meet Union Home Minister and BJP’s election strategist Amit Shah when he visited Chennai last month. However, Alagiri had dismissed the speculation as “baseless”. Alagiri, who was expelled from the DMK in 2014 by none other than his father and party patriarch M Karunanidhi, is attempting a political comeback as elections near. The 69-year-old politician, who once wielded tremendous influence in the DMK in southern districts, has been in political hibernation since 2014. His attempts to patch-up with his younger brother and DMK President M K Stalin, especially after Karunanidhi’s death in 2018, failed to yield any results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/casting-a-vote-is-also-taking-part-in-elections-m-k-alagiri-925814.html

This is for the third time that Raveendran is seeking time to appear before the ED. Initially, he cited Covid-19 infection and later post-Covid ailments. Opposition Congress and the BJP alleged that the probe into Raveendran, which is part of a probe against the gold smuggling accused, would expose links of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan with the gold smuggling accused and hence deliberate attempts were being made to delay ED quizzing. No evidence Meanwhile, an inquiry by the Kerala prions department is learnt to have found no evidence for gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh's allegations that she was threatened inside the prison against giving statements implicating persons of higher authorities. Deputy inspector general of prisons conducted the enquiry by verifying the CCTV footages of the women's prison in Thiruvananthapuram and recording Swapna's statement. Only investigation official, lawyers and close family members were found to have met her in the prison, said sources. Swapna stated before a court for economic offences in Kochi on Tuesday that a couple of persons who claimed to be police and prison staff approached her and threatened her against disclosing names of persons in high authority suspected to be involved in the criminal activities. They threatened that they were capable of doing away with her life in the prison and would also harm her family members, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gold-smuggling-kerala-cms-staff-seeks-more-time-from-ed-probe-on-into-threats-received-by-swapna-925817.html

The Rs 1869 crore programme, falling under the YSR Cheyutha plan to handhold women to become entrepreneurs, would be implemented in a three-phased manner to be completed by December next year. Speaking at the virtual launch on Thursday from his camp office in Tadepalli, the Chief Minister said that the scheme aims to raise the financial standards of women in the state with less investment and labour. Women from the Backward Class, Scheduled Caste, and the Scheduled Tribes, of 45 to 60 years age are eligible under the scheme. Each of the 2.49 lakh units consists of 15 sheep or goats (including one ram or billy). The government would also facilitate those women wanting to buy the sheep and goats on their own. CM said that the Allana Group‌ would buy the meat from the women as per the agreement made with the government. “However, if the price offered elsewhere is remunerative than Allana, women can sell their produce there. There is no compulsion to sell to Allana only.” Allana Group is setting up meat processing units in East Godavari and Kurnool districts. The 2.49 lakh sheep and goat units would be distributed in three phases - 20,000 units in the first phase by March 2021, 1,30,000 units in the second phase from April to August 2021, and the remaining 99,000 units in the third phase from September - December 2021. Training and certification centres for sheep breeding would come up in Dhone of Kurnool district and Penugonda of Anantapur district. AP government had last week launched a Rs 3500 crore programme to distribute 4.69 lakh units of cows/buffaloes to women, also intended to strengthen the dairy sector in the state. Reddy partnered with Amul on this project. Reddy opined that the promotion of agricultural and allied sectors would improve the rural economy and would eventually benefit the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-government-to-distribute-37-lakh-goats-sheep-to-women-offering-them-income-avenues-925825.html

After the postmortem, the mortal remains of Chitra, a popular face on Tamil television, was handed over to her family members on Thursday afternoon. Her body, which was taken to her residence in Kotturpuram for conduct of rituals, was consigned to flames on Thursday evening at the Besant Nagar electric crematorium. “The autopsy has established that Chitra died by suicide. Doctors who performed the autopsy have conveyed it to us. The body has been handed over to the family,” a police officer said. The autopsy findings came as reports said Chitra's mother has demanded to probe the role of Hemanth, who was engaged to Chitra, in her daughter’s death. Chitra, 29, was a popular face on television, acting in serials and hosting shows. She shot into limelight after her role in Saravanan Meenatchi, a popular television serial and went on to become popular. She was acting in Pandian Stores, another popular television soap broadcast on an entertainment channel. Chitra and Hemanth had checked-in to a hotel in Nazarathpet near Poonamallee on the outskirts of Chennai in the early hours of Wednesday after completing her shooting for the day. Chitra chose to stay at the hotel since the shooting spot was close. After checking-in, Chitra asked Hemanth to wait outside the room as she was going to take a bath. Hemanth alerted the hotelstaff after Chitra did not come out for a very long time. “Police rushed after receiving a call at around 3 am. When they opened the door using a duplicate key, the actor was found dead,” a police officer had said on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/serial-actress-v-j-chitra-died-by-suicide-police-say-quoting-autopsy-report-925835.html

The portal has been blocked following a criminal complaint lodged with police here by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), a temple official said. The action comes after social media outcry on the fake website, that claimed to do door delivery of the hill temple's 'laddus' (ball-shaped sweet) to devotees across the country at 'exorbitant' prices. The complaint alleged abuse of the fame of ancient temple and its much sought after 'laddu' for wrongful gains by the operators of the website. No arrest has so far been made in this connection, the official said. The laddu prepared at the massive kitchen close to the shrine at nearby Tirumala is in great demand among devotees, who throng the shrine from different parts of the world throughout the year. Annually about 10 crore pieces of laddu are made and sold for Rs 50 each. Taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic, some unscrupulous elements have resorted to cheating the devotees, he added. Meanwhile, the lone content that appeared on the deactivated website said, "We made a genuine effort. We also mentioned on the website that the laddus will be purchased from the TTD outlet. Considering the circumstances, we have discontinued the website which was launched on 7th December 2020." "We are grateful to the people who supported us and we apologize for any inconvenience," the site added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/case-against-website-for-illegally-selling-tirupati-laddus-925836.html
10-12-2020||South||Kerala: Second phase local body polls held, Mammootty misses voting||The second phase of the local body elections in Kerala held on Thursday is crucial for the Kerala Congress (M) group led by the Rajya Sabha MP Jose K Mani to show its strength. Polling to 451 local bodies in Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad were held in the second-phase that witnessed over 75 per cent voters turning up. The Jose K Mani faction recently joined the CPM-led Left Democratic Front ending years-long ties with the Congress-led United Democratic Front. The faction has to show its strength in its home town Kottayam in the local body elections. Then only they could stake claims for seats in the upcoming Assembly polls. There were reports that many in the grassroot levels of the party were unhappy over the decision to join the left-front. For the BJP the second-phase polls are significant as Palakkad municipality is the lone municipality in Kerala where the saffron party is in power now. The BJP is also pinning hopes in Thrissur corporation. Wayanad had presented a thumping victory to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Hence any set back in the district in the local body polls would be embarrassing to the Congress. In 2015 local body elections, Congress-led United Democratic Front got a majority in one of the three municipalities in the district and also won eleven seats in the district panchayat against five by the left-front. The third and final phase of the local body polls will be held on December 14 and counting will be on December 16. Mammootty too misses voting The local body elections are witnessing curious moments with many prominent persons missing from voters' list. Leading actor Mammootty, who used to cast vote in most of the general elections in Kochi, could not exercise his franchise on Thursday as his name was missing in the voters' list. He recently shifted residence and that could be the reason why his name was left out from the voters' list, said election authorities. During the first phase polls many IAS officers, including chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena, could not cast vote as their names were left out in the revised voters lift. There were widespread complaints of persons being left out from voters list. Complaint against minister The Congress will file a complaint against Kerala Local Self-Government Minister A C Moideen for allegedly casting his vote ahead of the polling time. Congress MLA from Thrissur Anil Akkara alleged that the minister was allowed to cast his vote at 6.55 am at a polling booth in the district even as the polling time began only by 7 am. A complaint will be filed against the minister in this regard, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-second-phase-local-body-polls-held-mammootty-misses-voting-925854.html

The secretary to Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR) has been directed to file an affidavit in this regard. A division bench, headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, was hearing a batch of PILs filed in connection with the IMA scam. During the hearing, the court was surprised at the submission by the competent authority, appointed under the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPID) Act, 2004. The competent authority has stated that officials with doubtful integrity have been appointed to the authority. The report of the competent authority referred to one of the competent authorities appointed in the past who subsequently was arrested in the very case. Now, an officer has been appointed to the competent authority who is facing inquiries by Lokayukta and Anti-Corruption Bureau. “To say the least, this is a shocking state of affairs. Going by the record, a very large number of investors have suffered due to the IMA scam. The concerned department of the state has shown audacity of appointing officers with doubtful integrity,” the bench said observing that a huge task has been undertaken by the competent authority of processing the claims which will be in lakhs. Considering the huge task before the competent authority, the court asked the state government to give an assurance that sufficient staff will be provided and also that officers will be posted after a thorough background check. Meanwhile, the status report submitted to the court stated that, so far, about 40,000 claims have been received from IMA depositors. However, no claim has been received from secure depositors. The competent authority informed the court that burst SMSs / IVRS voice messages have been sent to registered mobile numbers of 71,418 depositors and individual letters have also been sent to 76,597 depositors. The CBI, presently investigating the case, has informed the court that the investigation is likely to conclude by April 30, 2021. The court directed that the head of investigation should be continued till the investigation is completed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ima-scam-why-officers-with-doubtful-integrity-appointed-karnataka-hc-asks-state-925550.html

The Board has 15.69 lakh registered workers and the government relied on the Board during the Covid-19 lockdown to help the workers. But the audit has revealed glaring ineffectiveness in the Board’s functioning.  “The much bigger area of concern is that if the Board has to pay the entire liability amount (without getting any exemption) towards income tax, it has to be borne from the receipts of the Board, which are meant for implementation of the welfare schemes of the construction workers,” the audit said.  The Board reported a closing balance of Rs 7,151.26 crore as of March 2019. Its major source of fund is the collection of cess at 1% of the cost of construction incurred by those who employ the labourers.  “The Board had utilised a mere 5% of the funds available at its disposal on welfare schemes during the period 2014-15 to 2018-19,” the report said, attributing this to “shortfall in registration of beneficiaries, absence of database of registered workers, rigidity and inconsistencies in rules, inordinate time taken to process claims, insufficient publicity, etc.”  The CAG pointed out many instances of “inadmissible” and “unfruitful” expenditure of the Board running into crores of rupees. This included acquisition of 128 acres of land costing Rs 65 crore and development of a software (Karmika-I) at Rs 1.21 crore.  A beneficiary survey of 286 out of 1,136 workers at 30 construction sites in six districts found that 60% were migrants and only 27% were registered.  The audit concluded that the Board “suffered from systemic deficiencies.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/rs-2358-cr-i-t-paid-by-building-workers-board-was-avoidable-says-cag-report-925551.html

The controversial Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, was passed in the assembly on Wednesday amid protests by the Opposition. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday had announced that Congress will boycott the assembly session on Thursday in protest, terming it as 'anti-democratic act.' Congress MLAs participated in the legislature party meeting instead of attending the assembly proceedings today. As the Congress members were not present in the assembly when the House met for the day, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri made an appeal to them to participate. "Opposition leader Siddaramaiah and Congress legislators had yesterday announced that they will boycott the assembly proceedings today and none of them are participating today. I appeal to them to participate in the proceedings," Kageri said. Addressing from the Chair, he said the leader of the Opposition has spoken a couple of things about him regarding the passage of the cow slaughter bill, and clarified that he has conducted the house within the framework of set rules and procedures. Siddaramaiah and Congress had on Wednesday accused the Speaker of conducting proceedings in a 'partisan' manner by allowing the introduction and passage of the bill. He said it was against the decision of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and the subject was not even mentioned in the day's agenda. At the BAC meeting it was clearly discussed and decided that ordinance and important bills can be taken up, the Speaker pointed out as he read out his statement made to this effect by him in the House on Tuesday. "... so it is not right to say things were against the BAC decision." He also pointed out that the bill was mentioned in the supplementary agenda on Wednesday, before it was tabled and passed, also the copy of the bill was circulated among members. "So alleging that the bill was introduced and passed without bringing to the notice of the house in advance, was not right." Kageri also rejected the LoP's charge that the bill was passed without discussion, by stating that several members from the ruling side expressed their opinion about the bill, following which he repeatedly asked protesting Congress members to participate in the discussion. "They not participating despite repeated requests is not my responsibility." Conceding that though it was not mentioned in specific at the BAC that the anti cow slaughter bill will be taken up, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy said, however, it was made clear that a couple of important bills will be introduced during the session. He said only after realising that the legislative council will also be adjourned sine die on Thursday, the cow slaughter bill was introduced in the assembly, with an intention to get it passed in both the houses during the same session. "During the last sessions some bills passed by the assembly got held up in the council without getting passed and we (government) had to promulgate an ordinance. It looks as though we are only promulgating ordinances. Governor also had questioned," he said, as he asked the Congress legislators to participate in the proceedings and debate on the BBMP bill. Minister R Ashoka hit out at Congress for making allegations on the chair and the government, pointing to its conduct in the past while in power. He said the cow slaughter bill was on our agenda, we had nothing to hide in it, and Congress cannot dictate terms on how to conduct the House. The Speaker then adjourned the House for some time to make efforts to convince the opposition leader and Congress MLAs to get back to the House. When the House resumed, as the Congress legislators did not participate in the proceedings, citing that the legislature party meeting was on, the Speaker continued with the proceedings||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/congress-boycotts-karnataka-assembly-proceedings-to-protest-passage-of-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-925739.html

Replying to a question raised by Hoskote MLA Sharath Bachegowda, Narayan said the work from home arrangement will continue for “some more months” because of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. “The government cannot mandate companies to open offices. Eventually, they will open up. When the time is right, they will take a call on this. There’s no thought in the government to ask companies to open their offices. Also, the situation isn’t right for us to ask them to,” Narayan, the IT/BT minister said. The IT sector in Karnataka had performed well in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, Narayan said. “Technology came to the rescue. Startups and innovation haven’t stopped,” he pointed out. IT companies in Karnataka, especially Bengaluru, closed their offices as early as March due to Covid-19, asking employees to work remotely. The Centre has extended connectivity norms for work-from-home for IT and BPO firms till December 31, 2020. “Only 7-8% of the workforce is working while the rest are working from home. Because of work-from-home, productivity has gone down,” Bachegowda, who was a corporate executive before entering politics, said. “We should bring pressure on companies to open offices.” Udupi MLA K Raghupati Bhat concurred. “The government has allowed work-from-home till December-end. With IT companies yet to open, cabs and other dependent livelihoods are getting affected,” he said. Narayan maintained that work-from-home was a solution. “Once offices open up, ancillary services will also pick up,” he said. Over 3,000 cos took part in Bengaluru Tech Summit In a written reply, Narayan said some 3,099 companies and firms took part in the Bengaluru Tech Summit held last month. “Eight significant agreements were made with Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) nations in the areas of startups, health, life sciences, biotechnology, defence, space, sports, education and others. Of them, Finland and Sweden have signed the agreement and the process is underway with six other countries,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/wfh-to-continue-for-some-more-months-won-t-ask-it-companies-to-open-offices-karnataka-dy-cm-ashwath-narayan-925771.html
10-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Kasturirangan report on Western Ghats: Follow Kerala model, say worried MLAs||BJP legislators mounted pressure on the government to draw inspiration from Kerala on stalling the K Kasturirangan Committee report on conserving Western Ghats with the National Green Tribunal’s December 31 deadline for its implementation approaching fast. The Kasturirangan Committee has recommended that 20,668 sq km spread across 11 districts in the Western Ghats cradling 1,592 villages, be declared as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA), which will come with restrictions that MLAs believe will hamper developmental works. Even as Karnataka has repeatedly rejected the report, the NGT wants the Centre to finalise the notification (based on the Kasturirangan report) by December 31, 2020. During a discussion in the Legislative Assembly, BJP MLAs feared that the final notification could trigger “bloodshed” and “naxalism” in villages located in the Western Ghats region. The Opposition benches were empty during this debate. Primary & Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar, responding on behalf of the government, said a Cabinet sub-committee will submit its report to the Centre before the end of this month. Virajpet MLA K G Bopaiah pointed out that petitioning the Centre was of little use as the issue was with the NGT. To this, Kumar said that the government was “seriously looking” for a chance to implead in the case to clarify Karnataka's stand. Earlier, Karkala MLA V Sunil Kumar urged the government to resurvey the villages identified in the report as per the Kerala model. "We are not opposed to the report. But, the government should withdraw elements that affect people residing in the region," he said. Thirthahalli MLA Araga Jnanendra said that implementing the report in the current form could trigger bloodshed in villages. "Kerala compiled a report identifying various zones in villages as soon as the report was filed, reducing the eco-sensitive area from 13,108 sq km to around 9,000 sq km," he said, blaming the state government for laxity. “If the state had followed the same model, the 20,668 sq km area could have been reduced to around 13,000 sq km,” he said. Bopaiah also feared that implementing the report would trigger anti-government sentiment. "People will take to naxalism," he said. Mudigere MLA MP Kumaraswamy noted that the many villages have announced boycott of gram panchayat elections over the implementation of the report. Even Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri expressed concern on the fallout of the report’s implementation. Kumar assured the House that the government will not allow any village to be “forcibly extinguished” and “we are committed to protect all the villages.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/kasturirangan-report-on-western-ghats-follow-kerala-model-say-worried-mlas-925775.html

The Bill was passed with Opposition benches empty. The Bill, which was earlier passed in the Legislative Council, will now be sent to the Governor for his assent. During a discussion on the Bill, Somashekhar said as many as 60 companies were given the licence to procure agricultural produce from farmers between 2013 and 2018. "Till now, not a single complaint has come. I’ve visited 27 districts and held talks with APMC leaders. Nowhere was it expressed that this would trouble farmers,” Somashekhar said. The minister said the Centre had repeatedly claimed that the amendments had nothing to do with MSP. “The MSP will continue. Even our government and the CM have announced this. These amendments have been brought to ensure farmers get the right price for their produce,” he said. Piloting the Bill, Somashekhar said the amendments would allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere they want by removing restrictions. “There was a provision to levy a penalty of Rs 2,000-5,000 for selling outside AMPC (mandis) without a licence, which we are amending,” he said. BSP MLA N Mahesh said that the farmers would agree with the Bill provided it came with an assurance that MSP will remain intact. "I will not comment on the politics of the Bill. Farmers are anxious that the legislation will result in monopoly of the agriculture trade market without a guarantee on MSP,” he said. Welcoming the Bill, BJP MLA Araga Jnanendra lamented that farmers were being misled about the amendments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-assembly-clears-contentious-apmc-bill-925800.html

Bobde’s mother Mukta Bobde was allegedly cheated by Tapas Ghosh and his wife. Ghosh (49) has been arrested by the Nagpur police, while his wife’s role is being investigated. Nagpur Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar has tasked the investigations to the Economic Offences Wing. The Special Investigation Team is headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vinita Sahu. Chief Justice Bobde’s mother is the owner of an ancestral property Seadon Lawns, which is hired for weddings and other functions. Ghosh was managing the property for over a decade’s time, and was paid a salary and commission on the rentals which he used to collect on her behalf. According to the complaint, the accused couple did not deposit the entire amount that they collected. They even gave forged receipts to those who booked the property for functions.  The alleged fraud came to light during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown when many customers cancelled their bookings but did not receive their refunds. The case was lodged under IPC sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 467 (forgery).

The trash in the Karave mangrove area, off the T S Chanakya, the maritime training establishment at Nerul in Navi Mumbai, was cleaned up thanks to the initiative of Dharmesh Barai, the founder and honorary head coordinator of Environment Life. Barai, along with two founder-volunteers of Mangroves Clean Up Drive – Rohan Bhosale and Sriram Shankar – started the initiative, and today they have 90 members, who are known as MangroveSoldiers. What is commendable is that the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has joined the Environment Life initiative in Karave mangroves spread over 8,000 sq mt. “We started off on 15 August and in nearly three months removed garbage to the tune of seven tons…what we have done is small but the support that we got from people is tremendous,” Barai told DH on Thursday. Barai, a trekker, nature and wildlife lover, has been cleaning waterfalls and places around it over the last several years. The Karave initiative, which was launched during the Covid-19 lockdown/unlock period, has earned accolades in the Mumbai metropolitan region and it has shown the way for several others. Asked about the cleanup drive, Barai said: “We found footwear, medical waste, mercury bulbs, tube lights, liquor bottles, syringes, wafer packets, packaged water bottles and spoons, among other things, which had made their way through the creek and got stuck in the roots of mangroves trees.” After the work was known in social media, NMMC’s deputy municipal commissioner Dr Babasaheb Rajale, who heads the solid waste management department, personally spoke to him and assured support and joined them.  Thereafter, Assistant Commissioner of Belapur A ward Shashikant Tandel and Rajendra Sonawane, who looks after the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan', joined them. “We all must think to protect marine biodiversity. We don’t have the right to pollute oceans and creeks with our bad habits…it is not a dumping yard,” Barai said, adding that Environment Life has already zeroed in another location for a clean-up drive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/flamingos-return-to-mangrove-area-after-youth-remove-7000-kg-of-trash-925687.html

The activities that would spread across the weekend are being spearheaded by Akhil Maharashtra Giryarhon Mahasangh (AMGM), the apex body of several mountaineering clubs. The AMGM is formally associated with the United Nations. The western state of Maharashtra is blessed with a huge mountain range that runs parallel to the coastline – geographically part of the Sahyadris or the Western Ghats. “Since 2003, the United Nations has been celebrating the day to create awareness about the importance of mountains to life, to highlight the opportunities and constraints in mountain development and to build alliances that will bring positive change to mountain people and environments around the world,” said AMGM president Umesh Zirpe, a veteran mountaineer. Every year, the UN designates the theme to celebrate the day. This year the UN has planned to celebrate mountains with a 'Mountain Biodiversity' theme to acknowledge the rich biodiversity as well as the threat it faces. Zirpe, who motivates and trains people to come closer to the mountain and nature, said: “India and Maharashtra are blessed with vast and unique biodiversity mostly surrounded around the mountains.” Zirpe said that they are asking people to go to the nearest mountain. “Just go out and respect the mountain… Go and perform pooja on the mountain. He said that the local villagers worship the mountains,” he said, adding that on the occasion of 'Diwali' when 'Laxmi Pooja' is held, tribal communities do 'Parvat Pooja'. “Mountains are very important for us. The primary motive of the International Mountain Day celebrations is to inculcate, educate and promote mountaineering culture among the citizens,” he said. He said that 25 district-level mountaineering clubs, nature groups, adventure groups and wild-lifers are part of the pooja. "We are doing it in a big way and slowly want to develop a culture," he added. Zirpe, who has also written several books including  Joy of Mountaineering: A Beginner's Guide for Children, said, "Thousands of people all over the world participate in sports activities on land, in the sea, and in air. Mountaineering has a place of pride, earning the title - 'Mother of all adventure sports'.  A mountaineer learns nature, flora, fauna,  geography,  geology, and what not. It leads to overall physical and mental development and creates leaders." Zirpe said mountaineering as an adventure is wide and covers trekking, rock climbing, ice climbing, artificial wall climbing, and sports climbing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/a-drive-across-maharashtra-to-create-awareness-about-importance-of-mountains-925712.html

The incident took place at Gate Number 18 outside the Bandra Railway Terminus where Mudassar Khan, the victim, ran a shop selling tobacco products. Accused Samir Khan (22) asked him for a cigarette on credit, but Mudassar told him that he would not get anything unless he paid earlier dues. In a fit a rage, Samir picked up a knife from the nearby coconut-water shop and slit Mudassar's throat, a police officer said. He also attacked Mudassar's mother Noorjahan and his 12-year-old brother when they tried to intervene, and then fled from the spot, the official said. Mudassar was taken to nearby Bhabha Hospital where he was declared dead. Samir, who himself had sustained injuries in the incident, went to V N Desai Hospital from where the police nabbed him, said senior inspector of Nirmal Nagar police station Shashikant Bhandare. He was apparently under the influence of drugs, and was booked under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder), the inspector added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pan-shop-owner-killed-for-refusing-to-give-cigarette-on-credit-925816.html
10-12-2020||West||Gujarat: Former 'encounter specialist' seeks discharge from Sadiq Jamal Encounter case||Once known as "encounter specialist", retired Deputy Superintendent of Police Tarun Barot has moved an application in special CBI court seeking discharge from the trial of Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case. Barot is one of the key accused in the case who is alleged to have illegally taken custody of Sadiq from Mumbai police days before he was killed in an encounter in 2003 in Ahmedabad, which the CBI probe found was stage-managed. Barot, who is also an accused in Ishrat Jahan encounter case, has claimed in his plea that he is "innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case." The application claims,"...all the so-called statements and the documents, sought to be deliberately used as incriminating material against the present accused no. 8 (Barot), reveal nothing except the visit of the present accused no. 8 to Mumbai between 02.1.2003 to 04.1.2003. There is not a single direct statement/document in the charge-sheet which suggests that it was present accused no. 8 himself who obtained the alleged custody of Sadik from Mumbai. In view of this, the charge of the complainant CBI is based on just conjectures and surmises." Besides Barot, another policeman Chhtrasinh Chudasama has also moved a similar application on the ground that there is no evidence suggesting his role in any manner.  Recently, the CBI special court discharged two accused policemen-  R L Mavani and Ajaypal Yadav-  from the trial after concluding that there was not enough evidence against them for trial. The special court has issued notice and has sought CBI's response. CBI investigation revealed that on January 2, 2003, Barot, who was then posted with Detection of Crime Branch, took custody of Sadiq, 19, a resident of Bhavnagar, from the Mumbai Police and brought him to Ahmedabad. On January 12, he was taken in a tempo traveller to the Sai Baba Complex near Galaxy cinema in Naroda area where he was allegedly shot dead at around 1.15 am. However, at the time of the incident, the DCB officials had claimed that Sadiq was killed in an encounter who was on a mission to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders for avenging 2002 post-Godhra riots.  According to the CBI, it was Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (SIB), Mumbai which first generated an intelligence input claiming that Sadiq was associated with D-Gang and was allegedly planning to kill BJP leaders. The CBI charge sheet in his case stated that before handing over Sadiq to Barot, he was arrested “in a stage-managed joint operation” conducted by the SIB, Mumbai and Central Intelligence Unit, Andheri, of Mumbai Crime Branch. Sadiq worked as domestic help for Tariq Parveen, a close associate of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, at his home in Mumbai and then in Dubai between 1996 to October 2002. The CBI has said that Sadiq left Dubai following an altercation with Parveen’s associate, a Pakistan-based gangster Salim Chiplun and within months of his arrival back home, Sadiq was killed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-former-encounter-specialist-seeks-discharge-from-sadiq-jamal-encounter-case-925833.html

While Congress has not reacted, the Shiv Sena backed the Maratha strongman while NCP offered a guarded reaction. “In today’s circumstances, the only person who has the knowledge and the capability to lead is Sharad Pawar,” says Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut, a Rajya Sabha member. Raut works closely with Pawar and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and played a key role in forging the MVA that formed the government in 2019 and kept BJP out of power. Pawar, a four-time Maharashtra chief minister and three-time union minister – having handed portfolios of defence and agriculture, is the chief architect of the MVA. NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said that there is no demand or request either from Pawar or the party to make him the UPA chairperson.  “Recently Pawar saheb has said that the Opposition needs to be united and strengthened…who becomes the leader is not an issue,” he said. Pawar’s nephew and state’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said: “Pawar saheb knows how to do development without politics…you may see how he has taken up the issues of farmers.” Close Pawar-aide Hemant Takle said that when the Dr Manmohan Singh-led UPA government was in power, Pawar has shown how to work. “As a minister, he knew all the chief ministers very well including prime minister Narendra Modi, the then Gujarat chief minister.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mva-happy-over-sharad-pawar-s-choice-as-upa-chairperson-925849.html
10-12-2020||West||Gujarat Vidyapith, founded by Mahatma Gandhi, gets a new vice-chancellor||Mahatma Gandhi founded Gujarat Vidyapith on Thursday appointed its former registrar and currently an honorary director (extension) as its next vice-chancellor. The decision was taken in a meeting headed by chancellor Ela Bhatt, the founder of acclaimed Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA). Vidyapith registrar Bharat Joshi told DH, "The name of Rajendra Khimani was chosen by the members of Vidyapith Trust, headed by its chancellor, as the next vice-chancellor. There were two other candidates: Educationist and author Bhadrayu Vachharajani and Sanjay Chaudhary, interim dean and professor of School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad University." However, the appointment has not come as a surprise for the varsity officials as they were expecting Khimani to replace the outgoing VC Anamik Shah who is completing his second term next month. "For us, his appointment is not news. What is going to happen in the next few months is what matters the most," said a source privy to the latest development in the campus.  He said that the varsity, started by Gandhi back in 1920 who remained its chancellor till his death in 1948, is in "deep financial crisis" as University Grants Commission (UGC) has not been releasing funds for the past seven to eight months. "If the varsity doesn't receive adequate funds for one more month, it will be impossible for the administration to give salaries to its employees on time. Among other things, Khimani has been appointed to improve this situation as he is believed to be varsity's pointsman for UGC and other government agencies with which the varsity has been at loggerheads." A senior trustee of Vidyapith told DH on condition of anonymity, "We are facing at least 30% shortage of funds from the UGC that is affecting disbursal of salaries. It's not that they have entirely stopped funding us. But, there is certainly a lot of delay in releasing funds which the varsity has been receiving as a deemed university." He added that the trust has set up a committee to audit its finances to explore options by the end of this month. The university is known for its glorious past with its founder Mahatma Gandhi, deputy prime minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, country’s first president Rajendra Prasad, late prime minister Morarji Desai, among others served as its chancellors. It was once known for giving space to dissenting voices against the establishment. But, over the last decade, it has closed its door for such voices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-vidyapith-founded-by-mahatma-gandhi-gets-a-new-vice-chancellor-925876.html
10-12-2020||West||NGO members take out Sholay-style agitation against Raosaheb Danve||Members of a non-governmental organisation undertook a 'Sholay'-style agitation as they climbed on a water tank here in Maharashtra on Thursday to protest against Union minister Raosaheb Danve's controversial comments on the ongoing stir by farmers over new agri laws. The BJP leader has been facing flak after claiming that China and Pakistan were behind the protests by farmers, who are demanding scrapping of the three news agri-marketing laws enacted by the Modi government in September. Volunteers of 'Prahar', an organisation headed by Maharashtra minister Bacchu Kadu, climbed on a water tank in Shivaji Nagar here as part of their agitation against Danve. The agitation started around 1 pm and continued till late in the night as the protesters rejected repeated appeals by the police to come down and demonstrate. "We have commenced this agitation against Raosaheb Danve as he has alleged that there was involvement of Pakistan and China in the farmers' agitation taking place in Delhi. "We (outfit members) will continue to be atop the water tank till Raosaheb Danve apologises for his remarks," Prahar district unit president Sudhakar Shinde told PTI. A police team reached the spot and requested the volunteers to come down and agitate, but to no avail. "We requested the protesters to climb down and agitate. We are not using any force...when our men tried to climb the tank to pacify the protesters, they threatened to jump off the structure," a senior official from the Jawahar Nagar police station said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ngo-members-take-out-sholay-style-agitation-against-raosaheb-danve-925878.html

Desai stated later that if the boards were not removed by December 31, they will again head for the temple town. The activist had been barred from entering Shirdi in Ahmednagar district till December 11 after she announced the protest. Desai and 15 to 16 members of her outfit Bhumata Brigade were taken into custody by the Ahmednagar police near Supa village when they were on their way to Shirdi to remove boards put up outside the Saibaba temple asking devotees to dress in a "civilized" manner. "We released all the activists on Thursday evening and escorted them back upto the Pune district border," said Ahmednagar Superintendent of Police Manoj Patil. On Tuesday, sub-divisional magistrate (Shirdi area) Govind Shinde, citing the law and order situation, had issued a notice to Desai, asking her not to enter Shirdi from December 8 midnight to December 11 midnight. Trust officials had said the boards were put up after they received complaints that some people come to the popular shrine in "objectionable" clothes. It was only an appeal and not the imposition of a dress code, they said. Speaking to PTI, Desai said she was told there might be a threat to her and her associates' lives if they proceeded to Shirdi. "We urge the temple trust to remove the boards by December 31. If the boards are not removed, we will once again go to Shirdi," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/activist-trupti-desai-stopped-from-going-to-shirdi-925881.html
