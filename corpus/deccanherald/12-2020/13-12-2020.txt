13-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Kasargod district will replicate design of Dakshina Kannada farmer's ring-shaped check dam||The Kasargod district administration is conserving water and replenishing the groundwater table by replicating an innovative farming technique developed by a farmer in the neighbouring district of Dakshina Kannada. Nitile Mahabaleshwara Bhat, a farmer in Kodapadavu village near Vittal in Dakshina Kannada district, had constructed a micro-ring check dam across a stream that flows in his farmland in 2008, which will now help farmers in Kasargod. EP Rajamohan, special officer for Kasaragod Development Package took the initiative to bring ring check dams to his district. But this innovation was born out of necessity for Bhat back in 2008. The design of the dam is easy and requires minimal resources: a concrete ring and an iron shutter. “I had to cross a 20 feet-wide stream near my house in order to reach the plantation. Engineers estimated that a bridge across the stream would incur a cost Rs 1.5 lakh. In 2008, I had a custom-built two-foot concrete ring with a thickness of four-inch and a diameter of eight feet placed across the stream,” he said. “Motivated by the rainwater harvesting expert and Adike Pathrike editor Shree Padre’s campaign to revive traditional kattas, I added an iron sheet with gunny bags at the edges, which serves as a gate and helps in recharging the groundwater table,” he recollected. "The bridge constructed using cement rings, laterite stone and mud cost just Rs 36,000. The check dam allows the movement of trucks, pick-up vehicles, auto-rickshaws. Now I can carry areca nuts from plantation to the house and fertilisers or manure to the plantation using a vehicle,” says Bhat. “Once this ring katta-cum-bridge is constructed, it does not require any maintenance. Kattas are traditional dams used for impounding water from December to February end. It was Shree Padre who exposed Kasargod district administration officials to this unique model. A team of 8 to 10 engineers from Kasargod had visited my plantation to replicate the model in their district," he added. Bhat is a recipient of the Krishi Pandita award in 2007 for bringing innovation in farming. "Officials in Kasargod Development Package and MGNREGS are using this model across small rivulets, streams in the district. The district administration is planning to build nearly 3,000 micro ring check dams and 600 among them are to be completed this year,” he said. On its Facebook page, Kasargod District Collector Sajith Babu had said, “We have done many such structures in past six months and going to have 150 more such structures within a month. It costs less than Rs 1 lakh and no time delays due to Administrative Sanction (AS), Technical Sanction (TS), Tender etc. With help of this model, we will build small bridges for the poor and the underprivileged.” Bhat said with a bright smile that at least 8 to 10 such micro ring check dams had been constructed at Punacha, Pundikai and the surrounding villages in Vittal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/kasargod-district-will-replicate-design-of-dakshina-kannada-farmers-ring-shaped-check-dam-926798.html

During the visit to Ibrahim's residence on Saturday night, the KPCC President tried to convince him not to quit Congress to join the JD(S), they said. Both leaders are said to have discussed developments within the party and political happenings in the state. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy had on December 7 met Ibrahim and invited him to return to the party fold. Following this Ibrahim had said that he was yet to take any decision on quitting Congress and would arrive at a conclusion only after meeting his supporters and well-wishers. Ibrahim, a former Union Minister and a one-time close associate of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, had joined Congress in 2008. He was seen as one among the close confidants of Siddaramaiah. According to sources, Ibrahim has been sulking for some time now, upset with the party, especially Siddaramaiah after he was not considered for the post of Leader of Opposition in the legislative Council, the position currently occupied by S R Patil, who is also considered to be close to the former Chief Minister. Ibrahim had left JD(S) after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

13-12-2020||Mysuru||Urban administration needs to be revisited, revamped: MUDA chief||D B Natesh, who took charge as Commissioner of Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), on May 4, 2019, is a 2004 batch KAS officer. Earlier he served as Tahsildar of Mysuru, Ramanagar, Theerthahalli and Chikkaballapur, Administrative Officer of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Special Land Acquisition Officer of Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru South and Deputy General Manager of Karnataka Housing Board (KHB). Speaking to T R Sathish Kumar of Deccan Herald, Natesh says, the dynamics of population growth, economy and urban growth has drastically changed over the decades and the entire urban administration should be revisited and revamped, in the light of prevailing situations. MUDA rings only one thought among the people, sites. Besides developing residential layouts and allotting sites and houses to applicants, MUDA approves private layouts. What else does MUDA do? What such work is under progress? The objective of MUDA is to realise the dream of a planned city. We chart the Local Plan Area (LPA) and prepare Master Plans. The latest Master Plan, that includes parts of adjoining Nanjangud and Srirangapatna taluks, started in 2006. It was published in 2016. But it is being revised to incorporate the guidelines of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The final draft would be published in a year. It will give a direction to the development of Mysuru over the next few years. As per data 80,000 applications seeking sites are pending with MUDA. According to an estimate, there are already 1.25 lakh vacant sites in Mysuru City and suburbs. Further development of layouts will only create more vacant sites. What is the practical solution? The urban population has grown by 37% during 2001-2011. It is expected to grow by 42% during the next decade. Due to various reasons, people migrate to urban areas and they need adequate infrastructure. To meet the demand, more residential areas with proper amenities, should be developed. To check the rise in the number of vacant sites, we need a change in the policy and need stringent laws to withdraw allotment or confiscate such sites. At present, there is a provision to withdraw sites if the allottee does not construct a house within 10 years. But, that too is a bit complicated. Don’t you think, Mysuru should have a conservation authority, rather than a development authority, as it is marketed on its heritage? City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) is probably the first such agency in the whole of India, for town planning and development. Conservation policy and laws are not as stringent as in the West, in India. In our urban plan, infrastructure is the priority. Due to growth dynamics over the years, residential areas around Mysuru Palace became business areas. As industries did not develop on expected lines, the stress on the central business district grew, resulting in haphazard growth. Both MUDA and private developers are converting lands into residential layouts. For both, lands, revered as Mother Earth earlier, are a commodity. Green cover in and around Mysuru is depleting. Except for those earmarked or created before Independence, neither MUDA nor MCC has created a lung space. Rather, existing lung spaces are destroyed under the guise of development. How do you plan to ensure lung spaces in the expanding city? Under existing policies, laws and priorities, creation of a new lung space is impossible in any urban area in India. Lung spaces need vast expanses of lands, involving huge costs. Mysuru is developed, managed and administered by multiple agencies. MUDA’s jobs seems to end in developing layouts, allotting sites and handing over layouts to the MCC for maintenance. The concept of development has diminished for MUDA. What can be done to put forth the real concept of development of a city? Besides charting the development and maintenance guidelines for MCC, MUDA lays out guidelines for the maintenance of the planned city. But, due to various factors, mostly political interference, the guidelines and rules are violated. There is a policy gap in this respect. The Ring Road is in a pathetic condition though it had been handed over to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). There are thousands of potholes on the Ring Road. Most parts of the service roads and its footpaths are used for dumping of garbage and debris. Now, there is a plan for a Peripheral Ring Road. What plans do you have for the existing Ring Road? How do you plan sustainability of the Peripheral Ring Road? The NHAI has started ashphalting of the Ring Road. Tenders have been invited for other works. Wherever there is no service road, they will be laid. Roads are vital for economy.Thus, there will be proper planning for the Peripheral Ring Road.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/urban-administration-needs-to-be-revisited-revamped-muda-chief-926739.html
13-12-2020||National||India will go beyond expectations to achieve Paris Agreement goals: PM Modi over climate change||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that when independent India would celebrate its centenary in 1947, it would not only meet its targets for contributing to the global fight against climate change, but would also go beyond expectation of the international community. “In 2047, India will celebrate 100 years as a modern, independent nation. To all my fellow residents of this planet, I make a solemn pledge today. Centennial India will not only meet its own targets, but will also exceed your expectations (in doing its bit for the fight against climate change),” Modi said in a video message at the Climate Ambition Summit, jointly convened by France, the United Kingdom and the United Nations. The virtual summit was held to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement to fight climate change. Modi said that the Paris Agreement was the most ambitious step in the global fight against climate change. “Today, as we are looking to set our sights even higher, we must also not lose sight of the past. We must not only revise our ambitions, but also review our achievements against targets already set. Only then can our voices be credible for future generations.” He said that India was on track not only to achieve its Paris Agreement targets, but to exceed them beyond expectations. “We have reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels. Our solar capacity has grown from 2.63 GigaWatts in 2014 to 36 GigaWatts in 2020,” he said, adding: “”Our renewable energy capacity is the fourth largest in the world. It will reach 175 GigaWatts before 2022. And, we have an even more ambitious target now – 450 GigaWatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. We have also succeeded in expanding our forest cover and safeguarding our biodiversity.” India had ratified the Paris Agreement on October 2, 2016 and its pledged Nationally Determined Contributions to the fight against climate change included – reducing the emissions intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33%–35% by 2030 below 2005 levels, increasing the share of non-fossil-based energy resources to 40% of installed electric power capacity by 2030 with help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF) and creating an additional (cumulative) carbon sink of 2.5–3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The Prime Minister on Saturday also referred to two global initiatives by India – setting up the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. The Climate Ambition Summit was held on Saturday as a prelude to the next UN Climate Conference, COP26, which will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow in November 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-go-beyond-expectations-to-achieve-paris-agreement-goals-pm-modi-over-climate-change-926757.html
13-12-2020||National||PM Modi bats for reforms again; Farmers picket toll plazas, threaten bigger stir||Agitating farmers picketed highway toll plazas in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Saturday and claimed thousands more will soon arrive on Delhi's borders to intensify their stir against the Centre's new agri laws, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi again asserted that these reforms will help increase the income of cultivators. Hundreds of security personnel were deployed at border points on highways linking Delhi following an announcement by the farmer unions to block the Jaipur-Delhi and the Delhi-Agra Expressways on Saturday. The roads functioned by and large normally though the protesters did block some stretches briefly and did not allow the collection of toll at many places. Farmer leaders said major highways linking the national capital will be blocked from Sunday and they will sit on a hunger strike on December 14, when they have called for a nationwide protest. While both the Centre and farmer unions have said that they are open to talks after the cancellation of the meeting on December 9, there were voices of mutual recrimination as the farmers' protest continued on the 17th day with no sign of end to the deadlock. Union Minister Som Prakash, who is negotiating with protesting farmers, said efforts are being made to call an early meeting with farmer leaders. The two sides have had five rounds of talks. The farmers have rejected a government offer to amend the farm laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the MSP system. "We are trying to call a meeting early. ...We are discussing. The date has not been finalized," the minister told PTI, adding "ultimately, we have to resolve this issue through dialogue. There is no other way out. They (farmers) also know it, we also know." Sticking to their demand for the repeal of the three agri laws, the farmer leaders accused the government of trying to divide them. Their statement came as Union Minister Piyush Goyal and some other BJP leaders said the agitation no longer remains a farmers' movement as it has been "infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements" demanding the release of those put behind bars for "anti-national activities". Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, whose JJP is in alliance with the BJP, met Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Delhi and said he is hopeful that the next round of talks between the Centre and the unions will take place in the next 24-40 hours. Addressing a press conference at Singhu Border, farmer leader Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu said that thousands of farmers will start their 'Delhi Chalo' march with their tractors from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur-Delhi Highway at 11 AM on Sunday. The distance between Shahjahanpur and Delhi-Gurgaon border is around 94 km. Farmer leaders said more protesters were on their way from Punjab and Harayana too. Spelling out their strategy to make the agitation even "bigger", the farmer leader announced that their "mothers, sisters and daughters will also join them soon", and that arrangements for their stay are being made at the protest sites. "If the government wants to hold talks, we are ready, but our main demand will remain the scrapping of the three laws. We will move onto our other demands only after that," Pannu said. Farmer union leaders will also sit on a hunger strike between 8 AM and 5 PM at the Singhu Border during the nationwide protest on December 14 against the new agriculture laws, he said. "The government tried to weaken our agitation by dividing us (various farmer unions). I want to say that the ongoing agitation is fully under the control of 32 farmer unions. We will fail every government attempt to divide us," Pannu also said. Pannu claimed all toll plazas in Haryana "were made free today". In Punjab, toll plazas have remained free since October 1 he told reporters. Some union leaders said that farmers could not block the highways on Saturday because most of them were on their way to Delhi from remote areas of Rajasthan and Haryana. "Also, police barricades have been put up on several road stretches so farmers could not reach Delhi on Saturday. All farmers have assembled near Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur on Saturday and tomorrow morning, they would head towards the national capital," Pannu added. More than 100 farmers gathered at a toll plaza on the Ambala-Hisar highway, around 15 kilometers from Ambala city. Farmers also did not allow the collection of fees from commuters at Bastara and Peont toll plazas in Karnal on NH-44 and Karnal-Jind highway respectively. Farmers also took over four toll plazas in Hisar district, one on Jind-Nirwana highway among others. In Uttar Pradesh, dozens of farmers were detained in different parts of Aligarh for trying to occupy toll plazas. Similar incidents of protests trying to picket toll plaza were reported from other districts including Kaushambi. In Rajasthan, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) MP Hanuman Beniwal joined a demonstration as farmers blocked highways in dozens of places. Addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat organized at Kotputli, Beniwal said that the Centre did not discuss it with the stakeholders before bringing the farm laws. Farmers held demonstrations in districts like Kota, Ganganagar, Bharatpur, Hanumangarh and Alwar. In many places, toll plazas on the highway were closed and vehicles were allowed to move without paying the tax. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot appealed to the people to maintain peace during the agitation. "Even on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, farmers should place their demands democratically in front of the center and maintain peace," he tweeted In Punjab, toll charges are not being collected from commuters as farmers have been staging sit-ins at toll plazas since October 1. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is suffering a loss of Rs 3 crore per day on account of farmers' protest at toll plazas in the state. There are 25 toll plazas on national highways in Punjab. Farmers' move to further intensify their agitation comes on a day Prime Minister Modi assured them that his government was committed to their welfare and that the three legislations were aimed at giving them alternative markets to boost income. Without directly referring to the farmers' agitation, Modi said at the annual meeting of industry body FICCI here that agriculture reforms as part of government efforts are aimed at removing roadblocks, and the new laws will also bring in technology and investment in the sector. "Farmers have now options to sell their crops in mandis as well as to outside parties," he said. "While mandis are being modernised, digital platform is also available to farmers to buy and sell their produce." These efforts are aimed at raising incomes of farmers, he said. "All these efforts are directed towards improving the farmers' income so that they become prosperous. When farmers prosper, the country will prosper." "After the implementation of recent reforms, farmers will get new markets and new opportunities and they will get the help of technology. The country's cold storage infrastructure will become modern," he said. "From all these, there will be a higher investment in the agriculture sector. The maximum benefit of these reforms would be to small and marginal farmers who earn their living on small plots of land," the prime minister said. The Congress said farmers want pro-people governance not flowery speeches and urged the Centre to accede to their demands. In a tweet, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala attacked Prime Minister Modi, saying the "whole country is fed up of your enticing lollypops". Union Minister Piyush Goyal, meanwhile, said there was an attempt to derail agriculture reforms by Leftists and Maoist elements. "We now realise that the so-called farmer agitation hardly remains a farmers' agitation. It has almost got infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements, a flavour of which we saw over the last two days when there were extraneous demands to release people who have been put behind bars for anti-national (and) who have been put behind bars for illegal activities," Goyal, the Minister for Railways, Commerce and Industry and Food and Consumers Affairs, said at the FICCI's annual meeting. He, however, did not say if the government had or is planning to take any action against any person belonging to banned outfits seen at the protests. A delegation of 29 farmers from Haryana also met Agriculture Minister Tomar to extend their support to the new legislations and threatened to stage a protest if those are repealed. The delegation, led by Bharatiya Kisan Union's (Mann) Haryana state leader Guni Prakash, submitted a "letter of support" to Tomar on the farm laws passed by Parliament in September and demanded the government to continue with these legislations. Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for over two weeks to demand a repeal of these laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-bats-for-reforms-again-farmers-picket-toll-plazas-threaten-bigger-stir-926758.html

Khanchandani is the 13th person to be arrested in the alleged fake ratings scam in which at least three television channels including Republic TV were named by the Central Intelligence Unit (CIU) of Mumbai Police. Khanchandani is likely to be produced before a holiday court. Mumbai Police said that it was found after investigations that Republic TV claimed to have the highest TV ratings, and it was influencing its own ratings to charge more for advertising by bribing households where the monitoring machines are set up.  The police began a probe into the alleged scam after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Agency about rigging of TRP by some channels. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. The BARC engaged Hansa to install and maintain barometers which record TV viewership data at sample households. It was alleged that some of these families were being bribed to tune into certain channels to ramp up their TRP. In a charge sheet filed recently, the police alleged that an official of Hansa paid money to sample households to tune into Box Cinema, Fakt Marathi, Maha Movie and Republic TV.

13-12-2020||National||We will never forget cowardly attack on our Parliament: PM Narendra Modi||India will never forget the cowardly attack on its Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday as the nation paid tributes to those who lost their lives in the terror strike on this day in 2001. Nine persons, including eight security personnel, died in the attack by terrorists belonging to Pakistan-based outfits. All five terrorists were killed by security forces. "While commemorating the great sacrifice of those defenders of the temple of our democracy, we strengthen our resolve to defeat the forces of terror," President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted At a brief ceremony held outside the Parliament building, floral tributes were paid at the portraits of the personnel by Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Modi, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Union ministers and Opposition leaders. Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson Harivansh, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, Leader of Opposition in the Upper House Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and Rajiv Shukla of the Congress were among those who paid homage. The leaders observed a moment of silence as a mark of respect. "We will never forget the cowardly attack on our Parliament on this day in 2001. We recall the valour and sacrifice of those who lost their lives protecting our Parliament. India will always be thankful to them," Prime Minister Modi tweeted. The terror attack had pushed India-Pakistan ties to a new low and India had mobilised its armed forces under Operation Parakram. The incident also led to a massive upgrade in the security of the Parliament complex. In a Facebook post, Vice President Naidu said that December 13 is a stark reminder of the menace of terrorism and its professed antagonism to democratic values and economic aspirations. A catastrophe was averted by the alert and brave security personnel guarding the Parliament House. Eight of them sacrificed their precious lives and a gardener fell to the gunfire of the terrorists. All five terrorists were killed in a quick and spirited response, Naidu recalled. He observed that a brave woman constable was in the forefront of the spirited fight against the terrorists. CRPF constable Kamlesh Kumari first spotted the terrorists and kept tracking their movements inside the Parliament complex and informed the same to her seniors. "Her bravery was instrumental in quickly putting down the terrorists’ game plan. She fell to the barrage of the bullets pumped into her and became a martyr, leaving a saga of inspiration and commitment to fight for the country," Naidu said. "I pay my tributes, along with our grateful nation, to all the eight security personnel and the gardener whose acts of sacrifice will forever be etched in the minds of our countrymen," he wrote. The first year of this millennium was in fact a horrible one for the world. The year 2001 closed with ghastly terror attacks on the nerve centers of democracy and economy, he pointed out. "The most populous democracies of the world, India and the US, were at the receiving end. The attack on the World Trade Centre in September that year and on Indian Parliament in December revealed the agenda of the terror outfits. During the last two decades, several such attacks of different degrees were witnessed by humanity," he said. The only agenda of terror outfits, Naidu said, is to disrupt the democratic and economic fabric of the world and force humanity into a dark era. Such nefarious designs shall be brought to an end through effective and collective global action. The state and non-state actors who prop up terrorism as an instrument of state policy for narrow ends should be isolated by the global community and made to behave, he felt. "India has been piloting the proposal for adoption of a UN Convention against Terrorism. While many countries from across different continents support India’s voice in this regard, there are some who are oblivious to the larger threats of terrorism out of narrow geo-political geopoliticalconsiderations. "They should realise that in the end, everybody will end up a loser if the menace of terror is not rolled back through a united effort," the vice president asserted. The message of 2001 should awaken every citizen and every country to the lurking dangers of terrorism for mounting an effective action to roll it back, he said concluding his post with the hashtag "ParliamentAttack". People from different walks of life posted messages on social media paying tributes to the slain security personnel. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that the country will always remember the valour of the security personnel. "Their bravery will also be remembered by the future generations of this country," Singh tweeted. "I pay my heartfelt tributes to the brave sons of Mother India who made supreme sacrifice by taking on the enemies in the cowardly terrorist attack on the Parliament House, the temple of democracy, in 2001. A grateful nation will forever be indebted for your supreme sacrifice," Home Minister Shah tweeted in Hindi. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has brought out a book chronicling the valour of its bravehearts, including Kamlesh Kumari who sacrificed her life during the Parliament attack in 2001. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla released the book in his chamber on the anniversary of the attack on Sunday. "I am sure that this book will fill hearts of everyone with pride and inspire the generations to come," Birla said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-will-never-forget-cowardly-attack-on-our-parliament-pm-narendra-modi-926815.html

Another MLA Atishi and eight others were detained while protesting in front of the Delhi LG's residence. The AAP had announced that it will hold protests outside the residences of Shah and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal demanding a CBI probe into the misappropriation of over Rs 2,400 crore in the North Delhi and South Delhi municipal corporations. The MLAs were released later in the day and they described the action against them as "illegal" while accusing the Centre of "trying to bury the corruption matter using the Delhi police." "There was no provision to detain us, when we asked why we are being detained they said it is because section 144 is in place which prevents assembly of more than four people but then we were four people only who were going to protest," Chadha said. "It is clear that the scam we have unearthed has involvement of the top brass and that is why these attempts are being made to stop us from raising the matter," Atishi said. On its part, police said the MLAs were detained because they were trying to hold protests despite denial of permission. Police said it had rejected permission for the protest citing the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/four-aap-mlas-detained-while-on-their-way-to-protest-outside-amit-shahs-residence-926816.html

Officals said normal traffic resumed between Noida and Delhi via Chilla border after farmers vacated the spot they had been occupying since December 1 for their sit-in demonstration. The movement on the DND and the Kalindi Kunj routes, both connecting Delhi and Noida, was also normal, they said. The protest, however, continued at the border with some Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) members, including their chief Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh, staying put at Chilla. The farmers had vacated the carriageways around Saturday midnight after a meeting with Defence Minister Singh and Agriculture Minister Tomar, a BKU (Bhanu) office-bearer said. “Rajnath ji heard our demands and agreed to take the discussions further and resolve the issues. We were convinced and decided to vacate the road. However, this does not mean that our protest is over,” Satish Tomar, a senior IT Cell member of the BKU (Bhanu), told PTI over phone. He said a 'havan' was being performed at the Chila border on Sunday by the protesting farmers and further course of action would be clear by evening. At Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida, close to the Chilla border, another group of farmers belonging to the BKU (Lok Shakti) is staging a protest against the new laws. Some of the group members had on Saturday tonsured their heads and had earlier gone semi-naked during their protest. These protestors have gathered at the Noida border and want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. Government officials said efforts are being made for the next round of talks between representatives of the Centre and the farmers so that the logjam over the new laws could end.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/normal-traffic-resumes-at-chilla-border-farmers-say-protest-still-on-at-noida-border-926833.html
13-12-2020||National||Homemaker, farmworker and now protester, hundreds of women join farmers' agitation||They have long juggled the demands of field and family, making sure both are tended to, and now hundreds of women from Haryana and Punjab have added another dimension to their busy lives – the protest grounds at the various gateways into Delhi. As their husbands, sons and brothers leave home to demand a rollback of the Centre’s new agri laws, many women are joining them too, making the trip from village towards the national capital even if for only a few days at a time. For these women, who describe themselves as homemakers, farmworkers and protesters all rolled into one, any suggestion that farmers are about being alpha males because it requires physical labour is met with scorn. "The profession of farming is not defined by gender. Our fields don’t produce crops differently if tended by women and men. Many male farmers are here protesting. Why should we sit at home?" asked 53-year-old Mandeep Kaur, a farmer from Ludhiana who refuses to be stereotyped into any one role. Mandeep took a bus to the Singhu border, a major protest site of the farmers’ agitation that has been going for more than two weeks, spent a night and returned home. “But I will be back,” she said. “We have to look after both our homes as well as our fight. I watered the fields before I came here. It will sustain the land until I return home.” While the men have been camping at the Tikri and Singhu border, the main access point into the city from Punjab, many of the women have been travelling back and forth, balancing the jobs of taking care of their homes and fields and also participating in the agitation. Mandeep’s companion on the five-hour bus ride from Ludhiana to Singhu was her neighbour Sukhwinder Kaur.  The 68-year-old widow said she was tired of sitting at home while the men in her family were out protesting, and decided she needed to come down, even if it was for a short visit. "I wasn't being able to sleep at night properly. I couldn't sit back at home while my brother and nephew, and all our farmer brothers, are fighting here. I had my first good night of sleep after I came here,” Sukhwinder added. It wasn’t the epitome of comfort and toilets were a problem but that didn’t matter, said the feisty women. Sukhwinder and Mandeep, with several other women protestors, slept in a water proof tent provided by Khalsa Aid, an international NGO.  Sukhwinder said she was aware of the fight the farming community had undertaken but didn’t realise what it actually took to keep the fight going until she came here. "We are 'gharelu' women, don't know much about the world, but after coming here I have realised how big this fight is. We are prepared for it, however long it takes. The kind of help we are getting for the protest shows the entire country is with us. I have heard that people from Australia, Canada and America are also with us,” she said.  The farmers, with help from various organisations and generous donors, have pulled out all the stops to sustain their agitation. The site is seeing a constant supply of cooked meals, fruits, dry fruits, and even ‘chaat’. There’s also chai-pakora, cold drinks, kheer and other sweet treats.   Arrangements for laundry service, and medical facilities, including regular health check ups and a dental camp, have also been taken care of. Sukhwinder only had one complaint. “The toilet is a little too far,” she said. Staying on the Haryana side of the border, she said she had to take a bit of a stroll to find a toilet, which was on the Delhi side. Inadequate sanitation facilities is one reason why many women have to go back and forth, managing to stay at the protest sight only for a few days at a time. But 75-year-old Daljinder Kaur takes it all in her stride, like many others. She is Mandeep’s aunt and insisted on accompanying her to Singhu despite her age. Daljinder said she is positive her farmer brothers and sisters will convince the government. “‘Modi ko mana ke jaenge. Apne haq lene aaye hain, peeche nahi hatenge’ (We will convince Modi. We won’t go back until we get our rights),” she said. “'And if needed, we will die here too, she said. The farmers have called for a hunger strike on December 14, when they have called for a nationwide protest. Refusing the government's requests to make amendments to the new farm laws, the farmers are insisting that they should be repealed. On Saturday, farmers picketed highway toll plazas in Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan. They are apprehensive the new legislations will eventually do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/homemaker-farmworker-and-now-protester-hundreds-of-women-join-farmers-agitation-926836.html

Several rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have reached a deadlock as the farmers continue to demand unconditional repeal of the new laws. The government, on the other hand, has only offered to amend the laws.  Chautala on Saturday met Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Rajnath Singh. However, no breakthrough was seen. The Deputy CM has been under criticism for being a BJP ally when farmers across Haryana, Punjab and other states have camped at Delhi's border for 18 consecutive days.  "It's my responsibility as a representative of farmers to secure their rights. I discussed the matter with Union Ministers, I'm hopeful that a way will be found with mutual consent and the standoff will be resolved. The Centre is positive," he said. Prime Minister Modi had reiterated that the reforms will benefit the farmers, but agitators paid no heed and continued the protests.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/consensus-with-protesting-farmers-in-24-48-hours-haryana-dy-cm-dushyant-chautala-926858.html

Kang, who is associated with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, a global consortium involved in facilitating vaccine candidates for the novel coronavirus, also said that there should be equitable Covid-19 vaccine access globally and domestically. Known for her inter-disciplinary research on transmission, development and prevention of infections and their sequelae in children in India, Kang is also the first Indian woman to be inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society in London. Though vaccines for the coronavirus are being developed in a "very short period of time", all clinical phases of testing are being done, she told PTI in an interview. "What has changed is the approach to the testing where all steps that used to happen between phases of clinical trials have been cut out, which means regulators are working much longer and harder than they ever have before," Kang said. Everybody is talking about things being done very fast but "I think it is very important to know what steps we are cutting out and quite frankly, in all of the testing of vaccines that is being done, there is no aspect of testing that is being removed from the development pathway", she said. "I think it is very important to understand that there has been absolutely no compromise in clinical testing of Covid-19 vaccines. The only thing that we do not have from these trials, that we might have had otherwise, is the duration of safety follow-up. Generally, we follow up on trials for six months or one year, and generally, we do not find anything extra in the six months or one year," Kang said. Kang, who was the executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) but resigned in July, said that another thing that is different in the development of Covid-19 vaccines is that clinical trials have been made very large to get results faster. To a question on availability of cold chain capacity to store vaccines, she said that equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines should be ensured. The case should not be that those who live in big cities, where there is better cold chain capacity, get vaccinated while those in rural areas or small towns do not get it because of lack of storage facilities, Kang said. "My worry with all of it is the question of equity, will we end up with a system where we have freezers in big cities and some classes of people can get vaccines, whereas in rural areas or small towns there is no access to these vaccines as cold chain capacity does not exist," she said. "Even in the work that we are planning to do with the Lancet Commission, equity is a big part of looking at what services are provided to whom and where, and making sure that where you live and what your socio-economic status does not determine what kind of services you get," Kang said. The Lancet, a global health journal, on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens' Commission on Reimagining India's Health System, which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage (UHC) in India. The journal and the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University, together formulated the commission. Speaking about the Lancet commission, Kang said that its purpose is to aim for universal health coverage to examine all health concerns, to look at mental and physical health problems and their solutions, to ensure that catastrophic health expenditure does not happen and make sure coverage is accessible and affordable. The commission is being led by four distinguished health and business leaders, including Kang and CMD Biocon Ltd Kiran Mazumdar Shaw. "If we think about Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have a target of 2030, there is no way we can achieve these goals with the trajectory that we have at the moment. So what we are seeking to do over the next few years is to try and layout a road-map to make sure we are on a better path to achieving the SDGs," Kang said. She said in India, out of pocket payments for healthcare continue to be highest in the world and it is one of many reasons why many families are driven into poverty. This kind of "catastrophic health expenditure" actually winds up promoting further health inequities in the system, Kang said. "We have a situation where the most vulnerable in our population don't get services that they want and there is a problem in terms of accountability where the poor are treated as beneficiaries rather than as clients of the system, and there seems to be a lack of trust in the quality of the care that is provided by the healthcare system," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/there-has-been-absolutely-no-compromise-in-clinical-testing-of-covid-19-vaccines-gangandeep-kang-926885.html

The national transporter is planning to use AI and data analytics in train operations, passengers ticket booking, maintenance of systems, freight operations, and railways assets. "We will analyse all this data with the help of AI and analytics and use it in our Passenger Reservation System (PRS). This will also help in introduction of new trains, predictive asset maintenance," said an official. "Unlike the present system of carrying out maintenance in a periodic manner, a predictive asset maintenance system will continuously monitor the condition of equipment and generate the required alerts. This will help us to take up immediate maintenance," said the official. This will not only reduce in cost of maintenance costs but also help to cut down load on maintenance of assets, said the official. The Indian Railways has tied up with the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, for analysing the data generated by the national transporter. The railways tasked ISB to plan an introductory capacity building program and formulate a report on the industrial practices of AI on rail transport. The railways is also planning to set up a Centre for Excellence in this regard in the next three months. The ISB will help in developing a report on establishing the Centre for Excellence and an advanced capacity building programme.

Addressing a press conference in Maharashtra's Nagpur city on Sunday, Athawale, head of the Republican Party of India (A) which is an ally of the BJP, also said Union minister Raosaheb Danve's claim of China and Pakistan being behind the farmers' protest is "not the government's stand". "Besides, Pakistan and China's hands cannot reach till here," he said when asked about Danve's claim. To a query on Goyal's remark, Athawale said, "It is important to initiate an inquiry into the remarks made by Piyush Goyal, if such people have entered who have no relation with the farmers' protest." Since November 26, thousands of farmers have been protesting at various Delhi borders against the Centre's three new farm laws. Athawale said social distancing is not seen at the farmers' protest and spread of the coronavirus cannot ruled out in such crowded places. "I can understand the feelings of farmers, but the three farm laws are in the interest of farmers. We do not support their demand for a repeal of the laws," he said. The government is ready to make amendments. The farmers should not be adamant on repeal of the laws, but should pursue a dialogue on this issue, he said. "Both (farmers and government) should take two steps back and (then) try to move ahead on the issue," he said. Athawale also alleged that the Congress meted out injustice to NCP chief Sharad Pawar by not making him the prime minister (in 1990s). "I had said it earlier also that an able leader like Sharad Pawar should join the (BJP-led) National Democratic Alliance and work shoulder-to-shoulder with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and make the NDA stronger," Athawale added. He also expressed confidence that the BJP-RPI(A) will win the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections due in 2022 and unseat the Shiv Sena from power in the Mumbai civic body. "This time, BJP-RPI(A) for sure will come to power in the BMC. The BJP will have its mayor and RPI-A will have the deputy mayor," he said. The Shiv Sena-ruled BMC is the country's richest civic body with an annual budget of over Rs 33,400 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/probe-if-unrelated-people-part-of-farmers-protest-says-union-minister-ramdas-athawale-926901.html

According to the NHFS-5, several states and Union Territories, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Mizoram, Tripura, Lakshadweep, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, have registered several folds increase in the percentage of obesity among children below five years of age in comparison to NFHS-4 conducted between 2015 and 2016. Only Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu registered a drop in the number of overweight children under five years of age, the data showed. About 13.4 per cent children under the age of five were found to be obese in Ladakh which was highest among the 22 states and Union Territories surveyed, followed by Lakshadweep at 10.5 per cent, Mizoram 10 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir, and Sikkim 9.6 per cent each. According to the survey data, 16 states and Union Territories registered a rise in obesity among women while 19 states and UTs recorded an increase in obesity among men. Kerala and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded the highest percentage of obesity among women at 38 per cent. Also, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep recorded the highest percentage of obesity among women at over 40 per cent. Men and women were counted as obese whose body mass index was found to be over or equal to 25.0 kg/m2 while children's obesity was counted in terms of weight-for-height. Healthcare experts have attributed the rise in obesity to unhealthy food choices and lack of physical activities among children and even adults. Sheila Vir, a public health nutrition expert and founder-director of Public Health Nutrition and Development Centre, said there is also lack of awareness on what are good food habits. Also, high-fat and high-sugar foods are easily available and so there is higher consumption of it, she said. "We have a double burden of undernutrition, malnutrition and overnutrition occurring together. So, I think what to feed a child is what we are going wrong in," Vir said. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, she also raised concern over the rise in obesity. "There might be an increase in obesity among children in view of Covid-19 pandemic as after closure of schools, there was lack of physical activity among children and even in adults in some cases," she said. Dr. Khan Amir Maroof, Professor at Department of Community Medicine, University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital termed the rise in obesity a "very disturbing sign". "Obesity is a manifestation of what is rapidly changing in our environment. Of late, we see trends which increase the risk of developing obesity. Environmental factors, such as availability and consumption of junk foods, poor complementary feeding, lack of outdoor activity, and increased screen time on may be the reason for this trend," he said. "For children, we need to flag screen time as it has multi-dimensional effects on children, obesity, being one of them. The focus has been on breastfeeding, but now it's time that complementary feeding is also focused upon," Dr Maroof suggested. About the repercussions of obesity among children, he said non-communicable diseases can develop among obese children earlier than others. "There are higher chances for them being bullied in schools, neglected or shamed by peers, which lead to mental health problems among them," he said. Among adults, he said more consumption of ready-to-eat foods, increase in screen time with the 24-hour access to web content, and lack of outdoor spaces seem to be hitting adults with obesity. He suggested that children, with more stress on complementary feeding practices in the community, and reducing screen time, can be the immediate actions. "Counselling of breastfeeding mothers of children around 4 months of age should focus on counselling on complementary feeding. We find that all mothers know 'what' to give to the child but 'how much', 'when' and in 'what consistency' need to be explained with respect to complementary feeding. Intervention strategies to reduce screen time are needed," he said. The NFHS results of 17 states and five Union Territories have been released now as phase-one. The phase-two results covering other states will be released next year, the health ministry had said. The present NFHS was conducted on 6.1 lakh sample households, involving household-level interviews to collect information on population, health, family planning and nutrition-related indicators.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-survey-finds-drastic-rise-in-obesity-among-kids-under-5-years-in-20-states-926911.html

Nadda, who has embarked on a 120-day nationwide tour to after becoming party chief, said he had got the Covid-19 test done after experiencing some initial symptoms. “I am in good health. Following doctors’ advice, I am following all Covid-19 protocol in home isolation. I appeal to the people who came in contact with me in recent days to isolate themselves and get tested,” the 60-year-old Nadda said on Twitter. As part of his nationwide tour, Nadda had visited his home state Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Nadda had returned to the capital after a visit to West Bengal where his convoy was attacked, allegedly by Trinamool Congress workers, leading to a face-off between the Centre and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.   कोरोना के शुरूआती लक्षण दिखने पर मैंने टेस्ट करवाया और रिपोर्ट पॉजिटिव आई है। मेरी तबीयत ठीक है, डॉक्टर्स की सलाह पर होम आइसोलेशन में सभी दिशा- निर्देशो का पालन कर रहा हूँ। मेरा अनुरोध है, जो भी लोग गत कुछ दिनों में संपर्क में आयें हैं, कृपया स्वयं को आइसोलेट कर अपनी जाँच करवाएं।||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-president-jp-nadda-tests-covid-19-positive-isolates-self-at-home-926922.html

Johnson said that this in his address to the Climate Ambition Summit this weekend, co-hosted by the UK to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement. In his speech to the virtual summit, which was earlier addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi among around 70 heads of state and government, the British prime minister reiterated the UK’s pledge to radically cut dependence on fossil fuels. “We’re going ahead with a massive solar programme, even though we can’t hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, Australia or Morocco for instance,” he said. “Today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon-friendly way of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity… Hydro of course – we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of uses,” he said. The summit, held as a precursor to the UK’s hosting of the United Nations’ COP26 summit in November 2021, included addresses urging the world’s economies to "stop the assault" on the planet and increase their ambition on cutting the greenhouse gases that drive climate change. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned leaders that the world was heading for a "catastrophic" 3 degrees Celsius of warming, as he urged them to declare a state of climate emergency in their countries until they become carbon neutral. "Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes," said Alok Sharma, the UK's Business Secretary and President of COP26. “But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough," he said. Earlier on Saturday, Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would "save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs" as the UK announced an end to support for the fossil fuel sector overseas. Described as a significant move as in the last four years, the UK government supported 21 billion pounds of UK oil and gas exports through trade promotion and export finance. The new policy will be implemented after a short period of consultation and is intended to come into force as soon as possible before COP26 next year. "Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere – against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the Promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming," said Johnson. The UK had recently also announced a new commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The UK claims this means its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement is now among the highest in the world and commits the country to cut emissions at one of the fastest rates of any major economy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uk-pm-praises-india-s-incredible-solar-power-strides-at-climate-summit-926934.html

His firm that is manufacturing Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine candidates Covidshield, is expecting to receive emergency use authorisation by end of December 2020. Speaking at The Economic Times Global Business Summit, Poonawalla said, "By this month-end, we might get an emergency licence for the coronavirus vaccine, but the actual licence for wider use might come in at a later date. But we are confident that if the regulators give a nod, India’s vaccination drive can start by January 2021." “Once 20% of India gets the coronavirus vaccine, we can hopefully see the confidence and sentiments coming back, and by September-October next year hopefully there will be enough vaccines for everyone and normal life can return,” Poonawalla added. Last week, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC), a panel of experts on vaccines, asked the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech for more late-stage safety and efficacy data from their ongoing clinical trials. The panel is going through applications by three firms for emergency use authorisation of their Covid-19 vaccine candidates in India. The SEC specifically asked SII for immunogenicity data from its UK clinical trials and India, and the outcome of the assessment made by the UK regulatory authority regarding its emergency use authorisation application. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows 70 per cent efficacy against symptomatic Covid-19. It has efficacy of 62 per cent for trial subjects given two full doses, and 90 per cent efficacy in those given a half, and then a full dose.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-vaccination-may-start-in-january-2021-expect-normal-life-by-october-adar-poonawalla-926935.html

13-12-2020||National||Delhi High Court denies bail to doctor in medical negligence case||The Delhi High Court has declined bail to a 70-year-old general surgeon who "transgressed" his field and performed surgery for medical termination of pregnancy upon a woman, resulting into her death. Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri lent credence to the findings of the Delhi Medical Council (DMC) that the accused doctor Suresh Chandra Gupta was not a qualified obstetrician and gynaecologist, and still performed the surgery when there was no urgency as the pregnancy was only 19-20 weeks old. Acting on a complaint, the DMC conducted disciplinary proceedings and found the doctor concerned, along with others, as guilty of medical negligence. The regulatory body confirmed the findings of the disciplinary proceedings, which recommended removing the name of the doctor from the list of registered practitioners for a period of 180 days. The DMC had opined that the doctor, who is a postgraduate in the field of surgery, transgressed into the field of gynaecology by doing a procedure for which he is not trained and went beyond his knowledge, skill and competence. The court rejected his "bald assertion" that no doctor ought to be arrested in a case of medical negligence. The patient, 31-year-old Poonam Joshi, was admitted to R P Memorial Hospital here with 20 weeks pregnancy on July 8, 2015. She was diagnosed as a case of four months amenorrhea with placenta previa with bleeding and taken up for hysterotomy. She was referred to the Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital on July 9, 2015, at 12.30 am, where she breathed her last. The petitioner doctor, for his part, said the FIR in the case was lodged in 2015 and he has been arrested on November 18, 2020. He said he was 70-year-old and otherwise qualified as a medical surgeon and performed the surgery at the request of the hospital concerned. The court, however, said it did not find any ground to allow bail to the petitioner. "Keeping in mind recommendations of the disciplinary committee, which stand confirmed by DMC, this court is of the prima facie view that there is reasonable ground to believe that the petitioner has committed the offence. Further, it has been stated that the investigation is still pending and the charge sheet is yet to be filed," the court said, denying him the bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-high-court-denies-bail-to-doctor-in-medical-negligence-case-926949.html

As protests against the farm laws entered the 18th day, farmers also decided to observe a day-long hunger strike on Monday.  On Sunday, farmers took out a protest march on the Delhi-Jaipur highway.  With no end in sight to the agitation, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar met a group of farmers from Uttarakhand who declared support for the farm laws — the third such group to call on the minister over the past one week. Earlier, farmers from Haryana had called on Tomar and backed farm laws. Farmers belonging to the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), who had moved the Supreme Court against the farm laws, met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday night and called off their protests that had blocked the Delhi-UP border at Noida. Tomar and junior minister for Commerce Som Parkash met Home Minister Amit Shah with a group of BJP leaders from Punjab to assess the political situation in the state, which has turned the epicentre of protests. “The government is bringing its agents and presenting them as farmers with the intention to create a divide,” Gurnam Singh Chadhuni, president of the Haryana unit of Bhartiya Kisan Union, said. Kejriwal to fast with farmers today Announcing that he will sit on a day-long fast in solidarity with farmers on Monday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has asked the Centre to “shun arrogance” and repeal the three contentious laws besides bringing in a bill to guarantee MSP for agriculture produce. Kejriwal also found fault with Union ministers and BJP leaders depicting the protesters as “anti-nationals” asking them whether they considered former soldiers, national and international sportsperson and others supporting farmers were such people. Responding to a call given by farmers, he said he will hold a day-long fast and urged AAP workers as well as the people to join in solidarity. “I will be fasting on Monday. I know many people whose hearts are with the protesting farmers,” he said. “I want to appeal to the Central government to put an end to their ego. The governments are formed by the public, the public is not formed by the governments. The three farm laws should be immediately repealed and the farmers should be given guaranteed MSPs, and a new bill should be passed on it. All the demands of the farmers should be accepted without any condition as soon as possible,” he said. He said the BJP believes that the protest comprises only a few farmers from Punjab and Haryana and that it was a "misconception".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-accuse-modi-govt-of-dividing-them-to-observe-hunger-strike-against-farm-laws-926952.html

Delivering the second Manohar Parrikar memorial lecture, Jaishankar also said that as India expands its global interests and reach, there is an even more compelling case to focus on its hard power. The external affairs minister said the national security challenges being faced by the "rising India" are obviously going to be different and emphasised on having greater integration and convergence between the foreign and military policies. In a veiled reference to Pakistan, Jaishankar said a long-standing political rivalry is today expressed as sustained cross border terrorism by a neighbour even as he enumerated security challenges emanating from long borders as well as large maritime spaces. "The world is a competitive place and India's rise will evoke its own reactions and responses. There will be attempts to dilute our influence and limit our interests. Some of these contestations can be directly in the security domain, others could be reflected in economics, connectivity even in societal context," he said. The external affairs minister, delving into the broad spectrum of security challenges facing India, said it cannot disregard attempts to undermine the national integrity and unity. "There are really very few major states that still have unsettled borders to the extent that we do. Of equal relevance is the very very unique challenge that we face of years of intense terrorism inflicted on us by a neighbour. We also cannot disregard attempts to undermine our national integrity and unity," he said.   "And over and above these exceptional factors, there are the daily security challenges of long borders and large sea spaces. The thinking and planning of a polity that operates in such an uncertain environment naturally should give primacy to hard security," he said. Jaishankar further said the era of "unconstrained military conflicts" may be behind us but the reality of limited wars and coercive diplomacy is still very much a fact of life. Talking about India's growing global stature, Jaishankar said the country's "relationship with the world" cannot be the same as when its ranking was much lower. "Our stakes in the world have certainly become higher and correspondingly so have the expectations of us. Simply put India matters more and our world view must process that in all its aspects," he said. He added: "On the big global issues of our times, whether we speak of climate change or trade flows or health concerns or data security, India's positioning has more influence on the eventual outcome." Jaishankar also elaborated on "conceptual changes" witnessed in Indian foreign policy since 2014 and said much of that was influenced by the growing understanding of the different world. In terms of the neighbourhood first policy, he said the new approach envisaged a generous and non-reciprocal engagement of neighbours that was centred around connectivity, contacts and cooperation. He said the "enhanced importance" of India to the daily life of its neighbourhood will clearly build stronger regionalism but added that it was also one that is clearly predicated on mutual sensitivity and mutual respect for each other's interests. The external affairs minister also talked about evolving geo-political developments around the world including the salience of China, repositioning of the US, Brexit, intra-European Union politics, the Abraham accords signed by Israel, the challenges faced by Africa and the evolution of the Indo-Pacific. "We have actually seen sharp shifts in the basic stance and behaviour of nations and their interplay with each other. Some of these have unfolded more visibly in the last year, but its contours were evident even before. "The salience of China and repositioning of the US are perhaps two sharpest examples. But there are many others of great consequences, whether we speak of Brexit or intra EU politics, the Abraham accords and the dynamics of the Gulf, the challenges faced by Africa, the ideological debates we have seen in Latin America, or the evolution of the Indo-Pacific, each of these are in their own way reflection of larger rebalancing and emergence of multipolarity," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-rise-will-evoke-its-own-reactions-and-responses-says-external-affairs-minister-s-jaishankar-926953.html

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, (IRCTC), a railway PSU, emailed to its customers the 47-page booklet -- 'PM Modi and his government's special relationship with Sikh” -- as part of the government's 'public interest' outreach to make people aware of the bills and also to squash myths about them, officials said. The booklets are in Hindi, English, and Punjabi. The emails, which were discontinued on December 12, were sent to the entire database of IRCTC, where passengers key in their details while booking tickets, the officials said. The PSU denied reports that the emails had been sent to only members of the Sikh community. "The mails have been sent to all, irrespective of any particular community. This is not the first instance. Earlier also such activities have been undertaken by IRCTC to promote government welfare schemes in the public interest,” an official statement from IRCTC said. "IRCTC sent out 1.9 crore emails in five days till October 12,” a source in the national transporter said. Officials also said that the move to send out the emails was a conscious choice as part of a communication strategy for the public interest. “Which professional company or corporate doesn't analyse the demographic profile of the audience where the communication is to be delivered to? Why are some surprised if a government organisation is able to do as much or even better than what the corporates do day in and day out? One should be happy that the government of the day is as good in disseminating information in the public interest," said an official. The booklet speaks of the justice given to the 1984 riot victims, FCRA registration granted to Sri Harmandir Sahib, Jallianwala Bagh Memorial, no taxes on langar, the Kartarpur corridor among other things under 13 heads. The booklet was released by Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Hardeep Singh Puri on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti on December 1. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws has failed to cut ice with the protesting farmers who have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the legislations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/irctc-sends-out-nearly-2-crore-emails-in-5-days-highlighting-modis-relationship-with-sikh-community-926954.html

Tomar, who is leading negotiations with the 40 protesting farmer unions to break the deadlock, was addressing a delegation of over 100 farmers from Uttarakhand who came to extend their support to the laws. Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary and Uttarakhand Education Minister Arvind Pandey were present in the meeting. Addressing the delegation, Tomar said the government faced opposition when it revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. It also faced opposition when it brought the amended citizenship law as well as over the Ram temple issue. "When the agricultural reforms were brought, there was opposition to this too.... There are some people who just oppose and weaken the country. This has become their nature," the agriculture minister said. On agricultural sector reforms, the discussion has been going on for last many years, Tomar said. "Unfortunately the previous governments who wanted to reform were not able to it. Since they could not try, they did get the credit," he added. Tomar stressed that for a new India, reforms are necessary. "When reforms are undertaken it will benefit farmers in the long run. But in the short run, some may face difficulty. We know we can achieve no gain without difficulties," the minister said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn't bring reform or schemes for the sake of current impact alone but for long-term benefit, Tomar said. "Any good government or good leader is one who does such work that not only ensures the country's safety for now but also boosts growth in the next hundred years," the minister said. The prime minister has fulfilled the long-pending demand of farmers, Tomar said. Farmers leaders like Sharad Joshi of Shetkari Sangathan, Punjab's Bhupinder Mann, NCP chief Sharad Pawar have been talking about these issues, he said, adding that agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan too raised this issue. National Farmers Commission, Planning Commission and Niti Aayog also raised these issues but the previous governments did not do, he said. "Manmohan Singh Ji (former Prime Minister) tried many times but could not do. Today when it is implemented, propaganda is being spread," Tomar said. Meanwhile, Tomar met Union Home Minister Amit Shah amid farmers' protest. The deadlock continues between the central government and protesting farmers on three new farm laws. Farmer unions, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, say that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system under which government agencies buy their crop at an assured price. In its proposal to farmers on Wednesday, the Centre had said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation. Thousands of farmers have been staying put at Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) -- for two weeks against the Centre's new farm laws. On Thursday, the government had asked farmer groups to reconsider its proposals for amending the Acts to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want, but protesters remained defiant. Tomar had on Friday said some "anti-social elements" were conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers and appealed to the protesting farming community to be vigilant against their platform being misused. At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the central government and representatives of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws and repeatedly rejecting the Centre's offer to make some changes in law and give written assurances or clarifications on a few issues such as MSP and mandi systems.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tomar-targets-opposition-parties-over-farmers-stir-says-it-has-become-their-nature-to-oppose-926958.html

Rewari's Superintendent of Police Abhishek Jorwal told reporters at the site that district authorities had imposed Section 144 of the CrPC banning assembly of five or more people. "We have set up barricades and we will try to stop them here," he said, adding, besides adequate force of the Haryana police, three companies of paramilitary personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order. The farmers were sitting in protest at Jaisinghpur Kheda area in Rewari along Rajasthan-Haryana border (NH-48). Gurgaon is over 70 km from the site while Delhi is nearly 80 km away. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, who was at the site, said since the barricades have been put, the farmers had no option but to stage a sit-in. A farmer from Rajasthan who was among those who wanted to march to Delhi against the Centre's new farm laws said they will "force the government to rollback the anti-peasant legislations." Earlier, the farmers had threatened to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a fortnight demanding repeal of the new farm laws. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-stage-sit-in-protest-on-a-side-of-delhi-jaipur-nation-highway-as-haryana-cops-put-up-barricades-926959.html

Issuing notice to the two social media platforms and the person who uploaded the videos and seeking their replies to the GCMMF's suit, Justice Mukta Gupta refrained from passing any interim order directing removal of the videos, titled "Unholy Cattle of India: Exposing Cruelty in the Indian Dairy Industry", from YouTube and Facebook. The court asked the person, who uploaded the video, to indicate in his reply how the GCMMF or its members were indulging in cruelty to cows and why Amul's mascot was used in the video. With the direction, the court listed the matter for hearing on January 15, 2021. The GCMMF, in its suit, has sought the removal of the videos from YouTube and Facebook, claiming that the person who has uploaded those is targeting it. The suit has contended that the videos uploaded by defendant Nitin Jain "were slanderous and disparaged and denigrated the Amul brand and trademark". Jain's lawyers -- senior advocate Raj Panjwani and advocates Supriya Juneja and Priyanka Bangari -- told the court that the Amul trademark was not being used by their client for commercial purposes. Taking note of the defendant's stand and the fact that the videos were in public domain since 2018, the court said it was not passing any ad interim injunction and was giving Jain an opportunity to file his reply. "Along with the reply affidavit, the defendant 1 (Jain) will also state whether it obtains any profits out of the videos uploaded and if yes, the statement of accounts thereof," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amul-cow-video-row-delhi-high-court-seeks-reply-of-uploader-google-facebook-926964.html

Tata Motors had built a factory for the world's cheapest car, Nano, at Singur in Hooghly district, but the project was abandoned and shifted to Gujarat following a massive agitation by the farmers, led by Banerjee and her party, the Trinamool Congress, in 2006-2007. Admitting that he had also taken part in the 2006 Singur movement during his Trinamool Congress days, Roy, who was once Banerjee's right-hand man and had joined the saffron party in 2017, told a press conference here that driving away from the Nanomanufacturing plant out of West Bengal was the "biggest blunder" and this acted as a deterrent for other industrialists too. The project was moved to the western state on the invitation of the then chief minister Narendra Modi. The anti-land acquisition movement at Singur and Nandigram had catapulted Banerjee and her TMC to power in the state in 2011, ending a 34-year-long Left regime. Roy also highlighted the state government's alleged failure in attracting investments into the state despite hosting several global business summits. "The chief Minister held several global investment summits over the last nine years, but no investment has come to the state for setting up industries, while those who have units in the state, are being compelled to move base owing to syndicate raj," Roy told reporters here. He dared Banerjee to release a white paper giving details of the amount spent in organising the business conclaves and the investments made in the state during these nine years. "I know that my top leadership may not agree, but I feel that Article 356 should be immediately imposed in West Bengal to restore democracy," the BJP national vice president said. He also expressed confidence that the saffron party will win the Assembly elections in the state, due in April-May 2021. Noting that it was his personal opinion, the BJP leader said, 136 BJP workers have been killed so far in the Trinamool Congress-ruled state. Roy accused the police of serving the interests of the ruling party instead of acting neutrally and providing protection to law-abiding people. Unveiling a job opportunities assurance card for the youth of the state, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state president and Bishnupur MP Soumitra Khan said, instead of providing employment to people, the chief minister is asking young men and women to sell chops and fries for a living. "We will provide job avenues to the youth," he said. The BJYM will register the names of young persons for the purpose which, Khan said, will also provide an idea about the number of jobless men and women in the state. Khan claimed that at present, bomb making is the only industry in the state. Asserting that the saffron party will win the 2021 elections, he said that the BJYM will distribute cards to 75 lakh youths in the state for providing job opportunities in the next five years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mamata-banerjee-failed-to-fulfil-her-promise-of-providing-jobs-mukul-roy-926967.html

The verbal spat commenced on the eve of the two-day winter session of the Maharashtra legislature, which the saffron Opposition claimed has been curtailed to avoid debate on crucial issues including the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the state. The saffron party boycotted the customary tea meeting hosted by the government berore the session, saying that the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress dispensation has failed on all fronts and are scrapping the decisions of the previous BJP-led government. Spearheading the charge, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP said that the the MVA government is repeatedly taking what he described as “Tuglaqui-decisions” and muzzling the voice of dissent. “We do not agree with whatever Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami say, but is this the way you target those who speak against you… anyone who is speaking against the government is being targeted….there seems to be undeclared Emergency,” said Fadnavis, a former Chief Minister. According to him, his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar is also being targeted in wake of Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank Limited. However, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray immediately shot back, asking: “Who among the Cabinet colleagues have said anything against him (Darekar)…or is it so that Fadnavis is suggesting something.” Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that the Opposition leaders including Fadnavis, Darekar and state BJP President Chandrakant Patil are looking demoralized. Thackeray rejected the charge of “undeclared Emergency”, and went on to add: “Is what is happening in New Delhi is declared Emergency…farmers are protesting for over a fortnight now….you call them Khalistani…Pakistani…and you import onions from Pakistan….you call them terrorists, naxalites….they are ‘annadata’…what is this?…if you make such comments, you don’t have the right to call yourself human.” According to him, not allowing discissions is “Tuglaqui”.  "The farmers should be brought to the negotiating table and the issue should be resolved," he said. “They (BJP over the last one year has been predicting when the (MVA) government will fall…they have not seen what work we have done,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/war-of-words-between-mva-govt-bjp-over-tuglaqi-decisions-and-undeclared-emergency-926970.html

Speaking at an event as part of his campaign, Kamal Haasan said “honesty” is the only promise that he wishes to give to the people in return for their votes in the assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. Taking a dig at the Dravidian majors who have been ruling the state since 1967, Kamal Haasan said the degradation of Madurai is an example of their governance. “In January, the bulls will engage in Jallikattu. In May, we will engage in a fight with unworthy people (political parties). I am ready. You also get ready. We will transform Madurai. It is our duty to establish Madurai as the second capital of Tamil Nadu when we come to power,” Kamal Haasan said. His comments come months after members of the ruling AIADMK demanded that Madurai be turned into the second capital of the state for the convenience of the people. Though Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar floated the idea of a second capital, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said there was no such proposal before the government. He also asked people to get ready to embrace “political change” while promising to deliver governance at the doorsteps of the people. “When people come to your homes asking for your votes, why should you go to them for development? It should come to you at your doorstep. I will be your tool in bringing about political change,” the actor said. Kamal Haasan, who launched MNM in 2018, is the chief ministerial candidate of the party, which scored over 3.5 percentage votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. His party projects itself as an alternative to the Dravidian majors -- DMK and AIADMK, making the 2021 election ground a crowded affair. To a question whether his party-led government will implement prohibition, Kamal Haasan said he would not promise things that are not feasible. “It is a fact that liquor came into being when agriculture came into being. I am against the government selling liquor through a corporation led by IAS officers,” he said, while promising to revert to the pre-2002 policy of handing over sale of liquor to the private sector. TASMAC, which sells liquor in Tamil Nadu, is a state-owned company.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-work-towards-establishing-madurai-as-second-capital-of-tamil-nadu-kamal-haasan-926973.html

Baghel made the remarks in Korea district of the state on Saturday in response to reporters' query about Pandey's statement that the Congress government led by him was busy singing and dancing during the last two years of its rule. Baghel said, "What was Saroj Pandey ji doing with the then Chief Minister Raman Singh ji and then state Assembly Speaker Dharamlal Kaushik ji in sua dance function in Durg stadium? Sua folk dance in Chhattisgarh is performed by women." "She (Pandey) was not setting a world record, but was twisting waist with the (then) CM. Sua dance is performed by women and what was the need of the CM to dance there?" he said. Condemning his remarks, state BJP spokesperson Rajesh Munat said it reflected his "ill mentality" and added that he should apologise to women. "Baghel should maintain the dignity of his post and avoid using such derogatory language. He has insulted the folk dance form and cultural and spiritual importance associated with it," he alleged. Baghel will complete two years in office on December 17.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-seeks-bhupesh-baghels-apology-for-remarks-about-partys-woman-mp-926984.html

The Railway Board, in a directive to all general managers, has said that the working of Indian Railways has been increasingly shifting to ICT platform. Therefore, it has become necessary to secure the ICT infrastructure in order to safeguard critical information. “It has been observed that, in recent times, an alarming increase has been seen in the number of breaches/attempted breaches to ICT infrastructure of Govt Organisations. The Government of India, at the highest level, is also seized of the need for adequately and appropriately securing the ICT infrastructure. “It has, therefore, been decided that certain strength of officials from each Railway Unit with aptitude in ICT hardware, software, networking and compliances may be identified for forming the group for that Unit, to begin with. This group would work under the overall supervision of the nominated CISO (chief information security officer) of the Railway Unit,” the order stated. The prime minister during a presentation on the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020 on September 1 this year had directed that "every ministry has some personnel with technical aptitudes. These are to be identified and trained in Cyber Security Courses within six months. These should then form the cyber security nucleus of that Ministry.” In recent times, the railways has had to deal with a slew of cases in which illegal applications were used to book tickets, bypassing the railway firewall. While many such gangs have been busted by the RPF, newer technology automatically replace those that have been busted. Recently, a meeting was convened by the Secretary (Security) in the Cabinet Secretariat to firm up the road-map for implementation of the prime minister's directive, the order from the Railway Board stated. The minutes of the meeting on the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020 stated that these officials will be trained in both practical and theoretical aspects of cyber security through a course prepared by Miety of around six to eight hours, For advanced training, officers who are technically qualified or with requisite aptitude in cyber security or information technology will be identified. The training, according to the note, should enable officers to “troubleshoot”. The Railway Board has also allotted nominations for each railway unit. While the zonal railways have been assigned eight such officers each for generic training and four for the advanced course, rail PSUs have four each nominated for its regular training courses and two for advanced. The railways' IT arm CRIS and the Railway Board has 20 nominated spots for generic training and ten for the advanced classes each. Each railway unit has been asked to identify officers for these courses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-identify-officers-with-technical-aptitude-for-training-as-online-troubleshooters-926986.html

Previous five rounds of talks between the central government and representatives of 40 farmer unions remained inconclusive. The sixth round of talks did not take place after farmer leaders rejected the government's draft proposal to amend certain provisions of the farm laws and declined to participate in the meeting. The government has made it clear that it is ready for discussion anytime. But the farmer unions have said they would come for talks only if the laws are repealed. Asked when the government will hold the next round of meeting, Chaudhary told PTI, "The meeting will be called soon. We are ready for discussion. But the date has not been finalised." The government will find "some solution" to end the deadlock. "We have full confidence. In the next meeting, the issue will be resolved," he noted. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Agriculture, said senior ministers Amit Shah and Narendra Singh Tomar are holding discussions on the issue. Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-to-soon-hold-next-round-of-talks-with-protesting-farmers-to-end-stalemate-kailash-choudhary-927009.html

It hits hard without hesitation to secure India's interests,” Thakur, the Minister of State for Finance, who is also the BJP's in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir DDC elections, said. Addressing an election rally in R S Pura here, he said, “In 2001, India's temple of democracy was attacked by terrorists who were neutralised by brave security forces who fought the coward terrorists with valour." “The terrorists and its sympathisers wanted India to bleed. However, as we begin a new journey under Prime Minister Modi today by building a new temple of democracy, the new Parliament building, let me remind everyone that this marks a turning point in history,” he said. He said that the BJP has a new outlook for New India, where there is zero-tolerance for terrorists and their sympathisers. Training his guns on BJP’s political rivals, especially Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration comprising seven mainstream parties including National Conference and PDP, he said, “The Gupkar Gangs era of supporting separatists and shedding tears for terrorists is over forever.” “The Modi government has strengthened national security and modernised the armed forces. Today India has Rafales and our jawans have bulletproof vests and bunkers to face the enemy fire,” he said. He said, “India now looks into enemies’ eyes and does not hesitate in launching counter-terror operations to protect Indian lives”. “We have smooth inter-services coordination with the setting up of the Chief of Defense Staff. We have stronger firepower, air defence, and surveillance systems in place. India strikes on its own terms, fearlessly,” he said. Questioning the rationale behind forming the Gupkar alliance, Thakur asked, “Why should the sons of daughters of J&K become victims of terror while Gupkar Gang family members live a life of luxury abroad?” “Why do they never talk about the human rights of the parents, children and youths of J&K? Is humanity reserved only for the family members of the Gupkar Gang?” he asked. Thakur said since the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, the Gupkar leaders have become desperate as they considered J&K their “personal estate” and that era has come to an end. “The people have given them a befitting reply by coming out in large numbers to cast their votes, neither is there an atmosphere of fear nor fraud. The divisive politics by the Gupkar Gang who are hand in glove with separatists is coming to an end,” he said. “The Gupkar Gang has never believed in participatory democracy or public welfare,” he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-under-pm-narendra-modi-is-fearless-anurag-thakur-927023.html

"She (Mamata Banerjee) has come to understand that this is India and not Pakistan. Hindus are prepared to protect India. They will give a befitting reply (to her). BJP will win the Assembly polls in that state and there will be a Hindu raj in West Bengal," Thakur told reporters here. "She is frustrated because she has realised that her rule is about to end," the BJP MP said. "She has gone mad," Thakur added. In other controversial remarks, the Lok Sabha member from Bhopal cited dharmashastras (religious texts), claiming a 'shudra' (fourth and lowest of the traditional varnas as per these scriptures) feels bad for lack of understanding. "A kshatriya doesn't feel bad if we call them kshatriya. A brahmin doesn't feel bad if we call them brahmin. A vaishya doesn't feel bad if we call them vaishya. But a shudra feels bad if we call them shudra, what is the reason? Because they don't understand," Thakur said. The BJP MP is no stranger to courting controversies. The 2008 Malegaon blast accused, who defeated former MP chief minister Digvijaya Singh by over 3.64 lakh votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, has regularly remained in the news for her provocative statements. Despite a reprimand in May last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Thakur continues make controversial remarks on sensitive topics. Thakur referred to Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as a deshbhakt (patriot) during a debate in Lok Sabha, triggering a protest by opposition members.

Gen Naravane, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on the second leg of his two-nation visit that included the United Arab Emirates, is the first-ever head of the Indian Army to travel to the two strategically important Gulf countries. "COAS discussed issues of bilateral defence cooperation with General Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir, Commander Royal Saudi Land Forces," the Indian Army's Additional Directorate General of Public Information said in a tweet on Sunday. He also received a Guard of Honour at headquarters of the Royal Saudi Land Forces. Gen Naravane also called on Chief of General Staff Gen. Fayyadh bin Hamid Al-Ruwaili and discussed issues of mutual interest and defence cooperation, it said in another tweet. "During the meeting, they discussed issues of common interest in addition to means of enhancing bilateral cooperation," state-run Saudi Press agency reported Gen Naravane also interacted with Lt Gen Mutlaq bin Salim bin Al-Azima, the Commander of the Joint Forces of Saudi Arabia, and exchanged views on defence cooperation, the Indian Army said in a tweet. Gen Naravane earlier visited the UAE where he discussed bilateral defence cooperation and issues of mutual interest with the UAE's Commander of the Land Forces Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri. His visit is seen as a reflection of India's growing strategic ties with the two countries and is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere. Gen Naravane's visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel's relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran's top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Ahead of his visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Army said in a statement in New Delhi that "During the visit, he will be meeting his counterparts and senior military leadership of these countries. The visit is historic in the sense that it will be the first time an Indian Army chief is visiting the UAE and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Gen. Naravane's visit to the Gulf region comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's trips to Bahrain and the UAE during which he called on top leaders of the two countries. In the last few years, India's ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE have witnessed a major upswing. Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone. In October, Gen. Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-gen-naravane-begins-two-day-rare-visit-to-saudi-arabia-927029.html

Seeking to liken the proposed construction of the new edifice to the centuries old Great Wall of China, he claimed that 'thousands of people perished' during its construction, but the dragon nation rulers said the wall was to 'guard' the people. "To protect whom is a new Parliament building being constructed at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore when half of India is hungry due to the coronavirus pandemic triggered loss of livelihoods,' the Makkal Needhi Maiam leader asked in a tweet. சீனப்பெருஞ்சுவர் கட்டும் பணியில் ஆயிரக்கணக்கான மக்கள் மடிந்து போனார்கள். மக்களைக் காக்கத்தான் இந்தச் சுவர் என்றார்கள் மன்னர்கள். கொரோனாவால் வாழ்வாதாரம் இழந்து பாதி இந்தியா பட்டினி கிடக்கையில்,ஆயிரம் கோடியில் பாராளுமன்றம் கட்டுவது யாரைக்காக்க?(1/2) 'Answer honourable elected Prime Minister,' he said hours before kick-starting the first phase of his campaign for the Assembly polls from Madurai in southern Tamil Nadu.

The trend of registering more daily recoveries than the daily cases has led to a continuous contraction of India's active caseload, which presently stands at 3,56,546 as on date. While 30,254 persons were found to be Covid-19 positive in the country in a span of 24 hours, 33,136 new recoveries were registered during the same period. This has led to a net decline of 3,273 cases from the total active caseload in a day, the ministry said.

13-12-2020||National Politics||PM should clarify on remarks of Danve, Goyal, says NCP||The NCP on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify the claims of some Union ministers that the ongoing farmers' protest against the new agri laws has the backing of Pakistan, China and Maoists. NCP spokesman Mahesh Tapase said instead of sympathetically considering demands of the protesting farmers, Union ministers Raosaheb Danve and Piyush Goyal have made "controversial remarks to discredit the agitation". "Danve said the protest has the backing of Pakistan and China, while Goyal has alleged that Maoists are supporting the stir. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify if these claims are true," Tapase said in a statement. He said cultivators are demanding that the new farm laws be withdrawn, but the government is unrelenting. Goyal on Saturday said the agitation no longer remains a farmers' movement as it has been "infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements" demanding the release of those put behind bars for "anti-national activities". This was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government, he said. Danve a few days back stirred a controversy with his remarks that China and Pakistan were behind the protests being staged by cultivators, inviting sharp reactions from various quarters. Farmers have been protesting against the the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-should-clarify-on-remarks-of-danve-goyal-says-ncp-926874.html

With Assembly polls due in the state in April-May next year, the BJP Bengal minder appealed to the Election Commission to ensure free and fair elections, saying there should not be any place for fear and violence. "Mamata Banerjee knows that the land under her feet has slipped and so she is trying to return to power in the state on the strength of violence. "I urge the Election Commission to deploy central forces from now itself in order to put an end to the prevailing atmosphere of political violence and terror in the state," Vijayvargiya told newspersons here at Santiniketan in Birbhum district. The ruling TMC and the BJP have been engaged in a war of words over the attack on BJP national president J P Nadda's convoy by alleged TMC supporters when he was travelling to Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district from Kolkata on Thursday. The three officers -- Bholanath Pandey (SP, Diamond Harbour), Praveen Tripathi (DIG, Presidency Range) and Rajeev Mishra (ADG, South Bengal) -- were responsible for the security of the BJP chief during his December 9-10 visit to the state. The MHA's move came a day after the Mamata Banerjee government defiantly rejected summonses to state chief secretary and police chief to appear before Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla to tender explanation for the attack on Nadda's motorcade that left several BJP leaders and workers injured and their vehicles damaged. The TMC has alleged that the orders are politically motivated. On Sunday, the BJP national general secretary met Visva Bharati Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty to discuss details about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's virtual programme to mark the foundation day of the central university on December 24. The foundation of Visva Bharati was laid during a special ceremony at Santiniketan on December 22, 1918. Vijayvargiya was accompanied by BJP leader Anupam Hazra during the discussion with the VC. Later Vijayvargiya told reporters, "The PM, who is the Chancellor of Visva Bharati founded by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, is slated to address the programme virtually. We discussed the modalities. It was an informal meeting." Visva Bharati authorities on Saturday decided to organise the programme on December 24 where West Bengal governor, Union education minister and state chief minister will be invited and the PM will virtually inaugurate it, varsity sources said. Vijayvargiya came to Bolpur to oversee arrangements before Union Home Minister Amit Shah's proposed visit to the town next week ahead of the programme organised by the university, BJP sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/central-forces-should-be-deployed-immediately-in-bengal-vijayvargiya-926887.html

Prasad, who is the Union Minister for Law and Justice, made the assertion while launching Bihar BJP's state-wide "Kisan Chaupal Sammelan" (farmers' conference) in support of the three agricultural Acts at Tekbigha village in Bakhtiarpur assembly constituency of Patna district. "They (those protesting farm laws) are saying that they will not withdraw their movement unless and until these laws are withdrawn. We would like to say that Narendra Modi government respects farmers, but would like to make it clear that stern action will be taken against 'tukde tukde gang' taking advantage of farmers' movement," Prasad said. "I want to ask who are these people who are talking the language of breaking the country...Now demands are being raised to free those so-called intellectuals who are in jails for indulging in rioting in Delhi and Maharashtra. "Police have filed charge sheets, they are not able to obtain bail from the court as trials are underway. Now these people have taken refuge under farmers' movement for their interest but we will not allow them to succeed in their goal," Prasad said while addressing the 'Kisan chaupal sammelan'. Union Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also earlier asked protesting farmers to be vigilant against misuse of their platform by the "anti-social" as well as the "Leftist and Maoist" elements conspiring to spoil the atmosphere. He had said this on Friday after photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral. Food, Railway and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal has been more direct in his charge, alleging that certain Leftist and Maoist elements seem to have taken "control" of the agitation and rather than discussing on farmer issues, they seem to be having some other agenda. As per the Bihar BJP's programme, similar conferences will be held at the district level and chaupals (meetings) in every assembly constituency till December 25, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The pro-agri Acts meetings across Bihar will be attended by various union and state ministers. The conference was also attended by Bihar BJP president and MP Sanjay Jaiswal, MLAs Gyanendra Singh Gyanu, Sanjeev Chaurasia and a host of other leaders. Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of the big corporates. The Centre has maintained that MSP and Mandi mechanisms will stay. Prasad asserted that the three agri laws have been enacted to benefit farmers, especially small and marginal ones, across the country and wondered as why the opposition parties and farmers of Punjab are agitating against the laws which will free the farmers from shackles of Mandi system as they can sell their produce anywhere in the country. "The laws give the farmers opportunity to sell their produce either in Mandi or in PACS or outside the realm of mandi, PACS or Vyapar Mandal...I just want to ask whether or not farmers be given such freedom or opportunity. It is beyond ones fathom as they are opposing the laws," he said. The minister cited examples of farmers of Kishanganj and Aurangabad in Bihar making good money by selling one lakh MT of pineapple and 200 MT of strawberry to the traders from Kolkata, respectively. "Why should makhana (gorgon nut) of north Bihar be sold only locally and not be given access to global market?" he asked. As per the farm law, those entering into agreements with farmers can neither sell nor lease out or mortgage the land of farmers, Prasad asserted while adding that companies (entering into agreement) will provide quality seeds, technique to farmers, buy their produce and finally farmers getting money sitting at home. If any company was found indulging in irregularities with farmers or harassing them, then both the Narendra Modi government at Centre and Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, which are firmly standing behind farmers, will send such erring person to jail, the minister said. Speaking on the occasion, Jaiswal said that there is a "conspiracy" behind the farmers movement which is hugely participated by cultivators of Punjab alone. "This conspiracy needs to be exposed", he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-govt-to-deal-sternly-with-tukde-tukde-gang-trying-to-take-advantage-of-farmers-stir-ravi-shankar-prasad-926936.html
13-12-2020||National Politics||Centre reaches out to farmers backing farm laws; protesters cry foul||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has started reaching out to farmers supporting agriculture sector reforms, prompting the agitating farmers to accuse the government of creating a divide amongst them even as protests against the farm laws entered the 18th day on Sunday. Agitating farmers took out a protest march on the Delhi-Jaipur highway while another group camped at Hodal on the Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border as part of its plans to block highways to the national capital. With no end in sight to the agitation, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar met a group farmers from Uttarakhand who declared their support for the farm laws – the third such group to call on the minister over the past one week. Earlier, farmers from Haryana had called on Tomar and backed farm laws. Farmers belonging to the Bhartiya Kisan Union(Bhanu), who had moved the Supreme Court against the farm laws, met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday night and called off their protests that had blocked the Delhi-UP border at Noida. Tomar and junior minister for Commerce Som Parkash met Home Minister Amit Shah with a group of BJP leaders from Punjab to assess the political situation in the state, which has turned as the epicenter of protests against the farm laws. “The government is bringing its agents and presenting them as farmers with the intention to create a divide in the agitation,” Gurnam Singh Chadhuni, President of the Haryana unit of Bhartiya Kisan Union, told reporters here. The leaders of all the protesting farmer unions will observe a day-long hunger strike on Monday, while demonstrations were planned at district headquarters across the country to intensify the agitation. On Sunday, prominent activists Yogendra Yadav, Medha Patkar, Hannan Mollah led farmers' marched from Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan, around 120 km from Delhi. The marching farmers were stopped at the Haryana border at Rewari, where the police had put up barricades. Tomar lashes out at Opposition Addressing the farmers, Tomar slammed the opposition, accusing it of weakening the country. “The previous governments who wanted to bring the same reforms could not do it. Manmohan Singh tried many times, but could not do it. Now, when the reforms are implemented, a propaganda is being spread,” the Agriculture Minister said addressing the farmers from Uttarakhand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-reaches-out-to-farmers-backing-farm-laws-protesters-cry-foul-926998.html
13-12-2020||National Politics||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh dubs Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's announcement of observing fast as 'theatrics'||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday described his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal's announcement of observing a fast on Monday as "theatrics". Kejriwal has said he will observe a daylong fast on Monday in response to a call given by the farmers protesting against three new farm laws. Singh said the Kejriwal government had "backstabbed" the farmers by "shamelessly" notifying one of the farm laws on November 23. "And now, they are indulging in theatrics by announcing that they would be sitting on a fast in support of the farmers' hunger strike on Monday," he said in a statement issued here. "Do you have no shame? At a time when our farmers are braving the winter cold on the roads outside your city and many of them are dying fighting for their rights, all you can think of is how to make the most of the opportunity to promote your political interests. "Instead of doing anything constructive to help the protesting farmers, who are sitting outside your city for the past 17 days to seek justice, you and your party are busy playing politics," the Congress leader said. Kejriwal has proved time and again that he is no friend of the farmers, he added. Not only did the Punjab government support the farmers over the last three months of their agitation, it even passed amendment bills in the Assembly to nullify the farm laws, the chief minister pointed out, challenging Kejriwal to cite even one example of any welfare measure initiated by his government for farmers. Singh rubbished the allegations of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann that his government has signed a power purchase deal with the Adani group. He said the Punjab government has neither signed any agreement with the Adani Power nor is it aware of the private players bidding for power purchase in the state. Training his guns at Mann for "shooting off his mouth" without bothering to verify the facts of the power purchase situation in Punjab, the chief minister said he is a comedian and nobody ever takes him seriously. In a statement, Mann has alleged that "while the farmers of this country are protesting against the black farm laws, the central government and corporate houses, the Amarinder Singh government is busy cracking electricity purchase deals with the Adani group. By doing this, Amarinder Singh has backstabbed the farmers of Punjab."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-dubs-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwals-announcement-of-observing-fast-as-theatrics-927010.html

13-12-2020||North and Central||BJP ally Beniwal joins farmers' protest in Rajasthan||Farmers in Rajasthan blocked highways at several places on Saturday to protest against the Centre's new agri laws, with BJP-ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) MP Hanuman Beniwal joining one such demonstration. Terming the new farm laws as "anti-farmer", Beniwal, the convenor of RLP, said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is equally concerned about the farmers, he should implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission. He also reiterated that he would withdraw from the NDA if talks do not turn in favour of farmers. Beniwal along with his supporters also announced that they would move towards the Rajasthan-Delhi border to protest against the new farm laws. Addressing a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' organized at Kotputli, Beniwal said the Centre did not hold discussions with stakeholders before bringing the farm laws. "When the three bills were brought, they did not talk to anyone. We are also a part of the NDA. We are also the sons of farmers. They should have talked to us. They should have told us that they are bringing such a bill for farmers. I do not know who drafted the bills... They were brought and passed," Beniwal said. He added, "If the prime minister is equally worried about the farmers, then he should implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission report." "These three laws are anti-farmer and the government should enact a new legislation to benefit the farmers. If the talks do not turn in favour of the farmers, I would quit the NDA and if this too does not serve the purpose, I would leave my Lok Sabha membership," Beniwal added. If the government is not in a position to implement recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, it should guarantee the minimum support price (MSP), the RLP leader said. Farmers held demonstrations in several districts of the state, including Kota, Ganganagar, Bharatpur, Hanumangarh and Alwar. At many places, toll plazas on the highways were also closed and vehicles were allowed to pass free. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot appealed to the people to maintain peace while holding agitations. "Even on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, farmers should place their demands democratically in front of the Centre and maintain peace," Gehlot tweeted. Former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said the BJP-led government at the Centre should abandon its "adamant" attitude and fulfil the demands of the farmers soon. Pilot tweeted, "Our Annadata have been struggling on the streets for the last 17 days away from their family and home against central government''s autocracy to protect their rights in Corona crisis and harsh winter. The BJP government should abandon adamant attitude and fulfil the demands of the farmers soon." Meanwhile, BJP state president Satish Poonia said the three agri laws passed by the Modi government are in the interest of farmers. He said the agri laws will open the way for progress of farmers and the BJP is conducting a public awareness campaign by talking to the farmers all over the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-ally-beniwal-joins-farmers-protest-in-rajasthan-926763.html

The city police had on Saturday increased security arrangements by deploying additional personnel and placing more concrete barriers. Measures have also been taken to ensure commuters do not face inconvenience, a senior police officer said. The announcement by farmers' unions to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway comes amid protests by thousands for the last 17 days at the various other border points of the national capital, including Singhu and Tikri, against the laws. Farmers are demanding the Centre withdraw the legislations. Farmer leaders on Saturday had said that they are ready to hold talks with the government, but will first discuss repealing of the three new farm laws, and announced that representatives of their unions would sit on a hunger strike during a nationwide protest on Monday. They had also said that thousands of farmers will start their ''Delhi Chalo'' march with their tractors from Rajasthan's Shahjahanpur through the Jaipur highway at 11 am on Sunday. The Delhi Traffic Police has deployed its personnel across important border points to ensure commuters do not face difficulties and is constantly updating people about open and closed routes on its Twitter handle.

The green panel noted that the matter relating to air pollution has been pending for more than seven years and it does not find it necessary to keep it so for an indefinite period. “It is for the statutory authorities to continue further steps for enforcement of environmental norms as per law. “Accordingly, we close the proceedings with hope and expectation that the concerned authorities will take the necessary steps for maintaining environmental norms. There has to be continuous vigil against causing of pollution, particularly burning of plastic and other waste for the protection of environment and public health,” the tribunal said. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said the amount of compensation recovered from violators must be properly utilised for the legitimate purpose with the approval of the CPCB. “If there is any violation of environmental norms, the aggrieved party will be free to take remedies as per law, as and when necessary,” the bench said. The tribunal had earlier directed the Delhi chief secretary to co-ordinate with the municipal and police authorities and other officers to ensure compliance of its previous orders at the ground-level. It had asked the chief secretary to hold a joint meeting with the persons considered responsible for compliance and till the orders remain un-complied, continue to hold such meetings at least once a month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ngt-directs-delhi-govt-to-keep-vigil-against-burning-of-plastic-926867.html

However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-meets-amit-shah-amid-farmers-protest-926894.html

Kejriwal also found fault with the central ministers and BJP leaders depicting the protesters as "anti-nationals" and asked whether they considered former soldiers, national and international sportsperson who've won medals for the country and others supporting the farmers as such people. Responding to a call given by farmers, he said he will hold a day-long fast and urged AAP workers as well as the people of the country to join in solidarity. "I will be fasting on Monday. I know many people whose hearts are with the protesting farmers," he said. "I want to appeal to the Central government to put an end to their ego. The governments are formed by the public, the public is not formed by the governments. The three farm laws should be immediately repealed and the farmers should be given guaranteed MSPs, and a new Bill should be passed on it. All the demands of the farmers should be accepted without any condition as soon as possible," he said. Kejriwal also referred to the accusations of ministers and BJP leaders and said thousands of ex-servicemen, doctors, lawyers and sportspersons have pledged support to the families. "I also know of celebrities who are children of farmers and supporting the agitation. Will you consider all these people anti-nationals?" he said. He said the BJP was doing the same thing the erstwhile Congress government did during the Anna Hazare-led agitation earlier in the decade against the UPA regime on corruption.  "I cannot help but recall the days of Anna Hazare's movement. Even in those days, when we were sitting in Ramlila Maidan during the movement, the then Congress government propagated and planted several stories against us in the media. They called us anti-nationals. The attempts made by the Congress to malign our movement in those days, the same kind of attempts are made by BJP against the farmers' movements today. They should not dare to call the farmers of the nation anti-nationals," he added.  He said the BJP believes that the protest comprises only a few farmers from Punjab and Haryana and that it was a "misconception". Kejriwal said people are aware that the new laws allow one to hoard any quantity of grains and that any person, who has a lot of money, can hoard any amount of grains. "This also means that there will be high inflation. People can hoard till the time the inflation rate doubles every year. For instance, the prices of wheat will double from Rs 20 this year to Rs 40 next year, and then Rs 80, and then Rs 160, and so on," he added. Farmers are protesting at Delhi borders against the three controversial laws and have announced that they would intensify the protests in the coming days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shun-arrogance-and-scrap-farm-laws-kejriwal-to-centre-926912.html

And then, there are those who are distributing mosquito coils to the protesting farmers at the Singhu border. Sahab Singh has brought 12 cartons, each containing 60 mosquito coils, along with him from Chetanpura village in Punjab's Amritsar district. The 36-year-old and and his friend, Surmail Singh, has come to the Singhu border to "rescue" the protesting farmers from mosquitoes. "Everyone is bringing something or the other. We brought 'kachua chap' (mosquito coils) after a lot of farmers complained about mosquitoes," Sahab Singh, who is also a farmer, says. The farmers have been protesting at several border points into Delhi for over two weeks demanding that the contentious farm laws be repealed, claiming it would benefit the corporates and end the traditional wholesale markets and the minimum support price regime. During afternoon, the two friends are perched atop their car, holding packets of mosquito coils. "'Kachua jalao, macchar bhagao' (light the coils, ward off mosquitoes)," Sahab Singh cries out on the loudspeaker. Surmail Singh, 26, says the farmers have been camping out in the open and there are open drains that are a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The two started off on Saturday morning and reached the Delhi-Haryana border at night. "We started distributing the mosquito coils an hour ago and one carton is already empty," Surmail Singh says. They intend to go to every tractor and shed to distribute the coils among the farmers. "Some people are organising langars, some have set up medical camps, we are doing our bit," Surmail Singh says. "This is also 'sewa' (service)," Sahab Singh adds.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/doing-our-bit-duo-offers-mosquito-coils-to-protesting-farmers-926942.html

The terrorists are believed to have infiltrated into this side from across the Line of Control (LoC) about three days back and were heading for south Kashmir's Shopian district when they were intercepted in a snow-bound area along the Mughal Road in the afternoon, the officials said. They said it was a joint group of Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists and have been pushed into this side in an apparent attempt to disturb the ongoing district development council (DDC) elections which got a tremendous response from the people, causing frustration to Pakistan. The officials said police, assisted by the Army, launched a joint cordon and search operation in remote Chattapani-Dugran village after getting information about the presence of three suspected terrorists. The terrorists were trapped in a snow-bound area and were asked to surrender but they refused and instead fired indiscriminately on the security forces in an attempt to break the cordon, they said, adding the security forces retaliated and killed two of the militants. Another terrorist was captured alive during the gunfight, the officials said. They said both the slain terrorists are suspected to be Pakistani nationals but efforts are on to identify them. After getting information, they said, police along with the Army launched an operation and plugged all escape routes but the snowfall slowed down the chase. With the improvement in the weather, the operation resumed this morning and a contact was established with the terrorists, who were offered to surrender but they declined and triggered a gunfight, the officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-terrorists-killed-another-held-in-encounter-with-security-forces-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-poonch-926965.html

Several farmers' organisations marched through Behror, Shajahapur and Kotputli regions of the state to reach Jaisinghpur-Khera Border. Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, social activists Aruna Roy and Medha Patkar, and CPI (M) leader Amra Ram also reached Shajahapur along with farmers. However, police did not allow them to proceed forward. ''We are squatting on the highway in support of farmers. We are ready to vacate the road if we are allowed to march towards Delhi," Yadav told reporters, while apologising to the people for the inconvenience caused to them. Kisan Panchayat president Rampal Chaudhary is also continuing with his protest along with the farmers on the Haryana-Rajasthan border highway as police did not allow them to move forward. "Farmers affiliated to different farmer organisations are reaching Shahjahapur border. We want the government to repeal the new farm laws and for this, we want to march towards Delhi," said Chaudhary. While CPI (M) leader Amra Ram said the Centre should withdraw the three "anti-farmer" laws. "We do not have any intention to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway. Police have stopped us from marching towards Delhi, which has led to jam. We want the Centre to withdraw the anti-farmer laws," Amra Ram said. Due to blockade, vehicular traffic on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway had to be diverted through Bansur and other routes of Alwar, police said. One-way traffic from Delhi to Jaipur was later opened for traffic but Jaipur-Delhi highway is blocked due to the agitation, they said. Police administration is keeping a vigil on the border areas in view of the agitation. "The police department is all prepared to maintain the law and order and have made all arrangements in view of the farmers' agitation," Bhiwadi SP Ram Murti Joshi said. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.

The Director General of Police (DGP) complimented the joint team of police and army that gunned down the two infiltrating Pakistani terrorists and captured another. "Another attempt (was made) by Pakistan to send in LeT-JeM terrorists to Kashmir to disturb the ongoing democratic process of grassroots level elections," Singh told PTI. He said that it shows Pakistan's desperation due to huge participation of people in the ongoing elections. The DGP said that three days ago the group of three terrorists crossed over from Pakistan and were on their way to Shopian. "On an input they were being chased by police. Day before yesterday, (security) parties reached the spot but could not launch operation due to snowfall. Today afternoon another move was made...," he said. The terrorists were trapped in a snow-bound area in remote Chattapani-Dugran village and were asked to surrender but they refused and instead fired indiscriminately on the security forces in an attempt to break the cordon. The security forces retaliated and killed two of them. Another terrorist was captured alive during the gunfight. Both the Pakistani terrorists have been killed in the encounter, he said.

Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said the Modi government should shed its "arrogance" and follow the Raj Dharma by withdrawing these "black laws" as they "threaten" the farming sector and the livelihood of farmers. "This is not a fight only for the livelihoods and the lives of 62 crore farmers, but for the 120 crore people who eat what the farmers produce. To term the protests political is a big insult to the food-growers of the country. The Modi government should shed arrogance and follow the Raj Dharma," he said. "It is wrong to say that the farmers' agitation is limited to Punjab and Haryana. The entire country is affected by these three black agri laws. In Madhya Pradesh, due to decrease in the business volume at the mandis, the tax collection of the board in one year has gone down from Rs 1,200 crore to Rs 220 crore," Surjewala also said in a tweet in Hindi. Citing a media report, he said 47 mandis and 298 sub-mandis have been closed in Madhya Pradesh alone after the farm laws were enacted. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also took a swipe at the government saying if it was terming the protesters Khalistanis, Maoists and agents of Pakistan and China, then why was it engaging them in talks. "Ministers have described the protesters against the farm laws as Khalistanis; agents of Pakistan and China; Maoists; and, the latest, tukde tukde gang मंत्रियों ने कृषि कानूनों के खिलाफ प्रदर्शन करने वालों को खालिस्तानी, पाकिस्तानी और चीनी एजेंट, माओवादी और नवीनतम टुकडे टुकडे गिरोह का बताया। "If you exhaust all these categories, it means there are no farmers among the thousands of protesters. If there are no farmers, why is the government talking to them," he asked on Twitter. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government over rising petrol prices, alleging the money earned from the tax on petrol is going in the Central Vista project, on buying a new aircraft for the prime minister and on promotional advertisements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/terming-farmers-protest-political-an-insult-to-food-growers-of-the-country-says-congress-927043.html

Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) spearheading the sit-in at Chilla border also demanded the statutory provision for the pension to farmers. BKU (Bhanu) chief Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh raised the demand saying they would provide succour to farmers across the country. "We demand the creation of a 'Kisan Aayog' (farmers commission) which will have farmers as representatives and will set the minimum support price for crops," Singh said. He said the way industrialists and businessmen decide the price for their products, farmers too will decide the price of their crops and the government will have to procure it at that rate. The government can then distribute the crop to the needy people on subsidised rates as it is doing now and the remaining crop could be exported, said Singh, camping at the Chilla border since December 1. He also demanded a pension of Rs 10,000 monthly for farmers and cultivators who have reached an age of 60 years. “The MPs and MLAs who are elected by us are entitled to pension even after losing an election. Give something to the public also. There should be a government compensation of Rs 1 crore for family of a farmer who dies, Rs 2 crore for martyrs in police and Rs 5 crore for martyrs in defence forces," he said. "Had I been the prime minister, I would have fulfilled these demands in an hour. But I am not the prime minister," he said. The protestors have gathered at the Noida border and want to proceed to Delhi to join the larger congregation of farmers from Haryana and Punjab camping at Delhi’s various border point with Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big businessmen. The government has been maintaining that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. Government officials said efforts are being made for next round of talks between representatives of the Centre and the farmers so that the logjam over the new laws could end.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/form-kisan-aayog-to-decide-msp-give-pension-to-farmers-bku-bhanu-927051.html

Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), a banned militant group based in Bangladesh, claimed responsibility for the blast that took place on Saturday night at the staff quarters of Star Cement. "One person sustained minor injuries. The blast also resulted in the collapse of a wall, besides damaging a water pipeline," Superintendent of Police Deepak Kumar Palecha said. An investigation is underway and a case has been registered. The banned outfit said the blast was a result of the company failing to pay them "taxes", or extortion. "Any industry or company run by non-locals has to pay tax to the HNLC and if there is a violation of the same, they will face our ire," its general secretary Sainkupar Nongtraw said in a statement. Several HNLC members have surrendered over the years. Julius K Dorphang, the former chairman of the outfit, surrendered in 2007 and became a politician, successfully contesting the assembly elections in 2013. The HNLC is wanting to hold dialogues with the Centre and the Meghalaya government for years.

The hunger strike from 8 am to 5 pm is part of the farmers' plan to intensify their agitation from Monday. Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border, Chaduni said the leaders will observe the hunger strike at their respective places. "Also, dharnas will be staged at all district headquarters across the country and the farmers will submit a memorandum of demands addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The protests will go on as usual," he told reporters. Meanwhile, in a statement, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, "The Samajwadi Party supports the demands of the farmers and its sympathy is with them. The 'kisan yatra' was started by the SP on December 7. On December 14, the party workers will hold dharna at all the district headquarters in the state." Attacking the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said, "India is a 'krishi pradhan' (agriculture-dominated) country and the arrogant BJP should remember that the word 'krishi' comes before 'pradhan'."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-to-hold-farmers-meets-in-up-to-raise-awareness-on-agri-laws-927076.html
13-12-2020||Opinion||The measure of progress||The human quest for knowledge has been sustained by an unspoken assumption: that the answers to life’s questions can be found if we try hard enough. And when we do, we will be able to reorganise society in rational ways, free from superstition, dogma, and oppression. Yet, the ideas that liberate one generation become the shackles of the next. It is the relentless march of ideas that add to the beauty, poignancy and the idiosyncrasies of life. One such simple, but transformational idea was the Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure of progress. This December, we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the HDI. First introduced in the UN Human Development Report in 1990, the HDI was a step-change in Development Economics. It measures human development along three dimensions: a long and healthy life, acquisition of knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Pakistani economist Mahbub-ul-Haq, the originator of the HDI, recognised the importance -- despite considerable scepticism from many -- of one simple number that could capture the complex reality of human development and deprivation. He insisted stubbornly that “We need a measure of the same level of vulgarity as GNP -- just one number -- but a measure that is not as blind to social aspects of human lives as GNP is.” The rest is history. Haq was born in Gurdaspur, Punjab, in undivided India, and studied alongside Amartya Sen at King’s College, Cambridge. He was a heretic among economists, but went on to transform our understanding of the development process and had a profound impact on the global approach to human development. He emerged as the most compelling voice for the Global South, and was deeply concerned with the poor countries and what they could do to become less poor. In its explicit purpose, “to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centred policies,” the HDI has been eminently successful; and the rationale for a humane, alternative approach is presented in Haq’s book Reflections on Human Development. “We are rediscovering the obvious,” he wrote, “that people are both the means and the end of development.” The success of the HDI lies in its ability to bridge the gap between research and policy, and Haq’s pre-eminence, his ability to build this bridge. He was convinced that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to persuade governments, academics, and politicians alike, that they can and should evaluate development not merely by economic growth but by improvements in human well-being. Development praxis owes much to Haq and the simple yet profound idea of the HDI. The UN SDG Agenda 2030, in substantial measure, rests on the conceptual framework of the HDI. To understand why this is so, we must make a brief detour to consider the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the other measure of progress that governments continue to rely on; and which, in the public mind space, conjures up a powerful statistical indicator of national development, no matter how far removed it might be from the freedom of choice to be or to do. The modern concept of the GDP as an empirical measure of economic growth, and hence of national development, was proposed by Simon Kuznets in 1934. But it was not until the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that GDP became the main tool for measuring a country’s economic progress. Kuznets went on to win the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1971, while Haq remains much less celebrated than he ought to be for the profundity of his contribution -- new empirical avenues to measure human progress. Ironically, besides the dodgy data that goes into generating the GDP number, it is the method of calculation that makes it the handmaiden of political expediency: GDP = (C + I + G +[X – M] or consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports), gives governments of the day an incentive to spend more money, because greater government spending tautologically increases that sum. Bear in mind that the value of government spending includes the salaries of government employees, not the value of their output. It is not surprising then that the GDP as a measure is often described as “the price of everything and the value of nothing.” The HDI compels us to ask what matters more, the quantitative expansion of an economy, or the qualitative improvement in the capabilities of society. Haq’s true contribution was to infuse an ethical dimension to the development discourse. “There is a missing moral core in our technological advance. In rich nations and poor, the moral foundations of economic growth are often lacking. And we are too embarrassed even to mention morality anymore,” he lamented. Three decades later, this has greater resonance than it ever did.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-measure-of-progress-926696.html
13-12-2020||Opinion||Corona Karma: Our ‘vaccine’||The shiny white bus was standing in the Bengaluru depot, and I got in with my little strolley bag, avoiding the gleaming steel handles either side as if they had electric current in them. Masked-me glanced at the bus driver in a mask; I walked to my seat and stood, pushing the curtains away was a task. It was close to 10.30 pm on the sleeper bus that would transport me overnight to a scenic town in Coorg. I opened the curtains, pushed the luggage and my shoes below the seat, sat back, poured some holy sanitiser from the handbag onto my palms and surveyed the scene around me. The bus did look sanitised, and just as they had said on the website while booking, the customary water bottle and the blanket weren’t given. Good, I had my own sheets, but the mask? Should I wear it even while I slept? Oh, but my hands could still touch the rexin on the wall in sleep. And what if I touch my face and nose after that? The bus conductor called out from the other side of the curtain: “Yochane maad bedi (don’t worry),” he said, smiling as I put my face out, and he sat down on a seat opposite mine verifying my passenger details. “Really?” I smiled back at him, asking in Kannada, “What if corona is my co-passenger?” Nagaraj, the tall, strapping man with distinct South Kanara features and accent, said without looking up from his phone, “Do you know that I have not taken a single day’s leave, apart from my weekly off, from the day Modi said lockdown? Buses were not running, but I have been on duty every day, going up and down, meeting people, eating at so many places, taking currency notes in this same hand from god-knows-who-all. I should have got corona-girona by now, no? Look madam, we coastal people have a saying, Baaradu bappadu, bandadhu tappadhu. (If it is not to come, it won’t. If it is to come, it won’t fail to.)” It is a uniquely Indian theory -- Karma is worn as kavacha, armour, against the puny virus that continues to lash out worldwide, has pushed the mighty US into yet another lockdown, and continues to torment Italy and France with the next spike in cases. In the next three days, everywhere I went around the town of Madikeri and Bhagamandala, where the Cauvery takes her birth, the mask was, of course, there on people’s faces. So what if it wasn’t covering the mouth? We are Indians, we take it on the chin. The resort I stayed in had all the protocols in place, too: no taking aarti of us guests on arrival, no red tika on our foreheads. Payments were all touch-free. Auto-driver Sharief, who ferried us (oh, yes, the spouse was there, too) those three days with a lot of love and gentle chatter, carried his mask...safe in his pocket. Just in case the police show up and ask. “But they also understand that it’s okay, they act strict to show to their officers.” He then let me in on his own grand analysis of the Covid-19 saga. “Idhella government scamu. Even if it is only cold and cough, they shout corona, and push people into hospitals. You also see how chilly the weather is here? Did people not cough or have breathing trouble last year?” Friends who know of my wanderings into rural and tier-2 India ask, is it safe to travel? Well, it is just as safe or unsafe as your head and heart tell you it is. This is not to say that we should be careless or in denial about the virus. It is to say, we have to decide how much of the fear of the virus we will allow to get in our way. To me, it is to begin ‘normalising’ our lives in little ways. It is to be okay with living with the worry of, “what if it happens?” To let go and deal with it when it happens.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/corona-karma-our-vaccine-926697.html
13-12-2020||Opinion||I’m glad to be living in India at this time||As the dust (or rather, the s***storm) settles on 2020 and I reflect back on the year, a quote by celebrated British author Charles Caleb Colton comes to mind -- “Constant success shows us but one side of the world; adversity brings out the reverse of the picture.” The pandemic has upended the world. Each country has had to grapple with it. Some appear to be faring better than others. Although the game is far from over, one thing has become apparent to me -- I’m glad to be living in India. And so is a Swiss friend of mine. Mad or what? India has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world after the US. In contrast, Australia -- where I’m from -- is being lauded for containing the virus. However, it’s actually not as admirable as it seems. Australia is a sparsely populated island in the middle of nowhere that slammed its border shut and cut itself off from the rest of the world, including denying citizens abroad access to their own country. Residents are banned from leaving Australia, and more than 40,000 Australian nationals and permanent visa-holders are currently unable to return due to a weekly cap on the number of arrivals. The cap is in place because despite being 10 months into the pandemic, Australia hasn’t provided sufficient quarantine facilities to meet demand. Never mind that many of those people stranded abroad have no income and are separated from their families. Keeping the virus out of Australia at all costs is more of a priority than enabling people to come home. That’s not the country I know. Meanwhile, in India, we’ve had to face the virus head on. And doing so has brought the greatest learnings. After the disturbing initial months of disarray, India has pulled itself together to defy dire predictions of deaths, despite lifting the lockdown. Indian doctors have accumulated impressive depth of knowledge about the infection, and are successfully using several early treatment protocols to keep people out of hospitals. On the other hand, in the US, the standard of care offers nothing until people are gasping for breath. The travesty is that Americans are only just waking up to the fact that early treatments exist. The drugs were either politicised or suppressed because there’s no money to be made from them, while the over-regulated medical profession waited on impossible ironclad evidence of effectiveness to materialise. Fatality rates, unfortunately, indicate the outcome of this. Ivermectin is part of early treatment protocols in India. The irony is that an Australian professor pioneered the use of it, but it has been dismissed in Australia in favour of locking the door until a vaccine (hopefully) saves the day. Yet, ivermectin provides protection from the virus, too. It’s not insignificant that a study in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha, found ivermectin prophylaxis reduced Covid-19 infection in frontline healthcare workers by 73%. Ivermectin isn’t approved in Switzerland, either. My Swiss friend tells me her mother hasn’t heard of it. Both my friend and I agree we prefer to be in a country where prevention and treatment of the virus is understood, and medications are routinely available if we get sick. (But hey, scientists say Mumbai is heading for herd immunity by January, so we’ve probably already been exposed to the virus. Reportedly, 70% of active cases in Mumbai are asymptomatic. My maid even has Covid-19 antibodies without being ill). This year has delivered a lot of unexpected things. On the positive side, I certainly didn’t expect that, from experiencing the worst of times of the pandemic in India, I would feel more at home here than ever. What previously frustrated me about India’s disorganisation has revealed advantageous flexibility. As western countries pontificated against repurposing drugs, proactive Indian doctors chartered their own course -- finding what works and healing people, with amazing results. It’s commendable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/i-m-glad-to-be-living-in-india-at-this-time-926699.html
13-12-2020||Opinion||Hungry for change? Solve a public problem||A lot of people ask me, what can I do to make things a little better on the development front? My first instinct is to reply that there is not much that they alone can do, but there is surely a lot that they, too, can do. Let me explain what I mean with an example. A number of young people in Mumbai, who’ve decided early in their lives to be self-motivated change-makers, got together some months ago to distribute food and rations to migrant workers in desperate poverty during the Covid-19 lockdown. Each week, they went around the major transit stations, handing out relief, calling their effort “Khaana Chahiye” (I need food). A few companies helped (Wipro, PayTM, Godrej), and crowd-funding added a bit more money. This is such an absolute good thing to do that it quickly got the support of Parle-G, appropriately a company that makes food products, and the initiative became slightly more sustainable. This went on, week after week. Meanwhile, the volunteers started to think about scale, recognising that there’s only so much that they themselves could do. They approached the local municipal body -- the Mumbai corporation -- to see how it could take over this programme, eventually to cover the whole city. That got a few public officials genuinely interested in tackling the problem involved. They begin to co-ideate with the volunteers to scale the effort. And together, they began to ask how a proper programme could be put together in the corporation -- replete with the usual committees, plan, budget, etc., but also with participation from citizens. It always helps to make all of this better understood through data, and at Mapunity, we decided to build a platform for this. It took a few tweaks of some earlier technology that we’ve had lying around, but with feedback from the volunteers, a data-collection app was quickly put together, making the groundwork a little easier. More importantly, this kind of effort makes it easier to ‘show’ the problem, and a lot more people connect readily with that. Figuring out how to make this scale also needed people who could study the data and analyse what the gaps to be filled were. That created room for public policy folks to get involved, and I suggested that the new Kautilya School of Public Policy could get involved, mostly because my good friend Sridhar Pabbisetty and others there are interested in working on extreme poverty issues. With this, some of the volunteers could hope to see their work formally recognised in an academic space, too. The growing strength allowed reach-out to more people. Another friend, Roshan Shankar, who works closely with the Delhi government on a number of issues, began to explore how the state government there could work more formally with these ideas in larger areas. A few MLAs in the city could be requested to help, we felt. There’s a whole other initiative on constituency management that is emerging from that collaboration. More on that another time. One of the other things I’ve been working on is to see how children can get involved in public problem-solving early in life. While most of their civics learning is on environment, health, livelihoods, etc., there’s no reason why even more complex things like food security could not also be taught. And so, I connected Kautilya to an immersive civics-learning programme I know in Chennai, to see how we could build a template that other schools, too, could use. All these things have the same goal -- increase the number of people working on the problem, making deliberate connections between them along the way. I’ve reached a point with this kind of effort where it now is a standard feature on my calendar, bringing people together because they share interests and capabilities in working on some problem or the other. Rajesh Kasturirangan and I plan to teach a course about all this in the spring at Socratus, the solving platform for wicked problems, and hopefully later in the year at Kautilya. Each of us could ask the same question: Can I identify a local problem about which I care deeply, and to which I am willing to contribute time and effort, which can then be part of a much larger ecosystem of problem-solvers, all doing their part to tackle it? In short, can we see that these problems are social and political, not technical and managerial? And can we work on them across society and government, too? A couple of weeks ago, I tweeted asking if people in different neighbourhoods in Bengaluru would like to work on public problems in their own areas. About 40 people wrote to me in response to that, indicating what they’d like to do, and in some cases asking how they could get started. I see that as proof of latent interest in society -- there are enough people out there who care. Some people even wrote in from abroad, asking if there were things they could do remotely. Of course, there’s always something one can do, by teaming up with others. And some respondents wrote from other cities and towns in Karnataka, asking if the effort was limited to Bengaluru. Of course not. And I learned from them too, about problems that are quite different in other places. “Khaana Chahiye” is an example, but it’s also a metaphor. The power to do good within us is much larger than we usually imagine. But it’s not all within us -- there’s a twist to this. Some part of our power is distributed among many others, and some of their power in turn is within us. When we exchange that with each other, the world begins to change.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/hungry-for-change-solve-a-public-problem-926700.html
13-12-2020||Opinion||English exceptionalism is a big Brexit hurdle||Anyone watching the final days of the Brexit negotiations should receive free treatment for whiplash. One moment there’s optimism that a deal is imminent, the next brings a sense of impending gloom about a likely no deal.  Sunday’s deadline to reach an agreement, set during a long dinner between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday, proved as arbitrary as previous deadlines. But the Dec. 31 cutoff date for the UK leaving the single market is final. One of the biggest obstacles to a free trade agreement may be the doctrine of exceptionalism that Johnson has championed more than any other leader. Britain can do what it likes because it is freedom loving and, well, simply a “better country.” This ethos has delivered dividends for Johnson politically — such as the Brexit referendum and his own rise to Downing Street — but now it risks making any compromise look like capitulation. And that’s unacceptable to Brexiters.   Johnson had until June to secure a one-year extension so that the UK could absorb the shock of the pandemic and work through negotiations. He refused, arguing that would only postpone entry into the sunlit uplands of Britain’s post-Brexit future. Perhaps. But this also meant there’d be less time and therefore little chance of achieving anything more than a meagre deal. His refusal showed a callous disregard for UK businesses and workers, who would benefit from more time to prepare for changes.  Will the prime minister be able to change his tune? The argument for optimism is simple: There is nothing more feckless, counterproductive or self-punishing than two neighbours, longtime allies and economic dependents throwing up major barriers to each other’s businesses. Surely they won’t.  The optimist sees the threat of a breakdown in talks as part of the painful but necessary theatre that makes a compromise politically viable for both sides. Sunday’s decision to extend talks yet again might support that view. The pessimist, however, would say that both sides feel they can swallow a no-deal Brexit more easily than any compromise. The optimist suspects that consummate dealmaker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, will swoop in at the last moment and smooth the way to an agreement, just as she did this past week with Hungary and Poland — two EU members who’ve done more to undermine the raison d’etre of the bloc than the UK has. But the pessimist thinks France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a politician facing an angry fishing lobby and tricky regional elections next year — will refuse to play along and issue the decisive “non.” This brings us to the choice facing Johnson. Having refined his political and personal brand around the idea of exceptionalism, he probably doesn’t want to dilute it with a compromise now. But every time his government has assumed this posturing, it has done further harm.  The conceit of British exceptionalism (by which Johnson really means English exceptionalism) has underpinned every UK Brexit mistake, just as it has the policy errors made during the pandemic. Yes, Britain is a great place, but not so much that the laws of trade don’t apply to it. And not so great that it can hold a pandemic back without building testing capacity and enforcing lockdowns. The siren call of exceptionalism now says that no deal is no problem because negotiations will resume in the New Year after both sides have claimed a victory. And yet, any new negotiations will require the same hard choices Johnson faces now. Indeed, both deals that Johnson has struck since becoming prime minister — the one with Ireland’s Leo Varadkar securing the Withdrawal Agreement, and the one brokered by Michael Gove this week that ensured the government would keep its commitment on the Irish border — saw the EU hold to its important red lines. The government’s position is that leaving without a trade deal will have only short-term costs, that these will be minuscule in the context of the pandemic and that people will shrug them off because they’ll ultimately still be getting the freedom they want. These are big gambles. If Johnson doesn’t clinch a trade deal, he will no doubt claim that he took a tough stance for freedom and sovereignty. And he’ll have a willing audience for that message. After all, it’s better to feel exceptional than ordinary. Compromise is a much harder narrative to sell.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/english-exceptionalism-is-a-big-brexit-hurdle-926961.html
13-12-2020||South||Kerala CM's free Covid vaccine announcement dubbed an election gimmick||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's announcement that Covid-19 vaccines will be provided free of cost to all has triggered a political row with the Congress and BJP alleging that the promise is a violation of the election code of conduct. Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) convenor M M Hassan and BJP state president K Surendran said that petitions would be given to State Election Commission in this regard. Hassan said that the Chief Minister's announcement was only aimed at influencing voters during the elections. Hassan asked how a CM can make such an announcement at this point when the Centre has not issued any directive on vaccines yet. Surendran said that the Chief Minister's announcement of free Covid vaccines supply was an election gimmick only as the Centre would be providing the vaccines free. Meanwhile, CPM Kerala secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan said that the announcement of free Covid-19 vaccine supply was part of the ongoing measures of the government. The Chief Minister made the announcement at Kannur district, one of the four districts going to the polls on Monday. Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kasargod are the other districts. Counting will be held on Wednesday. The state is also on a high alert against chances of a Covid-19 surge owing to electioneering. Most political parties have been demanding a free supply of Covid-19 vaccines and had even included it in the election manifesto. Hassan said that the UDF was never opposed to free Covid-19 vaccine supply, but was also questioning the timing of the announcement, that too without any preparation. The Chief Minister earlier announced that free Christmas kits would be given to all ration cardholders, which was also a violation of election norms, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cms-free-covid-vaccine-announcement-dubbed-an-election-gimmick-926853.html
13-12-2020||South||Tension at churches in Kerala over power tussle||Tension prevailed at several churches in Kerala on Sunday with members of the Jacobite faction of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church trying to enter the churches that were taken over by the Orthodox faction on the basis of a Supreme Court order. Police blocked the Jacobite faction members, including priests and women, at various churches. The tense situations were continuing. The Jacobite faction had earlier announced that its believers would enter all the 52 churches that were taken over from them by the Orthodox faction. But the Orthodox faction maintained that it was not opposed to believers entering the church, but would not allow priests. Tension mainly prevailed at the Marthoman Jacobite Syrian Church at Mulanthuruthy in the suburbs of Kochi. Believers led by the Metropolitan of the Kochi diocese of the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church Joseph Mar Gregorios tried to enter the church. They were blocked by the police, leading to an altercation. A similar major tense situation was reported at Kattachira St.Mary’s Church at Kayamkulam in Alappuzha and Vadavucodu St Mary's Church in Ernakulam district also. The Jacobite faction members, who have been demanding referendum among believers on each church's possession and law in this regard, are planning to launch an indefinite stir in front of the Government Secretariat. It was after a long legal battle that SC ordered administrative control of  1,100 odd churches to the Orthodox faction. The state already witnessed tension at many prominent churches with the Jacobite faction members resisting moves to handover management to the Orthodox faction. The Kerala government is caught up in a fix over the issue with the SC order in favour of the Orthodox faction on one side and a prominent faction of the Christian community on the other. Hence the government has been maintaining a soft-pedaling strategy.  Even as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently initiated mediatory talks between the two factions, those remained inconclusive as both the factions remained adamant on their stands. While the Orthodox faction wants to implement the Supreme Court order granting control of about 1,100 churches to them, the Jacobite faction was insisting on the law to conduct a referendum among believers in each church to decide on the possession of the church.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tension-at-churches-in-kerala-over-power-tussle-926880.html

The deceased was identified as Kumari, 55, hailing from Salem in Tamilnadu. The police would be arraigning the flat owner, identified as Imtiaz, in the case. According to a Kochi city police official, the flat owner would be arraigned in the case registered for wrongful confinement and further sections would be added on the basis of investigation and post-mortem report. While Imtiaz told the police that the maid made a bid to steal his purse and tried to escape, there were allegations that the maid tried to escape owing to harassment. There were also allegations that she was not allowed to go out of the flat owing to the Covid-19 scenario. Couple of co-joined saris were found tied to the handrail of the balcony of the flat. Kumari was found on the premises of the flat with head injuries and was under treatment at a private hospital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/flat-owner-to-be-arraigned-as-maid-dies-in-suspicious-circumstance-in-kochi-926923.html

Such clinics which would function for two hours in the morning and four hours in the evening are expected to come near slums and other localities in Chennai and elsewhere in the state.  In the first phase, the government has decided to launch 630 mini-clinics each in the first two phases and 740 in the third phase. The idea was conceived after fever camps conducted first in Chennai and later expanded to other parts of the state to detect Covid-19 cases turned successful.  “The clinics will serve as the first stop for people suffering from fever, cold, and flu without having to knock at the doors of a private hospital or a government tertiary care hospital. Our aim is to establish such clinics in every area so that people can access them even by walk,” J Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary (Health), told DH.  The clinic will be open for four hours in the evening to enable people to access them after coming from work. People from the middle-class who live far-away from hospitals, those living in slums, and labourers and daily-wage workers are likely to be benefited from the new clinics.  Radhakrishnan added that the mini-clinics will add to the convenience of the people to access primary health care at their localities. “Treatment for ailments like fever, cold, and flu will be taken care of these mini-clinics. This will be very helpful to people,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-to-launch-mini-clinics-aimed-at-poor-on-december-14-926931.html

However, the ruling CPI(M) dismissed the charges as 'childish". United Democratic Front convener M M Hassan told reporters that the Front moved the SEC,as the announcement was a violation of the model code, given that the four northern districts are going to the polls on December 14. "There was no urgency to make such an announcement," he said Senior Congress leader K C Joseph filed an online complaint in this regard with the SEC. BJP state chief K Surendran, in his complaint, alleged that the Chief Minister was trying to woo voters through such announcements and it was a violation of the model code. Terming the charges as 'childish,' Left Democratic Front convener and CPI(M) state secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan told reporters at Thrissur that the CM's statement was part of the ongoing COVID-19 treatment procedure in the state. "The UDF allegation is childish. The COVID-19 treatment in the state is being provided free of cost. The announcement of giving the vaccine also free of cost was part of the process of him explaining details of the treatment," the LDF convener said. The Chief Minister stated on Saturday that the COVID-19 vaccine would be made available free of cost to all people in Kerala. "No one will be charged for the vaccine. This is the stand of the government," he told reporters at Kannur. Vijayan also said the quantity of the vaccine that would be allotted to the state by the Centre was not yet known. The Centre on Tuesday said three COVID-19 vaccines, developed by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer, are under active consideration ofIndia's drug regulator and there is hope that early licensure is possible for all or any of them. Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/opposition-udf-bjp-move-sec-against-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-free-covid-19-vaccine-announcement-926932.html

The Archdiocese had faced similar allegations earlier too. A section of believers burnt the calendar for 2021 of the archdiocese in protest at various parts of the state on Sunday. Franco's photograph was on the calendar for the month of March, his birthday month. Kerala Catholic Reforms Movement that initiated protests said that it was an insult for the entire Catholic community to publish the image of Franco in the calendar. While the Archdiocese authorities were not available for comments, sources close to the Archdiocese said that it was normal practice to give photographs of bishops in the calendar to mark their birthdays. A nun of a convent at Kuravilangad in Kottayam district alleged that Franco sexually assaulted her 13 times between 2014 and 2016 at the convent. He was charged under various sections of Indian Penal Code for rape, unnatural sex, illegal detention and criminal intimidation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/photo-of-rape-accused-former-bishop-in-calendar-triggers-protest-927003.html

The ED arrested Sharif after he was apprehended by authorities at the Thiruvananthapuram airport on Saturday, official sources said. Sharif was "evading" ED summons in connection with a criminal money laundering probe being conducted against the Kerala-based PFI. In a remand report submitted in a court here today, the ED stated that Sharif had funded the trip of Sidhique Kappan, a Delhi-based Kerala journalist, and three others to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, where a Dalit woman died after being allegedly gang-raped. Kappan and three others were arrested by the UP police in October while being on their way to Hathras with "ulterior motives of disturbing social harmony and inciting communal riots." The trip was funded by Campus Front of India national general secretary K A Rauf Sharif, who transferred the money for the said purpose to the bank account of one of those arrested, the agency said in the report. The central agency alleged that Sharif maintains three bank accounts and an analysis of the accounts revealed a total credit and debit of Rs 1.35 crore in one of them during 2018- 20. Also, a foreign remittance of Rs 29.18 lakh was received during April-June 2020 from two people and the purpose of remittance has been mentioned in the bank records as "payments to hotels by nationals of all FATF compliant countries /NRIs for their stay." "This purpose looks suspicious as it implies that Rauf Sharif either owns a hotel in India or Oman for which payments were made by the duo for the stay even though hotels were not operational during the period April-June 2020 due to COVID. Additionally, there are major high-value expenses by Sharif for purpose of land and vehicle purchase", the report added. Besides, it was found that there was a credit/debit of Rs 20 lakhs in his Axis Bank account during 2020. The ED said during the recording of Sharif's statement at Kochi zonal office of the directorate, he did not divulge information about his foreign remittances. He was evasive in his response and did not cooperate with the investigation, the ED said in the report seeking his judicial remand. Considering the plea, the court sent Sharif to 14-day judicial remand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/pfi-leader-rauf-sharif-received-huge-sums-of-money-ed-to-kerala-court-927033.html
13-12-2020||South||Tamil Nadu polls: Kamal Haasan launches campaign; does not rule out striking deal with Rajinikanth||Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Kamal Haasan on Sunday hinted at the realignment of political alliances in Tamil Nadu ahead of 2021 assembly elections while not ruling out a possible tie-up with actor Rajinikanth, who is set to float his party soon. "Alliances will break-up and alliances (new combinations) will come together," the actor-turned-politician told reporters in this temple city where he launched his party's campaign for the polls likely to be held in April-May. Haasan was replying to a question if there was a possibility of his party striking an electoral deal with the to-be-launched outfit of Rajinikanth. Nothing more could be spelt out on alliances, he added. To a question on putting an MNM-led third front in place, he said it was not possible to divulge when that would happen. On denial of permission by the government for campaigning in a number of places, he said such impediments were nothing new and they were geared up to reach out to people by following norms in place in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In his brief address at an event here, Haasan assured the gathering of designating Madurai as the second capital of Tamil Nadu if his party was voted to power. In a question and answer session that followed, he expressed confidence in eliminating corruption with the support of people. His political entry was to serve the public who stood behind him ever since he joined the world of cinema when he was still a child. Replying to a question, Haasan said enforcing prohibition in Tamil Nadu was not feasible. His stand was that the government should not be involved in liquor business, the way it focused on key sectors like education and health. Hence, if MNM was voted to power, liquor vends would be privatised and the government shall confine itself to priority areas including education and job creation, he said. History showed that the idea of complete prohibition had led to illicit liquor, he said. "We should not sow seeds for illicit liquor by claiming to do away with alcoholic beverages." On unemployment, he said his party stood for developing entrepreneurial skills of young men and women to make them entrepreneurs. They should pursue a variety of educational choices rather than choosing only engineering or medicine and ending up being mere job seekers, he said. Haasan, who earlier arrived here from Chennai to embark on the first phase of campaign, was accorded a grand reception by his party workers. Standing through the sunroof of his car, he greeted the people and joined his arms to symbolise the logo of his party that denoted togetherness. Haasan's party contested its first elections in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls fielding candidates in 38 constituencies in the state, but failed to win any seat, polling only 3.77 per cent votes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-polls-kamal-haasan-launches-campaign-does-not-rule-out-striking-deal-with-rajinikanth-927049.html
13-12-2020||State||Karnataka fares well in women's reproductive health; sex ratio improves||Karnataka has improved on almost all parameters in women's reproductive health and child health, shows the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-20) released on Saturday by the Government of India. The sex ratio has improved from 979 females per 1,000 males (in 2015-16) to 1,034. The neonatal mortality rate has also improved from 18.5% to 15.8%. However, the burden of family planning is still on women. While female sterilisation went up from 48.6% to 57.4%, male sterilisation came to a grinding halt, and is zero. It was a dismal 0.1% in 2015-16 too. Some worrying numbers have also emerged that is of concern to gynaecologists, obstetricians and public health professionals alike. The number of women who consumed iron and folic acid for 180 days or more when they were pregnant has come down. From 32.6% five years ago, it is 26.7% now. This is especially important because pregnant women in the age group of 15-49 years who are anaemic (decrease in haemoglobin in blood that is improved with iron, folic acid supplements) is 45.7%. Young women in the age group of 15-19 years who are anaemic is 49.4%. The government and the the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has a goal of 'Anaemia-Mukt Bharat'. Dr Hema Divakar, former president, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), said, "It is worrying that half the adolescent girls are anaemic. It can be tackled through proper nutrition and by giving deworming tablets once in six months and iron supplements once every week." In private hospitals, which cater to 60% of the population, pharma companies dump iron and folic acid supplements, which are in turn given to patients. "Even in public hospitals, if not anything else, these are given free of cost," she said. According to the WHO, folic acid should be taken all through pregnancy if the diet doesn't provide it. "Oral iron should be taken after the first trimester and during pre-pregnancy. Even during lactation, women are advised to take it as they lose blood in the delivery," Divakar said. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu from the Pubic Health Foundation of India told DH, "I am concerned that breastfeeding practices are not improving and have dropped in initiation within one hour of birth." Also, obesity levels are increasing in men and women, which is a dangerous sign of the shape of things to come in terms of a glaring non-communicable diseases (NCD) crisis. Besides, poor screening for cancer and a high burden of hyperglycaemia and hypertension show that NCD screening and management need to be strengthened, he said. Children under the age of three who were breastfed within one hour of birth fell from 56.3% to 49.1%. "Breastfeeding helps in decreasing pregnancy obesity and prevents women from getting type-2 diabetes. Women who are overweight or obese has increased from 23% to 30% as per NFHS-5. There is also a far-reaching association between women who don't breastfeed and breast cancer," Dr Hema Divakar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-fares-well-in-womens-reproductive-health-sex-ratio-improves-926719.html
13-12-2020||State||Karnataka legislative Council session to be reconvened on December 15||Under pressure from the government, the Legislative Council, which was “abruptly” adjourned on Thursday, will be convened again on December 15. It is speculated that the House will take up the issue of no-confidence motion against Council Chairman Pratapchandra Shetty. A BJP delegation had met Governor Vajubhai Vala on Friday seeking his intervention to direct the Council Chairperson to convene the session on December 15. The BJP MLCs contended that the Council was abruptly adjourned on Thursday though the Business Advisory Committee agenda had scheduled the proceedings till December 15. This, even as the BJP leaders had moved a no-confidence motion against Shetty. Leader of the House Kota Srinivas Poojary told DH that they wanted the government to take up the no-confidence motion on December 15. According to a senior MLC, not taking up the motion will result in a “legal battle”. “The government gave the Chairperson notice, asking him to reconvene the session to resolve the no-confidence motion. He has declined. Once the no-confidence motion is issued, the Chairman must hand over the seat to his deputy. The Chairman can defend himself and it will be put up for voting. If it is in his favour, he can be back in his seat,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-legislative-council-session-to-be-reconvened-on-december-15-926723.html
13-12-2020||State||New districts in Karnataka: Have political aspirations hijacked administrative reforms?||The state government has recently formalised the formation of Vijayanagar, a new district named after the capital of the historic Vijayanagar Empire, by dividing Ballari district. Vijayanagar will Karnataka’s 31st district and this move has revived several long-pending (and a few recent) demands for the creation of other new districts across the state. The trifurcation of Belagavi district into Chikkodi and Gokak is one such demand, while bifurcation of Tumakuru district to form a new Madhugiri district is another demand seeking Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s attention. MLC A H Vishwanath had earlier demanded that Hunsur be separated from Mysuru district and that the new district be named after former chief minister D Devaraj Urs. There have also been demands to separate Jamkhandi from Bagalkot and Sirsi fromUttara Kannada district. These demands remain controversial with much scepticism surrounding their motive. For instance, even though the Vijayanagar district has been touted as an administrative solution to a large district like Ballari, it is widely believed that the government’s decision stemmed from political pressure. The new district is seen as Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s appeasement of forest minister Anand Singh, who was among the Congress rebels who jumped to BJP in 2019. Singh, a mining baron, is said to have been keen on curtailing the influence of the Reddy brothers to Ballari. A senior Congress leader said, “Ballari was divided purely for political reasons and not administrative reasons. Of late, demands to divide districts are being made for political reasons with vote bank as the main consideration. Geographically, when a district headquarters falls within 50-60 km from any town, there’s no need to divide the district. Using this parameter, districts like Belagavi and Tumakuru need to be considered on priority for bifurcation. But the government has not acted on it.” Likewise, the demand for division of Belagavi district is also believed to be an attempt by the politically influential Jarkiholi family to fortify their control over the region, which also has other politically affluent families, such as the Hukkeris and Jolles among others. Vishwanath’s demand is seen as his attempt to thwart Siddaramaiah’s influence and regain his political clout in the region. Both leaders are from the Kuruba community. From an administration point of view, Belagavi and Tumakuru are huge districts which merited bifurcation, according to an IAS official. “In general, smaller districts with not more than four taluks are preferable for administrative ease. However, politics is taking precedence over development and district bifurcation is not scientifically planned,” the official told DH. Even with a large district, such as Belagavi, the public and political aspirations of several groups are in conflict with each other. While there are calls for trifurcation of Belagavi by carving out two new districts --- Chikkodi and Gokak --- some local groups feel such a decision would flare up the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute. “At a time when the border dispute remains unresolved, the division of the district would only help organisations, such as the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samithi to exert control over the region,” said Ashok Chandaragi, president, Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee. The committee has been actively protesting against this division, ever since it was first proposed during J H Patel’s regime in 1997, he added. The last time the state saw an extensive reorganisation of districts was during Patel’s tenure as the chief minister. At that time, seven new districts were created - Bagalkot, Udupi, Davangere, Chamarajnagar, Koppal, Gadag and Haveri. Later, during HD Kumaraswamy’s regime in 2007, Ramanagara and Chikkaballapur districts were carved out. Yadgir was the last district created in 2009 during Yediyurappa’s earlier tenure as the chief minister. The reorganisation of districts needs to be done through a committee, based on a detailed study. The policymakers need to have a rationale for splitting the districts. It cannot be done in a piece-meal manner, political analyst Sandeep Shasthri said. When politics take the front seat in this process, it leads to the creation of unviable districts, he added. The creation of new districts needs to be coupled with a political will for development. Otherwise, it is counter-productive,  senior JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti pointed out. While smaller districts are helpful in bringing the district headquarters closer to people and is helpful in getting more funds, it is futile without the political will to make use of the allocation, he said citing the instance of several districts in North Karnataka still perceived to be “backward” in development.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-districts-in-karnataka-have-political-aspirations-hijacked-administrative-reforms-926741.html
13-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19 death rate among men 2.1 times more than amid women, finds Karnataka data||The death rate among men with Covid-19 is nearly 2.1 times that of women, an assessment by state health authorities has found.  The finding tallies with an international study that finds that men hit with Covid-19 are not only more prone to going into ICU but that most of the deaths that have happened in ICUs are of men.  Dr Thrilok Chandra, head of the Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU), said the finding has been made as the result of an ongoing assessment of deaths. "Within the limits of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) alone, 3,25,999 men were infected with Covid-19 as opposed to 1,40,993 women up to December 9. Out of this, 2,876 who died were men. This is 2.1 times the number of women who died (1,334)," he said. Dr Chandra said the numbers corroborate an international study which has found that males are more prone to developing serious complications due to the disease. The study, which was published in Nature Communications, by researchers primarily in the United Kingdom, found that while there was no difference in the proportion of males and females infected with Covid-19, male patients have almost three times the odds of requiring ICU care, while facing higher odds of death compared to females. In Karnataka, the official data shows that out of 11,880 people who died of the disease up to December 8, 40 were children, out of which 24 were males. Among adults, the gap increased significantly. Another 557 people had either died at home or had been brought dead. Out of the remaining 11,283 people who had succumbed to the disease in hospitals, 7,843 were males aged 19 and above while 3,440 were females. "In Karnataka, most Covid-19 deaths are ICU deaths," Dr Chandra clarified. The findings have important implications for clinical management and mitigation strategies for Covid-19. Why women fare better Dr Anoop Amarnath, also of the CCSU and Head of Clinical Research and Scientific Review Board at Manipal Hospitals, said fundamental differences in the immune response between males and females could be responsible for why women are largely spared the lethal effects of Covid-19. "For example, the estradiol hormone which is found in women plays a role in curtailing cytokine storms. In contrast, the male testosterone hormone suppresses the immune system," Dr Amarnath said. The study also points to the fact that females have a higher number of CD4+ T-cells, which are crucial in achieving a regulated effective immune response to pathogens. Women also have more robust CD8+ T-cells cytotoxic activity which can destroy tumour cells, plus increased B cell production of antibodies compared to males.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-death-rate-among-men-21-times-more-than-amid-women-finds-karnataka-data-926712.html
13-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka govt mulls deploying private buses||The state government on Saturday said it was exploring the option of deploying private bus operators from Monday as 17,000 buses didn’t operate on the second day of the strike by workers of the road transport corporations (RTC). Transport Minister Laxman Savadi said the strike was instigated by outsiders and reiterated his position to hold talks with “workers” to discuss the issues.  Sources close to the minister clarified that the government may deploy private buses if issues were not resolved on Sunday. “Efforts will be made to resolve issues tomorrow, failing which we will initiate talks with private bus players,” the source said, while maintaining that farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar could not be entertained as the representative of the RTC workers. “He is not part of any union or association of RTC workers,” the source explained. The protesting workers, however, refused to come to the negotiating table if not represented by Chandrashekhar and warned that deploying private buses may lead to violence. Late Saturday evening, they took a memorandum to the minister, which also intimated that the farmers’ leader has been selected as the honorary president of RTC workers. To a question, Chandrashekhar told DH that the government has called another meeting but he has not been invited. “We don’t know who has been invited for the meeting. We only know that the invitees do not include those sitting on the road for the last two days demanding justice,” he said, indicating that talks may not go anywhere. Sources in a trade union told DH that they have requested the government not to force their members to work amid strike. “This will create division and animosity among workers. We leave it to the government to take a worker-friendly approach to end the strike,” he said. Meanwhile, lakhs of commuters continued to be inconvenienced as services remained curtailed. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) operated 126 of the 5,000 buses while the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operated 210 of the 5,500 buses. The North East Karnataka Transport Corporation operated 54 of its 3,678 buses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-mulls-deploying-private-buses-926714.html

13-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka transport workers refuse govt offer, vow to continue strike||Confusion prevailed over restarting of Bengaluru and suburban bus services, which partially resumed on Sunday night, as protesting workers vowed to continue the strike two hours after the Karnataka government announced an end to the three-day strike called by the employees of the four corporations. Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, surrounded by the representatives of the striking employees, made the announcement around 6 pm, stating that the government has agreed to consider the grievances of the employees. Though the announcement fell short of the demands when Savadi rejected the idea of "government-employee status", it still gave a positive signal with hundreds of buses across the state beginning operations. Savadi said the government has agreed to provide health insurance under Arogya Sanjeevini scheme, consider the revision of pay scale in accordance with 6th pay commission, Rs 30 lakh for employees who died due to Covid-19 and a committee on inter-corporation transfer. "However, we have not agreed to provide them government-employee status," the minister said. However, hours later, leader of the striking workers R Chandrashekhar and honorary president of the workers association Kodihalli Chandrashekhar held a meeting with freedom park. At around 8 pm, an announcement was made stating that the strike will continue. With this, the government has failed to break the logjam over the demand by the Road Transport Corporation (RTC) workers who shifted gears of the strike by beginning a fast at Freedom Park on Sunday. Bus services across the state have continued to be crippled for the third day. Thousands have sat down at Freedom Park, rebuffing appeals by Transport Minister Laxman Savadi to end the strike until their demands are met. Two meetings were held from the morning but neither sides refused to change their position. Asked about the continuation of the strike despite the holding of meetings, farmers' leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, who was selected honorary president of the striking workers on Saturday, said the ball was in the court of the government. "Our representatives have taken part in the two meetings from the morning. In the first meeting, we placed before them a list of 10 demands. In the second meeting, we had to clarify some of the issues they raised with regard to the demands," he explained. The third meeting began around 3.15 pm and Chandrashekhar warned that any dilution of their demand will not be allowed. The first of the 10 demands, workers said, was to give them the status of the government employee. "They have said that they will skip the first demand and take a decision on the nine other demands. However, I am telling the government, the failure to consider the first demand will make any response to the nine other demands irrelevant," he said. Chandrashekhar asked the workers what would they do if the first demand is not met. "Strike will continue," came the response from thousands of workers and their family members, including children."We shall continue then. Tomorrow (Monday), another set of workers will begin the fast," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-transport-workers-refuse-govt-offer-vow-to-continue-strike-926877.html

He made the plea during a discussion with the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), led by Union Home Ministry Joint Secretary Ramesh Kumar Ganta, that has been deputed to Karnataka to make a first-hand assessment of damage and loss caused by the floods in three spells since August. "In view of the estimated huge loss of Rs 15,410 Crores, I urge the IMCT to recommend release of central assistance to enable us to provide relief to the affected people and to take up repair of damaged infrastructure," Yediyurappa was quoted as saying by his office in a release. He thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for personally reviewing the flood situation twice through video-conference and Home Minister Amit Shah for having released Rs 577.84 crore from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) for flood relief and also for deputing a second IMCT to the state. After the August floods, the state experienced two more spells of very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall events during the second fortnight of September and mid-October. This was accompanied by very high discharges from reservoirs in Maharashtra to downstream Karnataka and this was probably the first time the state faced floods in Krishna and Bhima basins in a single year. Yediyurappa said the flood/landslides have damaged 34,794 houses, crops in more than 16 lakh hectare apart from extensive damage to critical infrastructure, totally estimated at Rs 15,410 crore. To provide immediate relief the state government has disbursed input subsidy of Rs 551.14 crore to 7.12 lakh farmers, he said. Despite severe financial constraints, Rs 1,320.48 crore has been committed for flood relief, repair and reconstruction, he said, listing the assistance given for various affected categories. The IMCT over the next two days will be travelling to flood-affected areas in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Udupi districts, official sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/loss-due-to-floods-in-karnataka-estimated-at-rs-15410-crore-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-926978.html

While Assam and Maharashtra too saw a jump on that count, their numbers are no match to Karnataka, where 44.4% women experienced such violence in 2019-20 as compared to 20.6% in 2015-16, according to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report that released its fifth round of data on 132 health and economic parameters for 22 states and Union Territories. Barring these three states, the incidences of domestic violence against women are on a decline in the remaining 19 provinces. The percentage of women in the 18-49 age group who experienced spousal violence — physical and sexual — was 20.6% in Karnataka in 2015-16 when the NFHS-4 report was released. It rose to 44.4% in 2019-20 (NFHS-5) with barely any difference between rural and urban areas. "It’s counter-intuitive to think that society has regressed so fast between two rounds (of NFHS). The reason for (such a big rise) happening only in Karnataka should be explored," Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, told DH. In Assam, the number of women experiencing domestic violence increased to 32% in 2019-20 from 24.5% in 2015-16, whereas in Maharashtra, the figure rose to 25.2% from 21.3% in the same period. Other big states with a large number of women facing spousal violence are Bihar (40.7%), Telangana (36.9%) and West Bengal (27%). Yet, in the last three states, the numbers actually dropped when compared against the figures recorded five years ago. But in the last three states, the numbers actually dropped when compared against the figures recorded five years ago. "The increase in spousal violence against women since 2015-16 reported by several states in the NFHS-5 is alarming. It reiterates the urgent need for ensuring the protection of women and girls, strengthening gender-responsive policies, and promoting social and behaviour change – all critical if India has to move the needle on gender justice and gender equality," commented Poonam Muttreja, executive director at the Population Foundation of India. The NFHS survey does not offer any explanation. But a month after the lockdown, the Karnataka High Court had asked the state government to take action against an increased number of domestic violence cases. Karnataka, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Assam are also the four big states that saw an increase in the number of young women (18-29 years) who experienced sexual violence by the age of 18. The number of such women in Karnataka is 11% in 2019-20, followed by West Bengal (9.7%), Assam (8%) and Maharashtra (6.2%). But several other parameters to measure women empowerment such as independent savings accounts, separate mobile phones and participation in household decisions, improved in the last five years. For instance, the number of women with an independent savings account rose to 76.7% in Bihar in 2019-20 from mere 26.4% in 2015-16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/domestic-violence-against-women-doubles-in-karnataka-in-2019-20-since-2015-16-nfhs-survey-927008.html
13-12-2020||West||Maharashtra: Madgyal sheep gets offer of Rs 70 lakh||A Madgyal breed sheep, known for its unique appearance and superior meat quality, has got an offer of a whopping Rs 70 lakh from a buyer in Maharashtra's Sangli district while its owner has quoted a price of Rs 1.5 crore. The Madgyal breed sheep, inhabitants of Jat tehsil in Sangli, are taller, larger and have a higher growth rate than other breeds. Hence, they are in great demand among breeders. The state's animal husbandry department is also making extensive efforts to increase the Madgyal breed's population beyond its origin, an official told PTI. This sheep breed derives its name from the Madgyal village in Jat tehsil of Sangli. Babu Metkari, a shepherd having a flock over 200 sheep in Atpadi tehsil of Sangli, was surprised when a buyer at a fair recently offered to buy one of his Madgyal sheep for Rs 70 lakh, though he did not wish to sell his prized possession. "This sheep's real name is Sarja, but it was re- christened 'Modi' after people likened him to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the way he won all elections and became PM of the country. Sarja, too, showed its dominance and ruled every fair and market it was taken," the proud owner told PTI. Metkari said as Sarja is a "lucky charm" for him and his family, he does not want to sell it. "I refused to sell to the person who offered Rs 70 lakh, but when he insisted, I quoted Rs 1.50 crore as I knew no one will shell out that much for the farm animal," he said. Metkari said he has several sheep of the Madgyal breed, but Sarja is far superior in terms of qualities, appearance and ability to reproduce. "We have been into the live-stock rearing business for two to three generations but in the last two years, we gained real profits just because of Sarja. A lamb bred by this sheep is sold between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh," he claimed. Metkari said in the last last two years, he has earned good money because of this sheep. The Madgyal sheep are taller, larger, have a higher growth rate and are considered ideal for meat production. The ruminant animal has a prominent brown ring around the eyes. Its head is convex and it has a typical Roman nose. Its ears are pendulous and leaf-like long and drooping. Maharashtra Sheep and Goat Development Corporation's assistant director Dr Sachin Tekade said in view of special qualities of the Madgyal breed, its utility, high demand and better adaptability to harsh drought-prone climate, the animal husbandry department has decided to revive the breed. "During a survey in 2003, it was found that there were only 5,319 pure Madgyal sheep available in the breeding tracts of Sangli district," said Tekade, who has been researching on the Madgyal breed for last several years. "So, an extensive programme was started with an aim to conserve and preserve the then endangered Madgyal sheep breed," said Tekade, who is also co-author of the paper 'Performance evaluation of Madgyal sheep in its breeding tract'. Under the programme, initially 500 ewes and 20 rams of pure Madgyal breed were maintained at government-run sheep breeding farms, and the improved progeny from this pure breed was distributed among shepherds in the breeding tracts of Sangli, he said. The characters of Madgyal sheep are very dominating and if it is crossed with a local breed sheep, the newborn lamb has more than 50 per cent features of Madgyal, he said. "Now, the sheep population in Sangli district is more than 1.50 lakh, predominantly comprising the Madgyal breed," he said. A proposal to register Madgyal as a separate breed has been sent tothe National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources at Karnal in Haryana, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-madgyal-sheep-gets-offer-of-rs-70-lakh-926841.html

13-12-2020||West||BJP remained busy trying to topple Maharashtra govt: CM||On the eve of the winter session of Maharashtra legislature, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday attacked the BJP for accusing his government of "non-performance", saying the Opposition party was "so busy" trying to "topple" his government that it failed to notice various welfare measures being undertaken. Addressing a press conference, Thackeray hit out at Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis for his remarks of "an undeclared Emergency" in the state. "If there is an undeclared Emergency in Maharashtra, then is there a declared Emergency in the rest of the country given the manner in which the protesting farmers are being targeted on the outskirts of Delhi?" Thackeray asked. He questioned whether "pouring water on farmers (use of water cannons) in biting cold is a sign of harmony?" Without taking names, the CM, who also heads Shiv Sena, criticised the attempts to "discredit" the protests by farmers. "The BJP should decide whether protesters have support from Pakistan, China or Maoists. You bring sugar and onions from Pakistan. Now farmers are also coming from Pakistan," he said sarcastically. Union minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said the agitation no longer remains a farmers' movement as it has been "infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements" demanding the release of those put behind bars for "anti-national activities". This was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government, he said. Another BJP leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve, who hails from Maharashtra, recently stirred a controversy with his remarks that China and Pakistan were behind the protests being staged by cultivators, inviting sharp reactions from various quarters. "If Fadnavis says the state government taking action against its critics is causing undeclared emergency then labelling farmers who are fighting for their rights as anti-nationals is worse than Emergency," Thackeray said. He said those who dub 'annadatas' (farmers) terrorists are not entitled to be called humans. "The BJP has been so busy trying to destabilise the state government that it had no time to go through the work done by us in the last year. There is no disillusionment among people about the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government," he said. Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, Fadnavis accused the government of imposing an "undeclared Emergency" and criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led regime for "going after" Republic TV's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami and Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut. Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said Fadnavis looked "demoralised" while addressing the presser. "The MVA won the recently-held Legislative Council polls held for Graduates and Teachers constituencies, which is proof that people are satisfied with the government's performance. In these polls, the BJP even lost the Nagpur Graduates seat which it never lost in the last five decades," he said. Pawar said the names sent to state governor B S Koshyari for nomination on 12 Legislative Council seats through the governor's quota be filled in a specific timeframe. "We agree to the governor's discretion and powers but there should be a timeframe for filling these seats," the deputy CM said when asked about the pending approval of the governor. Pawar said the state government was doing everything possible for the welfare of the people even as it has been battling the Covid-19 pandemic and other natural disasters. "The Centre's dues to the state towards the GST compensation have now piled up to Rs 28,000 crore. The Centre has failed to implement it's one nation one tax formula', he added. Meanwhile, when asked about the ED's questioning of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in connection with an alleged money laundering case, Thackeray said, "the Central agencies are working as if they are domestic help of the Centre". "People are intelligent and watching these developments," he said. Against the backdrop of the Supreme Court staying the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community, Thackeray said no one is trying to touch the existing OBC reservation. "Political leaders should not try to create confusion among OBCs. The government is working to get the SC to stay on the Maratha quota lifted," he said. The two-day session, curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is being held against the backdrop of the MVA government completing a year in office and its encouraging performance in the just held elections to half-a-dozen seats of the Legislative Council (one of them bypoll).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bjp-remained-busy-trying-to-topple-maharashtra-govt-cm-927001.html
