A study commissioned by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) department has revealed that 33% of the nearly 19,000 water purification plants installed across rural Karnataka are non-functional. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, who described this as a “big scam” in the Assembly following numerous complaints by MLAs, has agreed to order a probe and has requested the Speaker to constitute a joint legislature committee for the purpose. In some districts, official records were fudged to show 23% to 47% of defunct plants as functional. In other places, it was found that the plant had not even been installed. Ironically, in the dry districts of Yadgir, Dharwad, Kalaburagi and Bidar, 44% to 69% of the plants are not in operation.  The only silver lining is that 95% of the respondents found the quality of water to be good. A majority of plants were shut down due to absence of maintenance while the other reasons included drying up of water sources, low sales, more than one plant in the vicinity, no designated operator and vandalism. It appears that one of the main reasons for the current state of affairs is the failure of the vendor who set up the units to carry out regular maintenance as per the terms of the agreement. While the government should take steps to recharge water sources which have gone dry and encourage rainwater harvesting even in rural areas, it should also act against vendors who have breached their contractual obligations. Officers at the lower level who failed to act though the plants were not operational for six months, should also face action. The government should hold the chief executive officers of zilla panchayats personally responsible for this serious lapse. However, this might not warrant an investigation by a joint legislature committee, as such inquiries are time-consuming, expensive and often do not serve any tangible purpose. Now that the problem areas and deficiencies have been identified by the study, all that is required is to fix responsibility and to initiate action. An inquiry by a senior IAS officer will suffice. There are also reports that corruption charges are being raised to get even with H K Patil during whose term as RDPR Minister in the previous regime these plants were installed. While the guilty, if any, should be punished, this should not end up in a political slugfest, leaving the people who have been denied water, further in the lurch.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/water-plants-scam-punish-the-guilty-927819.html
16-12-2020||First Edit||Rising tensions in West Bengal||The attack on the motorcade of BJP president JP Nadda near Kolkata last week is the cause of the latest flare-up in the tense relations between the BJP and Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress. The BJP has alleged that the attack was carried out by TMC workers but Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has claimed that the incident was staged by the BJP. There have also been charges from the TMC side that the provocation came from the BJP convoy. Cases have been registered by the police against some TMC workers for the attack and against a BJP leader for provoking the attack. But investigations are immaterial because the incident and the attendant controversies have to be seen in the context of the politics that has been unfolding in West Bengal in the past few weeks and is set to continue in the coming months.   The fact that Bengal is heading for state assembly elections early next year is at the root of the increasing confrontation between the two sides. The BJP is aiming to replace the TMC in government after the assembly elections as the state is the most important trophy it is coveting in the eastern part of the country. It did well in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, winning 18 of the 42 seats, and has replaced the CPM and the Congress as the real opposition in the state. The party has been working to a plan, co-opting leaders from the TMC and other parties, raising issues like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state which has a large Muslim population and unleashing a high-pitched campaign across the state. The TMC has also activated itself, and the state may have already moved into the election campaign mode. Mamata Banerjee is not known to be one who gives up without a fight, and the result is the rising tensions and confrontation in the state.  The political confrontation has turned into a standoff between the Central and state governments. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar has taken a tough stance against the state government claiming that he had warned state officials about the possibility of the attack and reporting to the Ministry of Home Affairs that the security arrangements were inadequate. He has also issued public statements against the government. The MHA has, in an unprecedented action, summoned the chief secretary and the DG of Police and called three other IPS officers for Central deputation. The state government has said that it would reject the summons. The confrontation at the government and political levels may escalate in the coming days and it does not bode well or the state which has a history of political violence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/rising-tensions-in-west-bengal-928164.html

The RBI data reveals that credit from the scheduled commercial banks has shrunk to Rs 6 trillion in FY 2019-20 from a robust Rs 11.46 trillion of 2018-19. The Union government and the RBI have taken a slew of measures like bank recapitalisation, bank amalgamation, cut in the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points, creation of the new Targeted Long-Term Repo Operation (TLTRO), bad loan write off and one-time settlement of loan etc. Though these measures will encourage banks to lend, they actually need right environment to nurture thier credit cycle.  Banks’ credit cycle shows stress when wilful defaulters and their nexus work hand in glove to dupe banks. Bad loans of public sector banks rose to Rs 7.2 lakh crore in March 2020 from Rs 2.8 lakh crore in March 2015. The government should show zero tolerance to wilful defaulters and their hidden nexus as they demoralise banks, erode depositors’ trust on banks and imperil economic growth.   India’s 140 crore people earn their living from multiple economic activities in different sectors. Over three decades, a few sectors like realty, IT, manufacturing, infrastructure and services are in focus due to their integration with the global supply chain. As a result, many other sectors have lost income-generating capacity; many popular local products do not even cross the state boundary. Providing a nationwide domestic market to handloom, handicraft products, eatables, local fruits and vegetables produced in different states will add to people’s income.   Over three decades, villagers have been lured or compelled to sell their fertile agriculture land to builders, deposit their money in banks, buy unnecessary luxury items and spend more on social functions. When bank interest rate plummets and the cost of essential commodities soars, the villagers face financial crisis. Today, the urban-rural income ratio has come down to 7:1 from 2:1 in 1947 due to high input cost, scarcity of labourers, crop damage due to unseasonal rain, low price of the imported agriculture commodities and price manipulation by traders and middlemen. The government, instead of giving loan waivers and food subsidies, should provide a transparent market, preserve crop and animal diversity, recharge ground water, protect surface water, maintain law and order and inculcate repayment ethics among people. Village youth can learn online marketing of both farm and off-farm products, innovate handicraft designs, learn environment protection, develop fishery, horticulture and animal husbandry etc, which will add to their income. India’s 40 million fishermen who produce 6.3% of the global fish catch, can learn to bargain and use better technology in order to tap country’s 2.02 million sq km of exclusive economic zones, 1.91 lakh km of rivers and canals, 3.15 million hectare of reservoirs and 1.24 million hectare of brackish water. Agriculture graduates should be encouraged to start entrepreneurship in villages and senior officers after completing expensive foreign exposure training on village development should be necessarily posted in the backward districts to guide village entrepreneurs. Fastest growing Pilgrimage has been recognised as one of the fastest growing sectors as more than 330 million pilgrims move around the world every year. India’s pilgrim tourism sector will generate income if sincere efforts are made to preserve the natural beauty of those places. Construction of hundreds of unsustainable hydro-electric projects, houses, hotels and restaurants on hill slopes invited the devastating flash flood in Uttarakhand in 2013 which had killed more than 10,000 people, destroyed animal husbandry sector and made the credit cycle defunct. Thousands of farmers have lost their repayment capacity in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as the Cauvery river dries up in many places due to encroachment, intrusion of sea water, deforestation, over-damming etc. The river passes through Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to create a huge granary. “From Ganga basin alone, almost 100 gigatons of water is being withdrawn every year which is partially recovered in successive monsoons,” says Virendra M Tiwari of the National Geophysical Institute (NGRI).  If the river is revived, it could keep the credit cycle healthy in this region. Bank loans in the manufacturing sector will perform well if our industries focus on research and innovation for making high end products instead of producing tonnes of trash. “There is not a single invention from India in the last 60 years that became a household name globally,” N R Narayan Murthy, Co-founder of Infosys, has said. Banks should closely review the credit end-use, enhance investment skill, audit and supervision skill. Periodic review of the sectoral potential and auto-updated Management Information System etc, will safeguard banks’ credit cycle. In fact, the survival of banking sector depends on a healthy credit cycle.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/credit-needs-the-right-climate-to-perform-927821.html

The elected representatives and leaders of Beary-speaking communities will be invited to the foundation stone laying ceremony soon, he said. The Academy had purchased 25 cents of land at Baithurli in Neermarga for Beary Bhavana from Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), even the blueprint was readied. As few spoke Beary language in Baithurli and surrounding areas, the Academy realised that the construction of Bhavana will not benefit many. Thus Academy had appealed to the Deputy Commissioner, District-in-Charge Minister and Chief Minister for sanctioning free land Accordingly, the government sanctioned a free site for the academy in Thokkottu which has a sizeable population of those speaking the Beary language. Rahim Ucchil thanking government for sanctioning land said it was a long-pending demand of the Academy to have a Bhavana. The site purchased from MUDA will be returned and the amount refunded will be used for carrying out various activities. Due to the efforts of former Kannada and Culture Minister C T Ravi, the government had sanctioned Rs 6 crore for Beary Bhavana. Already, Rs 3 crore was released for buying land. The Beary Bhavana will be ready for public use within 12 months from the start of work. Ucchil said that the Bhavana will have a hall, mini hall, Academy office, public library and a museum. As the Bhavana comes under department of Kannada and Culture, priority will be given for activities related to Beary language, culture, literature among cultural activities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/beary-bhavana-to-come-up-at-thokkottu-927857.html

16-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Congress follows ‘goonda’ culture: BJP leaders||BJP leaders on Wednesday charged Congress leaders for creating ruckus in the Legislative Council and alleged that ‘goondaism’ is culture of the Congress party. He was speaking after inaugurating BJP Backward Classes Morcha state executive in the city. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said, “The Congress workers, who were trying to disturb peace and harmony in their constituencies, are now into goondaism inside the Council. It is a murder of democracy.” The Congress MLCs dragged Deputy Chairman of the Karnataka Legislative Council S L Dharmegowda from his chair, creating ruckus, on Tuesday. The Congress has been projecting BJP as anti-minorities and backward classes. But, Narendra Modi belongs to backward class and BJP made him the Prime Minister. The party elevated the people belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes to higher positions such as the President of India, he said. Earlier in the day, District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar charged Congress leaders and recommended to expel the MLCs, who created ruckus in the Council. Somashekar said, “The chair has its own respect and the Congress MLCs have disrespected it by dragging Dharmegowda from the seat. It is a goondaism by the Congress party. The leaders should dismiss the MLCs from the party.” Taking exception against former chief minister Siddaramaiah, he said, let Siddaramaiah, who talks about legal issues and policies, expel his party members. Was Siddaramaiah unaware about the ‘no confidence motion’ against Chairman Pratap Chandra Shetty, he asked. Minister of Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport Kota Srinivas Poojary opined that the incident might have occurred due to some confusions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/congress-follows-goonda-culture-bjp-leaders-928112.html

In a press conference here, Laxman said, "Many states have been demanding the inclusion of Muslim community into OBC. But, the community has no social discrimination and caste system and thus, it is not possible to include the community into OBC." The country has 50% OBC and the previous Congress government utilised the OBCs as vote bank. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is committed for the development of OBC and constituted the Rohini Commission to classify the backward castes in a scientific way.  The government has aimed to give 10% reservation to poor people of all the castes, but there are a few legal issues, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bjp-against-inclusion-of-muslims-into-obc-list-928113.html

16-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||JD(S) backs BJP, catches Congress off guard again||The JD(S) pulled a surprise card on Tuesday, backing the BJP’s no-confidence motion against Legislative Council Chairperson K Pratapachandra Shetty. This is yet another example of how the JD(S) is getting closer to the BJP. It was the second time that the Congress got blindsided by the JD(S) in the upper house during the winter session. About a week ago, the JD(S) voted in favour of a controversial Bill that liberalises agricultural landholdings, much to the Congress’ dismay.  “This is the legislature. Based on issues, we will have to support and oppose (BJP) sometimes. There is no connection to what happens in the House and the party outside,” JD(S) MLC Basavaraj Horatti, among the senior-most members in the upper house, told reporters on Tuesday.  “We support the BJP on the no-confidence motion because no chairperson should flout norms. We took the decision in the interest of the House,” he added.  Even outside the legislature, the JD(S) is evidently going soft on the BJP, especially its legislature party leader H D Kumaraswamy vis-a-vis Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. The JD(S), which is losing ground, is desperate for electoral survival. Sample this: When the Congress went all guns blazing against the Yediyurappa administration for alleged irregularities in Covid-19 procurement, Kumaraswamy preferred constructive criticism instead.  Kumaraswamy, during a recent outburst, suggested that the JD(S)-BJP coalition in 2006 was “more tolerable” than the one with the Congress in 2018.   Recently, the BJP and the JD(S) joined hands to take control of a district central cooperative bank in Mandya, the Vokkaliga heartland.  The JD(S) is picking and choosing its support to the BJP. While the party supported land reforms, it opposed the APMC Bill.  The Congress has repeatedly questioned the secular credentials of the JD(S) for its perceived closeness with the BJP. It is said that Kumaraswamy is wary of KPCC president D K Shivakumar in that he would decimate the party in the Old Mysore region, its stronghold. Ironically, the BJP wants to create a base in this region and a little help from the JD(S) would do well.  The Congress squarely blamed JD(S) for creating confusion. Leader of Opposition in the Council S R Patil said, “If JD(S) had signed the motion earlier, I presume that the Chairman would have resigned immediately, negating the need for all the drama.” According to one JD(S) leader, the party leadership wanted to support BJP without openly being seen as their ally. “This is a risky path,” the leader said, before painting a dystopian end: “This is what both Congress and BJP want. The JD(S) will be left an orphan.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/jds-backs-bjp-catches-congress-off-guard-again-927808.html

Going forward, I appeal to everyone to try not to bring disrepute to the Legislative Council,” he added. On December 15, the Legislative Council witnessed unprecedented scenes as BJP, Congress and JD(S) members brawled over a no-trust motion against the chairperson. Horatti called it “a black mark” on the 113-year-old Legislative Council.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/senior-mlc-horatti-says-sorry-for-council-ruckus-928041.html
16-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Ready to quit, but need to know I was right: Shetty||A day after the Legislative Council witnessed unprecedented scenes, chairperson K Pratapachandra Shetty on Wednesday offered to resign on the condition that he does not want to go out as the bad guy. “I have no intention of causing a constitutional crisis. When there is no majority on my side, I am obliged to resign. But it has to be officially made clear that I was acting in conformity with rules and that there was no error of judgment or procedural lapse from my end," Shetty told DH, adding that either the Governor or the court should provide clarity on this. Going by Shetty’s stand, the tussle is likely to drag on with both the ruling BJP and the Congress exploring the next steps, which may include a legal battle. The government might also consider taking a Cabinet decision to reconvene the Council. There is pressure on Shetty to quit, especially after the BJP and the JD(S) joined hands to move a no-confidence motion against him, leaving Congress without enough numbers to save the chairperson’s seat. Shetty, whom the BJP has accused of arbitrarily rejecting its notice to move the no-confidence motion against him, said his decision was based on legal advice. There was no legal provision for the motion to be taken up for discussion, Shetty pointed out. “The House was convened with the intention of taking up Bills and questions and answers,” he added. On December 15, the Legislative Council turned into a wrestling ring as BJP, Congress and JD(S) members brawled over the no-trust motion against Shetty. Lamenting the incident, Shetty said it was unexpected to see the deputy chairman of the JD(S) take the seat. "I felt it was not right to enter the House when he was sitting in the chair. Hence, I stayed in my chamber. Then, the secretary informed me that the situation was going out of hand. That's when I adjourned the session,” he said. That the JD(S) would side with the Congress was another unexpected turn. “When I was elected in 2018, Congress had 37 members (majority). A week later, the deputy chairman was elected with Congress' support. We naturally assumed that we had their support. I’d have 100% resigned had JD(S) announced its stand earlier. I couldn't have resigned when only 11 members signed and moved the motion,” Shetty said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/ready-to-quit-but-need-to-know-i-was-right-shetty-928100.html

Four other legislators have been given Minister of State ranks, according to notifications issued by the government. Some of these 17 MLAs were hoping to become ministers in Yediyurappa’s Cabinet, which is due for an expansion or reshuffle.

Earlier, the party used to exhibit such acts outside, but now they have displayed the same behaviour in Legislative Council by dragging Deputy Chairman SL Dharmegowda from his seat. Kateel told the reporters on Wednesday that Congress had even attacked Sudhakar when 17 rebel MLAs had switched loyalties to BJP. "Congress has been resorting to goondaism as it's unable to digest of being out of power in the state and centre," he said. "Earlier, when Congress had moved a no-confidence motion against then Legislative Council Chairman D H Shankarmyrthy, he had stepped aside and facilitated discussion on the motion. Congress too should have done the same by asking Legislative Council Chairman Pratapchandra Shetty to allow discussion, but instead, it displayed its hooliganism," he said. "The party and the government are exploring legal means to resolve the imbroglio in the Legislative Council. Since being ousted from power in the centre, Congress made many attempts to create unrest in the country but did not succeed as people have rejected it," Kateel added. "Congress leader Siddaramaiah has been making statements against me as he has a lot of affection for me," he expressed. Kateel also said that the BJP office bearers' meeting has been organised on December 20, at Bengaluru, where different issues will be discussed in preparation for the next state executive meeting to be held next month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-resorts-to-thuggery-when-out-of-power-nalin-kumar-kateel-928138.html
16-12-2020||Main Article||Limits Of A Moral State: Love and hate as state policy||There is nothing more dangerous than a leader who believes he is morally right. You cannot question him, nor criticise him, for he has seen the truth. He is the Enlightened One and is fighting for a cause; whatever that may be, his country or community. When entrusted with power his righteousness may cause untold misery to the people, for he uses the state as a moral weapon. Such a Leader believes he is the moral custodian of his people, for he wishes to build a moral society. At a mundane level, it comes down to ‘my women and my cows are my property and thou shall touch them at the peril of death’.  This leader believes he is fighting a ‘Dharma-yuddh’. That he is protecting his flock and their faith from the trickery and treachery of others trying to convert them. The problem is that the concept of right and wrong, good and evil is always community-specific. ‘Show me the community and I will show you the rules’ is the unstated dictum. He also assumes that destiny has chosen him to destroy the enemy that threatens his folk. The binary division of citizens into ‘Us /Them’, is so implicit in policymaking that it is seen as an act of benevolence.    Take the case of UP Chief Minister. He is the `Monk who became CM’, according to one of his biographers. Why monks become politicians and aspire to become ministers and CMs is a moot point. In the Hindutva hierarchy, saints and monks occupy a higher pedestal than normal politicians, though there is no evidence to suggest that they provide a more just and honest governance.   Certain obvious questions, however, seem totally beyond their ken. Is it the task of state to protect our morals or change them? Did we elect politicians or ‘Dharma gurus’? By what authority vested in them can they tell me who our daughters shall marry or what religion my family believes in. And how can anybody be punished for choosing a partner or religion? That is the central question of the new ordinance issued by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The ‘UP Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Order 2020’ states that ‘a marriage will be considered null and void if the sole intention of the same is conversion of a girl’s religion.’ Only Hindu girls are the subjects of this ordinance, secondly, only Hindu girls need to be protected from ‘misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means’ in this act of marriage which may lead to conversion. Hindu men are clearly exempt from such legislative hurdles either for marrying Muslim girls or for their conversion which may be celebrated as ‘ghar wapsi’. HC rulings Already the High Courts of Karnataka and Allahabad have weighed in on the debate and categorically stated that ‘the right of any major individual to marry the person of his/her choice is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution and the said liberty relating to the personal relationships of two individuals cannot be encroached by anybody irrespective caste or religion.’ The Allahabad HC added for good measure that this ‘would also be a threat to the concept of unity in diversity’. One may give Yogi Adityanath the benefit of doubt that he is neither aware of what is written in the Constitution nor has he heard of the principle of ‘unity in diversity’ but what about his government? Is the UP bureaucracy so inept that no one could tell the CM that his ordinance is bad in law and in morality? And why are only the BJP-ruled states seem so worried about the morality of their gullible daughters? All the BJP CMs, as if on a cue, seem threatened by Muslim men seducing Hindu girls. Who is giving them this ‘policy-diktat’? Is it our ever-caring Home Minister or is the directive coming from Nagpur? The latter seems more likely because what is it stake is the creation of a society based on Hindutva principles. A social engineering that will take us back to the Golden Age when the rule of the patriarch prevailed. Love for the ‘pitru-bhoomi’ cannot bloom unless the role of the ‘pitru’ is re-established. Hark back to the age when the women folk implicitly obeyed the command of the male in the household. The male has been traditionally idealised in our society. He is the ‘Yajamana’ who can perform ‘yaga and yagna’ and he is the one with a legal standing in the Hindu Undivided Family as the ‘Kartha’- the one who will divide and allocate properties to his children. There is a more insidious social engineering in this project. That is to remove the centrality of the ‘individual’ with all her ‘free will’ and ‘autonomy’ and replace it with ‘family’ as the ultimate unit of society. It must be remembered that the ‘individual’ is at the heart of our Constitutional universe. The vision of our Constitution and the ensuing human rights and values, such as Equality, Liberty, Fraternity and Justice are all attributes assigned to an individual and not to the family. It is her rights and liberties that are guaranteed by the Constitution and they are justiciable in a court of law. And that is precisely what is being snuffed out. The foundational purpose of the new ordinance is to curtail the Hindu girl’s choice in her marriage. For she ‘knows not’ what is good for her. It’s her family, preferably her father who will decide that for her. This is to legalise what the ‘Khap Panchayats’ in Haryana used to do without any legal sanction. The other objective, of course, is to criminalise the Muslim youth who marries a Hindu girl.

16-12-2020||Main Article||Embracing nature during pandemic: Building a positive attitude||Our relationship with nature is delightfully summed up in this quote from the popular tele-serial ‘Boston Legal’. As the lawyer on an exotic holiday tells his friend talking about environmental laws: “Let me tell you something, I came out here to enjoy nature, don’t talk to me about the environment.” This imagery of nature “out there” suggests holidays to a desired destination, with pictures duly reported on Instagram. So how do we catch up with nature and how do we connect with nature when we are under a lockdown and worrying about a second wave of the pandemic? In his 71st episode of the radio talk series ‘Mann ki Baat’ broadcast on November 29, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also touched upon the question. He noted how the pandemic had upturned our daily lives, and spoke of an opportunity to experience nature in a “new manner”. In our daily lives, lived under the regime of modernity, the fact is we are more separated from nature than ever. How many of us really get to experience the joy of seeing nature unfold in its myriad and magical ways? Modern-day living and more so in urban settings – be it squalor or splendour -- separates us at almost every step, making it more difficult to have the experiences of the kind that can breed not only curiosity and learning, but also a sense of joy and connectedness. Society is today almost designed to cut us off, to sanitise reality and to make it easy to navigate in a world of make-believe. The supermarket brings us our consumables often shrink-wrapped or sealed in a plastic packet – be it chicken legs, two-minute meals, breads and bakes or a host of other foods that are bought not on the basis of whether they are healthy or ethical but where there is a Bogo (Buy-One-Get-One) offer going on it. The market and its marketing efforts nudge us all the time. Simple foods have turned into complex nutrient analysis. Further, these foods are bought and often consumed in front of a screen that often blurts out more marketing messages. All of this is separation from nature that feeds into lifestyle, health, learning and growth of our children. A little reflection and a rethink can change all this. Nature is joy, not far away but right here and now – dancing in a blade of grass, the shades of green in the local trees and shrubbery, in the fruit we eat and the bird chirping on the branch outside the window. We need to call attention to this omnipotent presence. In exercises on mindfulness, participants are often given one raisin to touch, feel, and soak-in the ridges of that tiny bead so that we can become familiar with what we are about to eat. This raisin is then placed on the tongue as we exert to feel its shape, form, and myriad minutiae on the tongue, and then, slowly, chew it and enjoy every bit of the nourishment. The palate is fulfilled, the body is nourished, and the mind is also nourished – all with one raisin. This is the attention that can offer much more in return. Appreciation of nature takes us to ideas of gratitude, gratefulness for all that is offered to us and here begins a virtuous cycle of happiness that is in itself nourishing the mind and building a positive attitude to everyday living. There is no escaping this joy. It is waiting to be granted to everyone who can bring to attention nature that abounds all around us. A simple way to understand this connection with nature is the wonderment of the face of a child seeing slices of nature – fruit on a tree, a rainbow or the delights of rain. Inner feeling The benefits are untold and far too many to be recounted here. For example, it is well known that nature helps bring out that inner feeling of joy, helps fight depression and takes us closer to a sense of wonder. The University of Minnesota reported that “being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings.” “Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones...Research done in hospitals, offices, and schools has found that even a simple plant in a room can have a significant impact on stress and anxiety,” the University said in material put up by its Earl A Bakken Center for Spirituality and Healing. In November 2020, a study published in a journal called ‘Ecological Applications’ indicated that nature can help mitigate some of the negative effects of Covid-19. This was a study of five mental health outcomes, namely depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem and loneliness, along with two specifics related to experiencing nature: frequency of green-space use and green view through windows from home. Responses were obtained through a questionnaire administered to a sample size of 3,000 adults in Tokyo, Japan. The study’s lead author, Dr Masashi Soga, was quoted by Science Daily as saying: “Our results suggest that nearby nature can serve as a buffer in decreasing the adverse impacts of a very stressful event on humans. Protecting natural environments in urban areas is important not only for the conservation of biodiversity, but also for the protection of human health.” Science Daily  wrote, “more frequent greenspace use and the existence of green window views from the home were associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness, as well as decreased levels of depression and loneliness.” So there we have it, formally in a report, some deep truths that were always known to the ancients. To be healthy, embrace nature, and you can do so at arm’s reach, even in the lockdown.

16-12-2020||National||Rajnath calls up US counterpart as Trump admin's CAATSA sanctions on Turkey worries India||The move by President Donald Trump’s administration in Washington DC to impose sanctions on Turkey for buying S-400 Triumf air defence systems from Russia triggered concerns in New Delhi, prompting Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to call up his acting counterpart in the US, Christopher C Miller, on Tuesday. Singh told Miller that India-US defence partnership “matured into a strategic nature over the last decade”. “The year 2020 was a landmark year in the India-US defence relationship,” he tweeted, after speaking to his counterpart. The defence minister called up his US counterpart amid concerns in New Delhi, where many saw in Trump Administration’s move to slap sanctions on Turkey as a not-so-subtle warning to India, which too inked a Rs 39,000 crore deal to buy the S-400 Triumf long-range surface-to-air missile systems from Almaz-Antey Corporation of Russia in October 2018 and the delivery is expected to start in 2021. The US on Monday also asked “other countries” to take note and avoid acquisition of military hardware from Russia. “A strong foundation has been laid for the India-US relations over the years,” Singh told Millers, citing several bilateral deals the two nations inked since 2016 to boost bilateral defence cooperation. He apparently sought to drive home the point that any attempt by the Trump Administration to browbeat New Delhi and stop it from buying weapon systems from Russia would have an impact on India-US defence cooperation and the deepening strategic convergence between the two nations in the Indo-Pacific region. Not only the S-400 missile systems, the ongoing military stand-off along the disputed India-China boundary in eastern Ladakh also prompted New Delhi earlier this year to fast-track purchase of MiG-29 and Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft from Russia. The procurement of the 21 MiG 29s from Russia and upgrading the 59 previously acquired aircraft would cost India approximately Rs 7418 crore. The 12 Su-30 MKIs would be manufactured by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in India under license from Sukhoi Aviation JSC of Russia, involving an expenditure of Rs 10730 crore. India’s big-ticket defence deals with Russia makes it vulnerable to the US sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) – the same law that the Trump Administration invoked to impose sanctions on Turkey. The US Congress in July 2017 passed the CAATSA to impose sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. Trump signed it into law in August 2017 and its scope was further expanded in October 2017. The Section 231 of the CAATSA mandated secondary sanctions to any nation entering into high-value deals to procure military hardware from Russia. New Delhi has been discussing with the US, arguing for exemption from the US sanctions mandated by the CAATSA. The Trump Administration, however, remained non-committal, underlining that the CAATSA itself had no provision for exemptions for India or any other particular country entering into a defence deal with Russia and the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, would take calls on imposing sanctions mandated by the 2017 Act or granting exemptions on a case-to-case basis. “We hope that other countries around the world will also take note that the United States will fully implement CAATSA Section 231 sanctions and that they should avoid further acquisitions of Russian equipment, especially those that could trigger sections,” Christopher Ford, the American Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation, said after announcing the sanctions on Turkey on Monday. Trump fired his Secretary of Defence Mark Esper and replaced him with Miller soon after most of the TV networks called the US presidential elections and declared his defeat to Joe Biden. Esper had accompanied US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to New Delhi for the India-US 2+2 talks with Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on October 27 last. Though the Trump Administration is now on his way out, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is still worried over the possibility of it making any move within the next few weeks to impose the CAATSA sanctions on India to stop it from buying weapons from Russia. Besides, New Delhi is of the view that the possibility of the US using the CAATSA sanctions to put pressure on India and to make it stop buying military hardware from Russia might continue to loom large even after the change of guard in the White House, given Biden’s tough stand on Vladimir Putin’s regime in Moscow. Putin’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, last week publicly accused the US of putting “very tough pressure” on India to make it curtail its decades-old defence ties with Russia.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajnath-calls-up-us-counterpart-as-trump-admins-caatsa-sanctions-on-turkey-worries-india-927783.html

Seeking to portray acceptance of the reforms, Tomar met a delegation of farmers from All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC), founded by late Sharad Joshi, who declared their support for the farm sector reforms. Reaching out to farmers in his address from Dhordo, a major tourist attraction in Kutch district, PM Modi said, "Friends, the agriculture reforms are exactly the same as sought by farmer bodies and even opposition parties for years. These opposition parties supported these laws when they were in power but couldn't make a decision. Now that these have become laws, they are misleading the farmers that their lands will be taken away."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-farmers-protest-govt-ready-to-listen-927837.html

16-12-2020||National||Virus trains: How lockdown chaos spread Covid-19 across India||The crowds surged through the gates, fought their way up the stairs of the 160-year-old station, poured across the platforms and engulfed the trains. It was May 5, around 10 a.m. Surat was beastly hot, 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius). Thousands of migrant laborers were frantic to leave — loom operators, diamond polishers, mechanics, truck drivers, cooks, cleaners — the backbone of Surat’s economy. Two of them were Rabindra and Prafulla Behera, brothers and textile workers, who had arrived in Surat a decade ago in search of opportunity and were now fleeing disease and death. Rabindra stepped aboard carrying a bag stuffed with chapatis, an Indian flatbread. His older brother, Prafulla, clattered in behind, dragging a plastic suitcase packed with pencils, toys, lipstick for his wife and 13 dresses for his girls. “You really think we should be doing this?” Prafulla asked. “What else are we going to do?” Rabindra said. “We have nothing to eat and our money’s out.” They were among tens of millions of migrant workers stranded without work or food after Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a national coronavirus lockdown in March. By spring and summer, these workers were so desperate that the government provided emergency trains to carry them back to their home villages. The trains were called Shramik Specials, because shramik means “laborer” in Hindi. But they became the virus trains. India has now reported more coronavirus cases than any country beside the United States. And it has become clear that the special trains operated by the government to ease suffering — and to counteract a disastrous lack of lockdown planning — instead played a significant role in spreading the coronavirus into almost every corner of the country. The trains became contagion zones: Every passenger was supposed to be screened for Covid-19 before boarding but few if any were tested. Social distancing, if promised, was nonexistent, as men pressed into passenger cars for journeys that could last days. Then the trains disgorged passengers into distant villages, in regions that before had few if any coronavirus cases. One of those places was Ganjam, a lush, rural district on the Bay of Bengal, where the Behera brothers disembarked after their crowded trip from Surat. Untouched by the virus, Ganjam soon became one of India’s most heavily infected rural districts after the migrants started returning. Many people in Ganjam’s villages had no idea what coronavirus symptoms were — until people around them started dying. “There was a very direct correlation between the active Covid cases and the trains,” said Keerthi Vasan V., a district-level civil servant in Ganjam. “It was obvious that the returnees brought the virus.” The tragic irony is that Modi’s lockdown inadvertently unlocked an exodus of tens of millions. His government and especially his Covid-19 task force, dominated by upper-caste Hindus, never adequately contemplated how shutting down the economy and quarantining 1.3 billion people would introduce desperation, then panic and then chaos for millions of migrant workers at the heart of Indian industry. A top economic adviser to Modi, Sanjeev Sanyal, confirmed that the administration had been aware of the risks posed by moving people from urban hot spots to rural areas but said that the situation had been managed “quite well.” Railroad officials also insist that the trains were the safest way to get migrant workers home. “India has done extraordinarily well in managing the spread of disease compared to some of the materially most advanced countries of the world,” said D.J. Narain, a Ministry of Railways spokesman. In all, the government organized 4,621 Shramik Specials, moving more than 6 million people. As they poured out of India’s cities, which were becoming hot spots, many returnees dragged the virus with them, yet they kept coming. Surat, an industrial hub, saw more than half a million workers leave on the trains. “It felt like doomsday,” said Ram Singhasan, a ticket collector. “When you saw how many people were thronged outside, it looked like the end of the world was coming.” A Lockdown Unlocks an Exodus On March 24, at 8 p.m., Modi hit the lockdown switch. In a televised address, he ordered the entire nation to stay inside their homes for three weeks — starting in four hours. The decision was pure Modi: sudden, dramatic and firm, like when he abruptly wiped out nearly 90% of India’s currency bills in 2016, a bolt-from-the-blue measure that he said was necessary to fight corruption but proved economically devastating. Prafulla and Rabindra Behera had just finished a dinner of rice, lentils and potatoes, their usual fare. They lived in squalid, bare rooms in Surat’s industrial zone, sleeping wall to wall on the floor with a half dozen other laborers. Within minutes of Modi’s address, they started getting calls. “Everyone was thinking the same: This will be over soon and somehow we’ll pass the days,” Rabindra said. At the time, India had fewer than 600 known virus cases. Many experts have criticized Modi’s government for overlooking the plight of migrant laborers, who suddenly had no work, no income and no support network in the cities. The government’s Covid-19 task force lacked migrant specialists and was hardly representative of India. Of its 21 members, only two were women and the rest were largely upper-caste men. Many of the migrant laborers came from lower castes and economically underprivileged backgrounds. Harsh Vardhan, India’s health minister, responded by saying that “not even in our wildest imaginations do we think about the caste” and that the task force’s members had been chosen for their “competence, capabilities and intellectual abilities.” Modi’s lockdown closed all public transport, and immediately, some migrants began walking hundreds of miles, desperate to return to their home villages, where living was cheaper and they could find family support. After Modi declared a second lockdown in mid-April, the stream of migrants turned into a humanitarian disaster. Tens of millions poured out of the cities, and India’s airwaves were dominated by horrific scenes of migrants and their families dying along the roads, from thirst, heat, hunger and exhaustion. In New Delhi, railroad officials concluded there was no way to stop the migrants, said Arun Kumar, the head of the railroad police. “And we knew that one day or another we would have to carry them,” he said. India’s railroads ferried more than 8 billion passengers a year before the pandemic, traversing a network of 42,253 miles of track, enough to go around the earth nearly twice. It’s one of the world’s busiest train networks, the blood vessels of this country. Pressure was growing on Modi to use it. Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister of Odisha state, which includes Ganjam, said he spoke to Modi about the plight of migrants. “I knew that in this chronic situation that they would want to come home,” Patnaik said. The trains, he said, were the answer, but he emphasized that the key thing would be to bring back the workers “gradually.” In Surat, the Behera brothers were down to their last bag of rice. They could not work — the factories were closed. But they weren’t allowed to leave the city, where virus cases were beginning to surge. “We were trapped,” Rabindra said. On May 1, India’s Labor Day, the railways ministry made a grand announcement: Shramik Specials. Routes were drawn up from Surat, Mumbai, Chennai, New Delhi, Ahmadabad and other cities deep into rural areas. But Prafulla Behera, 39, was reluctant to get on a train. There was no work back in Ganjam — that’s why he had left in the first place. Prafulla was respected back home, known to be both strong and affectionate. He never complained about having four daughters, even though just about everyone in the village wants sons. His younger brother, Rabindra, 32, usually did what Prafulla asked. But this time, Rabindra pushed back. “If we’re going to die,” Rabindra said, “we should die at home.” A Rural District Explodes The Behera brothers rode for 27 hours across the width of India, about 1,000 miles, in a second-class, non-air-conditioned train packed to capacity. The heat seemed to be getting to Prafulla. During the journey, he complained of having a fever. They stepped off in Ganjam on May 6, around 1 p.m., exhausted and dehydrated, among the first wave of migrants to return. Far from any major city, Ganjam is a socially conservative, underdeveloped district with endless rice fields, empty beaches, squiggly Candy Land roads and a long tradition of its people pulling for each other. Initially, the news that loved ones were coming home was greeted with excitement. “There was no fear,” said Santosh Kumar Padhy, a block chairman. “The villagers were planning welcome ceremonies.” Ganjam’s officials hurriedly converted hundreds of schools into quarantine centers, drafted a workforce of 10,000 people and adapted their freight train station to handle the Shramik Specials, which were longer than typical passenger trains. The Beheras were told they would quarantine for 21 days at a center and each was given a toothbrush, a slice of soap, a bucket to wash with and a thin sheet to sleep on. But the next morning, Prafulla awoke with a splitting headache. A doctor didn’t think he had coronavirus but suggested, as a precaution, that he be moved into the courtyard, away from the other men. The following morning, Prafulla could barely breathe and called his wife on his cellphone. “Come and bring the girls,” he whispered. “I need to see you.” An hour later, he was dead. A subsequent test revealed that Prafulla Behera was Ganjam’s first coronavirus death. Across the district, people began falling sick. The first dedicated Covid-19 hospital, with fewer than 60 intensive care beds, quickly filled; patients had to be laid out on the floors. Testing was still relatively low but when authorities zeroed in on suspected carriers they found high positivity rates. After Prafulla’s death, Rabindra and six other men who had traveled with him were tested. Six out of seven tested positive. But the Shramik Specials kept coming — four, five, six, sometimes 16 a day, each carrying as many as 2,000 migrants, many from Surat. Across India, state leaders were under pressure from voters urging them to rescue stranded family members. Yet some recognized that the trains could mean trouble. “It will lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases,” predicted Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal’s chief minister, in late May. “Who will take the responsibility then?” A group of researchers at one of India’s most prestigious universities, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, submitted a scientific paper in May, which was published a few months later, predicting that virus cases in Bihar, a rural state, would jump by 800% when migrants returned. In New Delhi, health officials warned against packing the trains. There was no way to test most passengers. India was performing about 70,000 tests a day in early May, far fewer than the number of migrants lined up on train platforms some mornings. Passengers were supposed to undergo temperature checks with laser thermometers. Middle seats were supposed to be empty for social distancing. But in Ganjam, trains arrived “more than 100%” full, said Vijay Amruta Kulange, Ganjam’s collector, the top civil servant in the district. Ganjam, with a population of around 3.5 million, was absorbing as many as 20,000 migrants a day and didn’t have enough schools to hold everyone. At one overcrowded center, migrants mutinied, smashing light bulbs and jamming toilets with plastic bottles, trying to be freed. To open up more space, the authorities dropped the quarantine period from 21 days to seven. At the district’s first Covid-19 hospital, Dr. Umashankar Mishra said that at one point, the oxygen supply for 200 patients came within 15 minutes of running out. Mishra called the suppliers in a panic, only to learn that the truck carrying the oxygen cylinders was stuck at a railroad crossing. “I never felt so bad in my life,” Mishra recalled. When the truck finally arrived, Mishra bear-hugged one cylinder and waddled into intensive care. If the truck had arrived any later, he said, “it would have been a massacre.” A Desperate Response Workers at the quarantine centers were among the first to get infected. An entire group of cooks in Konkarada village came down with body aches. “We thought it was from working too hard,” said Bonita Pradhan, one of the cooks. She tested positive, as did nine out of 10 of the other cooks. A broader survey in Konkarada found that 80 out of 100 people were coronavirus positive. Across India, the same crisis unfolded: Poor communities, with few hospitals, witnessed sharp spikes in infections weeks after the Shramik Specials arrived. “For the virus to reach villages, it needed a carrier, a speedy one,” said Thekkekara Jacob John, a senior virus expert in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. “Then came the migrants, and particularly those who traveled by train. They wreaked havoc, wherever they went, unintentionally.” In two rural districts in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, infections surged and are now above 40,000 cases, more than twice India’s per capita average. Similar surges were reported in states such as Nagaland, Bihar, Assam and, especially, in Chhattisgarh. “Eighty percent of deaths and infections have happened in the rural areas after the arrival of the migrants,” said Tribhuwaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, a minister in Chhattisgarh’s state government. “The first mistake the central policymakers made was not checking the migrants at the station where they started from. The second was to open the floodgates all at once.” In Bihar, state health officials said returning migrants were responsible for 70% of the first wave of infections. “The quarantine centers turned into coronavirus hubs,” said Dr. Raj Kishore Chaudhary, a Bihar health official. “If asymptomatic patients would leave the center without getting detected, the cases would shoot up in areas where they lived.” Aftermath By the end of June, dozens of villages in Ganjam had been sealed off. Residents were ordered to stay inside. Police officers patrolled the silent lanes. Taxis were converted into ambulances. Volunteers sewed masks, cooked food and answered help calls. At the quarantine centers, schoolteachers led yoga classes. The whole district was mobilized and straining. “Imagine people are coming at 2 or 3 a.m. in the night, you receive them, register them, give them their kits, arrange where they will be staying. Doing all this, one gets tired,” admitted Naba Krishna Jena, an officer in the Ganjam government. “So when the crowd grew so big, compromises happened. And because of those compromises, the infections happened and spread.” The trains finally stopped coming to Ganjam on June 30. By then, officials had raised the quarantine period back to 14 days and opened other Covid hospitals, but the outbreak was already out of control. In late June, Simanchal Satapathy, a popular teacher who became a champion for the rights of the migrants at the quarantine center that he oversaw, was admitted to a hospital but misdiagnosed three times: first with malaria, then pneumonia, then tuberculosis. It wasn’t until a week after Satapathy, 26, came down with a high fever that he was tested for coronavirus. He was positive and soon died. “I used to cradle him as a baby,” said his uncle, Pradeep Kumar Satapathy, breaking down. “We had no idea he had Covid.” Ganjam’s caseload peaked in August and, overall, the district has reported 22,000 cases and 320 deaths, roughly the national average, according to Mishra, the physician who ran its Covid-19 hospital. Kulange, the district’s top official, said Ganjam would have recorded “single-digit cases” had the migrants not come back. “It was clear cut,” he said. Most cases in Ganjam caused only mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization. But no one is certain of the district’s real death toll, just as that figure remains a mystery across the country. India has reported far fewer virus deaths per capita than many Western nations, but experts caution that 80% of all deaths in the country are not medically certified. Patnaik, Odisha’s chief minister, said the Modi administration should have run the trains “in a more humane way” and before infections became so rampant in the cities. But he, too, agreed that once the migration started, it was impossible to stop. “This being a free country, I don’t think there was any way of controlling it,” he said. Railroad officials said they had worked their hardest to safely transport 6.3 million people “in the most trying circumstances.” When asked to respond to the data showing that the virus had spread rapidly in many districts after the trains arrived, Narain, the railroad spokesman, said much was still unknown about Covid-19 and “correlation of every kind is not necessarily causation.” Vardhan, the health minister, said that the Modi administration had started the trains as soon as it could, given that states needed time to prepare quarantine centers first. Opposition politicians have pushed for a parliamentary inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic but members of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party have blocked them. In October, India’s Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit calling for an independent investigation. In Ganjam, the scars are still fresh. The home where Simanchal Satapathy, the teacher, lived with his parents is now deserted. After he was told that his son had died, Satapathy’s father went to the market, paid off his debts and came home with a rope. He hanged himself from a tree. Satapathy’s mother also killed herself. She was found hanging from a ceiling fan. Rabindra Behera eventually returned to Surat, by train. His brother had been right: There was no work in Ganjam. And now Prafulla Behera’s widow and four daughters have no one to support them. The plastic suitcase that Prafulla brought home, packed with gifts, was destroyed at the quarantine center. His daughters never got their 13 dresses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/virus-trains-how-lockdown-chaos-spread-covid-19-across-india-927847.html

Geeta was 7 or 8 years' old when she was found sitting alone in the Samjhauta Express at Lahore station by Pakistan Rangers around 20 years ago. She was adopted there by a person from Edhi Foundation. She was brought back to India on October 26, 2015 following efforts made by then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, who called her "Hindustan ki beti" (India's daughter). Swaraj had also met her and assured that the government was making every effort to trace her parents. Geeta, believed to be around 30 years old now, is currently living at the 'Anand Service Society', an NGO working for disabled persons, in Madhya Pradesh's Indore city. Several couples have come forward claiming to be her parents, but she has not recognised any of them and none could substantiate their claims. Government officials from Indore and the NGO have been trying to trace her home and parents. Geeta has also not given up hope and visited Nanded on Tuesday along with members of the NGO to search for her home and family. During an interaction with reporters here with the help of the NGO's sign language expert Gyanendra Purohit, who has accompanied her, Geeta said she has been trying to find her parents. She conveyed that her home was near a railway station with a hospital, temple and river nearby. Purohit said they have come to Nanded in this context. "A train called Sachkhand Express runs from Nanded to Amritsar, and the Samjhauta Express, in which she was found, operates from Amritsar to Pakistan," he said. "A town called Basar in Telangana, located around 100 km from Nanded, resembles the place Geeta describes as her childhood home, so we came here," Purohit said. Nanded's police inspector Dwarkadas Chikhlikar told PTI that their team was providing all help to Geeta, Purohit and others accompanying her. "Our team accompanied her during the search and it will work with the NGO members as long as Geeta is here," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/5-years-after-return-from-pakistan-geeta-searches-for-family-in-maharashtra-927882.html

16-12-2020||National||Farmers' protest: Security beefed up at Chilla border||Security arrangements were tightened at the Chilla border between Delhi and Noida on Wednesday as farmer union leaders have threatened to completely block the key border point to press for repeal of the Centre's new farm laws. A senior police officer said elaborate security measures are already in place at the Chilla border. Multi-layered barricades, jersey barriers and additional security personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order. He added that only a small group of protesters were on a sit-in at the key border point, and the situation was largely normal. Farmer leaders had on Tuesday said they would "make" the government repeal the new legislations, and asserted that their fight has reached a stage where they are "determined" to win no matter what. The farmer unions are not running away from negotiations, but the government has to pay heed to their demands and come forward with concrete proposals, the leaders said. Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points for 21 days on the trot, causing closure of several routes. According to the police, Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Sabholi and Mangesh borders are closed. Commuters have been advised to take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad and Singhu school toll tax borders, while traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road. The Outer Ring Road, GTK road and NH-44 should be avoided, they said. Meanwhile, Gazipur border also remains closed for traffic coming from Gaziabad to Delhi due to the protests. Commuters have been advised to take other routes via Anand Vihar, DND, Chilla, Apsara and Bhopra borders. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-security-beefed-up-at-chilla-border-927902.html

16-12-2020||National||Farmers' protests complete three weeks: Story so far||Farmers' protests at Delhi's borders are set to complete three weeks with numerous rounds of negotiations with the Modi-led BJP government hanging in air. Farmers are protesting Centre's new farm laws saying the reforms will destroy the Minimum Support Price or the MSP system and leave them at the 'mercy' of the corporate bigwigs. The government claims that the laws are for the benefit of the people. The Opposition has backed the farmers' movement and accused the Centre of letting corporates exploit the farmers.  Here's the complete story so far and where it's going: On November 26. several farmers, predominantly from Haryana and Punjab, set to march towards Delhi as part of their protests against the  laws Delhi Police initially denied permission for protests and asked farmers to stay put citing the Covid-19 pandemic. The police also threatened with legal retaliation if the farmers continue to go ahead with the protests. However, Haryana farmers continued with the march anyway. The BJP government in the state blocked borders and bridges preventing the farmers from entering Delhi. Protestors agitated by the heavy force and blockade threw barricades off the bridge into the river below and clashed with the police. The cops used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd, While Punjab CM Amarinder Singh backed the farmers and condemned Khattar-govt's use of brute force, the Haryana chief hit back at Singh, accusing him of "inciting innocent farmers." SAD chief Badal termed the move to prevent farmers from protesting "Punjab's 26/11." After the farmers pushed through the barricades, security was amped up at the Delhi's nearby borders, like Singhu. Heavy forces were deployed and the roads were blocked with sand-laden trucks and barb wires. By November 27 evening, various farmers' groups from several places across Punjab, Haryana and other neighbouring states had reached Delhi borders, facing a wall of blockades and a pall of tear gas. By nightfall, Delhi police allowed farmers to enter the city to protest at Nirankari ground at Burari. Several farmers moved into the city but thousands camped at the borders. The next morning, accompanied by more farmers, the leaders decided to stay at the borders and refused to move to the government-designated spot in North Delhi.  As more farmers gathered at the national capital's borders, pressure grew on the Centre after various opposition parties including Congress, AAP, TMC and the Left backed the farmers. The government then offered for talks with leaders, meeting on December 1 for the first time since the 'Delhi Chalo' protests began.  Sikhs across the world took stock of the protests, few even protested in UK and US. Canada PM backed the farmers and supported "peaceful protests."  India dismissed it as an internal issue and termed the comments "ill-informed." With the traffic around Delhi in chaos and various entries blocked, the farmers' talks with the Centre remained inconclusive and decided to meet yet again on December 3, dragging the protests into a second week.  The Centre and farmers met twice in the second week, both times ending in a deadlock. Senior Union Minister including Shah and Agriculture Minister Tomar huddled to enter a decisive phase in the farmer crisis.  Meanwhile, support for the farmers grew with almost all of the opposition demanding the repeal of the new laws and some called for a parliament session to discuss the issue. Punjab sportspersons threatened to return awards if the laws were not taken back.  Boxer Vijender Singh said he will return Khel Ratna if "black laws" not withdrawn On December 5, the fifth round of talks also hit a roadblock. The farmers vowed to intensify protests and called for a 'Bharat Bandh' The nation-wide protests were backed by over 30 opposition parties and various trade unions.  After several rounds of talks with farmers failed, the Centre continued to offer amendments to the farm laws only to be rejected by the protesters. Farmers then went onto block more roads such as the Delhi-Jaipur highway and occupying toll plazas in their fight against the Centre.  Nearing the end of the third week of agitation, the government remained firm on the laws, refusing a repeal while the farmers continue to remain adamant on 'making' them withdraw all the three new laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protests-complete-three-weeks-story-so-far-927912.html

A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde proposed a panel, consisting of representatives of farmers unions across the country, government and other stakeholders to resolve the issue. The agitation by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh at Delhi borders entered the 21st day as several rounds of talks with the Union Agriculture Ministers and others remained unsuccessful. The court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that it intended to set up the committee, as the issue will soon become national issue and the government seemingly may not be able to work out the solutions. "Your negotiation does not work apparently. You should be willing to negotiate and we should have a farmer before us who is also willing to negotiate give us the name of the Union," the bench asked Mehta. As Mehta agreed to give the names, the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, posted a PIL by a law student, Rishabh Sharma for ending the agitation, along with other pleas by advocates Reepak Kansal and G S Mani for consideration on Thursday. Mehta submitted that the government would not do anything against the interest of farmers. He said the farmers were protesting and the Delhi police have blocked the roads. He suggested that the farmers can sit with the government and then there can be a discussion or debate with an open mind on each clause of the three contentious farm laws. The court issued a notice to the Centre on the PIL seeking removal of farmers from blocking the roads at Delhi borders and other pleas for providing the farmers with facilities and address the issues raised by them. The petitioner referred to the apex court's judgement of October 7 in the Amit Sahni case (Shaheen Bagh) where it was held public roads and spaces can't be occupied in an indefinite manner for protests, causing inconvenience to the people, as such demonstrations must be organised at designated places only. The court also issued notice to Bhartiya Kisan Union's different factions as well as other organisations including Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, and Kul Hind Kisan Federation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-bats-for-panel-as-govt-farmers-talks-not-working-notice-to-centre-states-on-pleas-for-removing-protesting-farmers-927914.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notices to the Environment Ministry and four members of the EAC whose appointments to the committee have been opposed in the petition filed by environment activist and retired Indian Forest Services officer Manoj Mishra. In the plea filed through advocates Ritwick Dutta and Shristi Agnihotri, Mishra has challenged the ministry's July 10 notification constituting the EAC for environmental appraisal of thermal power and coal mining projects, claiming that no expert has been appointed to the 15-member committee. According to his petition, the notification shows that nine ‘non-officials’ and six officials have been appointed to the EAC, but no expert as is mandatory under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. and the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 2006. The petition has contended that the EIA notification does not make any reference to ‘officials’ and ‘non-officials’. It has also claimed that the four members of the EAC, whose appointments have been specifically challenged in the plea, do not meet the criteria laid down in the 2006 EIA notification, and two of them also have conflict of interests as they are serving on the board of public sector companies who are into coal mining and coal-fired power plants. One of the four, Gururaj P Kundargi, has been appointed as chairman of the EAC, according to the petition which has claimed that he is on the board of various public sector companies, some of which are seeking environment clearances for coal mining or thermal power projects. Mishra has contended that serving on board of such companies would not make a person an expert to be appointed as a member or chairman of the EAC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-pil-challenging-appointments-to-expert-appraisal-committee-on-environment-927915.html
16-12-2020||National||SC notice to Centre on PIL for uniform grounds of maintenance, alimony for all||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Union government to respond to two separate PILs for uniform grounds for divorce and maintenance and remove discriminatory procedure prevailing in different communities for being violative of fundamental rights to equality. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice to the Centre on two PILs filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay. During the hearing, the bench asked senior advocates Pinky Anand and Meenakshi Arora, appearing for the petitioners, "How can we remove discriminatory practices without interfering in personal laws?" Anand, for her part, said the top court did intervene in the Shayara Bano (by declaring triple talaq unconstitutional) case. The court then said, under Article 146 of the Constitution, the directions given by it will exist till the law are brought in. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora said for two years, there is no one to head the Law Commission.  "If we look at certain provisions of the Muslim law, then maintenance can go on only for the period of Biddat. The woman is left with nothing," she said. The petitioner asked the court to frame guidelines for uniform grounds of divorce and remove discriminatory procedure prevailing in different communities. He sought a direction to the Centre to take apposite steps to remove anomalies in the grounds of divorce and make them uniform for all citizens without prejudice on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  Alternatively, he sought a direction to the Law Commission to examine the issue and give its suggestion within three months. The petitioner contended that different grounds of divorce reinforced patriarchal and stereotypical notions about women. He said the cause of action arose on September 13, 2019, when the Supreme Court in Jose Paulo Coutinho Case once again pressed the need for uniform civil laws and cited the example of Goa. But the Centre even failed to provide uniform grounds of divorce. Maintaining that divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for men and women, the petitioner said that even after 73 years of independence, divorce procedures continued to remain very complex and were neither gender-neutral nor religion-neutral.  Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains have to seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955. Muslim, Christian and Parsis have their own personal laws. Couples belonging to different religion have to seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956. If either partner is a foreign national then he has to seek divorce under the Foreign Marriage Act 1969, he pointed out. He added that minimum marriage age, grounds of divorce, custody, guardianship, adoption, maintenance, succession and inheritance, are the secular activities. Therefore, it is the duty of the State to ensure that men and women have uniform age of marriage, grounds of divorce, maintenance and alimony, succession and inheritance, adoption and guardianship in the spirit of Articles 14, 15, 21 of the Constitution and International Conventions, the plea stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-for-uniform-grounds-of-maintenance-alimony-for-all-927918.html

In March, the government had allowed over 6 crore subscribers of EPFO to withdraw an amount not exceeding their three months basic pay and dearness allowance from their EPF account in view of the lockdown to fight the pandemic. Speaking at Assocham Foundation Week programme, Gangwar said EPFO has settled 52 lakh Covid-19 withdrawal claims and disbursed Rs 13,300 crore to subscribers during the pandemic. He noted that the country has faced the pandemic with brave face. The Centre had launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) on March 26 to help the economically weaker sections cope with the pandemic. A provision for withdrawal from the EPF Scheme was announced by the government and an urgent notification issued, providing for non-refundable withdrawal to the extent of basic wages and DA for three months or up to 75 per cent of the amount standing to member's credit in the EPF account, whichever is less. On the implementation of labour codes, he asked the industry representatives to provide their feedback on the draft rules of three labour codes on industrial relations, social security and occupational health safety & working conditions. The ministry has circulated the draft rules on these labour codes to seek feedback of stakeholders. These three codes were passed in monsoon session of Parliament this year. The labour code on wage was passed by Parliament in 2019. The rules on that have already firmed up.

The Bengaluru-headquartered space agency under the Department of Space (DOS) has come out with revised technology transfer policy guidelines - 2020. "We have put it in the public domain and after getting public comments, it will go through the due process (before its approval)", the Department's Secretary and ISRO Chairman, K Sivan, told PTI on the guidelines hosted on ISRO website. One of the steps critical to success of technology transfer programme is the identification of technology that has a potential for commercialisation, and the DOS/ISRO centres play a vital role in this process, according to officials. "A dedicated Technology Transfer Cell (TTC) within the centre may be identified with laid down responsibilities for end-to-end coordination, both within the organisation, i.e., the inventors, quality and testing teams and the potential licensee to ensure successful commercialisation of technologies for maximal exploitation", the guidelines said. While the centre may have its own structure for picking up the technologies, it must be ensured that such technologies' maturity is assessed by rigorous screening process involving reliability testing quality certification, repeatability in in-house usage and proven worthiness, it was stated. The technology transfer activities shall be organised through a centralised Technology Transfer Group (TTG) Office under Capacity Building Programme Office (CBPO) operating from ISRO headquarters here. Such centralised office shall interface with all DOS/ISRO centres through centre-level TTC for all day-to-day activities concerning technology transfer. This revised guidelines document sets down the broad approach of ISRO, DOS, to the mechanism of transfer of technologies, developed by its centres/units. The technology transfer activities of the DOS are primarily intended for the domestic utilisation of these technologies by Indian industries (both public and private sector). "However, in the context of liberalisation and globalisation, requests from foreign organisations for transfer of DOS/ ISRO developed technologies shall be encouraged as per the guidelines issued by Government of India", according to the revised guidelines. "However, such request shall be reviewed and processed on a case to case basis and the term of licensing shall be arrived at considering the merits of organisation, intellectual value of the technology and its commercial potential etc.", they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/isros-technology-transfer-policy-to-get-renewed-focus-and-thrust-927942.html

"The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to take a decision on the dates of conducting board examinations including practicals. In case students are not able to do practical in classes before the examinations, alternatives to practical examinations will be explored," he had said. Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19 and partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in coronavirus cases. The board exams that were being conducted in March had to be postponed mid-way. The exams were later cancelled, and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. Competitive exams like JEE and NEET were also postponed twice this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of the continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jee-mains-schedule-no-of-times-exam-will-be-held-next-year-to-be-announced-on-december-16-education-minister-927946.html

Also, aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was raised by a steep 6.3 per cent. Non-subsidised LPG price was increased to Rs 694 per 14.2-kg cylinder from Rs 644 earlier, according to a price notification of state fuel marketing companies. This is the second increase in rate this month. On December 1, price was hiked by a similar Rs 50 per cylinder. Prior to that, the price had remained unchanged at Rs 594 a cylinder since July. This was the same rate at which subsidised LPG refills are also sold. Since May, most cooking gas customers have not received subsidies as the combination of international oil price collapse and domestic refill rate increases brought parity between subsidised and market rates. A subsidised cooking gas cylinder was priced at Rs 497 in Delhi in June 2019. Since then, prices have cumulatively gone up by Rs 147. However, the increase in rates this month would mean that the government will have to resume paying subsidies to consumers. Rates of LPG are revised every fortnight. Simultaneously, the price of jet fuel was hiked by Rs 2,941.5 per kilolitre, or 6.3 per cent, in Delhi to Rs 49,161.16 per kl. This is the second increase in ATF price this month. Rates had gone up by 7.6 per cent (Rs 3288.38 per kl) on December 1. Like LPG, ATF prices too are revised on the 1st and 16th of every month based on the average rate of benchmark international fuel and foreign exchange rate in the preceding fortnight. Alongside an increase in the price of 14.2-kg LPG cylinders, rates of the 5-kg bottles were increased by Rs 18 and those of the 19-kg cylinders by Rs 36.50. Households in India are allowed a maximum of 12 LPG cylinder purchases per year at subsidized rates. Cylinders have to be bought at full price at the time of purchase, and the subsidy is credited to the customer's bank account by the government. Non-subsidised LPG now costs Rs 720.50 in Kolkata, Rs 694 in Mumbai, and Rs 710 in Chennai. Rates defer from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lpg-price-up-by-rs-50-atf-rises-by-63-927950.html

Several other Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi, also spoke about the "befitting reply" India gave to Pakistan under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the war that led to the birth of Bangladesh. India celebrates December 16 as Vijay Diwas to commemorate its victory over Pakistan during the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh. "Greetings to people of the country on the celebration of India's historic victory over Pakistan in 1971 and salutations to the valour of our armed forces," Rahul said in a tweet in Hindi. "This was a time when India's neighbouring countries used to recognise the mettle of the Indian prime minister and feared violating the borders of our country," he added in an apparent reference to the latest India-China border row. Rahul, the former party president, and the Congress have been criticising the Modi-led government on its handling of the border row with China. On the other hand, the BJP has countered the Congress for the defeat India faced in the 1962 war with China when Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister. "We bow our head in deep salutations to the valiant soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces and the lion-hearted leadership of Indira-ji, for not only registering a thumping victory in the Indo-Pak War of 1971 but also wiping off tears of terror from millions in Bangladesh," the Congress said on its official Twitter handle. Priyanka said India gave a befitting reply in 1971 to those giving threats of the "seventh fleet" by its victory over Pakistan and planted the flag of India's power and sovereignty. Homage to patriotism-inspired Indira Gandhi and the brave Indian Armed Forces officials, she said. Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the country is indebted to its brave soldiers and 'Iron lady' Indira Gandhi. Former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said the 1971 war was not to protect India's interests alone but to protect peace in South Asia. "The way it was conducted and concluded represented true nationalism... There were no boasts, no exaggerations, yet India played its part as a responsible regional power," Chidambaram said in a video message. Shashi Tharoor said December 16, 1971 marked in many ways the coming of age of India as a significant power in the region. Very few leaders have the opportunity to redraw the map of the region and yet that is what prime minister Indira Gandhi and her brave Army did in liberating Bangladesh, he said. The victory over Pakistan was a national triumph, not that of any party or individual and the nation today stands united and rejoices in the true nationalism of Vijay Diwas, he said in a two-minute video posted on Twitter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/neighbours-used-to-recognise-indian-pm-s-mettle-rahul-gandhi-takes-dig-on-modi-927957.html

"Goans will be deeply hurt if the yearlong celebrations are marked by such unfair and twisted political statements that can damage the image of our beloved Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru," the Dakshinayan Abhiyaan president said in his letter to the President of India.  "The young independent India that believed in Gandhian approach played its cards very wisely and resultantly, through Operation Vijay, Goa was liberated. The peace-loving people of Goa are ever grateful to then prime minister Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru whose cautious efforts led to liberate Goa without bloodshed," the letter authored by Mauzo, a Sahitya Akademi award-winning writer said.  Dakshinayan Abhiyan is an organisation started by academic scholars, artists, writers, progressive-minded intellectuals, and social activists under the leadership of Dr. Ganesh Devy with the objective of promoting progressive ideas and human values among citizens in general and youth in particular.  The letter also mentions top BJP leaders including Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, and Goa CM Pramod Sawant for making misinformed comments on Nehru, blaming the latter for delaying Goa's Liberation.  "Dakshinayan Abhiyan Goa, with a heavy heart, would like to bring to your notice the spiteful and foul misinformation being spread indiscreetly and injudiciously that the Liberation of Goa was delayed because of the then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. Earlier, the Union Minister, Prakash Javadekar, and the CM of MP, Shivraj Singh Chouhan have gone on record and later we heard the Chief Minister of Goa repeating the same imprudently," the letter said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dakshinayan-abhiyaan-cautions-kovind-over-possible-maligning-of-nehru-at-goa-event-927969.html

The SOP, which was prepared in consultation with medical experts, has been sent to various states and union territories so that instructions can be issued to all officers concerned for its implementation, they said. "The National Human Rights Commission, in order to ensure effective prosecution leading to conviction in cases of sexual assault on women, has prepared a 'Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on Collection & Processing of scientific/forensic evidences'," the NHRC said in a statement. The SOP has been broken down into seven sections of key operating procedures. These sections are victim care, promptness and examination, collection of samples, collection of blood and urine samples, genital and anal evidence, handing over samples to FSL, and general guidelines, it said. "The commission has come out with this SOP after it observed that in many cases of alleged rape and sexual assault, there is substantial delay in medical examination, collection, and processing of scientific and forensic evidences of the victim," the statement said. The exhibits are forwarded to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) after much delay and by that time, the samples deteriorate or autolyse and become unsuitable for examination, the rights panel said. "This delay adversely affects the investigation for effective prosecution leading to conviction," it added. The NHRC hopes that this SOP, if implemented in letter and spirit by the authorities, will definitely help improve the system of medico-legal investigation in cases of sexual assault on women in the country, the official said. The SOP can be accessed through the NHRC website.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nhrc-introduces-new-sop-for-collecting-processing-forensic-evidence-in-sexual-assault-cases-of-women-927975.html

A bench presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao asked petitioner Juvvadi Sagar Rao, a resident of Telangana, to implead all the states as parties to the PIL. The court sought a response from the Centre, states and the National Disaster Management Authority, within eight weeks on the petition, which also sought a comprehensive report into corruption, generation of black money in granting approvals to illegal layouts, houses and registration of properties. The petitioner claimed that the regularisation of illegal layouts by the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu was violative of rule of law, urban bylaws, and building rules.  The National Disaster Management Authority issued guidelines for urbanisation and construction to avoid urban flooding and disasters. "But the greedy real estate mafia with the support of corrupt government officials, ignored the guidelines and warnings. Every rainy season urban flooding has been witnessed in the cities, and towns in the states," the petitioner said. He pointed out Chennai has seen the unforgettable disaster as flood in 2015. Most recently Hyderabad, Vijayawada have witnessed massive flooding due to sudden rains and cloud burst. Likewise, thousands of people suffered due to flooding in Hyderabad, Vijayawada.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-states-on-plea-against-unregulated-illegal-constructions-927976.html

The petition said to be running into 200 pages, is listed for hearing on January 4. Vanzara, 65, who practices law post-retirement, has filed the petition as party-in-person. When contacted he refused to divulge information related to the petition. He is learnt to have contended in the PIL that since there is no national language in the country as Hindi is only the official language, the government of India can create a separate category "higher than the official language" for making Sanskrit as country's national language. "This can happen simply by an Act or an executive order, without disturbing the present Constitutional frame. Official Language cannot necessarily be equated with national language. Both definitely can be separate," he argued in the PIL. KG Vanzara also happens to be the brother of controversial ex-IPS officer D G Vanzara who was discharged from Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Ishrat Jahan encounter cases after spending nearly eight years in jail. He claimed, "About 40 prominent Constituent Assembly (which drafted the Constitution) members including BR Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution who was not allowed to take Sanskrit as second Language in matriculation on caste basis in 1907, ferociously advocated to make Sanskrit (not Hindi) as an official language." He cited several prominent names who also advocated in favour of Sanskrit.   Vanzara has added a statement reportedly made by first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru as saying, “the greatest treasure that India possesses is and what is her finest heritage, I would answer unhesitatingly that it is the Sanskrit Language literature and all that it contains.” "If Hindi is continued as an official language and Sanskrit, in addition, is declared as National Language, there cannot be dispute or division on the lines of caste, creed, region or religions...Even a staunch Islamist scholar Dr. Zakir Nayak, although declared as an absconder for some reasons, favoured Sanskrit as a language of the common man. India should learn from Israel who in 1948, made Hebrew, considered to be a dead language from the last 2000 years, along with English as official/national language of Israel."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gujarat-ex-additional-secretary-files-pil-to-make-sanskrit-as-national-language-927993.html

Farmers have been protesting for nearly a month over the reforms, enacted in September, to deregulate the agriculture sector, allowing farmers to sell to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets. Small farmers fear the changes will mean the end of guaranteed minimum prices for their crops and leave them at the mercy of big retailers. "If these black laws come, more farmers will go deeper into debt," said 40-year-old Harshdeep Kaur, a widow from Punjab state, at one protest site on the outskirts of the capital, New Delhi. "More mothers and sisters will become widows like me." Suicide by struggling farmers has been a problem in India for years. Nearly 10,350 farmers and agricultural labourers committed suicide in 2018 - making up almost 8% of all suicides in India, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Kaur said her husband committed suicide three years ago after running up debts of 500,000 rupees (nearly $7,000). As she spoke, she held a passport-sized photo of him. The reforms, contained in three laws, loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to assure farmers the changes will bring them new opportunities but few have been convinced. Several rounds of talks between farm union leaders and the government have failed. "We'll keep protesting," said Gurbax Singh, a farmer union leader at a north Delhi protest site. The farmers have gathered at various sites around the capital since late last month, blocking traffic and clashing with police, at least in the early days of their action. Singh said dozens of buses, tractors and cars were being arranged to bring more women from Punjab – the epicentre of the agitation. The protesters occupied several kilometres of a busy main road in western Delhi with their tractors on Wednesday. At a nearby protest site, old farmers lounged in ramshackle shelters beside medical stalls and makeshift kitchens. Kaur said she and other women were prepared to protest until the laws were repealed. "More women will come," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protests-widows-too-join-the-agitation-928002.html

Mohan deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, chaired by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. The panel had called him on the issue of the citizens' data safety. Mohan was accompanied by Shivnath Thukral, the public policy director of Facebook. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, along with Tharoor, questioned Mohan about a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report suggesting that the social media giant is reluctant on banning the Bajrang Dal on its platform due to financial reasons and concerns over the safety of its staff, sources said. The WSJ report suggested that despite an internal assessment calling for a ban on the Bajrang Dal, Facebook has not cracked down on the Hindu nationalist group due to these reasons. Replying to queries, Mohan suggested to the panel members that the Facebook fact team consultant has so far not found any such element in the content posted by the Bajrang Dal that is violative of its social media policies. Further quizzing him, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked if the Bajrang Dal content was not found to be violative of its social media policies, then why did Facebook not deny the WSJ report and termed it as fake.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/facebooks-india-head-deposes-before-parliamentary-panel-928003.html

The SOP also insists that enough steps should be taken to keep the identity of survivors confidential and treating victims suffering from life-threatening injuries due to the sexual assault on priority than collecting forensic evidence. The SOP came after observing the delay in collection, examination and processing of forensic evidence. It noted that even after evidence is collected, there is "much delay" in sending it to laboratories leading to the deterioration of the samples. "This delay causes destruction of vital scientific evidence and deteriorates the chances of collection of semen/spermatozoa from the body of the victim which adversely affect the investigation as well as successful prosecution subsequently," the NHRC said. The SOP noted that the extremely poor conviction rate in sexual assault cases is due to several reasons -- one being the poor forensic medical evidence collection, documentation as well as maintenance of chain of custody of evidence. The SOP has been divided into seven sections of key operating procedures -- victim care, promptness and examination, collection of samples, collection of blood and urine samples, genital and anal evidence, handing over samples to Forensic Sciences Laboratories (FSL) and general.  It said the doctors should explain each step to the victim before performing the examination and ask them to use their "free will" either to accept or decline any of the steps. There is no need for a requisition from police or order from the court for examination of a sexual assault victim and it is the duty of the doctor to provide primary treatment and complete examination and then report to police. The collection of forensic evidence can take up to a few hours even by a trained professional, depending upon the case as every case requires requisite "due diligence and humane approach" and the examination should be done at the earliest possible. "The optimal time for forensic DNA evidence collection is up to 72 hours (in no case beyond 96 hours) of assault. However, forensic DNA evidence can still be collected up to seven days due to advancements in DNA technology," the SOP said. It emphasised that the efficacy of sample collection depends on the history of nature of assault, time elapsed between the assault and the examination, and also on post-assault activities, it said adding date and time of examination and collection of all the samples must be clearly mentioned in the report. Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kit, apart from the forensic labs, must also be made available at hospitals and police stations where victim approaches first. A thorough, detailed and proper history involving symptoms since the assault, details of the assault, number of assailants, specific threats, type of penetration, non-genital acts, recent genital procedures, loss of consciousness, amnesia and all activities (like taking bath, changing clothes and douching) after the assault should be mentioned in the report. A detailed history of the change of clothing, bathing, washing private parts is essential to be documented. Clothes of the survivor worn at the time of assault should be enquired into and if the victim is wearing the same clothes, these must be collected, preserved and sealed. If the clothes have been changed, the Investigating Officer should ensure to collect the clothes which the victim was wearing at the time of the assault and preserve it. "The victim should also be asked to stand on a large sheet of white paper and then 'undress'. This will aid in the collection of any foreign material which might have been left from the site of assault or from the accused. This sheet of paper should be folded very carefully and preserved in a bag to be sent to the FSL," the SOP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nhrc-issues-sop-on-forensic-evidence-collection-in-sexual-assault-cases-928009.html

"There is an atmosphere of enthusiasm in the country because of the recent reforms in the farm sector," he said while referring to the enactment of three new legislations. "The ongoing protest is an exception and the agitation is limited to one state. We are holding discussions and talks. I believe there will be an early solution," Tomar said at a virtual conference organised by industry body Assocham. The minister noted that while there is an agitation going on on one side, there are also lakhs of farmers coming in support of these laws. Tomar highlighted the measures taken by the central government in the last six years to boost farmers' income and make agriculture sector profitable. Thousands of farmers, particularly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting for more than two weeks against the three farm laws, saying the new legislation will lead to the dismantling of the MSP (Minimum Support Price) and mandi systems and leave them at the mercy of corporates. Tomar, who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, said the government has taken various initiatives during the Covid-19 pandemic for the growth of farm sector, including a Rs 1,00,000 crore fund for creating farm-level infrastructure and setting up of 10,000 FPOs. (Farmer Producer Organisations). These budgetary provisions in the agriculture and the allied sector will strengthen the rural economy and make farming activities profitable, he said. As the standoff continues between the government and groups of protesting farmers over the three farm laws, Tomar had on Tuesday said the Acts have been welcomed in various states and that the Centre was willing to continue its talks with "genuine farm unions" to find a solution with an open mind. The MSP at which the government commits to procure the produce from farmers is an administrative decision and it "will continue as it is", the minister had said. Earlier this week, Tomar told PTI that the next round of meeting will definitely happen to engage with farmers. The farmer leaders have to "decide and convey" when they are ready for the next meeting, he added. In its proposal to farmers last week, the Centre said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protests-against-farm-laws-an-exception-limited-to-one-state-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-928011.html

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said a committee with representatives from farmers unions can be formed to resolve the issue of road blockade at Delhi by those protesting against three farm laws. A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde posted a PIL by a law student, Ritvik Singh for consideration. The court told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that it intended to set up a committee, consisting of representatives of farmers unions across country, government and other stakeholders to resolve this issue. "This will soon become a national issue," the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said. "Your negotiations with protesting farmers have not worked apparently till nowm" the bench said. The court issued notice to the Centre on the PIL seeking removal of farmers from blocking the roads at Delhi borders. Security arrangements were tightened at the Chilla border between Delhi and Noida today as farmer union leaders have threatened to completely block the key border point to press for repeal of the Centre's new farm laws. A senior police officer said elaborate security measures are already in place at the Chilla border. Multi-layered barricades, jersey barriers and additional security personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order.   A few hours after the counting of the Kerala local body polls began, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) has an upper hand. While the LDF is leading in four corporations, including Thiruvananthapuram, Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is leading in two including Kochi. In Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur corporations, the BJP-led NDA is putting up a tight fight against LDF and UDF respectively. Of the 86 municipalities, UDF is leading in around 40, LDF in 35, and NDA in two, including Palakkad municipality, which was the lone municipality in Kerala where BJP was in power in Kerala.

Notably, the Sikkim High Court has a sanctioned strength of three judges, and the Andhra Pradesh High Court of 37 judges.  Sikkim High Court Chief Justice A K Goswami will replace Justice Maheshwari in AP HC.  On October 6, Reddy, in an unprecedented move, wrote a letter to the CJI, alleging that the Andhra Pradesh High Court was being used as an instrument to destabilise and topple the democratically elected government. He asked the Chief Justice to consider taking appropriate steps to ensure that the state judiciary's neutrality was maintained.  In other recommendations, the Collegium has also recommended the elevation of Punjab and Haryana High Court judge Justice S Muralidhar as Chief Justice of Orissa High Court and Delhi High Court judge Justice Hima Kohli as Chief Justice of Telangana High Court.  Justice Sanjib Banerjee was appointed as Chief Justice Madras High Court, Justice Pankaj Mithal of Allahabad High Court as Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir High Court; and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia as Chief Justice Gauhati High Court.  In other recommendations, Chief Justice of Telangana High Court Justice R S Chauhan has been transferred as Chief Justice Uttarakhand High Court; Chief Justice Mohammed Rafiq transferred as Chief Justice of Madhya Pradesh High Court.

India celebrates December 16 as Vijay Diwas to commemorate its victory over Pakistan during the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Lt Col Quazi Sajjad Ali Zahir, a decorated army veteran from Bangladesh, said Indian soldiers should also be considered as part of Mukti Bahini, as they also laid their lives to liberate Bangladesh. The Mukti Bahini, also known as the Bangladesh Forces, was the resistance movement consisting of the Bangladeshi military, paramilitary and civilians during the War of Liberation that transformed East Pakistan into Bangladesh in 1971. "The two-nation theory of Jinnah proved disastrous for the people of Bangladesh. In 23 years, Jinnah's Pakistan became a Kabristan for us. Bangladesh became a colony of Pakistan and we lost everything. We were treated like ghulams (servants) by them," Zahir said. He was addressing a virtual event organised by the Rashtriya Raksha University located near Gujarat capital Gandhinagar on the occasion of Vijay Diwas. He said Indian people never let Bangladeshis down when refugees started pouring into India ahead of the war. "Millions of Bengalis went over to India. But Indian people never let them down. All Indians, government machinery and NGOs came forward to lend support. Young men from Bangladesh trained by the best Indian Army officers. Both Mukti Bahini and Indian forces made the Pakistan army surrender," Zahir said. "I always considered Indian soldiers as part Mukti Bahini, as they also fought for the liberation. Let history say that we both won together in 1971," he added. Another war veteran from Bangladesh, Commodore Abdul Wahed Chowdhury, hailed India as a true leader and an excellent neighbour. "India is an excellent neighbour. A leader is the one who can lead in crisis. India is such a leader and it was proved (in 1971). India remained by my country's side, by the side of my brothers, sister and innocent refugees. India is a great nation and a great democracy," he said in his speech.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bangladeshi-war-veterans-thank-india-for-its-support-in-1971-928028.html

Javadekar said the Centre will take initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and encourage start-ups in the sector. Speaking at the CII Big Picture Summit virtually, he said the country's growth in communication technology is phenomenal and it presented a "tremendous scope" for the entertainment and media industry. "The AVGC is a sunrise sector and our experts are providing back-end support to top film-makers of the world. It was time that these professionals started doing more of this for our own films so that the use of animation and graphics in Indian films grows manifolds," he said. He also announced that the government is setting up a 'Centre of Excellence' in cooperation with the IIT-Bombay. On promoting the film industry, he said India will set up a special pavilion at Cannes in 2022 as the Cannes Film Festival celebrates 75 years.

Underlining that the Ram temple would actually take the form of a 'Rashtra temple', he said Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Shetra is going to start the mass contact and contribution campaign across the country for the construction of the temple.  Addressing a press conference here, Rai said photographs of the proposed new model of the temple will also reach crores of households through this campaign.  "Voluntary donations from Rambhakts will be accepted for which coupons of Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 1,000 will be made available," he said. In order to maintain transparency in the financial dealings and transactions, the trust has printed 4 crore coupons of Rs 10 denomination, 8 crore coupons of Rs 100 and 12 lakhs coupons of Rs 1,000 denomination, he said. Rai also said for construction of the temple, no foreign funding can be collected as the trust doesn't have enough necessary approvals while CSR funds can be considered for adjoining buildings of the temple. He further said no target has been fixed for collecting funds and no estimate has been made of expenditure for the construction of the temple. Rai said through this campaign, the public will also be made aware of the historical significance of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ram-temple-to-be-built-using-only-domestic-funds-trust-928037.html

The 'Samyukt Kisan Morcha', which represents protesting farmer bodies, also announced that they will observe December 20 as 'Shraddhanjali Diwas' (Paying Homage to Martyrs) between 11 am and 1 pm in every village in memory of 30 farmers who lost their lives during the agitation that started on November 25. The Morcha said the Centre should stop "defaming" the ongoing protests being held at several Delhi border points against the three farm laws. "We want the government to stop defaming farmers' agitation and holding parallel talks with other farmers' organisations," said Darshan Pal, a member of the 'Samkyukt Kisan Morcha', in his letter written in Hindi. The letter comes against the backdrop of the government holding talks with several farmers organisations from different states, which are in support of the new laws. The protesters see it as an attempt to divide the organisations. The Morcha leaders said the protest will continue till the three laws and Electricity Bill are withdrawn and that they would give their views on the Supreme Court's orders on Wednesday after a detailed study. The Supreme Court has said that the Centre could form a committee to look into the matter. The farmers unions said the agitation will continue till the laws are repealed. "The committee suggested by the Supreme Court will be fruitful only after the laws are withdrawn and the representatives of all National and Regional Farmers’ Organizations are represented in a decisive manner and should, therefore, be done only after repeal of the Acts. Detailed comments will be given after reading the judgement," a statement said. The protesters said the participation of farmers is rising in Singhu, Tikri, Shahjahapur and Palwal, while a massive increase is expected in Ghazipur on Thursday. More than 1,000 members of Ekta Parishad from Maharashtra reached Palwal and 100 from Gujarat came to Shahjahapur on Wednesday. Meanwhile, security arrangements were strengthened at the Chilla border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh's Noida as farmer leaders threatened to completely block the roads. Multi-layered barricades, jersey barriers and additional security personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order. At present, only a small group are on a sit-in protest at the border point. According to the police, Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Ghazipur, Sabholi and Mangesh borders are closed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/stop-defaming-us-protesting-farmers-to-centre-928055.html

Asserting that the government was there to protect the interest of the labourers, the minister, however, said such incidents may have an adverse impact on investment and job creation prospects in the state. Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple, has informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange that the December 12 violence at the iPhone manufacturing facility at Narsapura in Kolar district, did not cause any material damage to major manufacturing equipment and warehouses. It put preliminary damage estimates in the range of New Taiwan Dollar 100 to 200 million, which is about Rs 52 crore. Earlier reports, quoting the complaint by company officials to the local police station, had put the estimate at about Rs 437 crore. "There is no employees union as yet...There was immaturity on part of the labourers, also the company should have paid attention towards contractors..we will get to know in a couple of days, the exact information on how much amount was paid (towards workers) and when," Hebbar said. Speaking to PTI, he said meetings have taken place at the government level and also with the Union Cabinet Secretary from Delhi -- the Centre is also involved. The company has said it will try to start the factory in about 15 days, the minister said. "I hope it will be as early as possible. Also we will get the money that the labourers should get, actions are on in this regard...investigations are on, we are checking as to what really has happened," he added. Workers at the plant, run by the Taiwanese operator, had gone on a rampage on Saturday over the alleged delay in payment of salary and overtime wages. Over 150 people have been arrested following the incident that witnessed pelting of stones, breaking windows and doors, overturning and setting fire to vehicles in the parking lot footage of which had flooded the social media. The minister pointed out that the incident had happened early on December 12 and on December 14 a meeting was held with company and labour department senior officers. The minister said the company has 8,490 contractual employees through outsourcing arrangement with five-six companies and about 1,343 permanent staff working at the facility. He said their grouse was that contract employees were not being paid properly. Women were recruited but there were no proper measures and instead of eight hours they were made to work for 12 hours. "This was their anger, but they had not shared their grievances with the government or the department, or even sent a letter." "We are here to protect the interest of labourers, but this act of taking law into hands, the government will not support.This is not the right way," he said, as he appealed to the labour community in the state to approach it as the department is there to address their issues. Meanwhile, Wistron Corp has informed the Taiwan Stock Exchange that the company is assessing the extent of damage in various areas of the facilitys campus. Unlike earlier reports stated, the violence did not cause any material damage to major manufacturing equipment and warehouses, with preliminary damage estimates in the range of NTD 100 to 200 million,it said. Wistron is co-working with related government authorities and police officials regarding investigation of the incident as well as negotiating with Insurance companies, it said. The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) alleged that the incident was the direct result of the exploitative, illegal practices of the employer and the complete lack of regulation from the state government. The sweatshop-like-conditions of work at the factory combined with the failure to provide basic rights such as working hours and payment of wages led to the "spontaneous" violence,it claimed. In a release it demanded action against the employer and contract labour agencies, with reports that more than 85 percent of the workforce in the company was contractual. "This is a blatant and atrocious abuse of the Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act," it said. Several irregularities in payment of wages led to delayed payments and also illegal deduction of wages contributed to unrest among the workforce, the AITUC further alleged. It claimed that even engineering and MBA graduates were forced to work as operators earning (low) minimum wages of Rs 12,000 per month. Also complaining about 12 hour shifts, staggered weekly holidays and women working in night shifts without any regulation, it demanded that the state government initiate action against such "exploitative practices".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/probe-into-violence-at-wistron-iphone-production-plant-on-centre-steps-in-928064.html

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, repeatedly submitted before a bench presided over by the Chief Justice S A Bobde that Salve had sent him texts to make a request on his behalf to allow him to join the proceedings.  He said that the court master informed that there is no intimation about his appearance in the matter, and he has no case in the court of the Chief Justice. "We will allow if Salve has a case. There is no case of Salve before us," the CJI said. Mehta insisted that Salve wanted to put across some important legal points. "It isn't that we don't want to hear Salve but he doesn't have any case before us. And if we entertain something like this, we get long representations from other lawyers," the Chief Justice said.

Human Development Index is the measure of a nation's health, education, and standards of living. Life expectancy of Indians at birth in 2019 was 69.7 years while Bangladesh has a life expectancy of 72.6 years and Pakistan 67.3 years, the 2020 Human Development Report said. India, Bhutan (129), Bangladesh (133), Nepal (142), and Pakistan (154) were ranked among countries with medium human development, the report said. India's HDI value for 2019 is 0.645 which put it in the medium human development category. India has been positioned at 131 out of 189 countries and territories, according to the report. India had ranked 130 in 2018 in the index. Norway topped the index, followed by Ireland, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Iceland, the report showed. Talking to reporters, UNDP Resident Representative Shoko Noda said the drop in India's ranking doesn't mean "India didn't do well but other countries did better". Noda said India can help other countries too and lauded its commitment to reduce carbon emissions.   According to the report published by the United Nations Development Programme on Tuesday, India's gross national income per capita fell to USD 6,681 in 2019 from USD 6,829 in 2018 on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Purchasing power parity or PPP is a measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies. The report said evidence from Colombia to India indicates that financial security and ownership of land improve women's security and reduce the risk of gender-based violence, clearly indicating that owning land can empower women. It further said indigenous children in Cambodia, India and Thailand show more malnutrition-related issues such as stunting and wasting. "In India different responses in parent behaviour, as well as some disinvestment in girls' health and education, have led to higher malnutrition among girls than among boys as a consequence of shocks likely linked to climate change," the report said. The report said that under the Paris Agreement, India pledged to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP from the 2005 level by 33–35 per cent by 2030 and to obtain 40 per cent of electric power capacity from non–fossil fuel sources by 2030. "As part of the plan, the National Solar Mission aims to promote solar energy for power generation and other uses to make solar energy competitive with fossil fuel-based options. Solar capacity in India increased from 2.6 gigawatts in March 2014 to 30 gigawatts in July 2019, achieving its target of 20 gigawatts four years ahead of schedule. In 2019, India ranked fifth for installed solar capacity," the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-ranks-131-out-of-189-countries-in-uns-human-development-index-928067.html

"ISRO SSA Control Centre, 'NETRA', is set up within the ISTRAC campus at Peenya. The control centre is envisaged to function as a hub of all SSA activities within India," the space agency said. The Directorate of Space Situational Awareness and Management (DSSAM) engages in evolving improved operational mechanisms to protect Indian space assets through effective coordination amongst ISRO/DOS Centres, other space agencies and international bodies, it said. According to ISRO, the Network for space object Tracking and Analysis (NETRA) project is initiated as a first step towards meeting this goal, its main elements being a radar, an optical telescope facility, and a control centre. The control centre was formally inaugurated by Chairman, ISRO and Secretary, Department of Space K Sivan on December 14. Stating that concurrent processing of data from the upcoming observational facilities for space objects orbit determination, correlation and catalogue generation will take place here, ISRO said there will be provision to schedule and remotely operate the observational facilities from the control centre. Other core SSA activities will comprise close approach analysis between ISROs satellite and launch vehicles, timely dissemination of advance alerts on upcoming critical conjunctions for collision avoidance of operational assets, prediction of atmospheric re-entry of derelict satellites and rocket bodies, it said. In addition, dedicated labs will also be set up in this control centre for Space Debris mitigation and remediation, compliance verification of UN/IADC guidelines and various R&D activities. The R&D activities will encompass space object fragmentation and break up modelling, space debris population and micrometeoroid environment modelling, Space Weather studies, Near-Earth Objects and planetary defence studies etc, it added. According to ISRO, in view of the ever-growing population of space objects and the recent trend towards mega-constellations, SSA has become an integral and indispensable part of safe and sustainable space operations. For the last few decades, ISRO has been carrying out SSA activities, mainly focused on safeguarding India's space assets. The Directorate of Space Situational Awareness and Management (DSSAM) has been established at ISRO, recognising the need for dedicated efforts to tackle the emerging challenges of operating in an exceedingly crowded and contested space domain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/isro-sets-up-dedicated-control-centre-for-space-situational-awareness-928082.html

The two governments are keen to step up cooperation to fight future pandemics, building on the cooperation between the Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca PLC to produce the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University of the UK. “This Serum Institute and Oxford University partnership demonstrates the UK-India relationship at its best: a vaccine developed in the UK and made in India; drawing our brightest minds together to save lives as a global force for good,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in New Delhi. Raab called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. “A global pandemic requires a global solution,” he said, adding: “Scientific cooperation has made breakthroughs on coronavirus vaccines at record-breaking pace and the UK-India Vaccine Hub will now build on these innovations, to bring this crisis to an end and protect us all against future pandemics.” When Modi will host British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in New Delhi next month, the two leaders are likely to launch the India-UK Vaccine Hub for scientists to jointly work on developing shots to protect people, not only from coronavirus, but also from other viruses. The new hub will enable British and Indian experts to share knowledge on clinical trials and regulatory approvals and get vaccines to people who need them most in a safe, secure and energy-efficient way. It will also foster innovation, a press-release from the British High Commission in New Delhi stated, noting that Raab praised the Prime Minister’s commitment to equitable global access to vaccines. The Serum Institute of India is set to make over a billion doses of the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Oxford University and the AstraZeneca PLC. The British Foreign Secretary who arrived in New Delhi on Monday visited a health clinic where Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will be administered. The British High Commission in New Delhi noted that millions of the doses made by the Serum Institute of India would be distributed to the poorest people of the world, via the global Covax initiative, in partnership with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Gavi, the vaccine alliance. The UK has championed equitable access to any coronavirus vaccine for those who need it and has committed up to £619 million to Covax to secure both the UK’s access to coronavirus vaccines and distribute Covid-19 vaccines across the world. New Delhi and London also announced on Wednesday the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding between India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA). The MoU will set the stage for more frequent discussions on UK-India vaccine and pharmaceutical regulations, improving standards and sharing information to control against the trade of unlicensed products. The two nations also announced a new partnership to help UK and Indian scientists unlock the power of data, including the data within our genes, to deliver better diagnostics and enhanced life-saving treatments for cancer, diabetes, maternal health challenges and rare diseases. India supplies more than 50% of the world’s vaccines and 25% of the generic drugs required by the National Health Service of the UK. “Closer UK-India cooperation on medicines and vaccines approvals will ensure speedy access for the UK to Indian-produced pharmaceuticals and help safeguard future supplies to the NHS,” the British High Commission in New Delhi said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-uk-plan-vaccine-hub-to-fight-future-pandemics-sii-astrazeneca-to-produce-shots-against-covid-19-together-928086.html

Developed jointly by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad and Indian Council of Medical Research, the vaccine (popularly known as Covaxin) the vaccine was administered to 300 people. The results from these inoculations were then compared to results from 75 other subjects who didn’t receive any vaccine. The vaccine was administered in three doses and all of them were well tolerated well. The immune responses also give hints of long-term efficacy in all the three formulations, according to the study carried out by the researchers from Bharat Biotech, ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi along with doctors from other hospitals in India where the trials were carried out. On the basis of such early promising results, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has permitted phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenous vaccine on 26,000 persons. The Bharat Biotech vaccine is the first and only vaccine so far whose efficacy will be examined in India unlike the vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute (Covishield) and the Russian product (Sputnik V), which will have to only demonstrate safety and immune response. “The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site, which resolved spontaneously. The overall incidence rate of local and systemic adverse events was 10%-20% in all vaccine treated arms, which is noticeably lower than the rates for other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates,” the researchers reported. There was one serious adverse event when a participant who was screened on July 25, reported fever and headache, five days after the vaccination. On August 8, he tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to a hospital on August 15. A week later, he was found Covid-negative and was discharged from the hospital. “The event was not causally associated with the vaccine. No other symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in the first 75 days,” reported the team of researchers comprising ICMR director general Balram Bhargava and AIIMS director Randeep Guleria among others. The DCGI, India’s drug regulator, remained silent on the adverse event reported in August but allowed Bharat Biotech to continue with the trial after reviewing the data.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-biotechs-covid-19-vaccine-well-tolerated-with-no-serious-adverse-events-phase-1-trial-findings-928094.html

The gap between India and Bharat is still wide but with our motto of reform, perform and transform, we can definitely overcome the challenges,” he added. Observing that Rs 6,000 crore have been invested in technology centres until now, the MSME minister said: "Now we are planning to give these technology centres on a lease basis to engineering colleges, IITs, polytechnic colleges and industry associations with a good track record". The MSME Finance Week was a virtual event organised by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME).  "A key reason for most MSMEs to turn into non-performing assets (NPAs) is delayed reconciliation of their receivables and bills that creates liquidity constraints hence affecting their sustainability. "This was one of our key recommendations to the government for MSMEs to survive - to ensure quick disbursement of payables from not only government departments, but also private players,” said Ravi Venkatesan, Founder, GAME.  The facilities of the technology centres under the MSME Ministry allow designing and manufacture of sophisticated tools, parts, components and products in conformity with international standards.  The latest hardware and software available at these centres ensures professional design and 3D solid modelling. The production facilities at the technology centres offer an array of cutting edge production services to MSMEs. In addition, these institutes provide technical services such as design of parts and components, materials testing, heat treatment, quality control, and technical consultancy related to the product & process improvement. The technology centres, apart from extending design, development & manufacturing support to MSMEs for complex tools, parts and components (many that serve as import substitutes), have also supported the strategic sectors such as aerospace, defence, atomic energy etc. of the country for their R&D requirements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-plans-to-lease-msme-technology-centres-to-iits-engineering-colleges-nitin-gadkari-928099.html

The proposed Ram Mandir Nidhi Samarpan drive will run from January 15 to February 27 in 2021. Addressing the media in Delhi, the vice president of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Secretary-General of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai said that Engineers from IIT Mumbai, IIT Delhi, IIT Chennai, IIT Guwahati, CBRI Roorkee, Larsen & Toubro and Tatas are working on the foundation drawing. The foundation configuration and layout would very soon come out. He added that in this intensive and extensive campaign from the upcoming Makar Sankranti (January 15) to Magh-Purnima (February 27), the VHP Karyakartas would reach out to people in the villages of the country and "propagate and flourish Ramatwa by connecting the common man directly with Shri Ram Janmabhoomi". The Trust has printed coupons and receipts of denominations of Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 1,000 for this purpose. This will ensure that the Ram temple will reach millions of homes, VHP said. "The whole temple will be of stone blocks. Every-one of the three floors will be 20 feet high. The length and breadth of the temple will be 360 and 235 feet respectively," Rai said giving the details of the construction plan. Rai said that during the campaign, VHP activists will go from door to door, accompanied by Hindu saints. "For this, we need not only fund-contributors but also time-contributors," Rai said flagging the "struggle for five centuries" of the Hindu society and lauded the Supreme Court for having "accepted the sentiments of the society and the truths of history associated with the temple". "Our plan is to make the present and the future generations of the country aware of the truths of the history of this temple. By going from door to door, at least half of the country's 1350 million people will be made aware of the historical truths and people will be handed out Ram temple literature during the campaign," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vishva-hindu-parishad-to-conduct-pan-india-donation-drive-for-ram-temple-in-2021-928108.html

Speaking at a webinar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, he said historically India's contribution to the world's emissions has been just 3 per cent.  Even with the current emissions, India's contribution is just 7 per cent even though the country has a population of 1.3 billion, he said. Javadekar said India has "over-performed" in its goals. He cited the Climate Transparency Report, United Nation Environment Programme's Emission Gap report, Climate Action Tracker and Climate Change Performance Index to back his point. "India is one of the top performers on the commitments and actions. This all shows that India is walking the talk," he said. "Countries, without actually doing their own bit, are asking other countries to revise upwards, ratchet upward their ambitions. I see this as flawed," Javadekar said. He said it will be a "good scenario" if countries comply with the Nationally Determined Contributions agreed to under the Paris Agreement. "Why you want to ratchet it up now...everybody has given NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) ... even if you comply (with the) NDCs, it will be a good scenario. In 2023 when the global stocktake will happen, one can think of raising the ambition," he said. 'Global stocktake' refers to a proposed five-yearly review of the impact of countries' climate change actions. Under the Paris Agreement, every country must present a climate action plan in five-yearly cycles. Javadekar said when countries are asked why targets are being raised, they say that gives a very good signal to the industry to innovate and bring out new technologies. "It's a wrong argument that you must raise your ambitions to give correct market signal. It is not a valid argument. And therefore, I believe in human intelligence and intent. "All these innovations have taken place because of intelligence and intent. And this has continued even today. We should not profit from disaster. We are thinking that climate change is a disaster, (then) technology will find out the answer. But we should not charge technology excessively," Javadekar said. He stressed that there has to be collaboration in research and innovation, and there will be joint IPRs and all new technologies that cost to mitigate climate change must be provided and there should be no profit from it. Javadekar said India has taken a lead in adapting to climate change. As far as NDC implementation is concerned, he said India is doing "much much more than what we were expected to". "We took on ourselves, a target of reduction of 35 per cent of emission intensity by 2030 but within last five years, we have brought it down by 21 per cent, a huge impact over 2005 targets not 1990 targets. So we are also doing our bit," he added. Javadekar said Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 175 GWe of renewable energy and 40 per cent energy mix of bio-renewables in energy mix capacities and India is achieving both the targets. In the last six years, there has been an increase in the country's green cover, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/countries-asking-others-to-lower-emissions-without-doing-their-bit-is-flawed-logic-prakash-javadekar-928128.html

At present 6.01 crore rural households in the country are getting potable water through taps, it said. Eighteen districts across the country have provided tap connections to all households and states are competing with each other to ensure tap water supply to every home, it added. The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with states aims to provide potable water in adequate quantity of prescribed quality on a regular and long-term basis through tap connections to every rural home in the country by 2024. After the launch of the mission, states were requested to undertake a revalidation exercise of baseline data, according to which there are 19.05 crore rural households in the country. Out of this, 3.23 crore households were already provided tap connections. The remaining 15.81 crore households are to be provided with tap connections. Thus, the objective is to cover approximately 16 crore households in a time-bound manner while ensuring the functionality of already provided connections, the ministry said. This means 3.2 crore households are to be covered every year which comes to around approximately 88,000 tap connections to be provided every day. "With this goal in mind, states/ UTs are making all out efforts to provide tap water connections in rural areas. In 2020-21, a sum of Rs 23,500 crore has been allocated for the implementation of JJM. "Besides this, in 2020-21, 50 per cent of 15th Finance Commission Grants to Rural Local Bodies, that is Rs 30,375 crore, as tied grant will be utilised for water supply and sanitation,” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/278-lakh-households-provided-tap-water-connections-under-jal-jeevan-mission-928149.html

Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points for 21 days on the trot to press for repeal of the Centre's new farm laws. Talking to reporters here, Rajagopal, who is the head of the Ekta Parishad, said, "Although nobody has asked me to mediate on the issue, I am moved by the fact that farmers have been agitating since the last 20 days in the chilling cold, and there is a need to start a dialogue on the matter." He said he would embark on a foot-march with nearly one thousand farmers from Morena, the Lok Sabha constituency of the Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. "As no dialogue is happening, I am sure that both- the farmers and the government- will accept my offer of initiating talks," he said. The government should listen to the farmers, he said, while expressing hope that he would be able to help in the process. "Maybe the farmers as well as the government will not listen to me, but farmers have their problems and a dialogue must be established with them," he added. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/activist-p-v-rajagopal-offers-to-mediate-between-protesting-farmers-centre-928153.html

Vij, 67, was shifted to Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon Tuesday evening. The minister, who was admitted to Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak on Sunday after he complained of discomfort, had tested positive for COVID-19 on December 5. "Haryana Home and Health Minister Anil Vij, who was admitted to Medanta-The Medicity on December 15 at 9 pm, and is undergoing treatment for COVID-19, is stable and he is maintaining vitals parameters on high flow nasal cannula on oxygen support,” the statement said. In a medical bulletin, Dr A K Dubey, medical superintendent, Medanta, said Vij was transferred from PGIMS Rohtak with COVID pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU. Relevant investigations, including CT scan, have been done and the results are satisfactory. "He slept well last night and had his meals. He is likely to stay in the ICU for a few days,” the statement quoting the bulletin said, adding that Vij was being monitored by a team of doctors. On Tuesday, Vij's younger brother Rajinder Vij had told reporters outside PGIMS, "We are shifting him to Medanta because we are not seeing the kind of improvement which we were expecting." He had said that the doctors at the Rohtak hospital "gave their best treatment" and "provided best facilities", yet there had not been much improvement in the minister's condition. On Monday, he was examined by a special medical board comprising a team of senior doctors of PGIMS at Rohtak. A medical bulletin issued by the PGIMS hospital had said that the vital parameters of the minister were normal and he was undergoing convalescent plasma therapy. The minister had last month got one shot of the two-dose trial of Covaxin after he offered to be a volunteer. The firebrand BJP leader had offered to be the first volunteer in the phase three trials for Covaxin, an indigenous potential vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech against COVID-19. He was administered the dose on November 20 at the Civil Hospital in Ambala Cantonment, about 50 km from Chandigarh. Bharat Biotech had said that clinical trials of the vaccine are based on a two-dose schedule, given 28 days apart. The vaccine efficacy will be determined two weeks after the second dose, it said. Covaxin has been designed to be protective two weeks after volunteers receive the second dose. The Union health ministry had also stepped in to say that Covaxin is a two-dose anti-coronavirus vaccine and that Vij was given only the first dose a fortnight before he tested positive. "The antibodies against the infection build up in a human being only after a specific number of days pass after the second dose of the vaccine is taken. This is a two-dose vaccine. The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine," the ministry had said in a statement. Vij had earlier said that he had gone to Panipat a few days prior to testing positive for coronavirus where he spent two to three hours with a BJP leader, who too tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-positive-haryana-minister-anil-vijs-condition-stable-928158.html

Over the days, Good Samaritans, gurdwara committees, and NGOs have pooled technological resources to ensure the agitation isn't hampered by the lack of basic amenities. Gigantic machines that belt out 1,000-1,200 chapattis in an hour, washing machines and solar panels installed on tractor-trolleys for charging mobile phones -- technology is keeping the protesters camping at this highway-turned-township going. The chapatti-makers ensure timely meals for the protesters and that 'langar' is served smoothly till midnight. "This chapatti-making machine is fully automatic, you just have to put the dough inside. It cuts the dough into circles and in no time you get the chapattis. "We start the machine around 7 am and it runs till 12 am. We serve meals to over 5,000 people every day," Hardeep Singh from Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which manages one of the 'langars' at the protest site, told PTI. Living away from the comfort of their homes, another issue faced by the farmers was washing clothes. Initially, some of them bathed and washed their clothes at petrol pumps. But as the temperatures in the national capital dipped and the number of protesters swelled, some farmers and Good Samaritans arranged for washing machines. On one of his trips back home to Ludhiana in Punjab to wash his clothes, 30-year-old Prince Sandhu decided to bring two washing machines with him so that he and his fellow protesters didn't have to worry about the chore. Soon after, someone donated another washing machine and the 'laundry sewa' has been going on in full swing ever since. "Nearly 250 people come here every day to wash their clothes. Many do it on their own. We help out the elderly who don't know how to operate washing machines," said Sandhu, who joined the protest on November 27. "I wake up at 6 am and help people wash their clothes till 8 pm," he said. Not far from the laundry spot is Pushpinder Singh's phone charging station. Singh, 36, said he knew protesters would face problems in charging their mobile phones and hence decided to install two 100 watt solar panels atop his tractor trolley before he set out from home in Haryana's Karnal. "Mobile phones are our only source of knowing what is happening around us. I knew charging them would be a problem. So I bought these two solar panels for Rs 2,400 each before I got here. Not only are they helping us in charging mobile phones but also with lighting," he said. "Now I see many others have also installed solar panels, which is good," he added. Earlier, international NGO Khalsa Aid made headlines for installing foot massagers and geysers for the protesters at Singhu border. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Delhi's neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, have stayed put at the national capital's border points since late November to protest against the new farm laws. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure income, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/technology-powering-farmers-protest-at-delhis-singhu-border-927955.html

Talking to reporters here, Pawar, without naming the BJP, said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government's decision to shift the car depot project from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg seemed to have "hurt a lot of people" and that is why the Centre took an "extreme step". "In the Constitution and law, there is a provision of making an appeal against a court decision. Hence, it will be thought about," the deputy chief minister said. The Bombay HC on Wednesday stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acre of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area here for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land. The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The previous BJP-led Maharashtra government had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line 3 at Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project. The present Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, recently took a decision to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. The Union government had claimed the entire salt pan land in the area, including the 102 acres allotted to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), belongs to the Centre's salt department. The Union government had filed a petition in the high court challenging the October 1, 2020 order passed by the collector allotting the land for construction of the car shed, and said the land belongs to its (Centre's) salt department. Pawar said "be it the Centre or the state government", nobody should lay roadblocks in the development works. "I have seen (NCP chief Sharad) Pawar Sahebs 50 to 55 years of political career. I am also in political field for the past 30 years. I never bring politics in developmental works, rather we help," he added. Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said he is waiting for the court's detailed order. He also said the land is crucial for the Metro project as it will save almost Rs 5,500 crore of government money. "Honble HC has granted a stay to Kanjurmarg work. We await the detailed written order to decide the future course of action," he said. "This land is crucial for Metro Line 6, 4 and 14, apart from 3, as it will save almost Rs 5500 crores of Govt and be a nodal point for 1 crore citizens," Thackeray tweeted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/maharashtra-govt-may-approach-sc-on-hcs-metro-car-shed-order-deputy-chief-minister-ajit-pawar-927963.html

Rahul was not allowed to speak at the meeting when he sought to raise the issue. He along with two Congress MPs Rajiv Satav and Revanth Reddy walked out following this. The multi-party panel headed by senior BJP MP Jual Oram had met in the afternoon for a briefing by the Ministry of Defence officials on the "introduction to the Rank Structure of the Defence Forces including their Uniforms, Stars and Badges" and "Review of Working of Cantonment Boards". As the meeting took up the issue, sources said Rahul told the meeting that the panel was "wasting time" by discussing uniforms and badges and that they should be discussing more serious issues like better equipment for soldiers at the border in Ladakh and Chinese aggression. "We are wasting the time of top officials like the Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat. The force could decide on this," sources quoted Rahul as saying in the meeting. The political leadership should discuss the issues of national security and how to strengthen the forces who are fighting the Chinese in Ladakh, he said. In the meantime, a presentation on the colour of uniforms in the Army, Navy and Air Force was made during which BJP MP Lt Gen DP Vats raised the issue of disparity in the uniform of soldiers and cited that there is unity in uniforms and badges of the United States. To this, sources said, Rahul again said that why should one copy the US and it should be left to the military to decide on what the colour of their uniform should be. "The politicians should have no business to tell the Army, Navy or Air Force which uniform to wear and it is neither their jurisdiction nor domain and should not belittle them or insult them. The political leadership should instead provide hot tents, boots and equip the soldiers who are braving out at the border and are fighting the Chinese in Ladakh," he said. Rahul is also learnt to have told the meeting that the leadership should also focus on how to push back the enemy and support and strengthen the armed forces rather than dictating the colour of their uniforms. However, Oram intervened and disallowed him to continue, which led to a heated exchange. As Oram continued to disallow him, Rahul then said that there was no point in attending there as if they did not want to hear him and walked out. Sources said some Opposition MPs, including BSP's Danish Ali, told the meeting that Rahul should have been heard and it was not the way to treat a senior leader. Sources said Opposition MPs were of the view that the government does not want to discuss serious issues. They claimed they had demanded a discussion on the Ladakh border row in the last meeting but the ruling side had not agreed to it. During a meeting on September 11 when the panel discussed "provision and monitoring of the quality of ration and livery items to the Defence forces, especially in border areas", NCP chief Sharad Pawar had demanded a detailed presentation on the situation on the India-China border.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-congress-members-walk-out-of-defence-parliament-panel-meeting-928016.html

They also said the government should have formed a committee of farmers and others before the laws were enacted by Parliament. Their assertions came after the Supreme Court indicated earlier in the day that it may form a panel having representatives of the government and farmer unions to resolve the deadlock. Abhimanyu Kohar, a leader of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sabha which is one of 40 protesting farmer unions, said they have already rejected a recent government offer to form such a panel.   "Setting up a new committee by the court is not a solution. We just want a complete repeal of the three agriculture laws. Earlier, there have been several rounds of talks between a group of Central ministers and farmer unions, which was like a committee itself," Kohar told PTI. Taking to Twitter, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, who is also a member 'Sankyukt Kisan Morcha', said, "The SC can and must decide on the constitutionality of the 3 farm acts. But it is not for the judiciary to decide on the feasibility and desirability of these laws. That's between the farmers and their elected leaders. SC monitored negotiation would be a wrong path." In another tweet, he said, "This amounts to resurrecting a proposal made by the Govt on 1st December which farmers organisations had rejected unanimously." The Sankyukt Kisan Morcha is an umbrella body of 40 protesting farmer unions. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which has been leading the agitation at Tikri Border, said that there would be no meaning of a new committee now. "We will be in the new committee only after the government first repeals the three laws. The government should have formed a committee of farmers and others before enacting the new agriculture laws. There will be no meaning of new committee at this stage," BKU Ekta Ugrahan's Punjab general secretary Sukhdev Singh said. However, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said, "We have only seen media reports about the SC order as of now. We want to first see an authentic copy of the order and then see what the government has to say. Only then can we comment on this." Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court indicated that it may form a committee having representatives of the government and farmer unions across the country to resolve the deadlock. The top court was hearing a batch of applications seeking a direction to authorities to immediately remove the farmers from the roads, saying commuters were facing hardships due to the blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. "Your negotiations have not worked apparently. It is bound to fail. You are saying you are willing to negotiate," a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Mehta, who is representing the Centre, replied, "Yes, we are willing to talk to farmers." Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi border points for the last 20 days now in protest against the three laws that they claim will lead to a dismantling of the mandi system and the Minimum Support Price mechanism, apprehensions that the government has been saying are misplaced. On Tuesday, the leaders of the agitating farmers had asserted they will “make” the Centre repeal the three new farm laws in a hardening of their stand. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/forming-new-committee-is-no-solution-protesting-farmer-leaders-on-supreme-court-proposal-928044.html
16-12-2020||National Politics||Feudalistic force behind farmers' stir: Dharmendra Pradhan||Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday alleged that an anti-Indian and feudalistic force was behind the ongoing farmers' agitation against the new agricultural laws. He said that this force was also against the concepts of 'Bharatiyata' (Indianness) and India's self-reliance. "There is a force in the country which is basically anti-India and feudalistic. The people associated with this force are also against Indianness and the country's self- reliance. This force is behind the farmers' agitation," Pradhan told reporters. The Petroleum Minister was here to address a divisional farmers' convention organised by the BJP. "Who stood with China against its invasion (on India)? Who imposed the Emergency in India? Who ran nepotism in the country between 2004 and 2014? Those involved in these works are now engaged in instigating the farmers' agitation," he alleged. Questioning the farmers' protest, Pradhan said, "Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has agreed to give a written guarantee that the system of procurement of crops at the minimum support price (MSP) will continue in the country. Then on what issue the farmers' agitation is happening?" He also alleged that the agitation is being instigated to build an atmosphere against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and to create chaos in the country. "The people of the country are with Modi on the new agricultural laws," he said. Terming the Congress's move of opposing the new agricultural laws as the "mental bankruptcy" of the opposition party, Pradhan said, "Such laws have already been enacted in Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and other states". He described the new agricultural laws as an important step towards bringing Indian farmers' produce to international markets and said, "The concept of 'one country-one market' needs to be implemented in India to enter the global commodity market." Pradhan said that before the new agricultural laws, there was a lot of exploitation of farmers in the crop trading system and middlemen used to benefit a lot.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/feudalistic-force-behind-farmers-stir-dharmendra-pradhan-928062.html
16-12-2020||National Politics||Hardeep Singh Puri, Jairam Ramesh spar over Parliament session, new building||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh were engaged in a public spat on social media on Wednesday over the government's decision not to hold the Winter Session of Parliament, with the Opposition leader accusing the Centre of playing "silly games" and the Urban Development minister saying that "colourful" statements were coming out of frustration due to electoral reverses. The exchange of words on Twitter came after Ramesh objected to the government's claim that opposition leaders were consulted before it was decided that the winter session of Parliament will not be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "At 10:49 am on 15.12.2020, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad told me: He [Joshi] has not talked to me. 4 minutes later Ghulam Nabi Azad told me: They [Modi Sarkar] have not consulted us. So stop playing these silly games Mr. Joshi," Ramesh said in a tweet. Slamming the government for its decision not to hold Parliament's winter session in view of Covid-19, the Congress on Tuesday said the "decimation of parliamentary democracy is complete" and asked if poll campaigning can be done amid the pandemic, why cannot the session be held. Ramesh also attacked Puri for his claim that both houses had passed a resolution in October 2019 for a new Parliament building. "This is Puri's poora jhoot. There was no Resolution in the Rajya Sabha certainly. The Chairman made observations on it on 5th August 2019. The virus of lying has completely infected the Modi cabinet," the Congress's chief whip in the Upper House of Parliament said in another tweet. "This is NOT a House Resolution as you claim. There is no House Resolution. Keep lying," he said while replying to one of Puri's tweets. The minister hit back at Ramesh, saying, "Before you put your foot fully into your own mouth, I would advise you to read what the Hon'ble Speaker said. The demand and necessity for a modern, well-equipped and grand Parliament house has been around since a very long time." "You deny empirical evidence on the need for a new Parliament and in the process do great disservice to yourself and your party. I don't want to comment on the tone of your tweet or the other colourful statements you have recently been making. "A charitable explanation is that these are manifestations of your frustration arising out of electoral reverses. Fortunately, the virus of disinformation cannot alter facts," he said. Puri has slammed the Opposition for its criticism of the government on the new Parliament building and asked where these parties were when the resolution was passed by both houses to the effect in October 2019. The Congress has opposed the new Parliament building and none of its leaders attended the foundation stone-laying function. Congress spokesperson Surpriya Shrinate wondered if rallies can be organised and addressed by BJP leaders on farm laws, why cannot the Parliament session be held. She asked whether the people attending the big rallies organised by the ruling party are not affected by the coronavirus. Shrinate also accused the government of speaking half-truths about not holding the winter session of Parliament and said no opposition leader was consulted on the issue. "I will only urge the ministers of this government to stop resorting to blatant lies. It does not suit their profiles, it does not suit the positions they occupy. I find it extremely distressing that people in important positions of power and ministers in this government resort to half-truths," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/hardeep-singh-puri-jairam-ramesh-spar-over-parliament-session-new-building-928090.html

Shah expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Modi for this decision, which will benefit five crore sugarcane farmers, their families and five lakh workers associated with the sector. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the prime minister, has approved the assistance of about Rs 3,500 crore for sugarcane farmers. Currently, there are close to five crore sugarcane farmers and their dependents in the country. In addition to this, there are about five lakh workers employed in sugar mills and ancillary activities and their livelihood depends on the sugar industry, an official statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-government-continuously-working-for-farmers-interests-amit-shah-928115.html
16-12-2020||National Politics||Government being insensitive to woes of people: Congress on LPG price hike||Hitting out at the government over the rise in the cost of domestic cooking gas, the Congress on Wednesday accused it of being insensitive to the woes of the common people and demanded an immediate rollback of the hike in the price of LPG cylinders. Cooking gas LPG price on Wednesday was increased by Rs 50 per cylinder, the second hike in rate this month following firming of international prices. Non-subsidised LPG price was increased to Rs 694 per 14.2-kg cylinder from Rs 644 earlier, according to a price notification of state fuel marketing companies. Using the hashtag "LPGPriceHike", Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Attack on 'Annapurna' (the Hindu goddess of food) along with 'Annadata' (farmers), and how much more will you render the country helpless." Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala slammed the government over the issue, saying the "profit-seeking BJP government was assaulting the budget of the common man". Taking a swipe at the government, he said in "these acche din (good days)" the price of LPG gas without any subsidy has been raised twice by Rs 100 in the past 15 days. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate at a press conference termed the LPG price hike as "extremely unfortunate". In the last 15 days, the price of LPG cylinders has gone up by Rs 100 per cylinder. This has not just upset the monthly budget of families but has also brought about a huge pain for the middle class, for the poor, for the lower-middle class, who are finding it extremely difficult to buy gas cylinders, she said. Shrinate alleged that non-subsidised LPG cylinders were sold for Rs 574, today they are being sold for Rs 694. "This government has raised prices of petrol and diesel. There is huge taxation there. This government in its tenure so far and its first and second tenure has increased excise duty almost a dozen times and has earned about Rs 22 lakh crore," she claimed. "It is time you (government) bring some relief to the common man, because the common man today is reeling under economic slowdown, joblessness, wage cuts and your mismanagement of the Indian economy during the lockdown," Shrinate said. This is "extremely unfortunate and insensitive, and this also reflects complete lack of economic management", she said. Shrinate said that "anybody who understands economics will understand and will know that to spur up consumption, you will have to lower prices, especially in an economy like ours where consumption forms 60 per cent of our GDP". "If you do not spur consumption, no economy can recover, we are already in a recession. So we will urge and hope that the government will respond to the needs of the common man, to the needs of the poor people, to the needs of the women, who have to manage their kitchens, and roll back the LPG price hikes that has happened because Rs 100 per cylinder is a very-very steep hike," she said. Shrinate asked the government to provide some respite and said this will only happen if the Centre rolls back the hike in prices of LPG cylinders. "Instead of pasting your pictures all over the country, and tom-tomming what great things you have done which in reality are turning out to be nothing but boastful claims. Please, bring some respite for the common man," she said, alleging that the government will only earn profits and not share the burden of the common man. This is the second increase in LPG rate this month. On December 1, price was hiked by a similar Rs 50 per cylinder. Prior to that, the price had remained unchanged at Rs 594 a cylinder since July. This was the same rate at which subsidised LPG refills are also sold. Since May, most cooking gas customers have not received subsidies as the combination of international oil price collapse and domestic refill rate increases brought parity between subsidised and market rates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/government-being-insensitive-to-woes-of-people-congress-on-lpg-price-hike-928124.html

Police had said that they had received a call that Sant Ram Singh (65) had shot himself, and they were trying to verify a handwritten note in Punjabi, purportedly left behind by him, that says he was unable to bear the "pain of farmers". Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Modi government should quit its "stubbornness" and withdraw the laws. "Sant Baba Ram Singh Ji of Karnal committed suicide after seeing the plight of farmers on the Kundli border. My condolences and tribute in this hour of grief. Many farmers have sacrificed their lives. The brutality of the Modi government has crossed all limits. Quit stubbornness and immediately withdraw the anti-agricultural law," he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also blamed the government for the incident. An official of the Sonipat police said they had received a call that Sant Ram Singh, who hailed from Karnal, allegedly shot himself. He was rushed to a hospital in Panipat where doctors declared him brought dead. The official said the exact spot where the incident took place is being verified and police are in the process of recording statements of the deceased's family members. SAD spokesperson and Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa expressed grief over the incident and urged farmers to exercise restraint.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-targets-govt-over-death-of-sikh-preacher-near-singhu-border-928126.html

16-12-2020||North and Central||Noida to Delhi route via Chilla border closed due to farmers' protest||One side of the Delhi-Noida Link Road was closed for commuters on Wednesday due to the ongoing protest by farmers at the Chilla border here amid heavy police deployment, officials said. Barricades have been set up on the road, prohibiting vehicular movement from Noida to Delhi, while the other side (Delhi to Noida) was open, Noida Traffic Police officials said. Also, traffic was diverted from the Dalit Prerna Sthal, another site of the farmers' protests, to the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway in the wake of the situation at the Chilla border, an official said. "The route was closed around 11 am. The DND and the Kalindi Kunj routes are operational and commuters are advised to take these routes for travelling to and fro Delhi," the official said. The Chilla route had remained obstructed since December 1 when the protest started here. One side of the road (Noida to Delhi) had remained closed during a large part of the period until December 12, when protesters agreed to open it for the sake of commuters but stayed put at the border. However, a disagreement cropped up between splinter groups of farmer unions who opposed the move that led to a brief closure of the road on Tuesday as well, according to a BKU (Bhanu) protestor. Farmers, chiefly belonging to the Bharatiya Kisan Union's Bhanu and Lok Shakti factions, are staging demonstrations at the Chilla border and the Dalit Prerna Sthal respectively to protest the three new farm laws brought by the Centre. The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. Government officials said efforts are being made for the next round of talks between representatives of the Centre and the farmers so that the logjam over the new laws could end.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-to-delhi-route-via-chilla-border-closed-due-to-farmers-protest-927935.html
16-12-2020||North and Central||Those protesting against farm laws are 'middlemen': Madhya Pradesh minister||Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Kamal Patel on Wednesday claimed those protesting against the Centre's three new farm laws are "middlemen" and not real farmers. Talking to PTI, Patel asserted that the new farm rules will give cultivators the real price for their produce and an opportunity to trade, export, and set up food processing units and warehouses. Till now, middlemen used to buy crops of farmers at very low prices and sell them to end users at ten times higher rates by grading the purchase as per the quality of crop, Patel said. "As the three new laws have hit hard the middlemen, who have captured the entire market and given donations to political parties, they are agitating on the issue and demanding their rollback," the minister claimed. "As these laws are hitting hard the middlemen, who were associated with one party or the other, they are agitating on the issue. They are not real farmers," he added. The new farm laws are totally for the benefit of farmers and give them the facility to get loans against their properties and lands, he said. "With these laws, the cultivators have a big opportunity to produce, trade, export and set up food processing units and warehouses to enhance their incomes," the minister said. The new laws will give farmers an opportunity to sell their produce directly to the end user, bypassing the middlemen, he said. After the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Swamitva Yojna, farmers are now in a position to get loans against their properties and have money in their hands to spent on doing business on their own, he said. Terming implementation of the Swamitva Yojna as a "historic step", Patel said, "It gave real independence to rural folks after the country was liberated over 70 years ago, as now they have become owners of their land and have documents to show to financial institutions." Earlier, in rural areas people had their own houses, but did not have any documentary evidence to prove that the land as their own. "With the Swamitva Yojna, which I had implemented in 2008 in Harda district as the Mukhya Mantri Gramin Awas Yojna, people have become owners of their land in the real sense, as they have papers to show in banks and courts to prove their ownership to get loans from financial institutions," he said. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

Police said the incident took place on Monday night in Palimukim Pur village when the 28-year-old Bablu went to meet his friends soon after his marriage. His friends, already in an inebriated state, demanded more liquor from him, but the victim expressed his inability to arrange it saying that they already have enough of it, police said. This triggered arguments resulting in one of his friends stabbing him in a fit of rage, said police, adding the victim was rushed to a hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries.

AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, who met Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on Wednesday, said here his party was in favour of allying with smaller outfits in Uttar Pradesh in next year's Assembly elections. Asaduddin was on a two-day visit to the state. Rajbhar said after the meeting that seven other smaller outfits had also decided to join the alliance. ''We will contest the polls together and oust the BJP from power in the state,'' he added. Owaisi said that he would also meet Shivpal Singh Yadav, the estranged uncle of SP president Akhilesh Yadav, to discuss the possibility of joining the alliance. ''Shivpal Yadav is an important political figure,'' he remarked, when queried whether the issue of alliance would also be discussed. The AIMIM chief hit back at West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC president Mamata Banerjee over the latter's allegation that the former was working as a 'B team' of the BJP and was also receiving funds from the saffron party. ''No one can buy Asauddin Owaisi,'' he said also rejecting the assertions that he was helping the BJP by dividing the Muslim votes. Owaisi's party had made handsome gains in the recently concluded Assembly polls in Bihar and managed to win five seats there, especially in the Muslim dominated 'Seemanchal' region upsetting the electoral arithmetic of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress alliance. Although the SP rubbished the suggestions that Owaisi could dent the former's Muslim vote bank, political observers said that AIMIM could make inroads in the minority community votes of the SP and Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/owaisi-to-contest-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-in-alliance-with-smaller-outfits-927970.html

16-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi High Court seeks response on children, bonded labourers' back wages PIL from Centre, AAP||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the responses of the Centre and the AAP government on a Public Interest Litigation seeking recovery of back wages due to rescued child and bonded labourers. Back wages envisages to correct wage violations by requiring the employer to make up for the difference between what the employee was paid and the amount he should have been paid. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notices to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Delhi government and the police over the plea filed by the father of a now-rescued child labourer. "Give us a detailed status report," the bench said, and listed the matter for January 22. In his plea filed through advocates Kriti Awasthi and Nimisha Menon, the petitioner has sought an expeditious recovery of the back wages due to his child as well as to 115 other victims of bonded labour in whose cases the recovery process has been initiated after they were rescued. The plea also seeks directions to the authorities to “initiate the recovery proceedings in 77 cases where recovery, till date, has not been initiated”. The petitioner has contended that the authorities have allegedly failed to recover the back wages of his child and those of other similarly placed victims of bonded labour who are entitled to such relief as per various high court judgments. The petition has said that such recovered amounts would serve as a rehabilitative financial assistance for the rescued victims of child and bonded labour. The plea has further contended that various government schemes and policies also entitle such children/victims to back wages. The petitioner has claimed that his child was entitled to the back wages within seven days from the date of being rescued, which was in 2014, but nothing has been done in six years. Similar is the situation of other rescued victims of child and bonded labour, the plea has claimed, and added that the back wages have not been received by them despite being identified as bonded labourers and receiving their release certificates. The petition has contended that if the amounts are not received, these victims would be prone to be re-trafficked. The petitioner has claimed that his child was working as a bonded labourer when he was just eight-year-old and worked for one-and-a-half years before he was rescued in 2014. "During the course of his employment, the petitioner's child, was subjected to severe abuse for over a period of one-and-a-half-years at the hands of the trafficker/employer who inhumanely compelled the child to work for around 12 hours a day and for wages less than the prescribed minimum wages. "The rights of the petitioner's child as envisaged under Article 19, 21 and 23 of the Constitution of India were infringed. The petitioner's child was illegally forced to work as a child bonded labourer without basic wages, and in aberration of his liberties suffered the most dehumanizing treatment," the petition has said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-high-court-seeks-response-on-children-bonded-labourers-back-wages-pil-from-centre-aap-927992.html
16-12-2020||North and Central||Biting cold grips north India; eight killed in UP accident due to fog||Icy winds swept north India on Wednesday, with Amritsar in Punjab reporting the lowest minimum temperature in the plains, while dense fog engulfed several parts of Uttar Pradesh, where eight people died when a bus collided with a gas tanker amid reduced visibility. The mercury dropped below the freezing point in several hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. "The lowest minimum temperature of 2.0°C reported at Amritsar (Punjab) over the plains of the country," the India Meteorological Department's bulletin said. The maximum temperature in the holy city settled at 8.2 degrees Celsius, which was down by 13 notches against normal limits, making it even colder than Manali, Shimla and Srinagar. Manali, Shimla and Srinagar recorded maximum temperatures of 10.4 degrees Celsius, 11.7 degrees Celsius and 10.4 degrees Celsius, respectively. Delhi registered a minimum temperature of 5.8 degrees Celsius, while the visibility dropped to 100 metres in the Palam area in the morning due to "dense fog". The India Meteorological Department has predicted both "cold day" and "cold wave" in parts of the national capital on Thursday and Friday. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, experienced the coldest night of the season as the valley reeled under cold conditions with the mercury plummeting several degrees below the freezing point owing to a clear sky. The mercury in Gulmarg, the famous ski-resort in north Kashmir, settled at a low of minus 11.0 degrees Celsius which is about seven degrees below the normal for this time of the season, the officials said. The resort was the coldest recorded place in the Union Territory. In Himachal Pradesh, the weather remained dry in the last 24 hours, even as Manali, Dalhousie, Keylong and Kalpa in the state shivered at sub-zero temperatures. The minimum temperature decreased by one to two degrees Celsius in the state in the last 24 hours, the MeT Department said. Keylong, the administrative centre of the tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti, continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 5.6 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in Rajasthan has dropped by up to four degrees in the last 24 hours and the weather office has issued a cold wave warning for the next two days. Ganganagar was recorded as the coldest place in the state at 2.5 degrees Celsius. Parts of Uttar Pradesh received light rains, while dense fog engulfed isolated places over western part of the state. Eight people died, while 21 more sustained injuries on Wednesday morning when an Uttar Pradesh Roadways bus collided with a gas tanker amid reduced visibility due to fog, police said. Bareilly was the coldest place in the state where the minimum temperature was 5.3 degrees Celsius. Weather is most likely to remain dry and shallow to moderate fog is very likely at isolated places over the state on December 18 and 19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/biting-cold-grips-north-india-eight-killed-in-up-accident-due-to-fog-928116.html

At about 1800 hours, the Pakistan army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and intense shelling with mortars along the LoC in Nowshera sector in Rajouri district, a defence spokesman said. He said the Indian Army retaliated befittingly. The Line of Control (LoC) has witnessed heavy and intense firing and shelling in the last few months resulting in several casualties and triggering fear psychosis among the people living along the India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. On December 1, the Pakistan army restored to unprovoked ceasefire violation by shelling Rajouri sector in which BSF Sub Inspector Paotinsat Guite died. Two Army jawans Prem Bahadur Khatri and Sukhbir Singh were killed when Pakistani troops violated ceasefire along the LoC in Sunderbani sector on November 27.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pakistan-army-shells-forward-posts-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-928129.html
16-12-2020||North and Central||BJP, AAP demand CBI probe into Rs 2,500 crore scam in Delhi municipal corporations||The Delhi BJP on Wednesday challenged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to recommend a CBI probe into the alleged Rs 2,500 crore scam in the party-ruled municipal corporations, and step down from his post if the charges are not proven. Addressing a conference in front of Kejriwal’s residence where mayors and leaders of BJP-ruled corporations are holding an indefinite dharna, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta also alleged that the ruling AAP was trying to divert attention from the Rs 13,000 crore dues owed to the civic bodies by the city government. The AAP has been targeting the municipal corporations alleging misappropriation of Rs 2500 crore ahead of the civic body polls due in 2022. The ruling party has also called a special one-day session of the Delhi Assembly on Thursday to discuss the scam. “Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is making unwarranted and ludicrous allegations of Rs 2500 crore scam against the North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations,” Gupta said. "We challenge Arvind Kejriwal to get CBI or any independent agency to investigate the allegations against the municipal corporations. If these allegations turn out to be false, the chief minister should step down from his post," he added. Meanwhile, the AAP also called for a CBI probe in the matter. “Even AAP is demanding a CBI inquiry into the matter and that is why party leaders went to protest in front of the residences of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and LG Anil Baijal, but they were arrested,” senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said. “Why the BJP is showing its double face to public at large? When we protested against the scam, we were beaten up by police. Many party workers were arrested. We demand a thorough probe to unearth the truth,” a party statement said. The Delhi BJP president said a proposed settlement of rent dues between two constitutional bodies--North and South DMCs--does not involve transaction of a single penny and hence, involves no scam. "Ever since the AAP formed government in Delhi, it has consistently cut and delayed funds of municipal corporations. The Delhi government did not implement the fourth Delhi Finance Commission recommendations on municipal funds, thus paying hardly 50 per cent of the actual due funds," he alleged. The AAP leaders have claimed that all due funds were paid to the three corporations and claimed that corruption and inefficiency was responsible for the financial mess in the civic bodies. The BJP conference was also addressed by party MPs Meenakshi Lekhi, Gautam Gambhir and Hans Raj Hans. Lekhi challenged Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia for a debate on the condition of Delhi government schools. Sisodia, who will be visiting Uttar Pradesh on December 22, had challenged BJP ministers for a debate over the condition of schools in the northern state. BJP MPs Gautam Gambhir and Hans Raj Hans also slammed Kejriwal for not meeting the protesting mayors and leaders, including many women councilors, sitting on dharna outside the CM's residence for ten days in the biting cold. The BJP leaders and workers will hold fast in support of the protest outside Kejriwal's residence on Thursday. A demonstration will also be staged outside Delhi Assembly, party leaders said. Delhi BJP media cell head Naveen Kumar said 20 of the protesters sitting outside Kejriwal’s residence will go on an indefinite hunger strike from Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-aap-demand-cbi-probe-into-rs-2500-crore-scam-in-delhi-municipal-corporations-928141.html
16-12-2020||Oasis||No one is above the law of karma||A saying in Sanskrit says that one must always be wary of a fire which has not been put off effectively. Even a weak ember buried amidst cold ashes can have an uncanny way of springing an unpleasant surprise on a complacent person. When matters work out the way we desire it, we move forward with the policy of let bygones be bygones. We seldom realise that the affected party may not sport the same attitude. Resentment and anger may be stifled inside them. The bitterness in their bosoms might find expression at an unexpected moment, thereby jeopardizing our best laid plans.  In the Mahabharata, when the Pandavas arrived at the royal palace after the Great War, they went to seek the blessings of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. The grief stricken couple had lost their one hundred sons to the vengeance of the Pandavas. They were aware of the sinful nature of their children. Yet they were overwhelmed by the tragedy. They put on a courageous and composed front to meet their victorious nephews. When Yudhishtira paid his respects to the elderly couple, they could not help shedding tears of distress and helplessness. Even though Gandhari was blindfolded she focused on the ground to avoid any kind of a confrontation with the righteous Yudhishtira. In her seething anger, she happened to sight the toe of the senior Pandava. It charred with the ray of her burning fury.  Krishna sensed the unsettled undercurrents in the reunion. He knew that Gandhari was righteous and more forgiving than her husband. Hence Krishna accepted her curse of total annihilation of his Yadava Kula with grace. When it was the bereaved father’s turn to embrace Bhima, Krishna placed an iron statue of the Pandava in front of the blind king. As expected, the deadly combination of bereavement and anger enabled Dhritarashtra to make the cast iron idol crumble to mere dust. A round of grief ensued after the thoughtless act and some semblance of normalcy was restored when the couple was reassured of Bhima’s well being.  This incident is a proof of Newton’s third law about every action having an equal and opposite reaction. In other words no one can be above the law of Karma||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/no-one-is-above-the-law-of-karma-927825.html

But when it comes to another connection, our innernet connection that links us to our instinct, our heart and our soul, we draw a big blank. If I were to tell people that the supplier of the innernet connection is one’s own self, they will probably think I have lost it. All of us have that innernet connection which has so far been untapped and unused. It’s that tiny voice that constantly whispers in our hearts, ensuring that we listen to our gut and conscience, tugging us in all strange directions. So often we end up saying that we didn’t know why we did a certain thing, which ended up changing the course of our life. What we don’t know is that at that time the signals from our innernet connection were so strong that they were sending just one message, saying, “go for it,” which ended up guiding our path and our destiny. So often we feel restless about a person only to later realize that at that time they were in trouble. This was nothing but the innernet connection absorbing the signals the person was sending out. Many times, we have these feelings that something is not right, though on the surface of it, everything seems alright. And when that same situation turns negative, we know that our restless feeling sending us doubtful signals was right. We also end up saying that we were getting the negative vibrations. It was nothing but our innernet connection sending us those signals. We can make use of this personal WIFI (Wonderful Inner Faculty Influence) by listening to those soft but insistent voices that are universally known as our gut feeling and the voice of our soul, drowned out by the hustle bustle of life. If you were to keep a watch you would see that so often our instinct guides us, our gut feeling turns out to be true, the tug of our conscience saves us from long-term misery and the voice of our heart and soul serves us well. So fine-tune your innernet connection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/check-your-innernet-connection-928168.html
16-12-2020||Opinion||Trust deficit in insurance sector||Disillusionment with the insurance sector has been growing. This raises a question whether the liberalisation of the insurance sector has uplifted the prospects of insurance as a protection-cum-investment tool and whether the entry of foreign insurers has improved penetration rates. The penetration rates of insurance in India are far from satisfactory which means opening up the sector has only resulted in shifting the business from nationalised insurance companies to private companies. While private insurers and those banks that have forged alliances with foreign insurance companies have used every marketing trick in the trade to acquire customers, the insurance industry today has become an industry where the trust deficit is substantially high due to rampant mis-selling. Walk into any branch of State Bank of India, HDFC Bank or Axis Bank and request for a fixed deposit form –within no time, someone in the branch (an assistant branch manager who has been given targets) will insist on a dialogue with you – “Why do you want to invest in fixed deposits? Why don’t you invest in a guaranteed plan?” If you probe a little further, the penny will drop that they are referring to an insurance scheme with an investment element in it. Do these bank officials really know the scheme? Have they understood the clauses? Have they done some homework? Some of these bank officials will flash brochures of these schemes and explain to you that rest assured these schemes would fetch a return of anywhere between 13-18%. These officials would conveniently forget to add that these returns are subject to risks. Most of us have not forgotten how a private insurance company sold a senior citizen a scheme and collected a one-time premium of Rs.50,00 only to deliver him Rs 280 as the final maturity amount a few years later. I have also faced losses when I was sold a policy. After seven years, I simply got the principal amount back. Market risks were blamed for the poor returns. This was supposed to be a fund for funding the education of children. This is the reason most investors squirm at the very mention of insurance. All the claims of insurance as a protection tool turn hollow with such rampant misinformation and mis-selling. The nationalised insurance companies didn’t render great customer service but at least they did not suffer a trust deficit from customers. When you purchased a life insurance policy from LIC, you were assured that you would get some benefit out of it. Today, that kind of assurance appears to have become a far-fetched dream. This leads us to a question – should we revisit the insurance business model as such? The idea of collecting premiums from a large number of people to pay the claims of a few may have sounded logical years ago. Today, with frequent bouts of economic recession, lay-offs and salary cuts, it is unfair to expect customers to part with their hard-earned money to buy insurance policies that may not guarantee returns that they promise while marketing the product. Financial experts are now arguing that every individual should build his own corpus and keep aside certain sums of money as a means of self-insurance. Well, the moral and morale hazard in insurance continues to plague the sector but the trust deficit engendered by ostentatious claims by private insurers in India has made customers shun buying insurance altogether. This decision is most often a result of prior adverse experience. This is akin to throwing out the baby along with the bathwater. It is also prudent for an individual to ask, “Why are insurers constantly calculating claim ratios as a performance metric?” On one hand, insurers offer to protect an individual from risks and on the other hand, they want to limit their claims. In fact, claims are considered as “losses” by insurers and premiums are “incomes”. There is an urgent need to clarify all these terminologies as the millennial and Gen Z population may take umbrage to the fact that the money paid by them as premium is considered an income and the money that the insurance owes them as part of contractual clauses is considered a loss. This is the reason the concept of insurance per se needs to be upturned. Excellent customer service is a great differentiator but not many insurance organisations can stake claim to having raised the bar on their service standards. Most of the efforts by insurance organisations are directed towards soliciting customers to buy an insurance policy but when it is a question of claims management, a slew of performance measures emerge from nowhere. Private Banks and private insurers have added to the chaos through their shambolic efforts to acquire customers at any cost. There is a lot that needs to be done from a regulatory perspective.

16-12-2020||Opinion||Why do I write?||The lockdown took me down the memory line.  While studying in Mangaluru, I was neither studious nor genius.  My penmanship was not legible.  Many of my neighbours, including girls who studied in prestigious college used to mock at me and my handwriting as Kori and Kakke kal (The legs of hen and crows). Their prediction was that a person with bad handwriting would one day become a rubbish writer.  I was inspired by a gift.  It all began one day when I commenced writing using the new Reynolds (original) ball pen, which was presented to me the previous day by our neighbour who had returned for Christmas from Gulf. It was in 1980. I started writing in inland letters to the ‘letters to the editor column’ to a Kannada daily. Newspapers were our inspiration.  The other inspiration was College Times scheduled for Monday. The happenings and incidents taking place both inside the college and outside, the strike here, the dharna there, fighting here, dance everywhere influenced me.   My skills improved, thanks to the appearance of my name in the letters to the editor column in a popular Bengaluru-based English weekly.  Every Thursday, I would buy a copy, read a lead or an article, buy an inland letter write and promptly post in the post box. Come Thursday, I would buy a copy and show the same to my friends in college, and the neighbourhood.  Some seniors who considered me as a budding writer took me several times for a coffee in the nearby Shetty Ice Cream Parlour. Those who commented earlier also came and said sorry.  An incident which took place later influenced my ‘writing’.  A lecturer who taught us the English language called on me once. I told him, “I am writing to earn a name”.  Instead, he advised me to write and earn a name.  A senior came to my rescue. He explained to me the difference between the two while walking past Hampanakatta, Light House Hill road, Central library.    The difference between the two, the advice and the explanation given and the role of my seniors from my and other colleges all came to my mind when I was watching Gulf returnees on TV during the lockdown and also the gifted pen. The lessons I learnt still remain even four decades later. Now tell me whether you are writing to earn name or the other?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/why-do-i-write-928170.html
16-12-2020||Panorama||Need to operationalise green indexing of govt programmes||In India, the implementation of a large number of developmental and infrastructure programmes have often led to environmental degradation. Very often, environmental damage is recognised post-implementation of a programme or a project. The Government of India has Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and clearance requirements for large projects. Even this is a flawed process since most of the projects are cleared anyway. Of late, there have been efforts to further dilute the EIA. The government designs and implements a large number of developmental and infrastructural projects with massive investments such as MGNREGA (rural job scheme), watershed development, afforestation, irrigation, power generation, housing, road works etc. These large programmes could have negative consequences for environment such as land, water, air, forests, oceans or could also provide an opportunity to reclaim and regenerate environment. The Karnataka government undertook a unique initiative of assessing the greenness of all the developmental and infrastructural projects and schemes. The initiative was taken by the Department of Environment and Forests through the Environment Management and Policy Research Institute. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) undertook the task of developing a ‘Green Index’ and evaluating majority of the developmental and infrastructural projects of 20 major departments covering nearly 200 programmes.  Green Index is a composite measure of the environmental performance of a programme, scheme or a project. Development of Green Index creates multiple opportunities to promote green development at the state level. Green Index would enable them to identify opportunities to minimise the damage to environment and promote conservation and sustainable use of resources. Green Index is developed using a set of indicators and sub-indicators reflecting environmental concerns such as: adoption of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Systems, Water Conservation and Recycling, Waste Treatment and Recycling, air Pollution Control, Biodiversity Conservation, Carbon dioxide (CO2) Emission Reduction or Sequestration, and Adaptation to Disasters and Climate Change.  Green Index has been developed for the approved and ongoing programmes and schemes that are being implemented by different departments. Both Central and state-sponsored schemes that have implications for environment have been considered for green indexing. The scoring of indicators and sub-indicators is based only on the programme guidelines or components, government order and detailed project reports, and not on the impacts of the programme or scheme on the ground. The main purpose of the Green Index development is to create awareness within the government departments and among different stakeholders about environmental considerations in designing and implementation of government programmes or schemes, and facilitate enhanced financial allocations and rewards to green programmes and projects. It is also to empower the government, in a phased manner, to enforce use of renewable resources, conservation of resources, minimisation of pollution, treatment of wastes, and regeneration of environment, meet relevant climate change goals and SDGs (Sustainable Developmental Goals), and facilitate implementation of State Action Plan on Climate Change. The findings of the study showed that a majority of the projects and schemes were not green, highlighting the need for and potential to enhance the greenness of the programme components. The environment-related considerations for promoting green development in Karnataka to be considered at the programme or scheme preparation or design stage, using a set of key environmental concerns and indicators are given below. Energy efficiency and renewable energy systems: All programmes that use energy directly or indirectly should have a mandatory requirement or regulation to incorporate most energy efficient systems, appliances and standards. All programmes and activities where fossil fuels or electricity is used, should have a provision for adoption of renewable energy technologies and sources of renewable power. Water conservation and recycling: There is a need for regulation on use of ground water and all programmes which require water must have a mandatory requirement for adopting water conservation and recycling measures. Further, programmes where recycled water could be used, should incorporate provisions for use of recycled water. Waste treatment, recycling and air pollution abatement: All programmes that have activities leading to generation of solid or liquid waste or pollute air or water should have mandatory requirement to adopt technologies for solid or liquid waste treatment and air pollution mitigation. CO­2 emission reduction and carbon sequestration: All programmes requiring use of fossil fuel energy should have provision for adopting energy efficiency measures and shifting to renewable sources of energy, where feasible, to reduce CO2 emission. Land-based programmes should have a provision for minimising tree felling and promoting compensatory tree planting for carbon sequestration. Programmes using fossil fuel energy on a large-scale should have a provision for reporting CO2 emissions. Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services: Land and water-based programmes should have a provision for banning or minimising tree felling and to avoid loss of biodiversity of plants, fishes, etc. Biodiversity conservation should be made mandatory for all programmes that impact biodiversity and ecosystemservices. Adaptation to climate change and disasters: Where possible, activities aimed at promoting adaptation to climate change and disasters should be incorporated in the programme guidelines. India secured 168th rank, at the bottom, in the 12th edition of the biennial Environment Performance Index 2020 that measured the environmental performance of 180 countries, released by the Yale University. India scored below the regional average score on all five key parameters on environmental health, including air quality, sanitation, drinking water, heavy metals and waste management. Thus India and Karnataka should adopt the green index concept to enhance the standing globally and more importantly, to ensure environmentally sound and sustained development; clear air, water and energy, biodiversity conservation, reducing climate change, adopting to climate change and disasters, ensure sustained food production and economic development. In this context, the Government of Karnataka was the first to unveil the Green Index in March 2020. During the budget speech 2020, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa indicated that the Green Index would become an integral aspect of formulating policies and guidelines. The state government should operationalise Green Indexing of government programmes and schemes and aim at conserving environment and promoting sustainable development.  (Ravindranath is Retired Professor, IISc; Murthy is with CSTEP)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/need-to-operationalise-green-indexing-of-govt-programmes-927823.html
16-12-2020||Panorama||Unemployment rampant among women||In recent years, there is an upsurge in the enrolment of girls in higher education in all major disciplines across the country. Though it appears to be an encouraging scenario, their presence in salaried employment has not gone up accordingly.  In contrast, the number of working women is declining. This trend is alarming, especially in the present times of increasing awareness of women empowerment, liberalization, free economy and social mobility. If girls can pursue higher education comfortably, what are the barriers for their career aspirations? According to a recent study of the International Labour Organization, globally 75% of men are employed, while only 49% of women are salaried. Moreover, the figure is much lower in India, with only 27% of women being employed. And that too, most women in India work in unorganized sectors for lower salaries. Quite fascinatingly, another global survey by the International Labour Organization explores, what does woman really aspire to do--household management or salaried employment?  The findings reveal that 70% of women prefer to do any kind of work rather than home management. Still, they are not visible in the job market in proportion to their education.  The obvious reasons could be, the patriarchal social and cultural constraints as well as traditionally recognized family responsibilities. So, we as a society look at a man getting into a job without further enquiries. However, a woman has to answer the following possible queries satisfactorily: How far is the office from home?  What about the working hours? Is it possible to balance the household responsibilities first and then the job? Is there a safe transport facility?... Here, we also find a common link between the financial status of a family and the need for a woman to work outside. If the husband has a good job and takes complete financial responsibilities, then the wife will not seek employment mostly. Similarly, if there is a financial hardship, the wife will inevitably look for a job. Thus, the financial status of the family is the deciding factor, whether a woman should be employed, not her educational qualifications or personal aspirations. As a result, we often see more of poor or less educated women working outside at lower levels and sometimes in vulnerable conditions too, not the rich or highly educated women. Surprisingly, even in this age of woman empowerment, globally 20% of men and 14% of women still feel that women should not work outside. According to World Bank Report of 2018, the number of working women in rural India has declined by 11.5% and in urban India by 5% respectively. Likewise, among graduate girls, 67% in rural India and 68.3% in urban areas are still unemployed. However, the number of women getting a higher education is increasing. As a matter of fact, we do find women in large numbers at entry-level jobs. But they quit at the middle level due to family obligations.  This problem can be partially resolved if the institutions provide support facilities for child care for young mothers.  It is generally observed fact that women take less leave from office, perform better and comparatively take less tea breaks in-office hours. Yet, institutions hesitate to provide jobs for them. For instance, instead of providing child care facilities for a mother, they hesitate to hire such women. As a result, women brush their educational background aside and work in traditionally feminine jobs like beauty and health care or any other part-time jobs. Interestingly, in the teaching profession too, we find a large number of men in the higher education sector and women at school levels. Here, we should compare the immense difference in drawn salary at two levels.  The basic question here, why should India push for the employment of women? According to a study by McKinsey Global Institute in 2015, India’s GDP will see 60% increase by 2025, if women are employed equally. Currently, women contribute only 17% to the country’s GDP.  Thus, for their own self-reliance and also for the country’s growth, Indian women have to walk for long miles on the path to true equality. As Gandhi said, the change we want to see in the world must begin with ourselves. For this, we need to broaden the spectrums of our social and traditional values.

16-12-2020||Panorama||Legal considerations of agri reforms||Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. The Government of India recently enacted three core agricultural legislations – The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Bill, The Farmer’s (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. These Acts were met with widespread protests as they were perceived to favour large corporations by going against the interests of farmers and go beyond the scope of the Centre’s right to make laws on matters in the State list. After a harrowing journey in the cold, braving tear gas and water cannons, thousands of farmers have congregated in the national capital demanding a recall of the Acts that would deregulate the agricultural sector and make the farmers more susceptible to exploitation by large corporations.  The new Acts allow for stockpiling of food, which can lead to a rise in prices of essential commodities during times of scarcity. 30% of marginal and small farmers are poor and illiterate. They do not possess adequate bargaining power to negotiate with large corporations. Furthermore, the Bills were passed hastily through a voice vote, without much deliberation. The Acts do not mandate for a written contract, further aggrieving farmers in case of a violation. Farmers fear that they may lose their safeguards with the enactment of the new legislation. Did the government have the power to enact these Acts? India follows a federal structure of government with power being separated between the Union and the State governments. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution contains three lists – Union, State and Concurrent, effectively delegating Legislative powers between the Centre and the States. Agriculture, Markets and Fairs and Trade and Commerce within the State are State subjects. However, it is subject to Entry 33 of the Concurrent List where both States and the Union can legislate. In case of a repugnancy, laws of the Union override State laws. Entry 33 of the Concurrent List in its present form was added to the Constitution via the Constitution (Third Amendment) Act, 1954. The term agriculture has not been explicitly stated in the Concurrent List. The Union government has interpreted the term ‘food items’ to include agriculture. It has used Entry 33 as a tool to infringe on the rights of States to legislate by making laws on matters beyond its jurisdiction. Furthermore, these Acts do not mention, in their Statement of Objects & Reasons, the Constitutional provisions under which Parliament has the power to legislate on the subjects covered. The Supreme Court in ITC Limited vs. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and Others, 2002 has upheld the legislative powers and powers to levy tax on agricultural produce of States through intra-State agricultural marketing. In Union of India vs H.S.Dhillon, 1972, the Supreme Court held that the constitutionality of Parliamentary laws can be challenged only on two grounds – if it’s violative of fundamental rights or if the law is made on a subject in the State list.  In Punjab, where the protests and opposition to the Acts are particularly strong, the State Government has passed laws negating the Central laws, essentially removing them from the ambit of the Central laws. It is to be seen if this will stand the test of Constitutional validity. The Opposition is considering using Article 254(2) of the Indian Constitution which provides for States to enact legislation on a subject in the Concurrent List which conflicts with Central legislation, provided that Presidential assent is received by such legislation. However, this seems unlikely. Although Federalism is not explicitly set out in the Constitution, the Supreme Court in the case of S.R Bommai Vs. Union of India, 1994 held that it forms the basic structure of the Constitution. Any law that violates the basic structure is held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It’s evident that agriculture as a legislative subject is outside the purview of Parliament. The Centre should not use an emergency legal provision to impinge on the rights of States. The Haryana Government’s suppression of peaceful protest is highly condemnable. Talks are ongoing between the Centre and the farmers. It is to be seen whether a consensus can be reached which proves beneficial to the stakeholders.

16-12-2020||Right in the Middle||A scare||I set out on my usual daily walk-run routine one morning around 5:30 am. This helped me deal with the isolation pressures and is an important part. That day, I was blessed with the best of Bengaluru weather-- it was a little cool from the drizzle the day before.  Armed with my mask, I often set out early so that I could maintain social distancing. A few hundred steps into my routine, just as my mind and body were settling into the rhythm-- with no headphones or music just me and my thoughts--I heard the noise of a  two-wheeler coming from my right side. Before I could understand what was happening, a hand grabbed my right hand, let go and sped off.  It was two youngsters on a black Activa wearing masks. "What is the matter? What happened?" I asked them, startled. The pillion rider who was the one who had grabbed my hand turned back, flipped me the bird, before speeding off.  I had no time to note the number.  I had never seen them before in my life. I was just a stranger to them.  Wondering what to do, I retraced my steps , and without disturbing the sleeping members of my family, washed my hand thoroughly in Dettol and soap. After that, I set off on my run again.  My mind was disturbed.  Why would these youngsters do this to me during these pandemic times? As a middle-aged man, just minding my own business peacefully and trying to take care of my health?  Have they done this to others--especially vulnerable seniors or women runners alone?  All these thoughts were running through my mind, I stopped at the nearby Church from outside and offered my prayers for these youngsters. May they change from this path of trying to harm others and may they turn out to be blessings to society.  Continuing with my run, I crossed several other runners waved in acknowledgement and this was enough to limit my spirits. I will continue to run and I hope that this inspires any runner who has been traumatised in any way while running, to speak up, so that others know of their experiences and can be cautious, and keep running always. One day at a time, we must keep moving.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-scare-927822.html
16-12-2020||Second Edit||Everest height and needless ado||Adding another 86 cm to its height may not add much to the stature of the mountain which already rises far above everything terrestrial and standing. So the new revelation that Everest stands at 8,848.86 metres instead of a rounded 8848 m may only be considered a matter of academic interest. The heights of mountains, the depths of oceans and the length of rivers are the stuff of school texts and general knowledge books. But the measurement is not as old as the hills and mountains, and came in vogue only recently. Even after the first calculations were made, not only were the techniques and devices revised and refined but the mountains themselves grew and the rivers became longer, giving new numbers. These numbers count more for Everest than for other peaks because it is the point where the earth ends and the sky starts and it presents the ultimate challenge to the body and the mind.  The Survey of India had measured the mountain at 8,848 m in 1954. Much snow has melted since then, and it has seen many men and women trekking all the metres up and down, stretching themselves to the limits. No one of course measured it by their steps, but some doubts had to be set at rest. One was whether the 2015 earthquake that shook Nepal whittled down the peak too. Many thought it shuddered and shrank a little, collapsing on itself. When the earth shifts, the seas and the mountains move. But the entire Himalayas, along with Everest, was also considered to be rising by an inch or two every year because of the collision between two tectonic plates that created the mountain in the first place. That is why the masters of the mountain decided to audit the give-and-take between the quake and the collision and settle the account with a new measurement.  Half of Everest is Nepal and the other half is China. Mountains are not real estate, and are made not just of mud and rock and but of myths and minds too. The Himalayas, the frozen mind of all countries around it, rises to the heavens in the ethereal beauty and splendour of Everest. Ironically, the tallest peak of the mountain that made the conquest of mind and ego the currency of all contemplation of life itself came to symbolise the vaunting national pride of its owners. Pride and egos are not measured by satellites and GPS, but they still can rise in centimetres. It will not create any last metre timidity to the climber two steps short of the summit, and the mountain, which famously is the measuring rod of the earth, won’t mind too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/everest-height-and-needless-ado-927818.html
16-12-2020||Second Edit||Stop meddling in IIM functioning||Reports that the government is planning to arm itself with powers to interfere in the working of the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are disconcerting, as these are among the best institutions of higher education in the country and the government’s move can only harm them. The 20 premier business schools of the country enjoy a fair level of autonomy ensured by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) Act, 2017, in which the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had itself taken much interest. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had praised it as a ‘’landmark experiment’’, and it had given the Institutes ample powers to appoint directors, chairpersons and board members, to frame the curriculum and to award degrees. The law also granted autonomy in other important areas, but the government's present move goes against this, and that may turn out to the thin end of a wedge.  The government is planning to issue an executive order which will empower it to institute an enquiry against an IIM board if it thinks that the board is violating the provisions of the IIM Act. What provoked the ministry of education is the decision of the IIMs to introduce a one-year course leading to a degree for working professionals. The government, following the UGC’s norms, wants to call it only a diploma, because the UGC thinks a minimum two-year course is needed for the award of a degree. The fact remains that the IIMs are following an international practice. Business schools the world over award degrees to professionals who have working experience after conducting a one-year course. It is ridiculous that the government considers the terminology of an award given by the IIMs a matter serious enough to be taken up with them. It is worse that it becomes the ground for a standoff and triggers a move to conduct an enquiry against the IIM board.  Such an interventionist attitude from the government is unfortunate and unhelpful, and cannot aid the growth and development of academic institutions. The government has claimed in its New Education Policy (NEP) that it wants to nurture world class institutions. The IIMs are among our best institutions. Some of them find a place, though not very high, in the list of global business schools. What does autonomy mean when the government can question them even on academic matters? No institution can thrive if it is prone to political and bureaucratic meddling in its affairs even on the silliest matters. The heads of the IIMs are unhappy with the government’s move. The government should drop it as it had once stepped back from a plan to control them. The Prime Minister’s promise of freedom should be honoured in practice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/stop-meddling-in-iim-functioning-928163.html
16-12-2020||South||Kerala civic polls: BJP looks to make a mark; UDF, LDF confident||Counting of votes polled in the crucial local body elections began on Wednesday morning with the traditional political fronts -- CPI(M)-led LDF, Congress-headed UDF and BJP-NDA -- keeping their fingers crossed as its result is generally seen as pointer to the upcoming Assembly election. A total of 21,893 wards in 1,200 local self-governing bodies including 6 corporations, 941 village panchayats, 14 district panchayats and 87 municipalities, went to polls in three phases in the southern state on December 8, 10 and 14. According to ANI, early trends of the local body poll results show NDA is leading in 5 wards, LDF 21, UDF 27 and others 5, in Kochi Corporation. According to Election Commission figures, a total of 73.12 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the first phase, 76.78 per cent in the second phase and 78.64 per cent in the third and final phase. The counting began at 244 centres at 8.00 am and the final results were expected to be out by noon, Election Commission sources here said. Postal ballots, including the special ballots issued to the Covid-19 positive voters and those under quarantine, were counted first, they said adding that the entire counting procedure was held in adherence with the Covid-19 protocols. Section 144 has been in place in northern Malappuram and in some pockets of neighbouring Kozhikode and Kasaragod districts ahead of the announcement of the poll results. This time, the civic body polls have gained comparatively more significance as its result is generally considered to reflect the political mindset of the southern state which would go to assembly polls after some months. So, despite Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, the state witnessed a fierce campaign in which everything right from the national politics to state issues became a campaign tool. The ruling LDF, which used to showcase a good performance in the civic body polls, banked on the achievements in the development front under the four and half years old rule of Pinarayi Vijayan government. However, opposition UDF, during the campaign, focused on various corruption charges against the government and controversies related to the gold smuggling case and allegations cropped up against the Chief Minister's office. BJP-NDA, which was looking all means to break the decades-old bipolar polity led by UDF and LDF, was hopeful of showcasing an impressive performance and garner three-fold seats compared to the 2015 civic polls. In 2015, the ruling Left front had nearly swept the civic polls by winning 549 village panchayats, 90 block panchayats, 44 municipalities and four corporations. At the district panchayat level, both UDF and LDF had won 7 seats each. BJP had come third in terms of wards in 2015 but displayed an impressive performance in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and Palakkad municipality.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-civic-polls-bjp-looks-to-make-a-mark-udf-ldf-confident-927884.html

The India Meteorological Department has predicted both "cold day" and "cold wave" in parts of Delhi on Thursday and Friday. The visibility dropped to 100 metres in the Palam area in the morning, it said. According to the IMD, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres, 51 and 200 is “dense”, 201 and 500 “moderate”, and 501 and 1,000 “shallow”.   The minimum temperature was three notches below normal. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 19 degrees Celsius, it said, predicting 'cold day' conditions at a few places. The IMD had declared a cold wave in Delhi on Tuesday as icy winds blowing from snow-covered western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 4.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the city this season so far. The maximum temperature had also dipped to 18.5 degrees Celsius, more than four notches below normal. According to the IMD, the minimum temperatures is likely to remain around five degrees Celsius till Friday. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the Western Himalayas recorded widespread snowfall due to strong Western Disturbances and now frosty winds have been blowing towards the plains, bringing the mercury down.   He said both "cold wave" and "cold day" conditions are likely in Delhi on Thursday and Friday. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. “However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said. A “cold day” is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is 4.4 degrees Celsius below normal. The air quality was recorded in the "poor" category.  The city's air quality index (AQI) was 278 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 230 on Tuesday. It was 160 on Monday, 305 on Sunday and 356 on Saturday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dense-fog-in-parts-of-delhi-cold-wave-predicted-for-2-days-927885.html
16-12-2020||South||Left Front gets upper hand in Kerala local body polls||Nearly four hours after the counting of the Kerala local body polls began, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) has an upper hand. While the LDF is leading in four corporations, including Thiruvananthapuram, Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is leading in two including Kochi. In Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur corporations, the BJP-led NDA is putting up a tight fight against LDF and UDF respectively. Of the 86 municipalities, UDF is leading in around 40, LDF in 35, and NDA in two, including Palakkad municipality, which was the lone municipality in Kerala where BJP was in power in Kerala. Now the saffron party is emerging as the largest party in the Pandalam municipality in Pathanamthitta which could be an impact of the row over the Sabarimala issue on women's entry. LDF is leading in ten of the 14 municipalities and UDF in four. Of the 152 block panchayats, LDF is leading in 105 and UDF in 45. Of the 908 grama panchayats, LDF was leading in around 455 while UDF in around 370 and NDA in around 30. The trends show that the LDF, which is in power in Kerala, did not suffer much impact of the anti-incumbency factor despite many serious allegations prevailing against the government. While the Congress-led UDF could not take much advantage of the anti-incumbency factor, the BJP could marginally improve its position in many parts of Kerala and even opened accounts in many local bodies in North Kerala. The CPM faced a major embarrassment in Thiruvananthapuram corporation as its current major K Sreekumar was defeated. BJP's state leader B Gopalakrishnan was defeated in Thrissur corporation where the BJP is putting up a hard fight. Congress's mayor candidate in Kochi N Venugopal lost to BJP by one vote. Rajya Sabha MP Jose K Mani led faction of Kerala Congress (M) that recently parted ways with the UDF and joined the LDF received a shot in the arm as the LDF made major strides in Kerala Congress (M)'s strongholds in Kottayam and Idukki districts and was also emerging as the largest party in Pala municipality which was with UDF over many decades.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/left-front-gets-upper-hand-in-kerala-local-body-polls-927911.html

16-12-2020||South||Kerala local body polls witness further surge of Twenty-20 apolitical forum||The further surge of an apolitical forum at Ernakulam district in Kerala is one of the highlight of the Kerala local body election results. Twenty-20, a forum initiated as part of the CSR activities of Kitex Garments based at Kizhakkambalam, about 20 kilometres from Kochi city, has not only retained the Kizhakambalam panchayat, but also recorded thumping victory in all the four more panchayts it contested this time. Kizhakambalam panchayat shot to limelight in 2015 local body election as Twenty-20 won 17 of the 19 seats. This time they contested in four more nearby panchayats and recorded a sweeping victory. Twenty-20 was even  leading in all the wards in the Aikaranadu and Muzhavanoor panchayats. Vengola and Kunnathunadu are the other pachayats the forum was having majority. Sabu Jacob, managing director of Kitex Garments and chief coordinator of the Twenty-20, said that the victory in four more panchayats and retaining the existing Kizhakambalam panchayat was a recognition of the people for the work initiated by Twenty-20. Addressing the basic needs of the people by providing drinking water, housing and good roads, a host of welfare activities and opening a shop selling grocery items at very reasonable prices were the highlights of the initiatives of Twenty-20 at Kizhakambalam. The concerns of mainstream political parties over emergence of the apolitical forum was very well evident with the CPM-led Left Democratic Front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front jointly fielding candidates at some of the wards in the panchayat and even unleashing violence on the polling day. Twenty-20 candidate won in that ward also.  Now the state is eagerly awaiting if Twenty-20 would field candidates in the upcoming Assembly polls. Meanwhile, the mainstream political parties has been expressing concerns over a corporate firm having control over a pachayat.

16-12-2020||South||Kerala local body election results: Left-front fares well, BJP maintains status quo||The ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front in Kerala got an upper hand in Kerala local body elections by securing a majority in around 670 of the 1,199 local bodies that went to the polls. The BJP's hopes of securing power in Thiruvananthapuram corporation were dashed with the party unable to make remarkable inroads. Congress-led United Democratic Front suffered a major setback across Kerala. The election results are a shot in the arm for Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, as it is considered as people's mandate for his government, at a time when the Assembly polls are just five months away, with the government facing a series of allegations. While the BJP accused the UDF and LDF of striking an understanding to ensure the defeat of NDA candidates, Congress said the local body elections often favour the Left Front in Kerala due to local factors, and it cannot be seen as a mandate to the Left Front government. Of the six corporations in Kerala, LDF got a majority in five. Congress won the Kannur corporation. In 2015, LDF had majority only in two and UDF in one and two were hung. Thiruvananthapuram corporation, where the BJP secured 34 seats in 2015, up from just six in 2010, was expecting a further surge, gave the BJP just 34 seats this time as well. The LDF which lacked a clear majority by winning only 42 seats in the 100-seat corporation in 2015 has won 51 seats this time. UDF has been reduced to just ten seats, down from 21 last time. Thrissur corporation where the BJP had hopes also did not favour the party much as it could win only six seats while LDF secured a majority with 24 seats, while the UDF secured 23 seats. Even BJP state leader B Gopalakrishnan got defeated. Out of the 86 municipalities, UDF got a majority in around 45, while it was only 40 in 2015. The LDF that won in 45 municipalities last time could only secure a majority in 35 now. The BJP retained Palakkad municipality and won the Pandalam municipality in Pathanamthitta that hosts the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. With Rajya Sabha MP Jose K Mani faction-led Kerala Congress (M) parting ways with UDF and recently joining CPM, LDF could win the Pala municipality in Kottayam district, a stronghold of Jose K Mani faction, that was with UDF over the last several decades. Among the 14 district panchayats, LDF got a majority in 10 and UDF 4, while it was seven each last time. Out of 152 block panchayats, LDF won 108 against 98 in 2015 while the UDF won only 44 against 62. With regard to Grama panchayats, out of the 941, LDF secured majority in 514 against 551 in 2015 and UDF won 377 against 362. NDA won in 22 grama panchayats compared to 14 in 2015.

The directive came in the light of reports that confirmed presence of pesticide residues and organochlorine in food that caused the outbreak of the disease which left 615 people sick with symptoms of fits and convulsions recently. The Chief Minister held a further round of video-conference with experts from various national institutions that tested the food, drinking water, urine and other samples to trace out the causative factors of the mysterious disease, a release from his office said. Experts from AIIMS, New Delhi, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the National Institute of Nutrition and other research organisations confirmed the presence of pesticide residues, organochlorine, lead and nickel in blood, milk and vegetables. The institutions, however, certified that the drinking water supplied in Eluru was 'clean' and said a deeper study was required to establish how these substances entered the humans. Referring to the reports, the chief minister asked the officials to open public health labs in all districts and three state-level labs in three regions to constantly test drinking water and food samples to ensure they were contamination-free. He also wanted monitoring of the (waste) dumping yards to check the possible spread of contamination, the release said. The CM asked the AIIMS, New Delhi, and IICT, Hyderabad, to constantly monitor the situation in Eluru and conduct an in-depth analysis and suggest remedial measures. He directed Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, who heads a multi-disciplinary committee, to chalk out an action plan to prevent outbreak of such diseases elsewhere in the state. Come out with strategies and a plan of action to ensure such incidents do not recur anywhere, the Chief Minister said. He also asked the agriculture department to focus on elimination of harmful pesticides and, instead, encourage organic farming methods.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mysterious-disease-andhra-pradesh-cm-directs-regular-tests-of-food-drinking-water-in-all-districts-928076.html

16-12-2020||South||Local body polls: Pinarayi Vijayan govt hopes for a second term in Kerala||The CPM-led Left Democratic Front's (LDF) upper hand in the local body polls in Kerala despite the party facing a series of allegations could be considered a mandate for the welfare measures being initiated by the Pinarayi Vijayan Government, especially in the time of Covid-19. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the BJP-led NDA kept on attacking the LDF over gold smuggling case and the drug peddling cases, linking them to various leaders including Vijayan. However, Vijayan has been highlighting the welfare measures like providing housing to over two lakh homeless families, distribution of free ration kits during Covid-19 and social welfare pension dues. With the local body election being generally considered as semi-finals or trendsetter for the Assembly polls in Kerala that are five months away, the present trend indicates a second term for the Pinarayi Vijayan government as no anti-incumbency factors are seen in this people's mandate. Pinarayi Vijayan has emerged stronger within the CPM with this local body polls as veteran leader V S Achuthanandan, generally considered as the poster boy and crowd puller of the CPM, was absent from electioneering this time owing to his ill-health. Vijayan told reporters after the election results on Wednesday that the people have rejected false campaigns being carried out by the opposition parties with the help of central agencies against his government and voted for the development and welfare measures of the Left Front government. While Congress is the loser in the game, the BJP could barely heave a sigh of relief after maintaining the status quo. Infights and groupism among the party leaders are considered to be the adverse factors for both Congress and BJP and hence overt and covert demands for shake-ups of party leaderships could be expected in both Congress and BJP in the coming days. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala and Oommen Chandy tried to dismiss the Left Front's upper hand as an effect of local issues and personal connections. But the UDF lost even in the wards at home turfs of many Congress senior leaders. While BJP state president K Surendran alleged that UDF and LDF joined hands to ensure BJP's defeat in many seats, sources within the BJP say that party national leaders did not come to Kerala for electioneering even as they conducted major roadshows in Hyderabad civic polls. The Left Front fared well in strongholds of Jose K Mani faction in Kottayam and Idukki districts and even secured majority in Pala municipality in Kottayam district that was with the UDF for the last several decades. Having shown his strength, Jose is likely to stake a claim for Pala Assembly seat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/local-body-polls-pinarayi-vijayan-govt-hopes-for-a-second-term-in-kerala-928102.html

The teachers’ associations have extended full support to the government’s decision. The state technical committee for Covid-19 had advised the education department to trim the summer holidays and the department is planning to implement it across the state. Official sources told DH that the issue will be discussed with the chief minister at a meeting scheduled in December-end.  V M Narayana Swamy, president of state primary school teachers’ association, said, “Usually, vacations are given to kids to relax. But considering the current situation, we will support any decision taken by the government.” In the meantime, some of the teachers have expressed an opinion that rather than reducing the summer vacation, the government must consider providing at least 15 to 20 days of ‘holiday’ to teachers to relieve them from the severe stress of online education.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-govt-plans-to-trim-summer-holidays-for-schools-927785.html
16-12-2020||State||Karnataka Council sees new low as MLCs brawl over Chairman||The usually serene Karnataka Legislative Council witnessed unprecedented scenes on Tuesday, as BJP, Congress and JD(S) members brawled over a no-trust motion against the Chairman. The high drama, which produced a new low for state politics, began when Deputy Chairman S L Dharmegowda of the JD(S), backed by BJP legislators, took the chair before Chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty from the Congress arrived.   Some BJP legislators shut the door of the House to ensure that Shetty could not enter.  The BJP, with the help of the JD(S), wanted to dislodge Shetty through a no-trust motion. The motion was earlier rejected by Shetty on the grounds of it being "procedurally-flawed", but the BJP insisted on it being taken up.   Fearing Dharmegowda would allow the motion, Congress MLCs M Narayanaswamy, Naseer Ahmed, Srinivasa Mane and others dragged Dharmegowda out of the chairperson's seat. A tug of war ensued. On one side, Congress MLCs were seen pulling Dharmegowda by his arm, on the other BJP leaders were trying to hold him back in the seat. In the melee, MLCs rained blows and hurled abuses. The Council Marshalls could do nothing but watch. Once Dharmegowda was dislodged from the chair, Chandrashekhar Patil occupied it, with Congress MLCs standing guard. This angered BJP MLCs who claimed that Patil was not even part of the Council panel, and that he was unauthorised to occupy the seat. The MLCs turned their ire at a glass shield on the chairman's desk, a Covid-19 measure, uprooting it and tore agenda copies. Amid the ruckus, Shetty entered the House, even as he was pushed by BJP legislators, who tried to stop him from entering. Shetty managed to squeeze past the Council members and occupied his chair following which he immediately adjourned the session sine die.  Later, both the Congress and the BJP accused each other of "bringing shame to the House".  Speaking to mediapersons, Leader of Opposition SR Patil said, "Even as the bell was ringing, the Deputy Chairman sat in chairperson's seat. This is unauthorised and not befitting the dignity of the chair." Defending the party's move, Law Minister JC Madhuswamy said once the no-trust motion was moved, there was 14 days' time. "After that, he has to take a decision within five days. Tuesday was the fifth day. The motion had to be discussed today. The chairman cannot sit in the chair when the discussion is against him. Hence we called the deputy chairman to sit."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-council-sees-new-low-as-mlcs-brawl-over-chairman-927805.html
16-12-2020||State||Karnataka may require 1.47 lakh personnel for Covid-19 vaccination drive||Karnataka could require at least 1.47 lakh vaccination staffers to kick-start the ambitious Covid-19 immunisation programme. The state government is casting a wide net to marshal a small army of people to join the 10,008 trained vaccinators that the state already possesses.  For one, Karnataka would alone require over 29,000 doctors or personnel legally authorised to give an injection. This is because of a Covid-19 vaccine operational guideline issued by the Government of India that specifies that each vaccination site must be staffed by a five-member team. Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr K Sudhakar added, however, that six personnel per site may be required, saying they will be established along lines similar to election booths. "Each vaccination booth will have two vaccinators (ANM, Nurses, Male MPW, pharmacist etc), one assistant for maintaining data, one assistant for logistics and two to three persons (NCC, volunteers) for crowd management. Detailed SOPs are being finalised in this regard," he said. Personnel have to be found to staff the 29,451 designated vaccination sites in Karnataka. So far, however, the Department of Health and Family Welfare said it has trained only 500 additional staff.  "State immunisation staff were trained by the Government of India. We trained 500 district, taluk and medical college officers via Zoom, who in turn have to train block-level officers," said Dr Rajani Nagesh Rao, Director of Immunisation. Members of the so-called Block Task Forces made up of tahsildars, panchayat officers, rotary members and even representatives of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) have been given the critical task of training Primary Health Clinic personnel in their areas.  The real challenge will be in urban areas, explained the noted epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu. "Rural areas already have a robust system where there is one junior health assistant for every 5,000 people. They are already in the programme, vaccinating children every week, giving intramuscular injections and subcutaneous injections and so to give to adults is easier than giving to children," he said. MR vaccination template Dr Sudhakar expressed confidence that the state's universal (child) vaccination programmes had given it the requisite experience to tackle the massive programme.  "Based on the state's experience during the combined Measles-Rubella (MR) immunisation campaign in 2017 wherein 1.58 crore children were covered in two months, Karnataka is well-placed to implement the Covid-19 vaccination programme," he said. However, a health officer involved in immunisation programmes cautioned that the government is hastening matters at the cost of meticulous planning. "Even the introduction of a new vaccine for child immunisation programmes require three to four years planning," the source said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-may-require-147-lakh-personnel-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-928073.html
16-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19: Second serosurvey in Karnataka only in January||The Karnataka Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended conducting the second round of serosurvey in the state in January — either in the first or second week — after the gram panchayat polls and the New Year's celebrations.  Earlier, the government had announced that the survey would be conducted in December and another one in March.  The second wave of Covid-19 is predicted around the same time. Five to seven days is the maximum infectious period and 14 days is the maximum incubation period of the virus. Last time, the survey had projected that nearly two crore people might have been infected with Covid-19 in the state while till date only more than nine lakh cases have been reported in the official daily bulletins.  Health and family welfare department commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey told DH: "TAC has recommended to do it (second serosurvey) in January in the first or second week after gram panchayat elections and New Year's celebrations. Around 15,000 samples will be drawn from various groups. The second serosurvey will be tweaked as per the developing Covid-19 situation and TAC’s vision."  For the first survey, samples from 15,624 individuals were taken.  A TAC member said: "It is recommended to take samples from the same 290 hospitals from 30 districts and other places and people, like vegetable markets, autorickshaw drivers, transport workers, drivers and conductors, as the results have to be comparable with the first survey’s results. This is a dictum in sampling methodology. Else, how can we compare the second survey to the first?"  Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centres (VCTC) and Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) counsellors, who are a part of the National AIDS Control Organisation, have been trained to take samples for the serosurvey, the TAC member said.  "The same interviewer groups will be involved in the second serosurvey. We will discuss if an incubation period for the virus has to be factored in after New Year before deciding on the survey’s date,” he said.  A source said, “There have been many events in the past two months including upcoming Christmas. Gram panchayat elections will be a major driver for us.”  A two-phase poll to over 5,762 gram panchayats across 30 districts in Karnataka will be held on December 22 and 27. Another TAC member said they are observing an increasing number of crowds at marriages and that is a cause for concern.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-second-serosurvey-in-karnataka-only-in-january-927812.html

The court said that it would be appropriate for the government to also include that Covid patients, referred by the public health authorities to the private hospitals, are not required to pay any charges. And, such patients are also not required to pay any charges towards PPE and any consumables, the court said. “The state government will issue necessary directions at the earliest. The state government will also place on record whether any redress mechanism is available in Covid-19 hospitals for complaining about non-compliance of what is stated on June 23, 2020 order. It will be appropriate to direct the private hospitals to mention the manner in which complaints can be filed regarding violations,” the court said. The bench directed the government to place on record mechanism, if any, available to verify private hospitals’ claims for reimbursement of the amount. The court also directed the government to respond to contention in another petition about the delay in issuing test reports by the laboratories.  “This issue needs to be addressed immediately by the state government as approximately more than one lakh tests are conducted every day, except on Sundays. The state government will have to respond on this limited aspect by Monday,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/make-private-hospitals-display-covid-19-treatment-charges-hc-to-karnataka-govt-927813.html

Out of the few who have insurance, the claims of many patients are yet to be settled. According to General Insurance Council data, Karnataka’s Covid-19 patients have so far raised 57,207 insurance claims amounting to Rs 893 crore. Out of these, 44,412 claims have been settled, which amounts to Rs 414 crore. While 872 of these patients are already dead, 3,992 are under treatment, and 52,343 have been discharged. The average worth of a Covid patient’s claim in the state is Rs 1,56,087. The average worth of a settled insurance claim is Rs 93,246. The families of 7% of those who died of Covid have raised insurance claims. As on December 5, a total of 11,846 patients had died in the state. Doctor’s fees 25% of bill Sanjeev Mysore, Convener, Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership which collaborated and analysed the data from the General Insurance Council, said, “Doctor’s fees alone constitutes 25% of the bill in Karnataka.” Out of the claims received from the state, 10,174 claims are from Bengaluru alone which amounts to more than Rs 154.54 crore. Out of these, as many as 8,602 claims have been settled that amounts to Rs 80.72 crore. While 123 of these patients are already dead, 741 are under treatment and 9,310 have been discharged. The General Insurance Council is an important link between the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, the country’s apex insurance regulatory body, and the non-life insurance industry. However, Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST), under the state health department that implements Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka (AB-ArK), had different figures. It has 894 hospitals empanelled with it, providing Covid treatment. Out of these, 216 are government hospitals and 678 are private hospitals. Dr Manjunath B, director, medical management, SAST, told DH, “We have so far approved pre-authorisations of more than 1.32 lakh Covid patients.” This amounts to more than Rs 614 crore. There are 16,113 packages under AB-ArK scheme. Another SAST official said, “While we have paid more than Rs 209 crore, claims worth more than Rs 123 crore are pending and claims worth more than Rs 39 crore have been approved, but payment is in the pipeline.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/average-insurance-claim-per-covid-19-patient-in-karnataka-stands-at-rs-156-lakh-927906.html

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had scrapped the carshed project initially planned at the Aarey Milk Colony and shifted to Kanjur Marg site. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni asked the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to maintain status quo on the land till the Centre’s plea claiming title rights over the property was heard. The opposition BJP has asked Thackeray to leave ego and allow the carshed as per the original plan. The Maharashtra government may go in for an appeal in the Supreme Court. Thackeray’s son and state Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “The Bombay High Court has granted a stay to Kanjur Marg work. We await the detailed written order to decide the future course of action.  This land is crucial for Metro Line 6, 4 and 14, apart from 3, as it will save almost Rs 5,500 crores of government and be a nodal point for 1 crore citizens.” The Centre and State are locked in a battle for ownership of the land. The Salt Commissioner's office that reports to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Maharashtra government, both have been claiming the title of the 102-acre land at Kanjur Marg. “They must leave ego and ensure that the projects come up in the place it was decided,” said Leader of Opposition and ex-Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. “The Chief Minister (Thackeray) must apologise,” said senior BJP leader Dr Kirit Somaiya. It may be mentioned that the Thackeray father-son duo – even when the BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Fadnavis was in power – were opposed to the carshed project inside the Aarey Milk Colony. The Aarey Milk Colony is located in the periphery of the Sanjay Gandhi National Project. In October 2019, after the Bombay High Court dismissed all petitions against the proposed axing of over 2,500 trees in the Aarey Colony, in an overnight operation,  the Fadnavis government cut down nearly 1,500 trees leading to a string of protests in the city. The matter was taken to the Supreme Court, after which the apex court ordered that no tree would be axed. As the protests against felling of trees intensified, the police arrested over 70 protesters and imposed section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Aarey Colony and surrounding areas, restricting movements. The Shiv Sena had declared that when it comes to power they would scrap the carshed project inside the forest. The Aarey Milk Colony has a total area of 3,160 acres of land owned by the Dairy Development Department of the Maharashtra Government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bombay-hc-stays-construction-at-kanjurmarg-metro-car-shed-project-927904.html

The Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2020, to which state governor gave assent on October 8, lays down stringent punishment for land grabbers with an aim to protect the interests of small farmers and citizens, Rupani told reporters here. "Committees and special courts have been formed in each district for the purpose, and the law comes into force from today," he said. Land grabbing in any form shall be prohibited and declared unlawful and any such activity will be an offence punishable under the new Act. The government will enforce the law strictly and ensure the accused persons are punished, the CM said. As per the Act, a land grabber is a person who directly or indirectly takes illegal possession of lands and constructs unauthorised structures, or who collects or attempts to collect from any occupiers of such lands rent, compensation and other charges by criminal intimidation. Those found guilty of any of these crimes will be liable for 10 to 14 years of imprisonment and penalty equivalent to the jantri (government) rate of the land in question, says the Act. Such an offence by a company is also covered under the new law. "The Gujarat government is committed to protect the interests of small farmers and citizens who fall victim to land grabbers and are forced to fight long battles in civil courts and thereafter, enter into compromises with them against their will," Rupani said. He said as per the Act, a land grab complaint made by a victim with relevant documents will be taken up by a seven-member committee formed under collectors of respective districts once every 15 days. "The committee will ensure if the complaint is genuine or not. If it is genuine, the matter will be handed over to the police, who will lodge an FIR within a week," he said. Special courts constituted in each district under the Act will resolve the land grabbing cases within six months (from date of filing of the case before it), he said. Rupani further said the special courts may also take action against those grabbing government land, either suo motu (on its own) or on the basis of applications made by government officers authorised by the district collector. The Act provides for the constitution of special courts in every district and appointment of a public prosecutor for each court. It also makes provision for the burden of proof on the person who is alleged to have grabbed the land. Police officers not below the rank of a DySP or ACP shall carry out the investigation in the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-enforces-anti-land-grabbing-law-up-to-14-year-jail-for-violators-927916.html

Khanchandaniwas arrested on Sunday from his residence here by the police's Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU). A metropolitan magistrate court granted bail to Khanchandani on a cash surety of Rs 50,000, his lawyer Niteen Pradhan informed. The police began a probe into the alleged scam after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Agency about the rigging of TRP by some channels. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. The BARC engaged Hansa to install and maintain barometers which record TV viewership data at sample households. It was alleged that some of these families were being bribed to tune into certain channels to ramp up their TRP. In a charge sheet filed recently, the police alleged that an official of Hansa paid money to sample households to tune into Box Cinema, Fakt Marathi, Maha Movie and Republic TV. The Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing. The police have so far arrested 13 people in connection with the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/republic-tv-ceo-granted-bail-against-rs-50000-surety-927924.html
16-12-2020||West||HC's Mumbai metro car shed land order slap on govt's face: BJP||The Uddhav Thackeray government in Maharashtra has "fallen flat on its face" with the Bombay High Court staying the allotment of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area of Mumbai for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed, the BJP said on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters, BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said that the metro car shed project had been transferred to Kanjurmarg from Aarey Colony, a prominent green lung of the city, by the Shiv Sena-led government with the only motive to "settle a political score with the BJP". Another BJP leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya demanded the resignation of state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, son of CM Uddhav Thackeray, for his "insistence to shift the project to Kanjurmarg". The High Court has stayed an order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acre of salt pan land in Mumbai's Kanjurmarg area for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land. "The Bombay High Court's order has come as no surprise to us. The site is under ownership dispute, but the Thackeray government refused to pay heed to the facts and pushed the Metro-3 car shed project ahead (in Kanjurmarg) only to settle a political with the BJP. They have fallen flat on their face," the BJP leader said. The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led MVA government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The Union government had filed a petition in the high court challenging the October 1, 2020 order passed by the collector allotting the land for construction of the car shed, and said the land belongs to its (Centre's) salt department. Bhatkhalkar said the then BJP government in the state had decided to begin construction of the metro car shed in Aarey Colony after proper due diligence. "Similar discussions and orders were issued in 2015 when the BJP was leading the Maharashtra government. Our government had properly studied the project hence it decided to construct the car shed on the Aarey land," he added. Demanding resignation of Aaditya Thackeray, Somaiya said, "His insistence is going to cost the state dearly. It is the fault of Aaditya Thackeray who unnecessarily insisted on shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg". Meanwhile, in an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena said the metro car shed project on the Kanjurmarg site will move ahead "leaving behind the bullet train". The mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train is an ambitious project of the Narendra Modi government. Without naming the BJP, the Sena said the opposition party did not leave a single opportunity to stall the development of Mumbai. It said the time has come "to think seriously" about those who are trying to put roadblocks in the project work. On Tuesday, BJP leaders targeted the MVA government over shifting of the metro car shed project, contending it will escalate the project cost. "Skies will not fall on the Central government if the car shed takes shape in Kanjurmarg," the Sena said. The edit said the Thackeray government actually "saved" the Aarey forest by shifting the project to Kanjurmarg and should have been praised for the same. "Steps were taken to stop the Kanjurmarg car shed from coming into existence. Let one make any effort. The car shed will move ahead leaving behind the bullet train. The car shed will not be able to stop the political salt satyagraha," the Sena said, adding that the Kanjurmarg land is the property of the "people of Maharashtra". The Uddhav Thackeray-led party accused the Centre of trying to put a spanner in the works carried out in Maharashtra, but not in BJP-ruled states. It said the previous Devendra Fadnavis government had legally claimed that the Kanjurmarg land belonged to the state government only. "The Salt Commissioner of Delhi did not wake up from sleep then. But after a decision was taken (by the MVA government) to shift the Aarey metro car shed to Kanjurmarg, the Commissioner was made to wake up," the Sena alleged. The party also said there was no need to produce salt from the Kanjurmarg salt pan land as the state has a long coastline stretching from Mumbai to Konkan. "The state government will supply salt to the Centre if there is any shortage," the Sena said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/hcs-mumbai-metro-car-shed-land-order-slap-on-govts-face-bjp-927948.html

Goswami's counsel Aabad Ponda told the HC that the magistrate's court at Alibag in the adjoining district earlier in the day took cognizance of the chargesheet filed by the police against his client and two others in the suicide case of an interior designer. Ponda then sought time from the high court to amend the petition filed by the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief against the FIR registered by the Alibag police in the more than two-year-old case to also challenge the chargesheet. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik accepted the request and directed the magistrate's court to issue a copy of the chargesheet to Goswami at the earliest. The charge sheet has been filed before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunayna Pingale. The HC said it would hear the matter further on January 6. Goswami and the two other accused were arrested by the Alibag police on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by the companies of the trio. The 47-year-old TV journalist, who has denied charges in the case, had then filed a petition in the HC seeking to quash the FIR and had also sought interim bail. The high court had on November 9 refused to grant interim bail following which Goswami approached the Supreme Court. The apex court on November 11 granted interim bail to Goswami. The police earlier this month filed its charge sheet in the case against Goswami and the two other accused. The news anchor later filed an application in the HC seeking a direction to the magistrate to not take cognizance of the chargesheet. Since the magistrate has just taken cognizance of the charge sheet, we would like to amend the petition and bring the chargesheet on record to challenge the same, Ponda said. He called filing of the charge sheet a "hasty" move.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/suicide-abetment-bombay-hc-allows-arnab-goswami-to-challenge-charge-sheet-928035.html

This was revealed in a reply to a question filed under the Right to Information Act (RTI) by veteran activist Anil Galgali. The Maharashtra government has sought Rs 1,657.11 crore from the Centre. Mumbai and the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) could not withstand the pressure of nearly 944.2 mm rainfall in 24 hours. The high tide accompanied by rainfall following a cloudburst – created havoc in India’s commercial capital on 26 July 2005 – the memories of which are still fresh in the mind of one and all in Mumbai. The Mithi river flooded and caused extensive damage. The deluge had leftover 500 dead and lakhs homeless in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts. Through RTI applications, Galgali wanted to know the status update from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). In reply, the MMRDA administration has informed Galgali that the Mithi River has not received a single penny from the central government in the last 15 years till date. The MMRDA administration told Galgali that the amount sought from the Centre for development work done by MMRDA under Mithi River development work was Rs. 417.51 while BMC had demanded Rs. 1239.60 crore for development work coming under its jurisdiction. But, MMRDA has not received any amount so far. The then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh has assured financial assistance for the Mithi River. The Mithi River is a confluence of tail-water discharges of the Powai and Vihar lakes. The river is seasonal and rises during the monsoons. The river originates from the overflow of Vihar Lake – located inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park - and also receives the overflows from the Powai Lake about 2 km later. It flows for a total of 18 km before it meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim Creek flowing through residential and industrial complexes of Powai, Saki Naka, Kurla, Kalina, Vakola, Bandra-Kurla complex, Dharavi and Mahim. It also passes off the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-has-not-received-money-from-centre-for-improvement-of-mithi-river-928043.html

The NCP is part of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra, with the Congress being the third partner. The BJP is in the opposition. "More than 10 MLAs are unhappy in the BJP. They are sick of the system of that party. They speak to us freely several times. Hence, a decision about them can be taken in the future," Patil told reporters here. The Water Resources Minister was speaking after the induction of a former Jansurajya Party legislator into the NCP. In the recent past, Eknath Khadse and Jaisingh Gaikwad had quit the BJP and joined the NCP. During the induction event, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that the NCP should make efforts to strengthen its base in western Maharashtra, where the party enjoys influence. Speaking to reporters later, Pawar also said that the MVA has decided that if any opposition MLA resigns to join either of the ruling NCP, Shiv Sena or the Congress, the remaining two allies will support his/her candidature against the BJP. "It is natural that the BJP will field a candidate against him (the leader who resigns). But the two MVA constituents, other than the party he joins, too, will help him in the election and campaign for him...when the three (MVA) parties come together, the MLA who has resigned will face no difficulty in getting re-elected," Pawar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/over-10-mlas-unhappy-in-maharashtra-bjp-claims-ncp-chief-jayant-patil-928083.html
