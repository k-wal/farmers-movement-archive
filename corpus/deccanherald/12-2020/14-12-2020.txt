14-12-2020||First Edit||Transport strike unjustified||The flash strike by employees of state-owned transport corporations, KSRTC and BMTC, putting thousands of commuters to hardship is totally unjustified and ill-timed, however, legitimate their demands may be. Transport is an essential service and going on strike without even serving the mandatory notice is illegal. The economy is limping back to normal after the lockdown and lakhs of people who had lost their source of earning are slowly trying to put their lives together, and immobilising their movement at this critical point in time is inhuman. Innumerable people who had bought tickets in advance were stranded at various bus stands across the state due to the unannounced strike, which is a clear deficiency of service. Others had to shell out an extra sum to commute to their workplaces and back in autos and taxis. The employees should have chosen other modes of protest like dharna or hunger strike instead of disrupting the entire transport system. The two major demands of the striking staff are that they should be absorbed into government service and that those who died during Covid duty should be paid a compensation of Rs 30 lakh each. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has assured that the second demand would be met within 15 days. The first obviously cannot be granted overnight as it is a policy decision involving a cash outflow of several crores of rupees from the government, which could have serious implications on the state’s finances. The staff joined the transport bodies with their eyes open knowing fully well that they would be employees of a corporation, and demanding that they now be absorbed into government service is unwarranted. This could trigger similar demands from other corporations and if accepted the government which currently spends over 50% of its budget on paying salaries may go bankrupt, leaving no money for developmental work. Corporations should improve their organisational efficiency and ensure that they stand on their own feet instead of depending on the government’s crutches forever. The workers should also appreciate that the government released Rs 635 crore towards their pending salaries in November though the transport bodies suffered a loss of Rs 3,000 crore due to the pandemic. However, this does not mean that all is honky-dory for the employees. Their working conditions are pathetic while they face constant harassment from depot managers, among other issues. The flash strike indicates a serious deficiency of trust between the employees and the management. KSRTC and BMTC should set up a permanent mechanism to ensure that issues concerning workers are resolved immediately, without allowing the situation to reach the boiling point as it has now.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/transport-strike-unjustified-927119.html
14-12-2020||In Perspective||Disagree, dissent and disrespect||Dissent is dissed as ‘trouble’ in new India. While it is the prevalent mode of power today, what made it so effortlessly acceptable and all pervasive with society fabric? An examination of concepts of Indian culture give us the answer. Historically and culturally, India has been celebratory of authoritarian figures. The staunch patriarch (usually the male) in the home, the guru in the gurukul, the ruler in the kingdoms of erstwhile opulence. We have always been taught that the way to be ‘good’ is to submit - unquestionably, unarguably. To challenge any of these authorities was akin to disrespect - which met with accusations, ostracisation everywhere. The epitome of being ‘good’ was unchallenged loyalty that was seeped in lack of dissent. This idea of unchallenged loyalty itself has skewed structures of power deeply embedded in it. The structures of the family exemplify this. Unchallenged loyalty automatically meant to accept and accomplish what was asked. A wish that became a command by the virtue of the one who wished it.  Within the structure of the patriarchal family, the decisions of leading one’s life in a specific way (career, marriage, interest, place of residence, hobbies) were taken by the father - who remained unchallenged. Any disagreements or desires away from those of the patriarch, amounted to disrespect. Enough to warrant the severest punishment which included severing of familial ties.         If not punished, the disagreement came with guilt for the party disagreeing where fighting against oppressive authority was seemed tougher than a drastic step like suicide. Cinema, which is one of best ways to examine societal development and change, has exemplified these realities over and over again. Where assertion of individuality or desire, or even a soft vocal disagreement with the idea of the patriarch was akin to disrespect, worthy of punishment.  Or disagreement that was akin to disrespect which was expected to make the one who disagreed, guilty. Films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, Mohabbatein, 3 idiots, Munnabhai MBBS all show these realities well. The idea of the infallible parent, flawless and the need to accept their ideas unquestionably, built foundations of the idea of the family within the Indian milieu. Even today in our homes, the idea of challenging thought or an argument is equal to lack of respect. Why is disagreement the same as disrespect? Why does mere age, demand the idea of respect? Because the Indian fabric has never encouraged the idea of questioning.  The idea of tradition is so deeply rooted in preservation and following it all religiously, that spaces to question have shrunk. This is true of the home, school or religion. Democratic parenting and agency of choices are new ideas - which new age parents grapple with - given it is only the age-old ideas of parenting: fear, authority and punishments that seem to have ‘worked’.  We have always been taught to not look for flaws in authoritative figures. Whether that of the parent or the teacher, the sarpanch or the political leader, or God. Ideas of masculinity coupled with these and the overt righteousness that comes in sync with authority seals the fate of any critique. If there are no flaws in these figures, it means they can do no wrong, which means there are no mistakes, which again makes them infallible - and it is this virtue that demands respect and loyalty. And therein lies the issue.  Better living If we were taught to recognise authoritative figures as humans - who could make mistakes, and be wrong, and the ability to critique - would be seen as the virtue it actually is, to enable a better living society and a more equal existence. Religion, the idea of God’s supremacy and authority, eclipsed all ability to challenge its traditions. As a country that loves authority and prefers decisions taken for it, religion is a convenient escape where the heady cocktail of authority finds its greatest precipice.  Now add all of this to political realities of today - of which, religion is an unwavering part. Dissent is looked at as ‘trouble’ and dissenters ‘troublemakers’. Whether it is the students, farmers, free thinking citizens. We are marked as the ‘other’, and those who disrespect the ‘motherland’.  The ‘motherland’ appropriated by the Hindutva brand of toxic masculine unchallenged power, where the mother is pedestalised. The leader himself is the epitome of this masculinity and perceived infallibility - where every decision taken by him is evaluated by its ever-changing intentions and not its repercussions.  The idea of critiquing the prime minister is akin to disrespecting the state and amounting to treasonable offence, resulting in punishment by imprisonment or harassment. The image of Narendra Modi has by design been so deeply entwined with that of the state, that by capitalising on India and its relationship with authority, is reaching a demi-God status where dissent is dissed, written off as disrespect and punished in the most punitive manner possible.  Which makes it necessary to claim and keep the narrative of dissent factual, inspirational and agitational. All three that blinded authority fears. And to keep dividing ideas of cultural authority from state ones, enabling critique.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/disagree-dissent-and-disrespect-927117.html

The photo of him campaigning for the BJP-backed candidates had gone viral on social media. BJP minority unit leader Fazal Assaigoli said, "In the past Congress-supported candidates in Manjanady GP were elected unopposed. This year four BJP-supported candidates had filed their nominations, and Haneef was campaigning for them. Congress workers allegedly assaulted him over the issue." It is said that Haneef had convened a meeting of religious heads under the banner of BJP minority unit a few years ago, to create awareness about the government facilities. Enraged over the issue, Muslim leaders had suspended him from the Adkarepadpu madrasa. Later, he was working as a religious head in Puttur.

14-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Farmers affected by KSRTC strike spearheaded by their leader||The strike of the employees of the public transport system, KSRTC and other corporations, since December 11, that ended on Monday, has affected the people, especially farmers of Mysuru region, badly. Farmers said, "The effect of the strike, spearheaded by a farmer leader, Kodihalli Chandrasekhar, was bad, particularly to farmers, as most of them, especially small and marginal farmers, depend on public transport, for buying materials for their farm activities and to transport their produce." Rajesh, a farmer of Mellahalli, on the outskirts of Mysuru, said that he grows vegetables and need seeds, fertilisers and pesticides frequently. As he grow multiple vegetables, he sell his produce, usually in small amounts, twice a day. "I depend on KSRTC buses to reach my vegetables to either MG Road Market or Deveraja Market in Mysuru. Sometimes, I myself sell my vegetables on Bannur Road in Mysuru. I completely depend on KSRTC buses for my travel and to transport my produce. Due to the strike, I suffered losses,” said Rajesh. “Farmers fighting for their rights and employees fighting for their rights is not unusual. But, the services of KSRTC, BMTC, NWRTC and NERTC are crucial for the normal life of the people. We have just recovered from the lockdown. Recently, bandhs were observed against the constitution of Maratha Development Corporation and against the Amendments to farm Acts. Again, the KSRTC strike is a big blow to common people. Rich people do not feel the heat of such protests and bandhs, but middle class and poor people suffer,” said Sandesh Kumar, a businessman. C Narayana Gowda, president of Mysuru Hotel Owners' Association said, “Our travel and hospitality industry is still recovering, from the blow of lockdown, due to Covid-19 pandemic. The strike of KSRTC buses affects not only travel and tourism sector, but also common people." "People cannot even travel for medical emergencies. Since Covid set in, people have been suffering, due to various reasons. Many people find it difficult to earn for even two square meals a day. If it was just the KSRTC employees, I could understand that they are fighting for their rights. However, it is strange that even though a farmer leader is spearheading the protest, people are held for a ransom,” he said. "The basic question is, were the KSRTC employees made the staff of the corporation over night? Did not the employees know that they were joining KSRTC and not the state government, when they were recruited?” he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/farmers-affected-by-ksrtc-strike-spearheaded-by-their-leader-927396.html

The last Monday of the month of Karthika is considered auspicious. With New moon day also falling on the same day, devotees in the region visited Shiva temples in hordes. While 'Panchalinga Darshana' gained significance in Mysuru district, at Talkad of T Narasipur taluk, on Monday, all Shiva temples in Mysuru city were crowded, with people standing in long queues. Special pujas were conducted at Shiva temples in Mandya district. People had lined up at Sri Arkeshwara Swamy temple from 5 am. Hundreds of makeshift stalls were opened and the temple was decorated with special illumination. Karthikamasa special pujas, Mahajyothi and Teppotsava was conducted at Male Mahadeshwara Hill temple in Hanur, Chamarajanagar district. Amavasya jatra is popular at MM Hills and lakhs of people attend the festival every year. Hence, the district administration and MM Hill Temple Development Authority had restricted the entry of devotees from December 12 to 14. Though there were no devotees, all rituals were conducted as per traditions, said temple sources. Former prime minister and JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda, along with his wife Channamma, grandson Nikhil Kumaraswamy and his wife Revathi, visited the Shiva temple at his native Haradanahalli, Halekote hobli, Holenarasipur taluk in Hassan district, and offered Karthika masa puja on Sunday.

Speaking to reporters, during a visit to KSRTC bus stand in the city, the minister interacted with the passengers and assured them of resolving the issue soon. Expressing displeasure over the employees of KSRTC, the minister said, "Despite Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi's assurance to fulfil their demands, the employees continued the protest. "The employees were misled by Chandrashekar. The public were affected badly due to the protest," he said. Defending the state government, Somashekar said, "Despite hardships during lockdown, due to Covid-19, KSRTC and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) treated their employees in a good manner and their salaries were paid on time. The government is ready to fulfil the demands, but needs some time." Somashekar advised Kodihalli Chandrashekar to lead farmers protest, rather than playing politics with KSRTC employees. “Chandrashekhar is playing a drama and people are well aware of it. He should have appreciated the CM for fulfilling nine demands. The employees should have understood the conspiracy of Chandrashekar, instead of following him," he said. With a few KSRTC buses starting service, the city police deputed additional men at the KSRTC bus stands, to ensure safety of the buses as well as passengers. The Police Commissioner Chandragupta, who inspected security arrangements at the bus stand in the city said that the people can rely on public transport, without any fear. The police have taken measures to check any untoward incident, he said. The commissioner said, "The passengers need not worry about their safety and warned of stringent action against trouble mongers." Chandragupta warned taxi, autorickshaw drivers and private bus operators not to collect exorbitant charges from passengers. He said, "There were complaints against private taxi, bus and autorickshaw operators of misusing the situation. The police have deputed men at taxi, autorickshaw and private bus stands to ensure that no one will fleece the passengers."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ksrtc-strike-somashekar-blames-kodihalli-chandrashekar-advises-him-to-lead-farmers-protest-927400.html

14-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Transport stir: Karnataka ministers lash out at farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar||Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol on Monday rebuked farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, who has become the face of the transport workers’ strike, for “poking his nose” in issues that do not concern him. Karjol joined a growing list of BJP leaders who have hit out at Chandrashekhar, who has been ‘co-opted’ by transport workers in their stir against the government that has paralyzed public transport services across the state. “Crores of money was lost, the transport workers lost and the public was put to trouble for the past four days all because of Kodihalli Chandrashekhar’s prestige and vested interest,” Karjol said. “Any leader, before taking decisions, should consider the pros and cons. He should remain a farmer leader instead of poking his nose anywhere else,” he added. Chandrashekhar, who is associated with the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Green Brigade, has been leading the transport workers’ strike. Primarily seen as a farmer leader, Chandrashekhar unsuccessfully contested two elections - the Hassan Lok Sabha seat in 2009 and the Hassan assembly constituency in 2013. The government, on Sunday, agreed to nine out of 10 demands, which include health insurance, Rs 30 lakh compensation for death due to Covid-19, inter-corporation transfers and so on. By Monday afternoon, 10% of state-run buses became operational and the government expects normalcy by the end of the day. Late on Sunday night, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, Revenue Minister R Ashoka, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommia and others took turns to attack Chandrashekhar following a meeting where it was said that truce had been brokered, but it was not so. “The (transport) workers are stuck in the hands of a man who has no understanding of their issues. Normally, a strike is withdrawn when 50% of the demands are met. We have agreed to nine out of 10 demands! Nobody with humanity would do this, but Chandrashekhar. So, God bless him,” Ashoka said. Health Minister K Sudhakar, in a tweet, questioned Chandrashekhar’s credentials and asked if he was aware of the transport sector and its workers’ problems. BJP national general secretary CT Ravi hinted that Chandrashekhar was a political decoy. “The dream of some leaders who are using Kodi ‘huli’ (sour in Kannada) to return to power will remain just a dream,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/transport-stir-karnataka-ministers-lash-out-at-farmer-leader-kodihalli-chandrashekhar-927258.html
14-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||No-trust motion: Action-packed Karnataka council session likely on Dec 15||The Legislative Council session on Tuesday is likely to be stormy as the BJP is expected to push the no-confidence motion against chairperson K Pratapachandra Shetty, which is not listed in the agenda. The official agenda, however, includes the contentious anti-cow slaughter Bill, Question Hour, the government's reply on the discussion on the flood situation and 'calling attention' notices. Last week, eleven BJP MLCs moved a no-confidence motion against Shetty. The Council session was adjourned sine die on December 10. The upper house will meet again Tuesday after the state government mounted pressure on Shetty, saying the adjournment was 'abrupt'. The Council secretariat has, in a response to the BJP on the motion, stated that it was not as per the procedure. "The Council chairperson has sought legal opinion in this matter and has found that the motion does not conform to the norms..." it said. The Council secretary's response quotes 'Parliament Procedure' authored by Subhash Kashyap, where it is stated that any resolution for removal of the speaker should be specific with respect to charges. Addressing media persons here on Monday, Leader of Opposition in the Upper House SR Patil said there was no scope to take up the no-confidence motion. "The session was adjourned on Thursday as many legislators expressed that they had to prepare for the upcoming gram panchayat elections. As many as 25 MLCs are elected from local bodies and they are busy with the elections," Patil said. The Congress MLCs also claimed that they had support of the JD(S) legislators. "When the chairperson was elected during the coalition government in 2018, the Congress had a strength of 37 and the JD(S) 16. Even though the coalition crumbled, the two parties have cooperated with each other in the Council," he said. Meanwhile, BJP's floor leader Kota Srinivasa Poojary told DH that the Chairperson was obliged to take up the no-confidence motion for discussion when more than 10 people had signed it. "He cannot reject it and send a response. He has to take it up in the House," Poojary said, adding that as far as the ruling party was concerned, no-confidence motion was part of the session's agenda Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/no-trust-motion-action-packed-karnataka-council-session-likely-on-dec-15-927365.html

14-12-2020||Main Article||Dams Across Brahmaputra: China’s watery threat to India||The news that China is considering a proposal  to build a major hydro-electric dam over the Brahmaputra river (locally called Yarlung Tsangpo) in the Medog county of Tibet is a vital strategic move by Beijing in so far as its India policy is concerned. The proposed dam will be located about 30 km away from the Sino-Indian border at Arunachal Pradesh and very near the Great Bend of the Brahmaputra.  It is here that the mighty river, after originating from the Angsi Glaciar near Mount Kailash and traversing nearly 1,790 km in southern Tibet, enters India near Mount Namcha Barwa after a great U-turn. This is called the Great Bend of the river. Here, it experiences nearly a 2000-metre fall through the deepest canyon in the world. Geographically, the dam, proposed to be twice as big as the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze river, will be something new and strategically it will be an important step forward in China’s continued efforts towards controlling the water resources of Tibet. China’s India policy is now being guided by two dominant considerations - safety and security of the road connecting Tibet with Xinjiang through Aksai Chin and keeping India under constant pressure in areas south of the McMahon Line by a spectre, real or unreal, of blockade of Brahmaputra water. How many dams has China really built in Tibet on the Brahmaputra? There is a veil of secrecy. We know it for certain that Beijing has already commissioned a big hydropower dam at a place called Zangmu in the middle reaches of the Brahmaputra and three more are coming up at Dagu, Jiexu and Jiacha.   But Brahmaputra is a river system with many tributaries and perhaps some more dams are being built at different locations. Some recent media reports have quoted the number of such dams to be 11. However, some years ago, Jana Jagriti, an Assam-based NGO, pointed out that 35 dams are coming up on the Brahmaputra in Tibet - eight on the mainstream of the river and 27 more on the tributaries. There are reasons for panic. China went ahead with conceptualisation and execution of the Zangmu dam since the second half of the first decade of this century. Beijing admitted it in 2010 after persistent queries from not just India but several other countries. Then a disaster happened on March 1,2012 when the river Siang (this is how the Brahmaputra is known in Arunachal Pradesh) had  gone completely dry at a place called Pasighat where it used to be really voluble and wide. Although the river picked up momentum later on, yet it has not attained its former virility. What may be the fallout of China’s design to construct dams on the Tibetan rivers, particularly the Brahmaputra? As a lower riparian country, India is hamstrung by the absence of any water-sharing treaty with China. Beijing is yet to open up its mouth in regard to the nature of the giant Medog hydro-electric project. But so far as the other dams on the Brahmaputra are concerned, its constant refrain is that these projects are run-of-the-river types and hence would in no way result in blockade of downstream waters. But an alarming portent lies elsewhere. After the Galwan incident in Ladakh, where both India and China lost some of their soldiers, Beijing has stopped sharing of river water data with India and New Delhi is not in the know of hydrological changes of the Brahmaputra in Tibet, if there is any. Worry remains But even if the hydro power projects are run-of-the-river, causes of worry remain for India as all the dams will be required to store huge amount of water and thus may deprive the north-eastern India of the nutrient rich silt of the Brahmaputra that makes the Assam plains so fertile. As all the dams mentioned above will be situated in close proximity to each other, free flow of the Brahmaputra water is sure to be disturbed.  As a result, Assam may get 64% less water during the monsoon season and 85% less water in the rest of the year. Moreover, these dams would give China another leverage. It can release less water during summer, if it wishes. Similarly, during the monsoon it can arbitrarily open up the gates of the dams thus inundating large parts of north-eastern India. To call a spade a spade, Indian political leadership has been found to be unequal to fathom the massive danger that may lie ahead. Not only the proposed hydro power station near the Great Bend of the river but all the other dams on the Brahmaputra in Tibet are situated in areas near the geological faultlines where the Indian Plate collides with the Eurasian Plate. Therefore, these giant plants and their dams will have to live under constant threats of earthquakes. In such an event, large parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh will go under water. Beijing has said that it will take into account the interests of the upstream and downstream countries while formulating the plans for the proposed power plant. However, both China and India should keep in mind the interests of the Brahmaputra river as well and prevent a rat race for control of the river water as India is also considering a proposal for construction of a 10 gigawatt hydropower plant in Arunachal Pradesh.  Moreover, there are earlier proposals for the construction of more such projects on the rivers Lohit and Subansiri, two tributaries of the mighty river. They will entail construction of big dams and displacement of large numbers of people. According to an Indian official, India is apprehending discharge of huge volumes of water from the Chinese dams in Tibet during monsoon. But there is a third country – Bangladesh - whose fate is locked with the Brahmaputra. For the sake of ecology and humanity, Brahmaputra should have a free flow. It is hoped that good sense will prevail in Beijing and New Delhi.

Nearly 45% people surveyed near markets say police do not take action against unauthorised stalls in markets. This is what a study of infrastructure and survey of 79 "top-three" police stations in states and union territories -- 'Ranking of Police Stations 2020' -- across the country have revealed. These police stations were chosen -- one each from Union territories barring Delhi, two each from states and Delhi with less than 750 police stations and three from states with more than 750 police stations -- for the Ranking of Best Police Stations, an annual affair of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). While policy makers describe the beat system as the backbone of the policing system, the survey conducted by a Ministry of Home Affairs-mandated team near chosen police stations, nearby markets and nearby residential areas showed that 50% of the beat constables did not interact with the public. The survey of around 4,056 people -- around 50-60 people near every police station -- also brought to light that 45% of the respondents in markets near police stations felt that no action is being taken by policemen against unauthorised stalls in markets. Of the 79 police stations, Nongpok Sekmaiin Manipur's Thoubal district, AWPS-Suramangalam in Tamil Nadu's Salem and Kharsang in Arunachal Pradesh's Changlang district were chosen as top-three police stations in the country. Market Police station in Bidar pipped Women police station in Davanagere and Yeragera in Raichur district to become the topper among police stations in Karnataka though none of them could manage to find a space in the top-10 list. Though several police forces tom-tom the facility of online filing of complaints, 60% believe that no action is taken on online complaints while the same proportion of people express concern about non-availability of an online platform for FIR registration. Getting a copy of FIRs continues to be a troublesome affair in these "best police stations" too as only 42% who were coming out of police stations were having a copy of the FIRs with them. Another 53% said they did not receive any confirmation via text messages or telephone. On the brighter side, the survey finds that most police stations had women police personnel available for women complainants while police staff were "polite, respectful and attentive" to all complainants. When it comes to infrastructure, many police stations with comparatively older infrastructure maintained assets and high levels of cleanliness compared to some police stations with new buildings, which "failed to maintain cleanliness at the same level". More than 10 out of 79 police stations with older infrastructure performed extremely well on performance measures, which made them stand out in overall ranking. A concerned area highlighted by the report was fire safety -- it was least attended in police stations with 86% of them not having fire alarms. Nearly one in every three police stations had some basic fire safety equipment like sand and water buckets and hose pipes among others. Accessibility for the disabled was another issue with the report saying that ramp facility was not available in several police stations. However, when it came to toilets, all police stations had it. Compounds of 63% police stations were found to be clean and well-kept while only 17% had parking facilities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/half-of-beat-constables-do-not-interact-with-public-60-believe-no-action-taken-on-online-complaints-says-survey-927134.html

To give in to demands and scrap the laws would be an uncharacteristic admission of defeat for India’s strongman prime minister, who promised they would transform agriculture. But letting the unrest linger could cause chaos in food markets, alienate urban consumers, and potentially derail the post-Covid recovery. Meanwhile, MNM chief Kamal Haasan on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi spell out the rationale behind constructing a new Parliament building for about Rs 1,000 crore "when half of India is hungry due to coronavirus pandemic triggered loss of livelihoods". Seeking to liken the proposed construction of the new edifice to the centuries old Great Wall of China, he claimed that 'thousands of people perished' during its construction, but the dragon nation rulers said the wall was to 'guard' the people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-men-at-work-in-new-parliament-outside-and-inside-927152.html

He said that the government is looking to make India a hub of other electronic products as well with the expansion of the PLI scheme to other sectors. "We wanted India to become the second-largest mobile manufacturer in the world. Now I am pushing India to surpass China. That's my goal and I am very clearly defining it," Prasad said at the annual general meeting of industry chamber FICCI. India became the second largest mobile manufacturing country in 2017. The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE) envisages electronic manufacturing turnover of more than Rs 26 lakh crore by 2025, out of which Rs 13 lakh crore is expected to come from the mobile phone segment. PLI is designed to propel India's stature and ease of doing business under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to showcase India as an alternate manufacturing destination, Prasad said. "PLI is designed to enable global champion companies to come to India and make Indian companies national champion," he noted. The government has started a PLI scheme under which eligible companies can get sops of around Rs 48,000 crore. The government has cleared 16 proposals from domestic and international companies entailing an investment of Rs 11,000 crore under the PLI scheme to manufacture mobile phones worth Rs 10.5 lakh crore over the next five years. The companies include iPhone maker Apple's contract manufacturers Foxconn Hon Hai, Wistron and Pegatron, apart from Samsung and Rising Star. Domestic companies whose proposals have been approved include Lava, Bhagwati (Micromax), Padget Electronics (Dixon Technologies), UTL Neolyncs and Optiemus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-aims-to-surpass-china-in-mobile-manufacturing-ravi-shankar-prasad-927190.html

Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said that Ugrahan leaders will not observe fast. "We will not participate (in one-day hunger strike)," Sukhdev told PTI. Farmer unions, most of them from Punjab, have started their hunger strike against the Centre's new farm laws. Also, they have given a call to stage dharnas at district headquarters across the country. Photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these "anti-social elements" are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers.  "We did nothing wrong. We had just organised an event demanding their (jailed activists) release on Human Rights Day on Thursday," Sukhdev Singh said. The government on Friday asked protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some "anti-social" as well as "Leftist and Maoist" elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation even as the protesters stuck to their demands.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bhartiya-kisan-union-distances-itself-from-hunger-strike-927209.html

In a message showcased during Ficci's 93rd Annual General Meeting, Premji said the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked staggering human misery and tragedy and has been a sharp reminder that the economy is a part of society and that human well-being matters - in all its dimensions equally. "The pandemic has also been a magnifying glass for all our structural inequities and injustices, which exclude hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens from a life of basic dignity. It has made clear that while markets and businesses have an irreplaceable role in a society, even more fundamental are the public goods and public systems," he added. Premji noted that the agenda for the nation must include food, shelter, safety and basic social security; equitable and high-quality public education and public health systems; care for the planet and all life on it; elimination of any kind of prejudice and discrimination; and jobs and livelihoods that are just and fair. "If all of us come together - governments, industry, civil society, politicians, the average citizen, and more - I am sure that this agenda can be fulfilled in large measure. And then we can truly hope to have a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society," Premji added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pandemic-a-magnifying-glass-for-structural-inequities-injustices-azim-premji-927213.html

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde on Monday granted opportunity to the journalists' body to file its response to the additional affidavit of the Uttar Pradesh government in the case and fixed the plea for hearing next year. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, did not agree to the submission of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the KUWJ, that the case be listed in the first week of January instead of third on reopening of courts after the winter break. "First two weeks (in January) are miscellaneous (weeks when fresh matters will be heard)," the bench said in a hearing conducted through video conferencing. Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government had told the bench that “shocking findings” have emerged in the investigation so far in the case in which Kappan was arrested on his way to Hathras. Kappan claimed that he is working as a journalist in a Kerala-based daily but that newspaper was closed two years back and investigation conducted so far has found some shocking findings, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the bench. KUWJ, which has been questioning Kappan's arrest, had refused to approach the Allahabad High Court as suggested by the apex court for seeking bail and other reliefs. We would like to argue the matter in the apex court itself and implead Kappan's wife and others in the plea, Sibal had said. “The high court has granted one month's time on the habeas corpus plea of other accused in the same case and I want to argue here,” Sibal had said, adding, “Hear me finally”. The Uttar Pradesh government recently filed an affidavit in the apex court claiming that Kappan was going to Hathras under the “garb of journalism” with a “very determined design” to create caste divide and disturb law and order situation.   The state has alleged in its affidavit that Kappan is the office secretary of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and was using a “journalist cover” by showing identity card of a Kerela-based newspaper which was closed in 2018. In its counter affidavit filed in the matter, KUWJ has urged the apex court that an independent inquiry be conducted by a retired top court judge to determine the facts of the alleged “illegal arrest and detention” of Kappan. The KUWJ has claimed that Uttar Pradesh Police has made an “absolute false and incorrect statement” that Kappan is the office secretary of PFI as he is working as a journalist only.   In its rejoinder affidavit, KUWJ has alleged that the state filed a “misleading affidavit, misrepresenting the facts in order to justify their illegal and unlawful detention and malicious prosecution” of Kappan and there are no materials to support the allegations against him. It has said Kappan had attempted to visit Hathras on October 5 in discharge of his journalistic duties and he had intimated his employer prior to his trip. Kappan was arrested on October 5 while he was on his way to Hathras, home to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died after being allegedly gang-raped by four upper-caste men. The police had said it has arrested four people having alleged links with the PFI in Mathura and identified the arrested persons as Siddique from Malappuram, Atiq-ur Rehman from Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur. The FIR has been filed under various provisions of the IPC and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against four people having alleged links with PFI. The PFI had been accused in the past of funding protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country earlier this year.   Hathras was in the news following the death of Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped on September 14, 2020, in a village in the district. Her cremation at night by the authorities, allegedly without the parents' consent, had triggered widespread outrage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-hear-in-january-plea-of-kerala-journalists-body-against-arrest-of-scribe-on-way-to-hathras-927231.html

In an address at the annual general meeting of industry chamber FICCI, Singh also said the recent reforms in the sector have been undertaken with the best interests of farmers in mind and that the government is always "open to discussion and dialogue". "There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever. The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India's farmers in mind," he said "We are, however, always willing to listen to our farmer brothers, alley their misgivings and provide them with assurances we can provide. Our Government is always open to discussion and dialogue," Singh said. The defence minister said agriculture has been one sector which has been able to avoid the adverse effects of the pandemic and, in fact, come out the best. "Our produce and procurement have been plentiful and our warehouses are full," he said. Thousands of farmers have been protesting for more than two weeks on the borders of Delhi, demanding withdrawal of three new farm laws. Talking about the impact of coronavirus pandemic and strength of the country's economy, the defence minister said India received the highest ever total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) USD 35.73 billion in the first five months of the current fiscal which is 13 per cent higher compared to same period last fiscal. "It is the strength of our economy...that India, in April-August 2020, received the highest ever total FDI.

The incident came to light after Mohanraj’s father-in-law came to his daughter’s house. “Prima facie, it appears there is no foul play. It looks like the couple killed the children first and died by suicide. We are investigating the case from all angles,” a police officer told Deccan Herald. He added that financial issues seem to be the reason behind the incident. Mohanraj, who had availed loan for constructing a new building in his village, was under pressure to pay back the money as his earnings were affected severely during the Covid-19 situation. “The initial investigation has revealed that financial reason is behind the extreme step that the couple took. Mohanraj did avail a loan to improve his business but he was not able to pay it back on time,” the officer added. The bodies have been sent to Government Villupuram Medical College Hospital in Mundiyampakkam for autopsy. Villupuram MP D Ravikumar claimed the carpenter was threatened by the lenders to repay the loan due to which he might have taken the extreme step. “The incident took place after the loaners threatened the carpenter by sending people to his house. The police should take strict measures against the company for such activities. Providing loans at huge interest is a punishable crime and justice should be done to the deceased,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/financial-woes-lead-tn-couple-to-kill-their-3-children-themselves-927246.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the Centre to inform it by February 5, 2021, the status with regard to publication of the regulations. "Take a decision. Tell us how much time it will take," the bench said after the counsel for the central government told the court that the regulations have been sent for publication. The court was hearing the plea by advocate and mental health activist Gaurav Kumar Bansal who has said that a similar plea filed by him earlier was disposed of by the high court by directing the Centre to treat it as a representation and take a decision on it as expeditiously as possible and practicable. However, till date the central government has not notified the minimum standards, he has said in the petition. His petition has contended that under the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 the minimum standards were to be notified within 18 months of commencement of the statute. The high court on October 12 had directed the Centre to treat Bansal's earlier similar plea as a representation and to decide it in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case as expeditiously as possible and practicable. The direction had come after the central government said the draft minimum standards are ready and would be published/notified as soon as they are finalised. In his latest plea, Bansal has said there are many establishments in the country which claim they can cure or treat mentally ill people through Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy. "However, these establishments never register themselves with the Central Mental Health Authority or State Mental Health Authority as required under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. "Since till date respondent 2 (Delhi government) has neither issued any notification prescribing minimum standards for such establishments nor has clarified whether such establishments shall be treated as mental health establishments, persons with mental illness are finding it difficult to approach such entities," the petition has claimed. He has also said in his petition that under the Act, every person has the right to make an 'advance directive' which specifies how he/she, suffering from any mental illness, wishes to be cared for and treated or not treated. However, the regulations for specifying the manner of making the 'advance directive' have also not been notified, the plea has claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-in-hc-seeks-minimum-standards-at-mental-health-establishments-927247.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian sought a response from the Centre and states of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana on the petition filed by activist and advocate Sudiep Shrivastava. The petition, argued by advocate Prashant Bhushan, also sought framing of guidelines for dealing with forest clearance proposals for coal mining in dense forest areas. He said such clearance could be considered unless all the other available deposits of the said mineral were exhausted. It asked the court to quash auction of 14 coal blocks situated in dense forest and were classified as no-go by a joint study of Ministry of Environment and Forest and Ministry of Coal. The petition gave detailed examples of study of coal blocks and management plan of Saranda iron ore zone in Jharkhand to demonstrate that despite there being sufficient information and reports available which classified less forested or non-eco-sensitive areas as probable mining areas, the Union government was allowing mining in every area where mineral deposits existed. "As a result, areas where environmental damage would be least due to mining are not being considered and 100% dense forest which are catchment of important rivers are subject to made available for mining," the petition claimed. He sought a direction to the Union government to classify each mineral deposit in terms of their environmental forest value and allow mining only in those mineral deposits where the damage would be least to environment. This is obligatory in terms of Forest Conservation Rule 7(2Xc) and Section 18 (1) of the MMDR Act 1957, his plea said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-states-on-plea-against-mining-in-dense-forests-eco-sensitive-areas-927251.html

In comparison, Covishield, tested and made by Serum Institute of India and developed by Oxford-Astrazeneca is priced at just $3 per dose. Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine is the first one to be given emergency use authorisation by the UK, US, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Israel. Russian Covid-19 vaccine candidate Sputnik V is comparatively inexpensive too at under $10 per dose. Indigenous vaccines made by Bharat Biotech dubbed COVAXIN and Zydus Cadila's ZyCov-D are expected to be priced at in the $3-$6 per dose range. Moreover, Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine would require to be stored and transported at a very low temperature of about -70 degree centigrade and the cost of cold-storage technology for this would be exorbitant too only adding to the price of vaccinating the country. According to analysts at Bernstein, India may buy about 680 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, which means it would spend about $1.9 billion if the vaccine was priced at $3 per dose. Pfizer's vaccine at $37 per dose, would up the price by 12 times to a whopping $22.8 billion. “There has been a lot of deliberation on whether the Pfizer shots would be accommodative for Indian population, given its high pricing and the public health infrastructure.

A bench presided over by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, however, said the court was disinclined to consider the contention that the wrongs of history must be set right. "We would be disinclined to open all such aspects as there may have been wrongs done to persons but with the passage of almost 45 years, it would not be appropriate to re-open those issues," the bench said. The court said it would decide if simpliciter declaration can be made that the proclamation of emergency was unconstitutional. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for 94-year-old Veera Sarin, contended it was important to look into the matter as it involved issues of far-reaching importance and there was an abuse of power for 19 months. "We are finding it difficult to go into this. The emergency was an abuse and something happened which ought not to have happened," the bench said initially. Salve, for his part, said war-crime issues are considered and 90-year olds are hauled up  even today. At nascent stage of our democracy, rights were suspended for 19 months. "If history is not corrected, it repeats itself," he said. The bench expressed its doubts, saying, "We can't keep digging on these issues, persona's are gone today. What will this take us to?" Salve insisted, "This is a matter of constitutional debate and principles must be laid down on fraud upon the Constitution, that no matter how high you are, you will be held accountable." "I feel very strongly on this issue. We were students at the time of proclamation of emergency in 1975. This is too important a matter. Our generation is still around," he said. The court then issued issued notice to the Centre and asked the petitioner to restructure her petition by December 18. The petitioner claimed she was aggrieved by the trauma and harassment faced by herself and her family including her deceased husband during the period of emergency, declared on June 25, 1975. The petitioner submitted that she and her husband were compelled to leave the country for fear of being thrown into the jail on the whims and wishes of the government authority. The woman, who now lives with her daughter in Dehradun, alleged her husband’s gold art business in Karol Bagh and Connaught Place, here was ceased by then authorities, besides the family was threatened and their properties and valuables were forcefully taken away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-to-declare-the-1975-emergency-as-unconstitutional-927256.html

The retired diplomats wrote an “open letter” criticising Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other ministers of his cabinet for expressing concern over the protest by the farmers in India. They particularly slammed Trudeau’s comment as “uncalled for, disconnected with ground realities and served merely to fan the flames”. The signatories of the open letter included Vishnu Prakash, who served as New Delhi’s envoy to Ottawa from 2015 to 2016, Anil Trigunayat, Ashok Sajjanhar, Bhaswati Mukherjee, Mohan Kumar, Veena Sikri and Amarendra Khtua. They pointed out that India-Canada bilateral relations often come under stress due to the propensity of certain political parties and leaders of the North American nation “engage in vote bank politics”. “It is well known that the separatist and violent Khalistani elements carry out anti-India activities, from the safety of the Canadian soil. They are also radicalising the Canadian youth with far-reaching consequences, which is being ignored at the altar of short-term political expediency.” They noted that the Khalistani elements controlled a number of prominent Gurudwaras in Canada and thus got access to substantial funds, some of which were allegedly diverted to the electoral campaign of political parties especially the Liberals (Trudeau’s Liberal Party). “They (Khalistanis in Canada)) regularly hold demonstrations, rallies and other events, where anti-India slogans are raised and terrorists eulogised. Few Canadian politicians have qualms about attending such events, which provide the oxygen of publicity to the separatists,” alleged the retired diplomats. “Back home, encouraged by the Canadian support, the protestors have hardened their stance, adopting an all or nothing approach,” the IFS officers wrote in the open letter, adding: “Such blatant interference in India's internal affairs to appease a section of the Liberal Party's voter base is completely unacceptable and cannot but cast a long shadow on bilateral relations”. Trudeau recently expressed concerns over protests by thousands of farmers in India, subtly nudging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in New Delhi to resolve the issue through dialogue. New Delhi immediately reacted to the statement by the Prime Minister of Canada, calling it “unwarranted”. Ottawa’s envoy to New Delhi, Nadir Patel, was on December 4 last summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), where senior officials served him a démarche, conveying that the comments made by Prime Minister and other ministers of the Canadian Government on the protest by farmers “constitute an unacceptable interference in internal affairs” of India. Not only Trudeau, but Sikh ministers in the Canadian Government – Defence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan, Minister for Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Singh Bains and Minister for Diversity and Inclusion Bardish Chagger – also tweeted comments on police action against the farmers agitating against the new agricultural laws introduced by the Modi Government in India. They all expressed concern and stressed importance of allowing protests in democracies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ex-diplomats-slam-canada-say-encouraged-by-its-support-protesting-farmers-hardened-stance-927265.html

Also, this remains a repository for further analysis and research which will complement the available surveillance information," Niti Aayog said according to a report titled 'Vision 2035: Public Health Surveillance in India: A White Paper'. It is being jointly prepared by Niti Aayog and University of Manitoba,Canada. "Going forward, India's public health surveillance will be based on individual Electronic Health Records (EHR) that capture and amalgamate individuals' health-care related information through the use of a unique health identifier (UHID)," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/niti-aayog-proposes-setting-up-surveillance-information-platform-to-strengthen-indias-public-healthcare-system-927266.html

The BJP leader also urged the farmers, who are protesting at various Delhi borders since November 26, to return to the discussion table and find an amicable solution to the deadlock. "The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is part of the government's mechanism (to safeguard farmers from fall in Agri produce prices) and it will remain in force in future too," Rupala told reporters at the Gujarat BJP headquarters here. "In fact, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had first decided to introduce this MSP formula of agricultural cost plus 50 per cent profit as recommended by Dr Swaminathan," he said. Neither there is a need to bring a separate law for the MSP nor the provision is required to be included in the existing Acts, the minister said. "The MSP is being implemented by both the Centre and states, and there is no need to bring MSP under the purview of law," Rupala said when asked to comment on the demand for it from the protesting farmers. He asked the opposition Congress why it did not make a law for MSP when the party was in power before 2014. "The recently introduced laws do not affect the MSP at all. These three laws were introduced for the benefit of farmers, not the government," he said. "Majority of farmers have welcomed these laws. I urge the agitating farmers to end the stalemate by holding discussion with the government to find an amicable solution," he said. The minister said that the three farm laws were enacted "on the request of farmers and their organisations" and most of them are happy with it. "PM Modiji has taken many steps to double farmers' income. As part of that endeavour, the Centre had deposited Rs 95,000 crores into farmers' bank accounts," he said. There is no need for farmers to be sceptical about the PM's intentions, he said. "Let the laws get implemented first. The government will take steps if something does not suit you afterwards. But, opposing the laws upfront is improper," he said. On one of the laws about contract farming, Rupala accused the Congress of "taking a lead in spreading false propaganda" that farmers would lose their land to big corporates due to provisions of the law. This law is about the price and quality of the farm produce and about the tenure. There is no mention of land in the entire law, he said. "Yet, some people, led by the Congress, are trying to spread false propaganda that farmers will lose their land," Rupala said. He said the law about the APMC (agriculture produce market committees) only gives options to farmers and it does not eliminate the present system of mandis. Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-need-for-law-on-msp-most-farmers-support-new-laws-rupala-927270.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan made the observation while hearing a plea moved by the Board challenging a single judge order, which said the CBSE's reassessment scheme for students whose board exams got canceled due to Covid-19 would apply to improvement candidates also. "We don't like this anti-student attitude of the CBSE. You are dragging students all the way to the Supreme Court. Should they be studying or going to court? We should start imposing costs on the CBSE.  "They are treating students as enemies," the bench added. The bench further said that if the scheme applies to all improvement students, "what is the harm in it?" The single-judge had held on August 14 that the scheme approved by the Supreme Court for assessing students due to cancellation of the CBSE exams in light of Covid-19 will also apply to students, who appeared for improvement examinations as they are equal victims of the pandemic. "There is no earthshaking emergency for you to come to court now all guns blazing," the bench said, adding that the CBSE should have gone to the apex court for a clarification, instead of dragging students to court.   The single judge had said that like regular students, those who appeared for improvement exams would also be entitled to avail the scores as per the assessment scheme or appear for the optional examination whenever it is held by the CBSE. The August 14 order had come on a plea by a student who appeared in the CBSE class 12 exams held in February-March last year and secured 95.25 per cent. Thereafter, to improve his score, he dropped one year and decided to reappear in Accountancy, English Core, Economics and Business Studies for an improvement examination this year. While other exams were held as per schedule, the Business Studies exam, which was slated for March 24, was cancelled due to the lockdown announced on account of COVID-29. The student, Sanyam Gupta, sought that his result for the improvement examinations ought to be declared and in respect of the cancelled paper of Business Studies, he should be treated at par with the regular students for whom an assessment scheme was approved by the apex court. The high court directed the CBSE to issue a corrected marksheet to the student. After implementing the August 14 order and issuing a corrected marksheet to Gupta who, thereafter, got admitted in a Delhi University college on the basis of the same, the CBSE has now challenged the single judge's decision. Taking note of the facts and circumstances, the bench said, "The impugned order has been implemented. The child has taken admission. Why should we upset the applecart now?" When the CBSE counsel said that the improvement candidates were getting more chances under the reassessment scheme as compared to regular students, the bench said it should have brought this to the attention of the apex court when the scheme was being approved. The high court, nevertheless, issued a notice to the student and sought his reply to the CBSE's plea. "We will put you to an exam now," the bench said to the CBSE and listed the matter for hearing on February 5, 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-slams-cbse-for-anti-student-attitude-treating-students-as-enemies-927275.html

According to the remand report submitted by ED before special court for PLMA cases in Kochi, K A Rauf Sherif, who is national general secretary of Campus Front, received Rs 2.51 crore in his bank accounts through various sources, including Rs 29 lakh as foreign remittance. The ED report said that Siddique and three others carried out the trip to Hathras to meet the family of rape-murder victim as per the direction of Rauf, who sent money for this purpose to Atiq-ur-Rehman, who was a member in the delegation and a former treasures of CFI. Rauf was held by ED from Thiruvananthapuram airport on Saturday while trying to board a flight to Muscat. A native of Anchal on the suburbs of Kollam district, he case under ED probe owing to the heavy cash transactions during the lockdown days. The ED report also said that the cash remittances to the accounts were mentioned as payment for hotel stay and hence it was suspected that Rauf could be owning a hotel either in India or Oman. But ED was suspicions over this as most hotels remained defunct during the lockdown days and around Rs 30 lakh were received during April-May this year. Hence the remittance were suspected to proceeds of any crime. Rauf made the bid to leave for Muscat even as he did not appear before ED for quizzing despite repeated summons. ED was also learnt to probing whether Rauf was among those who funded the anti-CAA protest in Delhi. Earlier there were allegations that Campus Front used to woo cadres from campuses in Kerala by offering cash and even two-wheelers. They even managed to make their presence felt in some of the prominent college campuses in the state.

The politicians came into contact with Covid-19 patients earlier this month, but officials allowed them to partake in a key budget vote -- provided they wore gowns, face masks, shields and gloves. But the sitting quickly descended into pandemonium, with opposition MPs shouting out in protest and most deciding to leave the chamber rather than cast their votes. "It is a black day for democracy in Malaysia because there is no rule of law," opposition lawmaker Xavier Jayakumar told AFP. However, as well as the health minister and human resources minister, one opposition MP who should have been quarantining also turned up in parliament in protective gear. The parliament speaker insisted safeguards had been taken, including having the lawmakers transported in an ambulance and placed in a special room, state news agency Bernama reported. He rejected attempts to stop the vote, and the nine-month-old government easily won after the walkout. Most MPs had already backed the main budget vote last month, a victory for embattled Prime Minister Muhyddin Yassin whose parliamentary coalition holds a wafer-thin majority. But officials need to win several more crucial votes related to specific parts of the spending bill. Muhyiddin seized power in March without an election after the collapse of a reformist coalition, but his government is highly unstable and has been accused of lacking legitimacy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/malaysian-ministers-wear-ppe-in-parliament-opposition-walks-out-927280.html

Each vaccination team will consist of five members tasked to inoculate 100 beneficiaries per day, which could be scaled up to 200 with an additional vaccinator if the site has adequate logistics and infrastructure such as waiting rooms. The state governments have also been advised to allocate vaccine from only one manufacturer to a district to avoid mixing of different vaccines in the field. As per the 'Covid-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines’, the states have been asked to consult the latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha or state Assembly elections to identify population over 50 years, who are expected to be vaccinated on priority. The Centre plans to vaccinate 30 crore persons, including healthcare and frontline workers, those above 50 years and with co-morbid conditions in the first phase of the vaccination drive. The priority group of above 50 years may be further subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 to 60 years of age for purposes of phasing of rollout based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability. The identified persons would have to register on the Co-WIN website using one of the 12 photo-identity documents, including Voter ID, Aadhaar card, driving licence, passport and pension document, before approaching the vaccination site. As per the guidelines, all measures should be taken to avoid exposing the vaccine carrier, vaccine vials or ice packs to direct sunlight, the document stated. Vaccines and diluents should be kept inside the vaccine carrier with the lid closed until a beneficiary comes to the centre for vaccination. “There may not be vaccine vial monitors (VVM) and Date of Expiry on the label of Covid-19 vaccine. This should not discourage vaccinators from using the vaccine. At the end of the session, the vaccine carrier with all ice packs and unopened vaccine vials should be sent back to the distributing cold chain point,” the guidelines said. "These may include the challenge of ensuring over 1.3 billion people in India receive factual and timely information and updates on vaccine rollout progress and benefits, public's anxiety and queries regarding government's decision for prioritisation of vaccine administration, apprehension about the vaccines introduced after a short trial raising safety concerns, and fear of adverse events, misconception about vaccine efficacy, rumours and negative narrative in media/social media space and laxity observed in public adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour," the document stated. States have been asked to implement an integrated 360-degree comprehensive advocacy communication and social mobilisation strategy to address the challenges surrounding vaccine rollout progress and benefits.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-issues-guidelines-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-vaccine-label-may-not-carry-expiry-date-927284.html

He made the remark while speaking at the Annual General Meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). “There is a big build-up of Armed Forces at the LAC in Ladakh. In these testing times, our forces have shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude. They fought the PLA with utmost bravery and forced them to go back,” he said, even as his cabinet colleague External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had reiterated recently that the communist country had flouted bilateral agreements and deployed a large number troops along the LAC, resulting in the stand-off, which could not be resolved so far. “The coming generations of this nation will be proud of what our forces have managed to achieve this year,” the defence minister said. Singh, however, did not clarify where the Chinese PLA soldiers had been forced to go back from. Jaishankar, who had addressed the FICCI meet last Saturday, had declined to predict when the seven-month-long military stand-off between India and China could be resolved. The talks between the diplomats and the senior military commanders of India and China in fact hit an impasse once again. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had held the eighth round of talks on November 6 but had failed to agree on a plan for a mutual withdrawal of troops from the face-off points along the LAC. The two sides had agreed to have another round of meetings soon. But neither the military commanders nor the diplomats of the two nations had any engagement in the past four weeks to end the stand-off. “Whenever there is a situation at the LAC, the most obvious outcome is a comparison between military strength of India and China,” Singh said on Monday, adding: “There can be a serious debate on who owns more military might but when it comes to soft power there is no scope of ambiguity. India is far ahead of China when it comes to leading the world with ideas”. The stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had started with the communist country’s aggressive moves along the LAC – the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector – in late April and early May. It had reached a flashpoint when the soldiers of the two sides had a violent face-off at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15. The Indian Army had lost 20 of its soldiers. The PLA too had suffered casualties but had never made public the number of its personnel killed or injured in the clash. The prime minister on June 19 had held a meeting with the leaders of a number of political parties on the clash between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA. “Nobody is inside our territory, nor are any of our posts in anyone’s possession,” he had told the leaders of the political parties. The opposition leaders, a section of military veterans and strategic affairs analysts had criticized the Prime Minister for stating that no intrusion by the Chinese PLA into the territory of India had taken place. The defence minister on Monday also said that the international community had now realized that India’s allegation about the export of terrorism from Pakistan was based on facts. “We have been victims of cross-border terrorism, yet have fought the scourge alone, even when there was no one to support us. But later, they understood we were right about Pakistan being the fountainhead of terrorism,” Singh said. “And now again our brave forces are there in the forefront fighting icy winds to guard our borders and to fulfil their responsibility,” he added, apparently referring to the deployment by the Indian Army in eastern Ladakh to counter the Chinese PLA’s move to push the LAC westwards.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-jaishankar-declined-to-predict-when-lac-stand-off-would-end-rajnath-says-indian-army-forced-chinese-pla-to-go-back-927299.html
14-12-2020||National||India to establish regional climate centre for Himalayas, to benefit country, neighbours: IMD chief||India is planning to establish a regional climate centre for the Himalayan mountain region which will not only provide weather-related advices within the country but also to its neighbours, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said on Monday.   Mohapatra said the work for establishing such a centre has already begun and talks are also on with the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). China is also building a similar regional climate centre on its side of the Himalayas, he said.    Addressing a webinar on 'Weather and Climate Services over Mountains Region', Mohapatra said India has the eastern ghats, western ghats along the east and the west coast and the Myanmar hills in the northeast. Considering the size of Himalayas and its role in India's hydrology, meteorology, disaster management, ecosystem and many other activities, the world has correctly recognised it as the 'third pole of the world', he noted. As a part of the ecosystem, as a part of the land, ocean, atmosphere system, the mountains, including the Himalayas and all other hill ranges play a significant role, Mohapatra stressed. Being a data sparse region, the relative observational network is limited as compared to the plain ranges of the country, Mohapatra observed.   He said there is a scope to improve further the physical understanding of various processes occurring in these mountains regions, their modelling and hence the forecasting and warning services. "At the same time, we have to develop the climate applications scenarios, especially with respect to water sector, industries, tourism, agriculture, specifically in these mountains regions. "We are planning to establish a regional climate centre for the mountains region and it will be providing advices not only to India but also to the entire region in the Himalayas," he said. The RCC is likely to come up in Delhi, Mohapatra later told the PTI. The RCC will provide weather-related services specially for the farmers and tribes residing there. He added that Himansh, the country's remote and high altitude research centre, established in 2016, will also undertake weather research activities in the Himalayas. Mohapatra said a lot of initiatives have been taken by the Ministry of Earth Sciences and IMD for augmentation of observational network with deployment of doppler radars and automated weather stations and with the development of region specific numerical models and application activities with improvement in forecast activities and warning services. He said the disasters in the mountainous regions play a dominant role in deciding socio-economic activities. Mohapatra said natural calamities in Himalayas like the earthquakes are well-recognised --- the heavy rainfall leading to cloud bursts and also many other phenomena that affect the local agriculture, local industry, local bio-system, local lives. "We also have various types of disaster phenomenon in other hill ranges like western and eastern ghats. In the recent times, we all have witnessed that because of the monsoon rains, how the landslides, which have generally realised in the Himalayan ranges or the northeast states... how disastrous landslides have been realised in Karnataka and Kerala states," Mohapatra said. He added that similar landslides have taken place when cyclones have crossed Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-establish-regional-climate-centre-for-himalayas-to-benefit-country-neighbours-imd-chief-927303.html

The first of the few clinics in Chennai were inaugurated by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday, who said 2,000 such mini clinics will be launched in the state in the next few months. The mini-clinics are aimed at reducing the burden on overcrowded hospitals and ensuring that people living in slums access healthcare just by a walk or by commuting through cycle. The clinics, each of which will have a doctor, nurse and a medical assistant, will function from 8 am to 11 am and 4 pm to 8 pm everyday. The state government has decided to launch 630 mini-clinics each in the first two phases and 740 in the third phase. The idea was conceived after fever camps conducted first in Chennai and later expanded to other parts of the state to detect Covid-19 cases turned successful. “We have chosen areas where people from poorer sections of the society live to establish these mini-clinics. We want to ensure a healthy Tamil Nadu and these mini-clinics will go a long way in realising the dreams. We do not want poor people to spend even a few hundred rupees for consultation or treatment,” Palaniswami said. The launch comes months before the state goes for its most-crucial assembly elections in recent times. The clinic will be open for four hours in the evening to enable people to access them after coming from work. People from the middle-class who live far-away from hospitals, those living in slums, and labourers and daily-wage workers are likely to be benefited from the new clinics. “The clinics will serve as the first stop for people suffering from fever, cold, and flu without having to knock at the doors of a private hospital or a government tertiary care hospital. Our aim is to establish such clinics in every areas so that people can access them even by walk,” J Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary (Health), told DH. “Treatment for ailments like fever, cold, and flu will be taken care at these mini-clinics. This will be very helpful to people,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tamil-nadu-launches-amma-mini-clinics-aimed-at-helping-poor-927311.html

It has also asked the government to initiate measures for capacity building and skill training programmes for the transgender community and create greater employment opportunities for them. The recommendations were given by NHRC's Core Group on LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex) during a meeting last month, according to the minutes published recently. The meeting had discussed unequal protection in the matter of sexual offences for LGBTQI+ community, forced gender and sexuality conversion, right to self-perceived gender identity and invisibility of the issues and concerns particular to the intersex community. The Core Group said the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 must protect the rights of the transgender persons from atrocities from outside and within the community and it should not resort to merely extend the application of the existing penal provisions. It asked the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to define the atrocities meted out against them with specific and equal punishments as enumerated in Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The rules framed to implement the Act should give detailed enumeration of the welfare scheme which the transgender persons can avail. There should be strict and mandatory laws against forced sex reassignment surgery and conversion therapy should be formulated. It also recommended "horizontal reservations within caste, tribe and other categories of reservation" for transgender persons in furtherance of the NALSA judgement. The quota for SCs, STs and OBCs is called vertical reservation while those for ex-servicemen and disabled among others are called horizontal quota. The percentage of reservation allotted to horizontal reservation categories should be adjusted against percentage of SC, ST, OBC and General categories in vertical reservation. With the community facing trouble at work as well as getting opportunities, the Core Group emphasised that capacity building and skill training programmes should be conducted for the transgender community and greater employment opportunities should be generated for them. "Attempts needs to be made at workplace to encourage inclusivity and participation of the LGBTQI+ community," it said. Steps should be taken by the Indian Medical Association to train medical practitioners for medical examination of transgender persons. The medical community should be sensitised about sex, gender, sexuality and self identity. "An advisory may be issued to all medical students and the Indian Association of Clinical Psychologists to train them about the medical and health issues and requirements of person form this community and to discourage medical intervention attempted due to gender incongruence," the Core Group said. The Core Group recommended to the government that proper advocacy and sensitization programmes should be organised in Ministries both at the Centre and states, including National and State Human Rights Commissions, to have a better understanding of the issues which this community faces. It also highlighted the need to popularise directions given in NALSA and Navtej Singh Johar judgements by the Supreme Court to reduce stigma in the society and disseminate information about the rights of the LGBTQI+ community. "The law enforcement agencies need to be sensitized towards people belonging to LGBTQI+ community," it said. Separate shelter homes and access to food should be ensured for all the estranged individuals from this community. There is also the need to introduce one-stop grievance redressal centres with representation from the LGBTQI+ community on the lines as One Stop Centre for women to address the issue of sexual violence and abuse. Housing discrimination faced by transgender people and same-sex couples can affect where they live and the resources available to them, the Core Group said adding fair and equal housing rights for LGBTQI community should be provided. The issues of intersex community should be dealt separately from the Transgender community, it said addding that the Core Group should have representation from the intersex community so that their issue may have equal representation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/introduce-quota-for-lgbtqi-bring-law-to-prevent-forced-reassignment-surgery-nhrc-core-group-927313.html

Senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal, appearing for the petitioner, also raised before a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde the issue related to 'Pegasus', which he claimed, could hack WhatsApp messenger. In November 2019, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has reportedly confirmed that Indian journalists and human rights activists have been targets of surveillance by operators using Israeli spyware Pegasus. Over a dozen activists and journalists, including Anand Teltumbde, Bela Bhatia and Shalini Gera, had said that they were intimated about they being the target of surveillance using 'Pegasus' through WhatsApp. WhatsApp has then sued the Israeli firm NSO over cyberespionage. On Monday, the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for WhatsApp, about the "serious allegations" which he termed "baseless" and asked the petitioner to file an affidavit in this regard. Venugopal, for his part, maintained that the Pegasus issue has been reported in newspapers. It was already on affidavit, he claimed. The court asked the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to file its response and put the PIL for consideration in the fourth week of January. In his submissions, Venugopal claimed critical financial data of users of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) were allowed to be accessed by companies abroad and RBI justified it. "This is a violation of the privacy judgement as my data is being grossly misused since these companies collect this data and use it for advertisement purposes," he said. He also claimed all the data were being shared with the parent companies in violation of the NPCI guidelines. He also accused the RBI and others of allowing these companies to go ahead with the payment services without any circular or formal regulation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/data-protection-cpi-mp-binoy-viswam-questions-safety-of-payment-services-by-foreign-companies-before-sc-927317.html

Here is the top news of December 14, 2020: Vaccinating 100-200 people in each session per day, monitoring them for 30 minutes after administering the shots for any adverse event and allowing only one beneficiary at a time are among the guidelines issued by the Centre for the Covid-19 inoculation drive. According to the guidelines issued to states recently, the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system--a digitalised platform--will be used to track enlisted beneficiaries for the vaccination and coronavirus vaccines on a real-time basis. At the vaccination site, only pre-registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated in accordance with the prioritisation, and there will be no provision for on the-spot registrations. The states have been asked, as far as possible, to allocate the vaccine from one manufacturer to a district to avoid mixing of different Covid-19 vaccines in the field.   Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik has moved a breach of privilege motion against Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut for a tweet against him vis-à-vis possession of a Pakistani credit card. Sarnaik, a three-time MLA from Thane district, is one of the close aides of Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray. He moved the breach of privilege motion against Ranaut on Monday, when the two-day winter session of Maharashtra legislature commenced in Mumbai.   The government is engaging with farmer leaders to decide on the next date of talks, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, as unions intensified their agitation against the Centre's three farm laws and observed a day-long fast on Monday. "The meeting will definitely happen. We are engaging with farmers," Tomar told PTI. The government is ready for discussion anytime. The farmer leaders have to "decide and convey" when they are ready for the next meeting, he added.   Russia on Monday conducted a second launch of its new heavy-class Angara rocket -- the first developed after the fall of the Soviet Union -- nearly six years after its maiden voyage. Space agency Roscosmos announced that the next-generation Angara-A5 rocket had been successfully launched with a mock payload from Plesetsk in northern Russia at 0550 GMT. President Vladimir Putin hopes the new launchers will revive Russia's space industry and reduce reliance on other former Soviet countries.

He is also the TMC president in West Bardhaman district. Writing to Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim, Tewari further alleged that the state government did not keep its promise of allotting funds for the development of Asansol city. “It was instead promised that funds will be made available by the State Government for overall development of this city but it was not done,” stated Tiwari. Accusing the Urban Development Minister and his Department of not allowing AMC fund of Rs1500 core under the Centre’s Solid Waste Management Project Tiwari stated that “injustice” was being done to Asansol. The letter sparked a war of words between Tiwari and Hakim. Expressing his displeasure over the incident Hakim said that “ he (Tiwari) was wrong in sending such a letter without raising the issue directly to him...He should not have created such an unnecessary controversy.”He also said that perhaps Tewari was “misled” by the BJP. Tewari hit back by saying that “ I am only concerned with what Mamata Banerjee says and don’t bother about the rest.” Earlier, senior TMC leader and erstwhile close aid of the Chief Minister Suvendu Adhikari had resigned as a Cabinet Minister voicing his displeasure against the party leadership. Forest Minister Rajib Banerjee had also expressed unhappiness over how the party was being run. Union Minister and BJP MP from Asansol Babul Supriyo said that " Tewari's letter vindicates BJP's claim that the State Government was obstructing development for narrow-minded politics."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/yet-another-tmc-leader-lashes-out-at-party-leadership-927349.html

Speaking at the launch of the Indian Navy’s Project 17A stealth frigate Himgiri built by the PSU Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd GRSE) in Kolkata Rawat also said that concerted efforts must be made to ensure that there was no disruption of trade via sea due to piracy, terrorism, and conflict. “China’s attempt to change the status quo on the Line of Actual Control necessitates high levels of preparations on the land, sea, and in the air. As the Chief of Defence Staff I am fully confident that the Indian Armed Forces will leave no stones unturned to safeguard our frontiers be it inland, in the air, or the oceans,” said Rawat. He also said that China was carrying out some development activities in its Tibet Autonomous Region at a time when there was a standoff between Indian and Chinese forces at Ladakh. "Our forces are fully prepared to deal with any kind of eventuality. I don't think that there should be much concern as we are executing similar activities on our side," Rawat said. He also said that India’s 7500 km long coastline projecting into the heart of the Indian Ocean allows the country to be at the “epicentre of global trade” “The maritime dimension of India’s security and its importance to national development and economic prosperity is well recognized today. Indian Navy has a preeminent role in guarding the country’s economic, strategic and territorial interests,” said Rawat. Emphasising indigenisation Rawat said that the seeds of the Indian Navy’s goal of self-reliance were sown with the setting up of its own design organization as early as the 1960s. The P17A warships would be state-of-the-art guided-missile frigates. At 149 meter long with a displacement of 6670 tons they would have an advanced propulsion system enabling a speed of over 28 knots. “These complex weapon platforms are equipped with a powerful weapon and sensor package capable of neutralising threats in all three dimensions, air, surface, and subsurface,” stated a release by the GRSE.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chinas-pla-carrying-out-development-work-in-tibet-india-ready-for-any-eventuality-cds-rawat-927351.html

Some social groups also took out a joint rally, demanding repealing of the laws. The hunger strike by dozens of AAP members near Jewel Chowk in the heart of Jammu was meant to convey the support of the party to the agitating farmers, an AAP spokesperson said. He alleged that the Centre has "introduced these black laws to benefit a section of corporate houses". "If farmers are not ready to accept these laws, the government should shun its rigidity and accept their demand by revoking these laws immediately," the spokesperson said. Thousands of farmers are protesting against the legislations at various border points of Delhi since November end, demanding that the central government withdraw the laws. A group of people affiliated to social organisations, such as the Desh Bhagat Yadgar Committee and the Lok Manch, took out a rally from the Gandhi Nagar Gurdwara here in support of the agitating farmers and briefly blocked the Jammu airport road before dispersing. Some Sikh organisations and NGOs were also part of the march. They were initially stopped by police when they tried to block the road.         Protesters raised slogans in support of farmers' demand to repeal the new farm laws and later, dispersed off peacefully, officials said. "The government has to take back these anti-farmer laws. The entire population of the country stands with farmers," chairman Sikh Youth Sewa Trust Tejinder Pal said. Farmers are protesting the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aap-stages-hunger-strike-in-jammu-in-support-of-agitating-farmers-927353.html
14-12-2020||National||Shiv Sena makes last-ditch attempt to save INS Viraat||During 1999-2000, late Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray ensured that decommissioned-aircraft carrier Vikrant was not auctioned. He ensured that the move to convert her into a full-fledged museum remained alive. Thackeray was in regular touch with late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and late Defence Minister George Fernandes to ensure that the ship was not sold out. But in 2013-14, the heroine of the Bangladesh Liberation was scrapped - even after a legal battle - in Mumbai’s Darukhana area. Now, 20 years later, decommissioned aircraft carrier Viraat is meeting the same fate – she is being scrapped at Alang in Gujarat, considered the biggest graveyard of old ships. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, however, has initiated a move to save Viraat. Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has petitioned Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to save Viraat from being scrapped, and preserve it for future generations. “Let Viraat be a living, breathing and thriving memorial of India’s nationalism, patriotism and pride. Let us be preservers than destroyers of our rich history. Hence, it is my humble suggestion to kindly grant the NOC that would help preserve Viraat,” Chaturvedi said in a letter to Singh on Monday. In the emotional appeal, she said that it would be a crying shame if we let go of our history without giving the benefit of knowledge to our future generations. “Viraat’s preservation is well merited and deserving of strong consideration of the government,” she said, adding that the warship can be saved if the Government of India desires – and the Government of Maharashtra would be happy to cooperate in the restoration. “We as a nation must use our decommissioned naval ships to help citizens better understand the significance of India’s maritime history,” she said. One of the longest-serving warships in the world, INS Viraat has covered 5,90,000 nautical miles at sea, and 22,622 hours of flying operations. The ship served for 30 years in the Indian Navy, and 27 years in the Royal Navy. Under the Indian Flag, the ship was instrumental during Operation Parakram between India and Pakistan; apart from Sri Lankan Peace Keeping operation. Its last operational deployment was for participation in International Fleet Review in February, 2016. The plan to convert the majestic ship into a museum has failed and she had been auctioned by Metal Scrap Trading Corporation Ltd (MSTC). The Shree Ram Group of Gujarat has purchased it for around Rs 38 crore. At least, three states - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Goa - had initially expressed interest in the project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shiv-sena-makes-last-ditch-attempt-to-save-ins-viraat-927363.html

Farmer leaders said that they are making arrangements to host the women members coming from various parts of Punjab -- tents are being put up, separate langar is being planned, and extra temporary toilets are being arranged. The aim is to give them a safe and comfortable environment to stay at the protest site, they said. Farmer leader Harendir Singh Lakhowal said that a Delhi-based organisation donated around 2,00 tents on Sunday which is now being put up at Singhu as well as Tikri borders, especially for women. Shiv Kumar Kakka, one of the 33 farmers who observed the hunger strike at Singhu border on Monday, said it is not an agitation of Punjab farmers alone, but of farmers from across the nation. Several women have already been a part of the agitation at the borders here, but more have expressed their willingness to join the cause, he said. "We are expecting over 2,000 women from across various parts of Punjab to join the agitation. We have multiple langars open here for everyone, but we are also thinking to start a separate one for the women.

"Our main purpose is to give women a safe and comfortable environment to stay in. After all, they are daughters of farmers, they can live anywhere here," he said. Lakhowal said that with more farmers, especially women, planning to join in the agitation, they are looking for vacant or incomplete buildings as temporary accommodation for the protesting women. Some good samaritan have also approached them to donate temporary toilets and have offered their flats for temporary accommodation, the farmer leaders said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/over-2000-women-from-farmers-families-to-join-protests-927366.html

Addressing a press conference at TMC Bhavan here, senior party leader and state minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay said that under the BJP dispensation at the Centre, corporates are getting sops, even as common people continue to suffer. "The BJP government has taken upon itself to sell all of India's PSUs. It has approved the sale of major PSUs such as Air India, BSNL, Bharat Petroleum Corp and IOC, three SAIL plants and the Shipping Corporation of India," he said. All of these are being done as "part of a quid pro quo scheme called 'sell India' mission", he claimed. "The BJP, when it came to power, promised to create two crore jobs a year. Unemployment in India is at 24% now. In Bengal, however, it has reduced by 40%. One crore jobs have been created under the Mamata Banerjee government," he said. Listing out data and figures to back his claims on job creation in the state over the last few years, he said the TMC government has floated with new employment schemes, disbursing loans of up to Rs 10 lakh. Taking a dig at the BJP for its promise to distribute job opportunity cards among 75 lakh youths in the state over the next five years, Chattopadhyay said, "The saffron party, in a bid to win polls, will go to any extent to fool people". He slammed the BJP for spreading "canards about unemployment" in Bengal. "More than 28,000 youths have benefited from the Gatidhara scheme, which provides loans of up to Rs 10 lakh. Six lakh youths are being trained to become self-reliant under Utkarsh Bangla scheme. Also, Rs 1500 per month is provided as financial assistance to one lakh unemployed youth under the Yuvashree project," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-on-sell-india-mission-tmc-minister-927382.html

As per guidelines, restaurants, tea stalls, hotels, grocery stores, and other places can become Wi-Fi access points without registration with the DoT and use bandwidth procured from service providers. “The backhaul requirement for these Wi-Fi access points will be met by procuring internet bandwidth from the telecom service providers/internet service providers," said the DoT. Internet Service Providers, and companies like Google and Facebook can start registration and can offer WiFi hotspot services, said an official in the statement. Last week, the Union Cabinet approved PM-WANI project, aimed at proliferation of broadband connectivity in the country. The cabinet approved the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recommended aggregator-model paving the way for new categories of public data offices (PDOs), public data office aggregators (PDOAs) and app providers to deliver public WiFi services without a licence. Any company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 can become a PDOA with DoT’s certification and free of cost. The DoT will approve the registration within seven days. A PDOA will be an aggregator of PDOs to oversee authorisation and accounting of Wi-Fi connections, the DoT said. The process of registration as an app developer will be the same, says the guidelines. An app developer will build a platform to register users and discover Wani-compliant Wi-Fi hotspots in an area and display them on the app, says the guidelines. The government hoping that the scheme will promote growth of public Wi-Fi networks in the country.

The CDS said that the new generation Project 17A ships with advanced stealth features, state-of-the-art weapons and sensor systems will be a major boost to Indian Navy's mobility to undertake a variety of challenging tasks. "I am fully confident that Himgiri and other such ships of the project will conquer the seas and bring glory to our nation," he said at the launch of the ship. He complimented the workforce at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) Limited here for the launch of the first of the three Project 17A warships within schedule despite the Covid-19 pandemic situation, terming it as a singular achievement. "It is a historic day for the Indian Navy and for the Armed Forces as we gradually move forward to strengthening our operational preparedness," he said. General Rawat said that the mighty warship is a reincarnation of the earlier INS Himgiri, a Niligiri class frigate launched half a century ago in May 1970. "We must be proud of our ability to innovate and invent and we must continue," the CDS said, lauding the Indian shipbuilders for transforming the Indian Navy from a buyer to a builder. Launched by his wife Madhulika Rawat, 'Himgiri' touched the water of the river Hooghly and the frigate will now undergo extended trials before it is delivered to the Indian Navy. The CDS said that the Navy's journey towards self- reliance began way back in the 1960s by setting up its own design organisation. "The Directorate of Naval Design has designed over 19 classes of ships of which more than 90 ships have been built in the last 60 years," he said. General Rawat said that the Indian Navy has a preeminent role in guarding India's economic, strategic and territorial interests. He said that the government has promoted the Make in India policy to ensure that large defence contracts are executed by Indian forums with employment being generated within the country. "We are proud that India belongs to an elite group of nations which is building complex warships and strategic submarines," he said, adding that indigenisation is a key part of the Indian Navy's acquisition of warships. He said that all 24 vessels and submarines inducted in the past six years have been built in the country and 41 more vessels are being constructed at various shipyards across the country. "I want to compliment and congratulate every member of GRSE right from the grass root workers to the supervisors up to the CMD who have toiled very hard in spite of Covid-19 conditions," General Rawat said. P17A ships are the most advanced guided missile frigates, each of which is 149 metres long, with displacement of approximately 6,670 tonnes and a speed of 28 knots, according to an official. The contract of Rs 19,294 crore for construction of three highly advanced stealth frigates under Project 17A is the largest ever order won by the GRSE, he said. The contract was signed between the Ministry of Defence and the GRSE on February 20, 2015 and the first ship is expected to be handed over to the Navy in 2023 and the next two ships in 2024 and 2025 respectively, the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/grse-built-stealth-frigate-himgiri-launched-general-bipin-rawat-calls-it-a-historic-moment-927390.html

Seeking to portray acceptance of the reforms, Tomar met a delegation of farmers from All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC), founded by late Sharad Joshi, who declared their support for the farm sector reforms. “We are engaging with the farmers,” Tomar said after meeting the farmers’ representatives from Haryana, Maharashtra, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Telangana. The minister also met BJP MLAs and MPs from Haryana, who expressed their support for the three farm sector reforms. The AIKCC was the fourth farmers’ group to have met Tomar and supported the three farm laws that have had farmer unions from across Punjab up in arms against the Modi government. Farmers under the banner ‘Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’ blocked the Jaipur-Delhi highway, clashed with the police who had prevented their march towards the national capital. Thirty-three farmer leaders, mostly from Punjab, who have been held six rounds of negotiations with the government observed a day-long hunger strike to press for their demand for the repeal of the three laws. “Our message to the government is that due to its policies the ‘Annadatas’ had to observe fast today. The government should repeal the three farm laws,” Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Manjeet Singh said. “We are ready for talks with the protesting farmers, but they have their own programmes lined up. We are awaiting proposals on clause-by-clause discussions with them,” Tomar said. Tomar also met Home Minister Amit Shah before meeting with the farmer groups. BJP delegations from Punjab and Haryana also called on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, whose Jananayak Janata Party is in alliance with the BJP, met Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Chautala, who is facing the heat due to the farmers’ agitation, said Agriculture Minister and Home Minister have been reaching out to the farmers and the next round of talks would be held soon. “I hope 40 unions who came for talks earlier will also join the next round of talks as well and come to a conclusion,” Chautala said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-steps-up-efforts-to-reach-out-to-farmers-bjp-mlas-from-haryana-speak-in-favour-of-farm-laws-927393.html

As around 5,000 nurses went on strike from the afternoon hampering patient care services at the premier hospital, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria in a video message termed the strike in the time of pandemic as "inappropriate and unfortunate". "I appeal to all the nurses and nursing officers not to go on strike, and not to make us feel embarrassed about the dignity that we have as far as the nurses are concerned. "I, therefore, appeal to all of you to come back and work and really help us get through this pandemic," he said in an emotional message. The strike was earlier scheduled to start on December 16. Guleria said that the nurses union had put in 23 demands and almost all of them have been met by the AIIMS administration and the government. He said one of the demands is basically a perceived anomaly in the fixation of the initial payment as per the Sixth Central Pay Commission (CPC) is concerned. The AIIMS director said that multiple meetings have been held with the nurses union not only by the AIIMS administration but by the economic adviser in the Ministry of Health, representatives of the department of expenditure and also the person who drafted the 6th CPC was also present in the meeting and that it was explained to them that the interpretation is not correct. "...but because the nurses' union were asking for a hike in the salary, it was said by the government that would sympathetically look at this as a fresh demand and asked the department of expenditure to consider this," he said. "It however seems inappropriate that when a country is fighting a pandemic when we are fighting for our near and dear ones to save lives and we know that we need to work only for a few more months and the vaccine may actually provide a solution. Unfortunately at this point in time, the nurses have gone on a strike," Guleria said. Besides the demands with regard to the sixth CPC, nurses have also been demanding redressal of issues such as the abolishment of gender-based reservation in the recruiting process of nursing officers and contractual appointments, enhancement of hospital accommodation, and cadre restructuring. In a letter to the director, the Union said no solid solution was taken by the AIIMS administration and rather their demand related to the 6th central pay commission anomaly was turned down. Guleria said in his message, "Whatever issues you have we will try and resolve amicably and try and be sympathetic to your demand. But at this time of hardship and in this time of trial and tribulation please do not go on strike.” He said that the year 2020 has been declared by the WHO as the year of nurse and midwife as the world celebrates the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale. "She also insisted that a real nurse would never abandon her patients and I am sure that even in Covid-19 a real nurse will really never abandon her patients or those healthcare workers who are now admitted in our hospital and looking for care," he said. AIIMS issued a statement stating the Nursing Union of AIIMS, New Delhi has gone on a strike in contravention of the direction of the High Court of Delhi... in relation to "Code of Conduct" laid down whereby no employee or staff or faculty member will cease work for any reason whatsoever or shout slogans or hold demonstrations within the campus or hold gate meeting within 500 meters radius of the institute boundary, etc. "The various demands raised by the nurses Union stand discussed with them for resolution. The Union has however abandoned many critically ill patients on the demand of perceived anomaly of fixation of the initial pay related to 6th CPC of the year 2006," the statement said. The Nurses Union was apprised that their interpretation is not covered under the existing instructions of the Ministry of Finance, as clarified by the Department of Expenditure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aiims-nurses-union-announces-indefinite-strike-927401.html

Singh, who has been working with sugarcane and paddy farmers in Uttar Pradesh has been at odds with the AIKSCC and taken divergent stand ever since the farmers union began their march to the national capital on November 26. “The National Working Group of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee has decided to do away with the post of the convenor. Henceforth, all decisions of AIKSCC shall be taken only by the Working Group, which shall be the official stand of the AIKSCC and shall be announced as such,” the AIKSCC said in a statement on Monday. Singh was in favour of shifting the protests to Burari Grounds, instead of blocking roads and highways, a stand rejected by the agitating farmers. The protesters had dissociated with Singh, but the decision to oust him came after he reiterated his views of accepting the amendments proposed by the government and drop the demand for repeal of the laws. On Saturday, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu faction) had ended the blockade at the Noida-Delhi border after talking to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. Though these appear to suggest division among the ranks of farmers, the 32 farmer unions of Punjab still remain united in their demand for repeal of the farm laws. Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan leader Raju Shetti told DH that he had advised the protesting farmers not to let differences divert the attention from the agitation and stick to the demand for legal sanction for minimum support price. “If you succeed on MSP, you will get the support of 94% farmers from across the country. The government speaks of 'One, Nation One Market, but we should insist on 'One Nation One Rate',” Shetti said, noting that only 6% farmers benefit by MSP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aikscc-removes-convenor-who-favoured-amendments-in-farm-laws-amid-stir-927402.html

He said the current laws do not allow the sale of agricultural land to a person whose past four generations have not been in farming. “Such laws, including for tribal land, deny farmers willing to sell their land a fair price,” Patil said referring to a case of Bachchan and Mukherjee facing legal problems in acquiring agricultural land. In a memorandum submitted to Tomar, the AIKCC also demanded scrapping of the Essential Commodities Act completely as it allowed the government to impose an export ban which denied farmers access to free markets. The AIKCC said the country had witnessed emotional agitations in 1991-1992 against the Dunkel Draft and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. “We are of the firm belief that Indian farmers will not prosper if they do not get freedom to enter global trade,” the AIKCC said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/allow-the-resource-rich-to-acquire-farmland-says-aikcc-927403.html

In the last 15 days, ENT surgeons at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) have seen 13 cases of "Covid-19-triggered mucormycosis". This alarming affliction, although rare, is not new. What is new is Covid-19 triggering mucormycosis, they said. Black Fungus or mucormycosis has been a cause of disease and death of patients in transplants, and ICU and immunodeficient individuals since long. However, it is the rapid increase in the numbers seen in unsuspected recovering Covid-19 patients that is causing the grave concern, the SGRH said in a statement. "In the last 15 days, ENT surgeons have seen 13 cases of Covid-19-triggered mucormycosis in over 50 per cent patients, with loss of eyesight, and removal of nose and jaw bone needed," it said. Mortality is currently being seen in the range of 50 per cent (five patients), with certain deaths when there is involvement of brain, the hospital authorities said. Doctors had to do these resections in about 10 patients over the last fortnight, with "about 50 per cent losing their eyesight permanently". Five of these patients required critical care support due to associated complications. There also have been five mortalities so far in this subgroup, the statement said. According to Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon, at the hospital, “The frequency with which we are witnessing the occurrence of Covid-19-triggered mucormycosis with high morbidity and mortality has never been seen before and is shocking and alarming." Varun Rai, consultant ENT surgeon at SGRH said, “Early clinical suspicion on symptoms such as nose obstruction, swelling in the eye or cheeks, and black dry crusts in the nose should immediately prompt the conduct of a biopsy in the OPD and start of the antifungal therapy as early as possible”.  Delhi recorded 1,376 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, the lowest in over three-and-a-half months, even as the death toll mounted to 10,074 with 60 new fatalities. The positivity rate dropped to 2.15 per cent from 2.74 per cent on Sunday, authorities said. The Monday bulletin said 5,83,509 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-triggering-rare-deadly-fungal-infection-claims-ganga-ram-hospital-927405.html

CSIR-CCMB has developed the innovative, direct Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction technology which lets faster testing of samples for Covid-19. The MoU with CSIR-CCMB is for conducting these tests in SpiceHealth’s mobile testing laboratories. The method received Indian Council of Medical Research's approval. The procedure has the potential to scale up Covid-19 testing 2-3 fold with no additional resources while significantly reducing the time and costs of such tests. SpiceHealth said it will be the first to launch the dry swab direct RT-PCR Covid-19 testing in India. Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CSIR-CCMB said, “The dry swab testing method will be a game-changer during this Covid-19 pandemic. This is safer, faster and cheaper than the current testing methods, while not compromising on quality.” The dry-swab direct RT-PCR method eliminates the new kits requirement. No additional training needed for the persons conducting the test. Normally, the swab samples are placed in a liquid called Viral Transport Medium. These samples are packed heavily to avoid leakage, thus increasing the processing time at the collection and testing centres. Dry-swab testing eliminates this process while also not requiring RNA extraction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/spicehealth-inks-deal-with-ccmb-to-use-its-dry-swab-covid-19-testing-technology-927407.html

It said the virtual meeting was held as a follow up of decisions taken during talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan last week. Located in the Sistan-Balochistan province on the energy-rich Iran's southern coast, the Chabahar port is being increasingly seen as a fulcrum of connectivity to Central Asia. The port is being developed by India, Iran and Afghanistan to boost trade ties among the three countries in the wake of Pakistan denying transit access to New Delhi. The port can be easily accessed from India's western coast, bypassing Pakistan. "During the meeting, the participants discussed joint use of Chabahar Port for trade and transit purposes and enhanced regional connectivity. All sides also noted the significant role played by Chabahar port for the region to deliver humanitarian assistance during the COVID pandemic," the MEA said in a statement. "All sides welcomed India's proposal to hold 'Chabahar Day' on the sidelines of the International Maritime Summit scheduled to be hosted by India in January 2021," it said. The trilateral meeting took place in the backdrop of India pitching for participation of Uzbekistan in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) project. The INSTC is a 7,200-km-long multi-mode transport project for moving freight among India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe. Ways to speed up connectivity projects linking central Asia was a major focus of the virtual summit between Modi and Mirziyoyev on December 11. The trilateral meeting was jointly chaired by India's Shipping Secretary Sanjeev Ranjan, Deputy Minister of Transport of Uzbekistan D Dehkanov and Deputy Transport Minister of Iran Shahram Adamnejad, according to the MEA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-iran-uzbekistan-hold-first-trilateral-meet-on-joint-use-of-chabahar-port-927411.html

Gen Naravane, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on the second leg of his two-nation visit that included the United Arab Emirates, is the first-ever head of the Indian Army to travel to the two strategically important Gulf countries. "COAS visit to #SaudiArabia will strengthen bilateral defence cooperation between the two countries," the Indian Army's Additional Directorate General of Public Information said in a tweet. On the first day of his visit on Sunday, Gen Naravane met top Saudi generals, including Commander of the Royal Saudi Land Forces Gen Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir, Chief of General Staff Gen. Fayyadh bin Hamid Al-Ruwaili and Commander of the Joint Forces Lt Gen Mutlaq bin Salim, and discussed issues of common interest and ways to enhance bilateral defence cooperation. On Monday, Gen Naravane visited King Abdul Aziz Military Academy and exchanged views on military training. He also visited Saudi Armed Forces Command and Staff College and National Defence University, where he addressed the Faculty and student officers attending the War Course, the Indian Army tweeted. His wife Veena Naravane and other delegates visited the TCS All Women Center in Riyadh. She appreciated the commitment of the TCS towards gender empowerment, investment and growth in Saudi Arabia through such initiatives, it said in another tweet. She also visited Princess Nourah University and Wipro Women Business Park in Riyadh, which bear testimony to women enabling and empowerment, it added. Gen Naravane’s visit is seen as a reflection of India's growing strategic ties with the two key Gulf countries and is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere. His visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel's relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran's top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Ahead of his visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Army said in a statement in New Delhi that his "visit is historic in the sense that it will be the first time an Indian Army chief is visiting the UAE and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Gen. Naravane's visit to the Gulf region comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's trips to Bahrain and the UAE during which he called on top leaders of the two countries. Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone. In October, Gen. Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gen-naravanes-visit-to-saudi-arabia-will-strengthen-bilateral-defence-cooperation-indian-army-927423.html

Farmer leader Baldev Singh said, "Representatives of farmer unions have started their hunger strike at Singhu Border." On Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he would also observe a day-long fast on Monday and appealed to the central government to shun ego and scrap the legislations. A large group of farmers on Sunday blocked the key Delhi-Jaipur national highway when it was stopped by police on the Haryana-Rajasthan border. As part of the nationwide protest, dharnas will be staged at all district headquarters across the country on Monday. In view of the nationwide protest, the Delhi Police has enhanced security at city border points.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/agitating-farmers-begin-day-long-fast-to-intensify-protest-against-farm-laws-927174.html

Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian, the US District Court of Los Angeles, in his order on December 10 said that Rana "presented a robust bail package" and offered conditions that significantly mitigate the risk of flight. But the "Court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight" and as such granted the request of the US government to the continued detention of Rana. Meanwhile, the US government in the court has supported India's request that the documents submitted by it in support of the extradition of Rana be not made public. The extradition documents presented by India apparently include information about Rana’s involvement in the Mumbai terrorist attack that would be shared with him. "Although the United States has no affirmative discovery obligations in extradition matters, in this case, it has agreed to provide Rana a document in its possession from an unrelated 'state court' proceeding in India. India has requested that the United States take steps to limit public dissemination of this document," US Attorney Nicola T Hanna said in a court submission on Friday. Rana has informed the United States that he may seek to introduce materials provided as discovery and labelled "general discovery materials" and "sensitive discovery materials" in United States v Kashmiri, Case in opposition of the United States' Request for Extradition. These discovery materials are subject to a protective order issued in the Northern District of Illinois, it said. In his December 10 order, the judge said Rana was currently facing multiple criminal charges emanating from India in connection with alleged conduct by him that at least to some degree overlaps with and formed a basis for federal criminal charges on which Rana was tried in Chicago and relates to the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai. Rana in his bail plea said that his health is in poor condition, including two heart attacks while in custody and two weeks of illness early this year. Rana argued that he was not a danger to the community – which was opposed by the US government. The judge noted that Rana did not perform any violent acts himself and instead provided material support to the Denmark plot by furnishing Headley with business cards, supporting his business cover, and providing him with logistical support for his travels and plots. The nature of the offenses charged in India – which relate to the Mumbai attack – also weigh in favour of finding that Rana is a danger to the community, though the weight of the evidence on the same is far less conclusive, she wrote. The Conspiracy to Commit Murder and Murder charges are obviously extremely serious and the letters filed by the government bring home the devastating impact the Mumbai attack had and continue to have on the victims and their families, the judge wrote. The weight of the evidence presented to date against Rana on such charges is not overwhelming. The other two charges – Conspiracy to Commit Forgery for the Purpose of Cheating and the Conspiracy to Use as Genuine a Forged Document or Electronic Record – are far less serious in and of themselves – but the weight of the evidence presented to date against Rana as to those charges is far stronger, Chooljian wrote. There is no question in the Court's mind that given Rana's significant foreign ties, particularly to Canada, and the potential death penalty awaiting him in India if he is extradited on and convicted of the most serious pending charges, that Rana is a flight risk, the judge wrote.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/us-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-26/11-accused-tahawwur-rana-927194.html

But the social media company is concerned about the safety of its staff in India. Many of Bajrang Dal's videos have lakhs of views on Facebook. In June this year, Bajrang Dal extremists got into a church in New Delhi and installed a Hindu idol, claiming that the church was constructed on temple grounds. The group posted a video about it on Facebook, which has been viewed over 2.5 lakh times. According to a report filed by its security team, if Facebook bans the organisation from its website, it may invite attacks on its employees and buildings. The company should also beware of angering the ruling government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by banning the group. Facebook has five offices in India in New Delhi and Mumbai. This highlights the struggle Facebook is facing across the world in its efforts to curb hate speech and fake news on its platform. The reason it is especially worried about India is that the South Asian country is Facebook’s largest market by the number of users. Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told WSJ that the company does not regard the political position of any group before deciding to ban it. Bajrang Dal, which has been classified a militant religious organisation by the CIA, said that none of its members partake in any illegal activity or conflicts with other groups. Mark Zuckerberg-run Facebook has similar concerns about two other right-wing Indian groups, Sanatan Sanstha and Sri Ram Sena, sources are quoted as saying in the report. The company has deemed India as a ‘Tier One’ country, which means it is considered to be at the highest risk of societal violence and so, requires additional efforts from the company. Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are also on the list.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/why-facebook-is-on-the-fence-about-banning-bajrang-dal-927238.html

On the BJP ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party supporting the farmers' agitation and threatening to sever ties with the NDA, Singh said his party leaders will persuade its chief Hanuman Beniwal when he talks to them. Beniwal has said that he will have to reconsider his support to the central government if the farm laws are not withdrawn in the interest of farmers. The BJP leader said, "More than 99 per cent farmers in the country are with the Modi government and if there is confusion among the rest, we will sit and the confusion will be removed." "They are innocent farmers but among them are some elements who need to be exposed. They put up posters of Sharjeel Imam," he said, referring to anti-citizenship law activist accused by Delhi Police of being involved in the recent riots. Singh, who is charge of party affairs in Rajasthan, said the farm laws have been enacted in the interest of farmers, but the Congress, which in its election manifesto had promised similar steps, is now opposing the reforms due to political considerations. He said that the Modi government increased the minimum support price (MSP) for crops and worked in the direction of doubling farmers' income. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Some of them have also blocked the Jaipur-Delhi highway. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. Singh said no highway was blocked but a few farmers are sitting in Delhi. Targeting the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, he said that people are fed up with the Congress in just two years and have voted in support of the BJP in the recent local body poll. He said farmers in large numbers voted in favour of the BJP in Panchayati Raj elections. Singh also expressed concern over the situation in West Bengal, saying democracy in the state is under threat and BJP workers are being murdered. He said that the Centre will take appropriate action at an appropriate time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/99-per-cent-farmers-are-with-modi-government-arun-singh-927245.html

"The meeting will definitely happen. We are engaging with farmers," Tomar told PTI. The government is ready for discussion anytime. The farmer leaders have to "decide and convey" when they are ready for the next meeting, he added. Tomar is leading the negotiations with 40 farmer unions, along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce and Industries Som Parkash. Previous five rounds of talks between the Centre and 40 farmer unions' leaders have remained inconclusive. The government has sent a draft proposal along with written assurance of continuing the minimum support price (MSP) system to them for consideration, but farmer unions have rejected it and demanded repeal of the laws. Later, the agriculture minister also met a delegation of farmers led by the All India Kisan Coordination Committee (AIKCC) which extended support to the farm laws. This is the fourth group of farmers who have extended support to the laws in last two weeks. Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The farmers protesting at Delhi's borders observed a day-long fast on Monday even as the agitation spread to different parts of the country with peasant unions staging demonstrations at district headquarters. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/we-are-engaging-with-farmers-to-decide-on-next-date-of-talks-agriculture-minister-tomar-927278.html

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said the order passed by the Haryana government is prima facie without jurisdiction and the requirement of prior environmental clearance cannot be dispensed with. The tribunal said there is no merit in the submission that prior environmental clearance is not required where it was obtained by the concerned industrial area. "Let the contesting respondents show cause why the impugned order be not quashed by their response by e-mail before the next date. The applicant may provide a set of papers and a copy of this order to all the contesting respondents and file an affidavit of service within one week," the bench said. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by NGO Dastak seeking quashing of the order of Haryana government allowing manufacturers of formaldehyde, requiring prior environmental clearance, to operate for six months without EC, subject to making an application for EC within 60 days. The applicant submits that requirement of prior EC is mandatory and there is no jurisdiction with the State to exempt the same. It is further stated that the industries are using groundwater of approximately six lakh litres per day without requisite permission of the Ground Water Authority. There is also non-compliance of Manufacture Storage, and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989. "Untreated effluents are dumped back into the groundwater through reverse borewells. In the condensation process, excess steam is discharged, using chimney adding to the air pollution," the plea said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/prior-ec-for-industries-ngt-issues-show-cause-notice-to-centre-haryana-govt-927296.html

Kejriwal, who joined AAP leaders, MLAs and volunteers at the party office in observing a day-long fast in support of the protesting farmers, said the new farm laws "gives license to inflate". Farmer leaders on Monday started their day-long hunger strike against the Centre's new farm laws and said protests will be held at all district headquarters later in the day, even as more people are expected to join the ongoing agitation at Delhi border points. Addressing volunteers, Kejriwal said this law says people can hoard as much as they want. "I appeal to parties to stop playing dirty politics over farmers' issue. These laws are anti-farmer and anti-aam aadmi and are aimed to benefit a few capitalists. These laws will lead to immense inflation through hoarding. These legislations gives license to inflate," Kejriwal said. Due to these laws, wheat will become four times more expensive in the coming years, he said. "Don't think you are doing a favour by supporting farmers. Farmers are doing a favour by protesting against these laws," he said. Kejriwal said the AAP stands in solidarity with the farmers. "AAP is standing with the farmers and is supporting them. Across the entire country, AAP volunteers are observing fast along with the farmers and standing in solidarity with them," he said. "When we were asked to give stadiums to convert them into temporary jails, we refused. I also went to serve the farmers as 'sewadaar'. This angered these people a lot. My doors were closed when I wanted to go and support the farmers protest," he said, referring to his alleged house arrest last week when 'Bharat Bandh' was observed. Speaking to reporters, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the farmers are very unhappy with the three black laws of the central government. "The central government should leave its arrogance and withdraw all three laws. The Aam Aadmi Party is observing fast in support of the farmers," Sisodia said.

Hazare's other demand include granting autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The anti-graft activist had sat on a fast in his Ralegaon Siddhi village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra in February 2019. He called off the fast on February 5, 2019, after receiving a written assurance from then Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh that the Centre would form a high- powered committee to discuss the suggestions made by the Swaminathan Commission and other agriculture-related demands. In his letter to Tomar, copies of which were shared with reporters, Hazare has enclosed the letter of Radha Mohan Singh assuring that the high-powered committee will prepare its report and submit it by October 30, 2019. "The Centre had assured that it would take appropriate action on the demands on the basis of the committee's report. Since nothing has been done till date to that effect, I am thinking to resume the hunger strike which was called off on February 5, 2019," Hazare wrote in his letter to Tomar. The octogenarian said the Centre would be soon apprised of the date and venue of the fast. Hazare observed a fast on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by farmer organisations demanding a repeal of the Centre's three agri laws. He had warned of an agitation if the government fails to grant autonomy to the CACP and implement recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/anna-hazare-warns-centre-of-fast-over-agri-related-demands-927333.html

Speaking to reporters in his Lok Sabha constituency of Azamgarh, about 300 km from here, Akhilesh accused the BJP of trying to 'polarise' the voters in West Bengal to gain electoral mileage in the polls. "BJP has started inciting communal hatred in West Bengal...we do not want BJP to win there and so we have decided to support the TMC," he said. Although the SP did not have a large support base in Bengal, the party had pockets of influence, specially among the people from Uttar Pradesh. A large population of migrants from UP lives in Kolkata and some other districts in West Bengal. It was not yet clear if Akhilesh would also be campaigning in West Bengal in support of TMC in the polls. West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC president Mamata Banerjee was locked in a fierce electoral contest with the BJP. Akhilesh also sought to corner the BJP government at the centre and in the state for ignoring the 'genuine' demands of the agitating farmers and said that the saffron party would have to bear the consequences in the Assembly polls in UP, which was due in less than two year's time. He also made it clear that his party would not have any truck with bigger national parties though the SP could have electoral alliance with smaller outfits.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sp-chief-akhilesh-yadav-to-support-mamata-banerjee-in-west-bengal-assembly-polls-927346.html
14-12-2020||National Politics||Kejriwal, Amarinder Singh in Twitter spat over ongoing farmers' protest||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh engaged in a Twitter spat on Monday over the ongoing farmers' protest against the three recently-enacted agriculture-related laws. The war of words between the two leaders began after Singh, addressing a press conference at Chandigarh on Sunday, described as "theatrics" Kejriwal’s announcement earlier during that day that he will observe a one-day fast on Monday in support of the protesting farmers. Responding to Singh's comments, Kejriwal accused him of having "done a deal with the Centre to save your son from ED (Enforcement Directorate)''. "I have been with the farmers since beginning. I did not let Delhi's stadiums being turned into jails. I fought with the Center. I am serving the farmers by becoming their sewadaar. You have done a deal with the Centre to save your son from the ED. You disowned the farmers' movement. Why?” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi, attaching a news article on Singh's statement. Singh responded to the tweet by saying that he is not cowed down by the ED or other cases, and accused Kejriwal of "selling his soul for political purposes". "Just as every Punjabi knows, I am not one to be cowed down by ED or other cases, you Mr @ArvindKejriwal will even sell your soul if it serves your political purposes. If you think farmers are going to be taken in by your dramatics then you are totally mistaken," he tweeted. "Farmers of India and particularly Punjab know that you Mr @ArvindKejriwal have sold off the interest of farmers by notifying one of the draconian farm bills in Delhi on November 23. What pressure did the Centre have on you," Singh said in another tweet. In response, Kejriwal accused Singh of being part of the committee which drafted the three bills that were passed into the laws. "You were part of the committee which drafted these Bills. These Bills are your ‘gift’ to the nation. Captain sahib, why do BJP leaders never accuse you of double standards the way they accuse all other leaders of?," Kejriwal tweeted. In response to this, Singh said these farm laws were not discussed at any meeting. "These farm laws were not discussed at any meeting & your repeated lies will not change that Mr @ArvindKejriwal. And naturally BJP can’t accuse me of double standards as I don’t have any nexus with them like you have. They after all have to cover up their collusion with you!" Singh tweeted. Kejriwal said it is matter of record that Singh's committee drafted these laws "It's a part of record that your committee drafted these laws. You had the power to stop these laws, tell the people of this country that such laws were being contemplated by the centre. Why did u go along with the centre?" Kejriwal tweeted. The three farm laws that were enacted in September have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of minimum support price (MSP) and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kejriwal-amarinder-singh-in-twitter-spat-over-ongoing-farmers-protest-927425.html

In an address at the annual general meeting of industry chamber FICCI, Singh said the "unprovoked aggression" on India's Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing and how existing agreements are being challenged. "They fought the PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) with utmost bravery and forced them to go back. The coming generations of this nation will be proud of what our forces have managed to achieve this year," the defence minister said. Without elaborating, Singh said Indian armed forces have shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude in dealing with the challenge. "The unprovoked aggression on our Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing, how existing agreements are being challenged, how power is being asserted not just in the Himalayas but across the Indo-Pacific," Singh said. "And how uncertain the future of the region and world could be in this backdrop. As you are aware, there is a big build-up of armed forces at the LAC in Ladakh," he said.  In an indirect reference to the farmers' agitation, Singh said there is no question of taking "retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever". "The recent reforms have been undertaken with the best interests of India's farmers in mind. We are, however, always willing to listen to our farmer brothers, allay their misgivings and provide them with assurances we can provide," Singh said. Calling agriculture the mother sector, he said the government is always open to discussion and dialogue to resolve issues.   "Agriculture has been one sector which has been able to avoid the adverse effects of the pandemic and, in fact, come out the best. Our produce and procurement have been plentiful and our warehouses are full.There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/unprovoked-aggression-in-ladakh-reminder-of-how-the-world-is-changing-says-rajnath-singh-927216.html

Following clashes with police, several Samajwadi Party leaders and workers were taken in custody in various districts of Uttar Pradesh. In Lucknow, the SP workers clashed with police in the Kaisarbagh area on being stopped from proceeding to the district collectorate. Several SP workers, including women, were also taken into custody. In Agra too, television footage showed police using mild force to disperse protesting Samajwadi Party workers. SP MLC Rajpal Kashyap claimed from Sandila in Hardoi district that he has been arrested and many other party leaders have been put under house arrest for siding with farmers. "Samajwadi Party supports farmers’ demands. Its sympathy lies with farmers. The ‘kisan yatra’ was started by the SP on December 7. The party workers are holding dharna at all the district headquarters in the state today. I have been arrested in Sandila and many party leaders are under house arrest," Kashyap told PTI. In Gorakhpur too, police detained several SP leaders and workers including district president proceeding to participate in a sit-in at Nagar Nigam office campus. Police began detaining SP workers since morning and arrested party’s Gorakhpur district president Ram Nagina Sahini and former president Ziaul Islam when he was undertaking morning exercise in a school campus. Some SP workers were arrested near the Townhall crossing and some were arrested from Zila Parishad road. "The police and government are snatching our constitutional right to demonstrate peacefully. They are registering fake cases against us and not letting us protest," Sahini said. Gorakhpur’s Senior Superintendent of Police Jogendra Kumar justified arrests on grounds of Covid-19 restrictions . "Section 144 is already imposed in the district. It is not safe to gather at a place without social distancing during a pandemic. They should have first take taken permission for holding demonstrations from the district magistrate," SSP Kumar said. Senior Samajwadi Party Peader and former UP minister Arvind Singh Gope told PTI from Barabanki that houses of all local SP leaders have been turned into police fortresses. "When we wanted to move out, we were not allowed," Gope said. “In a democracy, when people hit roads, dictators have to flee,” he added, exuding confidence that protesting farmers would bring his party back to power in 2022 UP assembly elections and “throw out the dictatorial regime". In Kanpur, hundreds of Samajwadi Party workers sat on a dharna on Bada Chauraha in support of farmers’ agitation. "We were heading to the district collectorate to submit a memorandum addressed to the President on farmers’ issue when we were stopped by a large police posse at Bada Chauraha," said party’s city president, Dr Imran. On being stopped, party leaders, including MLAs Amitabh Bajpayee and Irfan Solanki, decided to sit on dharna at Bada Chauraha, he added. Kanpur's City Magistrate Himanshu Gupta said the protestors were stopped at Bada Chauraha where they sat on dharna. Samajwadi Party workers from Ballia claimed their party leaders along with those of the Congress and other opposition parties were kept under house arrest. In Muzaffarnagar too, several SP and RLD leaders were taken into custody ahead of their proposed protest in support of farmers. Reports of SP workers protests came in from Bahraich and Siddhartha Nagar also. Samajwadi Partry leader Amit Yadav told PTI from Mahoba that at least 30 party workers were taken into custody by the police.

The AAP MLA said that there are some people referring to the agitating farmers, who are the country's food-providers, as "anti-nationals". "I want to tell those people calling the farmers as anti-national that you are the ones who are anti-nationals and you should go to Pakistan. They have no place in India," Chadha said. Reacting to Chadha’s comments, Delhi BJP spokesperson Virender Babbar said that everybody supports farmers, including the BJP. "Chadha should tell what would you call those who talk about killing the prime minister and demand the release of people arrested under sedition charge," Babbar said. Several Union ministers have repeatedly alleged that the farmers’ protests have been hijacked by Maoists, Leftists, and anti-national elements, a charge denied by the farmers' union leaders spearheading the agitation. On Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also expressed his anguish over the issue, saying that some Central ministers and BJP leaders were labeling protesting farmers as "traitors and anti-nationals". "I want to ask them, if so many ex-servicemen, sportspersons of national and international level, singers and celebrities, lawyers and traders supporting and joining the farmers, are all anti-national?" he questioned. The farmers have been camping at several border points of Delhi for close to three weeks now against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September. The three farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.

14-12-2020||North and Central||Hathras: Arrested Kerala scribe associated with PFI, Uttar Pradesh govt tells SC||The Uttar Pradesh government has claimed before the Supreme Court that Kerala journalist Sidhique Kappan, arrested on October 5 while on way to Hathras, has been found associated with the Popular Front of India (PFI), which is a "reincarnation" of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). "Kappan is closely associated with and has been in frequent connection through social media platforms and telephonic conversations with PFI members holding various portfolio across the country namely P Koya, Abdul Mukeet, Saleem, Md Faizal, and Gulfam Hasan, most of whom have been executive members of banned terrorist organisation SIMI," the state government said. It alleged that the investigation to date revealed that most members of the PFI were ex-office bearers of the banned SIMI organisation, and they have been in close contact with Kappan. The documents recovered during the investigation disclosed that the motive and ideology of both the organisations PFI and SIMI are corroborative in nature, it claimed. The state government also alleged that the present habeas corpus petition by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists, New Delhi, was a proxy litigation on behalf of the organisations for which Kappan was working. It also pointed out the petitioner-organisation, to which Kappan was secretary, itself was facing vigilance probe for embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds on the direction of Kerala HC in a PIL.  Opposing the bail application, the state government claimed if it was allowed at this stage, it would interfere with the investigation and allow the accused to indulge in similar activities and make himself unavailable to the investigating agency. On Monday, a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde put the petition for consideration in January to enable the petitioner to file its rejoinder. In an additional affidavit, the state government also alleged Kappan and other three co-accused were "involved in questionable financial transactions" such as co-accused Masood was being funded from PFI, the other co-accused Atiqur Rehman was being funded from Rauf Sherief from Campus Front of India, "who have received crores of funds from various national and international suspicious sources". On Saturday, the ED detained arrested Sherief at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram International airport.  The UP government also claimed Kappan and other co-accused were in touch with Delhi riots case accused Md Danish and Sherief and were heading towards Hathras in a pre-planned manner to execute unlawful activities and disrupt public peace by provoking caste and class conflict, after a 19-year-old SC girl had died, succumbing to injuries due to alleged gang rape. It also said Kappan worked for the newspaper 'Tejas', closed in December 2018, was an acclaimed mouthpiece for the PFI. The newspapers' views were so extreme that it called terrorist Osama Bin Laden a martyr.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-arrested-kerala-scribe-associated-with-pfi-uttar-pradesh-govt-tells-sc-927364.html
14-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers 'apologise' to people with 'folded hands' for road blockade, inconvenience||With some key roads blocked for several days now due to their protest against the three new agri laws, an umbrella body of farmers Monday apologised with "folded hands" to people for the inconvenience caused to them, but said they were carrying out the demonstration "out of compulsion". Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is spearheading the protests at Delhi border points, distributed handbills in Hindi to commuters on the Jaipur-Delhi Highway near Haryana-Rajasthan borders, where hundreds of farmers have been camping for almost past three weeks now, to convey their apology, and also reiterate their demand for legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP). "Blocking roads, causing inconvenience to the public is not our aim," read their pamphlets. "We are sitting here under a compulsion. Yet we apologise with folded hands if our agitation has caused you any inconvenience." Farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur border points for over 17 days now, leading to traffic jams on key roads connecting the national capital with Haryana and Punjab. The Morcha also said that any elderly person, patient or ambulance stuck due to the blocked roads may contact the volunteers, who will immediately provide help. The Morcha also asserted in the pamphlets that the farmers do not want any "charity", but a fair price for their crops. They said they wanted to enter Delhi with this demand, and present their view to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "We are farmers. People also call us Anndata (food-providers). The prime minister of the country says he has brought us the historic gift of three laws. We say this is not a gift but a punishment. "Please keep your gift with yourself. If you want to give us a gift, there should be a legal guarantee of fair price of our crops," read the pamphlets, distributed among people. The farmers also accused the Centre of "pretending" to be talking to them but not listening to their grievances. The pamphlet signed off with "I am a farmer". Leaders of around 32 farmer unions observed a day-long hunger strike at Delhi's Singhu border earlier on the day to protest against the Centre's new farm laws. The unions claimed that demonstrations were also held at various district headquarters across the country. The unions have claimed that more people are expected to join the ongoing agitation. Hundreds of farmers have been camping at the Haryana-Rajasthan border as they were stopped from moving towards the national capital. Several borders of the national capital remained closed on Monday due to the ongoing protest by farmers. Protesting farmers at Delhi border points have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-apologise-to-people-with-folded-hands-for-road-blockade-inconvenience-927398.html

The girl, about 15 years old, was allegedly raped by two persons of her village on Sunday evening, Station House Officer (SHO), Pahadi, Shravan Kumar Singh said. When the accused saw her uncle coming, they left the girl in a field and threatened her of dire consequences if she told anyone about the incident, he said. The SHO said that of the two involved in rape one is about 16 years old while the other is 19 years old. Police are probing the matter. The accused are absconding, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/teen-girl-raped-in-uttar-pradeshs-chitrakoot-district-927427.html
14-12-2020||North and Central||SC chides UP cops over clean chit to BJP MLA Sushil Singh in BSP leader Ram Bihari Chaubey's murder case||The Supreme Court on Monday castigated the Uttar Pradesh police for giving a clean chit to BJP MLA Sushil Singh in the murder investigation of BSP leader Ram Bihari Chaubey in 2015 in Varanasi, saying the investigation and the closure report were "extremely casual and perfunctory in nature". A three-judge bench presided over by Justice R F Nariman set aside the closure report filed by the police, after pointing out the investigation appears to be a sham, designed to conceal more than to investigate.  The court appointed senior IPS officer Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, to carry out further investigation in the matter through a team of competent officers to be selected by him. The apex court decided to supervise the matter after giving two months to complete the probe. Acting on a petition filed by Amar Nath Chaubey, son of the deceased leader, the court noted that eight investigating officers were changed and an investigation, which had been kept pending since the lodging of FIR on December 4, 2015, was promptly closed on January 30, 2019. The court pulled up the police also for saying the petitioner had failed to provide any concrete evidence of a conspiracy against the MLA. “The police have the primary duty to investigate on receiving a report of the commission of a cognizable offence. This is a statutory duty under the Code of Criminal Procedure, apart from being a constitutional obligation to ensure that peace is maintained in the society and the rule of law is upheld and applied. To say that further investigation was not possible as the informant had not supplied adequate materials to investigate, to our mind, is a preposterous statement,” the court said. Maintaining that a fair investigation is, but a necessary concomitant of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, the bench said the court cannot abdicate its duties if it is found that the police have not investigated properly or apparently were remiss in the investigation, which, though was their exclusive privilege and prerogative.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-chides-up-cops-over-clean-chit-to-bjp-mla-sushil-singh-in-bsp-leader-ram-bihari-chaubeys-murder-case-927431.html
14-12-2020||North and Central||Congress leader Kamal Nath says 'ready to rest'; sparks retirement talks||Veteran Congress leader Kamal Nath has said he was "ready to rest" and not hankering for any post, setting off speculation that he is hinting at possible retirement from active politics. Nath's comments, made at a party event on Sunday, came over a month after the Congress won just 9 out of the 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh where bypolls were held in early November. Making amends in his statement, the former chief minister (74), who had just 15-month-long stint in the CMO, on Monday said the day the people of Chhindwara, his native district and constituency, wish that he should retire from active politics, he call it quits. I am ready to rest. I have spent a lot of time (in politics). I dont hanker for any post or position. I had enough. "What I got nobody achieved, the MP Congress president said at a meeting of party workers at Sausar near here on Sunday. On Monday, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly said, The day, the people of Chhindwara wish that I should retire from politics, I will call it quits." The former Union minister was speaking to reporters at Amarwada in Chhindwara from where he had elected to the Lok Sabha nine times. Many in the Congress saw his "retirement" statement as mere posturing, saying he is facing resistance to his leadership by a section in his party. On Sunday, Congress MLA from Sheopur Babulal Jandel said he holds Nath responsible for the party's poor performance in the by-elections to 28 assembly seats. Nath had spearheaded the campaign for the bypolls in which the Congress won only nine seats, while the rest 19 were bagged by the ruling BJP. Nath had to step down as Chief Minister in March following a rebellion by a section of party MLAs and ministers. Twenty-two Congress MLAs, mostly of them Jyotiraditya Scindias associates, had resigned, reducing the Nath government to a minority and paving the way for the BJP to come to power. Scindia joined the BJP in March and is now a Rajya Sabha member.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-leader-kamal-nath-says-ready-to-rest-sparks-retirement-talks-927432.html

14-12-2020||Oasis||Using vs loving||Many months ago, I had read this mind-stirring story, which makes my mood go all mushy and melancholic even now, on recalling. It seems, a man, who’d have procured a plush car, by paying a prodigious amount, would be perpetually taking profound care of his prized possession. Once, when he’d be scrupulously cleaning his swanky vehicle, his six-year-old son, suddenly sprints in, and surreptitiously starts scribbling something, on the car’s side-surface, using a sharp stone. The instant the man sees his son’s impish prank, he gets inundated by ire and indignation. Then taking a wrench, he starts whacking on his ward’s right-hand wrist till the latter, writhing in pain, starts wailing loudly. Deeply regretting his ruthless action, he rushes the child to a nearby hospital, only to realize he’d have caused irrevocable damage to the child’s fingers, which were irretrievable. The man feels his soul, splintering to smithereens, when his son softly asks him, “Dad, will my fingers grow back”? On returning home, he collapses and cries hysterically, as he casts his eyes on what the child had carved on the car-surface. Lo! It’d be – “Love you Dad!” He painfully realises how all his priorities and perspectives in life were palpably misplaced. When ‘things’ are meant to be ‘used’, and ‘people’ are to be ‘loved’; he was busy ‘loving’ lifeless things, and ‘using’ living humans, to his personal gain.  Incidentally, there are many of us, looking for that ‘utility value’ in our relations with people. On meeting someone, the first thought would be, “How beneficial is this one to us?” But, our materialistic things, like say, our house, vehicle, apparels, etc, etc, – which have nothing, but mere ‘utility value’ – we try loving those to a ludicrous extent. We amass wealth, instead of amassing blessings from others.             Apparently, instead of bonding with others, we are battering our brain in busily buying a barrage of vanity-hiking things. Besides, expending a reservoir of time and energy, in maintaining our already-bought possessions! Maybe, it’s time we realised, in process of gaining something trivial, we don’t start losing something vital!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/using-vs-loving-927115.html
14-12-2020||Opinion||Trump has never believed in democracy||By Charles M. Blow Donald Trump’s continued effort to overturn the result of the election — an effort buttressed by the support of many Republicans in Congress, it should be noted — is nothing short of an attempt at a bloodless coup. The only way Trump could achieve his aim of denying Joe Biden his rightfully earned victory would be if some people or entities — state legislatures, judges or the Supreme Court — were to agree to throw out millions of legally cast and appropriate votes. (It is also worth noting that many of the jurisdictions being disputed are heavily Black.) But a stinging defeat in the Supreme Court, packed with three justices of Trump’s own choosing, seems to have slammed the door on any legal path Trump might have had in his outrageous endeavour. The members of the Electoral College will meet on Monday and choose the next president. Barring any extraordinary and unprecedented developments, they will select Joe Biden, as the people already have. And yet, on Saturday Trump continued to insist on Twitter that “I WON THE ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE,” and that the Supreme Court ruling was incorrect: “This is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced. Never even given our day in Court!” That same day, Trump flew over a “Stop the Steal” rally at Washington’s Freedom Plaza, where the Proud Boys were a prominent presence. He keeps lying to his supporters, telling them — partly out of pride, partly out of a craven quest for power — that he was cheated and that he actually won the election. Many of them believe him. Right-wing media have aided him in his deception, as have Republican officials, either through their public pronouncements or through their silence. On Sunday, the House minority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, appeared on "Fox News Sunday" and said: “If you want to restore trust by millions of people who are still very frustrated and angry about what happened, that’s why you got to have this whole system play out.” But of course this isn’t about restoring faith in our elections; rather, it is about allowing Trump to further degrade that faith. Scalise and many other Republicans are accomplices in this crime against our democracy. Trump is still trying to steal this election, and they are outside revving the engine of the getaway car. That a majority of all Republicans in the House of Representatives expressed support for the frivolous Texas lawsuit signals to me that the difference between liberals and conservatives is no longer about values; it is now about a fundamental belief in democracy. Republicans appear to be saying that not all votes matter or should be counted. This is voter suppression on the grandest of scales, because it is an attempt at voter erasure, at eliminating votes that have already been cast and counted. All the while, Trump has continued to use the division and deception he has created to raise money. He has now collected more than $200 million in donations in support of his bogus election recounts. But, as The New York Times reported earlier this month: “Trump’s campaign apparatus has continued to aggressively solicit donations under the guise of supporting his various legal challenges to the election of Joe Biden, but as of now 75% of donations goes to a new political action committee that Trump formed in mid-November, up to the PAC’s legal limit of $5,000. The other 25% goes to the Republican National Committee. Only if a donor gives more than $6,000 do any funds go to Trump’s formal ‘recount’ account.” Trump has realized that trying to steal the presidency is more lucrative than actually being president, so he won’t stop. We are witnessing one of the greatest grifts in the history of the presidency. The presidency gave Trump something he always craved but never possessed: constant attention and real, legitimate power. And, once tasted, power is craved forever. Trump has never believed in American democracy. He was never a student of history. He was never really a patriot. When he foreshadowed his current behavior in 2016 by refusing to say that he would accept the results of that election as legitimate if he didn’t win, we knew. When he cozied up to the world’s dictators and spurned our allies, we knew. When he winked at hate groups by refusing to immediately and fulsomely condemn them, we knew. Trump wants to operate a dictatorship behind a veil of democracy. He wants to wield power without winning it legitimately. He wants to manipulate his mob and prioritize it above the masses who oppose him. Yes, Trump is attempting a coup, whether or not you want to call it that. But, no matter what you choose to call something, it will still be what it is.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/trump-has-never-believed-in-democracy-927180.html
14-12-2020||Opinion||Is India really closer to achieving sanitation goals?||While the whole world is grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, there is another public health issue which needs to be addressed with equal rigour and that is of sanitation. The WHO, in collaboration with UNICEF, released a report in November, on the state of the world’s sanitation and it paints a grim picture. While the global progress towards achieving sanitation-related sustainable development goals has been rather slow, the report states that India is one of the thirty countries that is on its way to meeting the targets. Last year, on October 2, India was declared open defecation free (ODF). India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission in October 2014 to eliminate open defecation in rural areas through behavioural change, construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring the progress. For a village to be declared ODF, no visible faeces should be found in the surroundings and every household, as well as public/community institutions, must use the safe technology option for disposal of faeces. Persisting problems Many have criticised the mechanisms developed for declaring a village ODF. Gram panchayats are responsible for self-declaring the villages ODF and the state governments are responsible for verifying that status. It is up to the state governments whether to involve independent agencies or not. With no compulsion for independent verification, the integrity of the process might be undermined. The focus for declaring villages ODF seems to be on the construction of the toilets but not on its actual usage. Behavioural factors also need to be considered, especially when it comes to matters of sanitation and hygiene. Universal access to sanitation has implications not only for the health of populations but also for the economy. The WHO report, in its case study on India, states that the economic cost of poor sanitation, in the fiscal year 2018-19, was estimated to be 3.87 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA). This was in contrast to 9.7 per cent of GVA if the sanitation coverage would have been the same as in 2013-14. The health benefits of sanitation are very obvious with diseases like worm infections, diarrhoea, cholera being prevented, which affect children the most. Sanitation can also reduce gender disparity in education. Many girls, especially in rural villages, have to drop out of schools due to the lack of toilets in the vicinity.  Road ahead The political will that has been shown by India through Swachch Bharat Abhiyan is something that will be needed in the long run. However, that has to be coupled with transparency and accountability. Behavioural change has to be pursued with rigour, because people in India have been practising open defecation since years and getting them to use toilets will not be as easy as it seems. There have been reports about newly constructed toilets being used as storerooms or not being used due to lack of consistent water supply. A rounded approach which takes into consideration the aspects of health, society, and economy is needed to achieve universal access to sanitation truly.

14-12-2020||Panorama||Prompt govt response needed to alter shape of recovery||Since the onset of the pandemic, there have been incessant discussions over India’s shape of recovery. From the rapid and optimistic V to the sharp and pessimistic W, conversation on how we will come out of the pandemic has not ceased. Lately, however, there has been a growing consensus that India is witnessing a multi-speed recovery, with different sectors of the economy growing at different paces. The issue, however, is that this multi-speed recovery hinges on another shape – ‘K’, which could lead to exacerbated inequality in an already unequal India.  The government has been insistent on the V-shaped recovery argument, which is essentially a steep decline in the economic activity and employment, followed by a sharp rise. In Indian context, this rise can be viewed in terms of increasing demand and business activity with lifting of the lockdown. However, it only provides a myopic view of the bigger picture that illustrates an uneven economic impact of the pandemic on industries as well as workers.  This bifurcation has been reflected in the K-shaped recovery, wherein the economy experiences a fall in growth, followed by a split in recovery, where one section of the economy prospers while the other continues to suffer.  Indian economy has shown a significant improvement with 7.5% contraction in Q2 2020-21 as compared an unprecedented 23.9% year-on-year contraction witnessed in the previous quarter. However, the improvement does not necessarily imply that the recovery path is alike for both formal and informal sectors as the latter is not completely captured in the GDP calculations.  Overall, while the formal sector has recovered relatively steadily, the informal sector has been severely impacted by the pandemic. The stark contrast is exemplified in the plight of blue-collar workers who had to migrate on foot in peak lockdown while white-collar workers could work from the comforts of their homes. Additionally, a study by Ashwini Deshpande and Rajesh Ramachandran indicated that daily wage workers’ rate of job loss was nine times higher post-lockdown as compared to the pre-lockdown phase. Besides, the impact even within the formal sector exhibits great discrepancy. For instance, while e-commerce sector registered a 17% growth between February and June 2020, India’s hospitality sector declined by 43.5% in terms of revenue per available room in April-October period of 2020 over 2019.  Similarly, while fintech companies remain hopeful about their growth, given the structural shift in consumer behaviour towards online solutions, aviation sector continues to function far below its pre-Covid levels due to the cap on operational capacity as well as reluctance of travellers due to potential risks. Thus, while sectors like pharmaceutical, technology, e-retail and software services have fared well during the pandemic, sectors such as tourism, transport, hospitality, entertainment and the like still face the brunt of it.  The bifurcation is also visible in labour unemployment across formal and informal sectors. Although India faced unprecedented levels of job loss during lockdown, unemployment levels have now returned to the pre-lockdown phase. However, India’s recovery in employment has not been equal for all, with vulnerable sections being left behind. Besides, marginalised sections are majorly employed in the informal sector which leaves them even more vulnerable to economic downturns like the current crisis.  The study by Deshpande and Ramachandran estimated that the rate of job losses among Scheduled Castes, after the lockdown, was three times higher as compared to the upper castes. Another study by Deshpande reported that women employed during pre-lockdown were 23.5 percentage points less likely to be employed post-lockdown as compared to men employed before the lockdown.  IMF warning An International Monetary Fund report warned that the current crisis could follow the path of previous pandemics and lead to higher income inequality and unemployment for people with basic education qualifications while barely impacting employment prospects of people with higher education.  A joint report by Asian Development Bank and International Labour Organisation suggests that youth (15-24 years) will face a severe immediate and long-term economic and social blow as compared to adults (25 years and older) due to the pandemic with estimated job losses of 4.1 million among youth. Hence, in a deeply unequal India, an uneven recovery post-lockdown is exemplifying existing inequalities. While economically and socially better off sectors are experiencing a stable growth, the sectors comprising of marginalised workers and households are undergoing a battle for survival. Although the government did provide a timely fiscal stimulus for revival, it has largely proven to be inadequate as compared to other countries.  India fares amongst the bottom five and way below the average fiscal stimulus undertaken by the Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies (EMIMEs) as a whole.  In the long run, this pattern of growth could be highly detrimental to India which highlights the GDP losses to various Advanced and Emerging Market Economies in 2025 as compared to GDP projections made pre-pandemic. India stands to lose almost 12% of its GDP as compared to pre-pandemic projections – the second worst amongst the selected countries, given its unbalanced recovery.  However, evidence suggests that given the right mixture of monetary and fiscal policies, extreme economic downturns like the Great Recession, have successfully transitioned the shape of recovery from K to V. Similarly, India could also adopt policies that target the affected sectors, enabling their speedy revival and paving the way for a balanced growth story. The recovery of the better-off section often tends to dominate the misery of the weaker section, as has been the case with the current crisis. Instead of turning a blind eye towards the multi-speed recovery, there is a need to put concerted efforts towards ensuring an inclusive one. The need of the hour, thus, is a prompt government response to alter India’s shape of recovery.

14-12-2020||Panorama||Off the record: December 14, 2020||Potential embarrasment  A one-time close aide of Rahul Gandhi is set to release a ‘fictional’ film called ‘Love You Pappu’, which at least through the teasers available online, could leave the Congress squirming. Pankaj Shankar, a former consulting editor of Doordarshan, maintains that the film has nothing to do with the Gandhi scion, but the teasers have glaring similarities between the functioning of the Congress and the protagonist of the film. One video clip shows Mahatma Gandhi at Tughlaq Lane to meet Yuvraj, the protagonist, after getting an appointment, only to be told off by his aide. The second video clip takes a swipe at Rahul over the recent letter written by 23 leaders to Congress President. Politics of vengeance! Barely a month before the election for Mehsana Dudhsagar dairy, the Gujarat police arrested former home minister and former chairman of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Market Federation (GCMMF), Vipul Chaudary. GCMMF is the body that markets its products under the ‘Amul’ brand. Chaudhary faces dozens of cases including several scams while he headed the federation. However, even his critics say that his arrest before the important poll is an act of vengeance as the BJP is afraid of losing the polls. It is believed that BJP is suspecting that panels supported by Chaudhary would win and therefore, the arrest was made in an old case in an act of desperation.   Spilling the beans  Former President Pranab Mukherjee’s fourth and final volume of autobiography ‘The Presidential Years: 2012-2017’ is to hit stands next month. With the publisher Rupa Publications releasing excerpts that talks about Mukherjee’s views of the Congress’ defeat in 2014 Lok Sabha polls, a lot of interest has been generated on what else he has said about the High Command. Much before Mukherjee’s book is hitting stands, another one by Sanjay Jha, a former Congress spokesperson who fell foul with the leadership after raising questions about the way the party is heading, is hitting stands later this month. ‘The Great Unravelling: India After 2014’ takes a “long, hard look at the state of the nation today, especially Congress’ acute lack of oppositional ability”, says the publisher Westland. The book seeks to ask and answer the question--can the party look beyond the easy fallback of the Gandhi family charisma and embrace transformational change. Now readers are waiting for Jha spilling the beans. Pawar’s word One of India’s seniormost politicians Sharad Pawar is known to be workaholic but he never ignores his family. This was his message to his followers and Gen-Next politician – as he turned 80 last week. “The need of the hour is to remain alert and aware while doing social work. When you take care of the needs of the last person in the society, you learn a lot on having clarity and direction of the road ahead…but at the same time it is necessary that you take care of your family also,” said Pawar. “My parents (Shardabai Pawar and Govindrao Pawar) taught me not to neglect family responsibilities while doing social and political work,” said the politician, who has never lost an election in any law-making body in over five decades. Pain in the neck A second member of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s personal staff is now under ED scanner in connection with the probe against Kerala gold smuggling case accused. C M Raveendran, additional private secretary to the CM, has skipped ED quizzing for the third time last week. While he skipped the first two rounds of ED quizzing by citing Covid, this time he seems to have cited ailments in the neck. It could be a coincidence that CM’s former principal secretary M Sivasankar had earlier tried to delay his arrest citing disc prolapse. This coincidence occurred amidst the opposition raising suspicions over Raveendran’s illness.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/off-the-record-december-14-2020-927114.html
14-12-2020||Right in the Middle||A 'tree'bute||There are men and women who love animals especially cats and dogs but there are not many tree lovers. My late grandfather loved trees passionately. The love he had for trees did not die when he died. It was transferred to me. I fell in love with dozens of trees. Of these, some stood behind or in front of houses we occupied, and some were by the houses of our relatives and some I came across in public places like parks, railway and police stations. While travelling via train, one can see wonderful specimens of peepal, banyan and neem trees in way stations as they stand breeze-fully behind benches. I remember many such trees between Chennai and Mathura stations. Surprisingly, you can find beautiful trees on the premises of police stations. The one place where trees are loved and revered is the state of Kerala. The people of this state never cut a tree to make way for construction. They build their houses around it. People experience first love, second third and so on. In my relationships with trees, I too have my first love second love third love and many more. The tree I fell for first, was a guava tree that grew in my aunt's house. It was a tree that showered fruits on our heads. While going to and returning from school, I always stopped at my aunt's house to taste a few of its fruits. It was a motherly tree that fed innumerable parrots and squirrels. One fateful day as I was, as usual, passing my aunt's house I saw two dark bare-chested men standing near my tree and in their hands were axes and saws. A fear gripped my heart. I ran inside and asked my aunt “What’s going on Aunty? Are they going to cut my guava tree?” ”I am sorry dear. Its house owner's decision. He wants to build a shed for the car he is going to buy shortly," she said.  I was inconsolable. The poor guava tree appeared to stand frozen with fear. Not a leaf of it stirred.  I never hated fellow human beings as I hated them then. I was continuously thinking of my guava tree in the class. When I returned to my Aunt’s house from school in the evening what I saw where my beloved guava tree stood all these days throbbing with life were its branches and trunk cut into pieces and stacked. The ground strewn with twigs leaves and trampled fruits looked like a battlefield. Even now after so many years that guava tree appears in my dream with all its fruits, parrots and squirrels.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-treebute-927120.html
14-12-2020||Second Edit||Right decision on transgender people||The Central government’s announcement regarding inclusion of ‘transgender’ as a separate gender in the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) Prison Statistics Report is a step in the right direction. The decision came in response to a Delhi High Court order to the NCRB to classify transgenders as a separate category in their annual publication of prison statistics. Hitherto, the NCRB report classified prison statistics in terms of just two genders, although it did include the third gender with regard to information on crimes and accidental deaths and suicides. The decision to include separate transgender category for prison statistics will correct this anomaly and make prison data more inclusive and representative.  It will require prison authorities to assign an appropriate sex to inmates. It is another step towards recognising and guaranteeing the civil, constitutional and basic human rights of transgenders. It is well known that transgender people are among the most discriminated sections in our society. They are subjected to ridicule, humiliation and even violence, including brutal sexual and other assaults. Those in prison suffer even more. When transgender persons are brought to the jail, the chief medical officer classifies them based on their genitals. This is contrary to a 2014 Supreme Court judgement which said that a person’s gender is determined by the person concerned. Just a few states provide separate cells for transgenders. In most states in India, they are not provided with separate cells or toilets. These are grave violations of their privacy, dignity and even security as often they are subjected to sexual assaults not just by other inmates but prison officials too. By requiring the NCRB to provide separate data for the transgender category, the Delhi High Court has pushed for change in the way transgender prisoners are treated in prisons. The court has forced the government to take the first step: to record their identity as transgenders. The government must follow up to provide separate living quarters and other facilities for transgender inmates. While it is important to count transgender prisoners as a separate category to ensure them their rights, it is necessary to ensure that collection of this data is not misused to target or harass them. It is therefore essential that prison officials are provided with training to approach issues with sensitivity. Transgender prisoners should feel secure that their self-identification as transgender will not lead to their humiliation or targeting. Forcing them to come out and then not providing them with security will be a grave violation of their rights.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/right-decision-on-transgender-people-927118.html
14-12-2020||South||Brisk polling in third phase of local body polls in Kerala||After high voter turnouts in the first two phases, Kerala on Monday witnessed brisk polling in the initial hours of the third and final phase of the local body polls which got underway in four northern districts. Long queues of voters could be seen in many wards in Kozhikode, Malappuram, Kannur and Kasaragod districts since the polling began at 7 AM. Among the early voters were Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Industries Minister E P Jayarajan, senior CPI(M) leader and Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, Congress leader and former minister, Aryadan Mohammed, IUML state president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal and PK Kunhalikutty, MP. The Chief Minister cast his vote at a polling booth in Junior Basic School in Kannur district. Vijayan later expressed confidence about the impressive victory of the ruling Left Democratic Front in the crucial local body polls, which is considered a curtain-raiser for the Assembly elections due next year. "The Left front is going to achieve an iconic victory in the polls. Those, who have voted so far, have given us great support," Vijayan told reporters in Kannur. A total of 25.09 per cent voting was registered in the four district at 10 AM, according to official update. A total of 89,74,993 voters including 46,87,310 women and 86 transgenders were in the electoral roll in these districts to elect representatives in 6,867 wards in 354 local bodies including two Corporations and 31 municipalities. Among the total 10,842 polling stations, 1,105 were identified as sensitive and webcasting facility and special security arrangements were introduced there, State Election Commission (SEC) officials here said. The election has been postponed in two wards- Thillankery ward in Kannur district panchayat and Thathoor division in Mavoor Panchayat of Kozhikode-due to the death of candidates.

Officials say students assembling at the mess for  their meals could likely be the reason for the emergence of the cluster, adding that samples of all of them are being taken. Of the 444 persons who have already been tested, 104 students, research scholars, and staff have tested positive for Covid-19. All of them have been shifted to the King’s Institute, an exclusive Covid-19 facility managed by the government, officials said. “71 persons had tested positive till Sunday, and samples of 33 more persons have rendered positive on Monday. All students are being tested. We are monitoring the situation and there is no need to panic,” Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan told reporters. He also asked institutions that have reopened to take necessary precautionary measures to prevent the Covid-19 spread. Radhakrishnan also said since the IIT-M hostel mess is said to be the reason behind the spread, measures have been taken to deliver food to students at their hostel rooms. The emergence of the cluster comes a week after higher education institutes in Tamil Nadu reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown. In a statement, IIT-M said the Institute has been functioning on limited capacity with only 10% students in the hostels. “As soon as a spurt in symptomatic cases was reported by some students residing in the hostels, the Institute has consulted the civic authorities and has arranged for all students residing in hostels to be tested for Covid. To be cautious, all students have been asked to remain in their rooms and packed food is being supplied to the students in the hostels,” it said in a statement. IIT Madras has been permitting research scholars who need to do experimental work to return to campus in a cautious manner with a 14-day quarantine and testing of each returnee. “An SoP is in place to determine how many scholars and project staff can work safely in each lab based on its size, ventilation etc.  Research scholars who wished to return earlier were permitted to do so as long as they were willing to stay off campus, like the project staff, till their turn came to be accepted in the hostels, and provided their lab could accommodate them,” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/iit-madras-emerges-covid-19-cluster-over-100-students-staff-test-positive-927229.html
14-12-2020||South||SC notice to Centre, Kerala on plea against forced confessions in Malankara churches||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the Centre and Kerala government on a plea against mandatory confessions in Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, saying pernicious practice was leading to several problems including sexual exploitation of women and blackmailing. A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde sought a response from Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Kottayam on a PIL filed by Mathew T Mathachan and two others. The petitioners claimed there has been a spate of incidents which have exposed the sexual exploitation of women, including nuns themselves, as is evident from reports against Bishop Franco and Bishop Johnson P Matthew. Terming the reports the tip of the iceberg, they said, "priests turning into predators is fast becoming an accepted social norm that is almost impossible for the victims to overcome". When confessions become the platform or medium through which rapes and sexual exploitation are carried out by predator priests, there is no reliable safety mechanism for the victims who are physically and mentally scarred for life, they said. The petitioners, themselves members of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, asked the court declare the practice of forced and mandatory confessions and payment of money for retaining membership in Parish Churches as violative of basic human rights and dignity and fundamental rights to life, privacy and practice one's religion under the Constitution. The petitioners contended that the top court in a judgement in K S Varghese case in 2017 had held the 1934 Constitution of Malankara Association was binding upon the Parish Churches. However, the practice these Parish Churches were indulging in were of public nature that affected human dignity and liberty of thoughts. They said since the top court by a subsequent order on September 6, 2019 restrained any other court to pass any order against the mandate in the Varghese case, they could not raise their grievances before any other fora except the Supreme Court. They claimed mandatory requirement of confessions and keeping such a register as per 1934 Constitution has "turned into a tool for exploiting men and women parishioners by the Vicars and priests of the respective churches". "The compulsion to confess is a serious intrusion into the right to privacy of a person as held by the nine-judge bench in the K S Puttaswamy case (2017)," they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-notice-to-centre-kerala-on-plea-against-forced-confessions-in-malankara-churches-927239.html
14-12-2020||South||Free Covid-19 vaccine announcement not in violation of poll code: Vijayan||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday dismissed the opposition allegation of poll code breach, saying the free Covid-19 vaccine announced by him was part of the treatment for the infection already being given without any charges in the state and he has not committed any violation. He was responding to the charge by the UDF and the BJP which petitioned the State Election Commission on Sunday a day ahead of the final phase of local body polls in Kerala, contending that the chief minister's remarks that the vaccine would be given free of cost violated the model code of conduct. After casting his vote in Kannur district, Vijayan asserted that the Left front was going to achieve an "iconic victory" in the local body polls, seen as a curtain-raiser ahead of the state assembly elections due in April-May, 2021. "We have been providing free treatment for Covid-19 and preventive medicine is part of that treatment. We made it clear that it will be provided free of cost. There is no violation of any model code of conduct," the Chief Minister told reporters. He added, "It's something which is going on in this state and I have not violated any code of conduct." Vijayan claimed the Congress-led UDF will face a major backlash in the civic polls and IUML, the second major partner of the opposition combine, would lose its base in the state. The ruling CPI(M)-led LDF had on Sunday dismissed the opposition charge as 'childish' and had said that Vijayan was only answering a question from reporters and also that its manifesto included the free vaccine assurance. Vijayan had on Saturday said Covid-19 vaccine will be made available free of cost to all people in Kerala." No one will be charged for the vaccine. This is the stand of the government," he had said here. Elections to the local bodies in the state are being held in three phases with voting underway in four northern districts on Monday in the final phase. The first and second phases were held on December 8 and 10 respectively. Counting of votes polled in the elections, being held months ahead of the assembly polls likely in April-May 2021, would be on December 16. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M M Hassan had said that the front moved the SEC as the Chief Minister's announcement was a violation of the model code in view of the local body elections. Union Minister of State and BJP leader V Muraleedharan had claimed that desperation was "driving the Communists in Kerala", adding the announcement undermined the sanctity of the election process. Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in the country and the Centre has last week said there was the hope of an early licence for one or more with three of them being under the active consideration of the drug regulator.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/free-covid-19-vaccine-announcement-not-in-violation-of-poll-code-vijayan-927248.html

Yusuf, 62, a native of Chengamanad in the suburbs of Eranakulam district did the inhumane act towards his pet, a female local breed aged around five, on Friday. The reason was the dislike of his family towards the pet. With the video of cruelty triggering strong resentment, the police swiftly nabbed him and initiated legal action. Expressing his pain over the cruelty toward the dog, Chennithala shared the story of his pet Scooby, a Labrador, on social media, which has gone viral. His younger son Ramit brought the puppy to their house about two and a half years back. It got acquainted with all the family members very soon. It was after some time that they noticed that Scooby was visually impaired as it often stops by ramming into the legs of others. Though they were deeply pained by that, it only made their love and affection towards Scooby more intense. Scooby is also overcoming its blindness with its sharp nose and ears, says Ramesh. Ramesh winds up his post with an appeal not to hurt pets. Dogs used to love its master more than it loves its own body. It will return double the love that its masters give it. This world is not only for human beings but for pets as well. Meanwhile, the dog that suffered cruelty is now recovering at an animal shelter. BJP leader and People for Animal chairperson Maneka Gandhi also urged the police to take stringent action against the accused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-congress-leaders-love-towards-blind-pet-goes-viral-927357.html

However, the actor refused to part with information on the constituency from where he would test the electoral waters. The announcement by Kamal Haasan is significant since he did not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the MNM scored over 3.5 per cent votes in its debut polls. The actor, who launched MNM in 2018, projects his party as an alternative to the Dravidian majors DMK and AIADMK that have ruled the state alternatively since 1967. “I will definitely contest the (assembly) elections. It will not be right to name the constituency now,” Kamal Haasan said in Usilampatti as he continued his campaign in Southern Tamil Nadu for the second straight day. Kamal Haasan is the Chief Ministerial candidate of the MNM, which is trying to stitch an alliance to face the polls. The actor reiterated that “honesty” was his only promise to the people to get his party elected to power. The actor also asked people to vote out the two major parties and pave the way for youngsters to administer Tamil Nadu. He also took a dig at deputy chief minister and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam for his comments that five-year rule should be equally split between a man and a woman as Chief Minister. “Those who advocate such an idea should remember that their party does not have a single woman as district secretary. If MNM comes to power, the government will have at least 20 women in the cabinet,” Kamal Haasan said. He also asked people to get ready to embrace “political change” while promising to deliver governance at the doorsteps of the people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-to-contest-in-2021-tamil-nadu-assembly-polls-will-announce-constituency-later-927362.html
14-12-2020||South||All parties express high hopes for Kerala local body polls||Widespread clashes marked the third and final phase of elections to local bodies in Kerala on Monday. With the counting scheduled for Wednesday, all the major political party leaders are expressing confidence of a positive outcome for themselves. Since the Assembly polls are hardly five months away, the local body polls are considered as a trendsetter. Polling was held to 21,865 wards in 1,199 local bodies in the three-phase polls. As the local body election happened amid a series of allegations against the ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF), especially with regard to nexus with gold smuggling accused, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the election outcome would prove that the people were rejecting the series of lies being spread against his government. The Congress-led United Democratic Front is expecting a cakewalk in the local body polls as well as the ensuing Assembly polls taking advantage of anti-incumbency factor against the government. Kerala PCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said that people would vote against the opportunistic politics of Pinarayi Vijayan government. BJP state president K Surendran said that the people's resentment towards the Congress and CPM-led fronts ruling the state in recent years would reflect in favour of the BJP-led NDA in the polls. The last phase of polling held at Kasargod, Kannur, Kozhikode and Malappuram districts witnessed clashes between political activists at various places. At Nadapuram in Kannur, the police were forced to use grenades to disperse mobs. Some police personnel were injured. CPM and Welfare Party activists clashed in the district causing minor injuries to some activists. Country bombs were also recovered from some parts of Kannur. Alleged attempts to cast bogus votes were also reported. The polling was over 78% till evening. But at many polling booths, the polling extended for several hours after 6 pm.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/all-parties-express-high-hopes-for-kerala-local-body-polls-927380.html

It also lacks a party like AIMIM here, to find big traction for its Hindutva rhetoric like during the Hyderabad polls, though the Andhra BJP constantly accuses Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy's actions as being anti-Hindu and appeasing the Muslim, Christian minorities. Speaking at the party's state executive meeting in Tirupati on Saturday, Union minister and Andhra in-charge V Muraleedharan extolled the BJP unit for “attacking Reddy's inefficient rule, agitating on various public issues, and playing the Opposition party's role.” However, unlike in Telangana where the saffron party's electoral prospects are bolstered by the Congress unit vitiated by internal squabbling and desertions to the TRS; BJP faces an uphill task in even achieving the “BJP is the alternative in AP” public notion. For the Opposition TDP retains a big influence – organisation, popularity and vote share basis, though it was trounced in the 2019 polls, restricted to 23 MLAs in a 175 member Assembly. The YSRCP has 151 MLAs and is firmly seated in power, Jana Sena Party 1; while the BJP which had four MLAs when it contested alongside the TDP and JSP support in 2014, has drawn a blank in May 2019. Thanks to its refusal to confer the special category status for the truncated state, the BJP also failed to retain its two Lok Sabha seats despite a nationwide Narendra Modi wave. The party's vote share was less than 1%, even below the NOTA percentage. So, in January this year, the BJP announced a partnership with Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party (JSP). The film-star turned politician's party had won only one Assembly constituency in 2019. PK, as he is popularly known, himself lost from the two Assembly seats he contested. But the JSP displayed the electoral benefits its friendship brings by grabbing a 7% vote share. “BJP and JSP are working together with a nationalistic spirit to jointly form a government in the state,” AP BJP chief Somu Veerraju says. However, the BJP right now is engaged in dealing with a challenge posed out of this friendship with PK. The JSP is keen on contesting from the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency, which the BJP wants for itself to move ahead in the state.   The seat fell vacant because of the death of YSRCP MP Balli Durga Prasad in September and would go to by-polls soon. TDP, which stood second here, has already announced its candidate. “Our central leadership in consultation with the state unit and JSP would take the appropriate decision,” says Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, general secretary, AP BJP, when questioned if the BJP is willing to let go of the seat in the spirit of alliance. The BJP is predicting a gradual political decline of its former ally Chandrababu Naidu, which it believes would allow the Opposition space it needs to grow in the state. “Not even half of his party MLAs are seen standing beside him in the assembly confrontations with the ruling side or in the party's public protests against the YSRCP government,” Vishnu Vardhan tells DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjps-alliance-with-pawan-kalyan-faces-tirupati-test-in-andhra-pradesh-927385.html

Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front and BJP had petitioned the election commission alleging that the Chief Minister's announcement on Saturday that Covid vaccines would be given free of cost to all was a violation of the election code of conduct as the final phase of the local body polls was scheduled for Monday. Election Commission V Bhaskaran said that based on the complaints of violating election code of conduct an explanation was sought from the Chief Minister. A letter was sent to the Chief Minister seeking a written reply. Based on his reply, further steps could be initiated on the petitions. Meanwhile, Vijayan said earlier during the day that the state government was providing Covid treatment free of cost and providing Covid vaccine was only part of that. Hence it did not involve any code of conduct violation. While Congress and BJP filed petitions alleging code of conduct violation, CPM Kerala secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan said that the announcement of free Covid vaccine supply was part of the ongoing measures of the government against the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/election-commission-seeks-kerala-cms-explanation-over-covid-vaccine-927410.html

Police security has been provided to each bus going to various destinations. Buses to Hyderabad, Vijayapura, Bidar and Shahapur and other cities were on their way after a three-day strike by employees.

Speaking to media persons on Monday, he suggested KSRTC employees be cautious of such individuals. "People of the state were the worst affected due to the strike. After the meeting with the officials concerned, the government had promised to meet eight demands out of ten and employees had also decided to withdraw the strike. But the farmer leader Chandrashekhar misguided the employees and urged them to carry on the strike. In this way, he meted out injustice to the employees and people," he said. Coming down heavily on the farmer leader, the minister said he divided transport employees and misguided them. "The state has more than 50 corporations and all employees were told at the time of appointment that they are not government employees. They also joined for service after accepting it. Now, if the government meets the demand of transport employees, employees of the remaining corporations would put pressure on the government to meet the same demand. It would be impossible for the government to consider all employees of various corporations as government staffers," the minister added. BJP leaders Girish Patel, S N Channabasappa, S Jnaneshwar, K V Annappa, Nagaraj, N K Jagadish were also present at the press conference.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/farmer-leader-kodihalli-chandrashekhar-misguided-transport-employees-k-s-eshwarappa-927325.html

There are a total of 60 enterprises of the state government. Of these, 37 are profit-making, while five are in the ‘services sector,’ so they do not have a profit or loss statement.  The total monthly expenses of the beleaguered road transport corporations stood at Rs 619.3 crore, with the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) footing a Rs 321-crore bill every month. Compared with these, only two of the seven undertakings of the Energy department are in the red.  The transport corporations were able to manage expenses on their own till the Covid-19 lockdown. As a result, the government had to pay salaries of employees from these corporations from April to September. Expenses incurred by other RTCs such as North East Karnataka RTC, North West Karnataka RTC and Bangalore Metropolitan Road Transport Corporation were Rs 178.49 crore, Rs 46 crore and Rs 73.20 crore, respectively. The only profit-making transport undertaking was the Devaraj Urs Truck Terminals Limited. The two loss-making undertakings under the Energy department are Hubli Electricity Supply Company (Hescom) and Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (Gescom). Of the two, Gescom recorded profits since the 2018-19 fiscal, which is not sufficient to overcome the overall losses.  Companies of historic importance such as Mysore Paper Mills Ltd and Mysuru Sugar Company Ltd (MySugar) have continued to be in the red. MySugar, according to a reply in Legislative Council to a question by Congress member M Narayanaswamy, was paying salaries to its employees by selling off the sugar stock in the factory. “Administrative departments concerned with these undertakings are continuously working to improve their prospects,” Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said in his response.  The five undertakings classified under services sector are Dr B R Ambedkar Development Corporation Limited, D Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation, Karnataka Maharishi Valmiki Scheduled Tribes Development Corporation, Karnataka State Women’s Development Corporation and Karnataka Minority Development Corporation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/rtcs-among-18-loss-making-govt-undertakings-in-state-927420.html

Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, who was leading the transport agitation, announced the end of the strike at the Freedom Park here. "We are calling off our strike as the state government has accepted nine out of 10 demands," Chandrashekhar announced. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who holds the transport portfolio, expressed happiness over the development. "I am happy that the strike has been called off. I also greet the people of Karnataka who stood by the government," Savadi told reporters here. The employees' key demands were compensation equivalent to the corona warriors who died in the line of duty due to Covid-19 and recognising them as government employees and salaries paid accordingly. With no end to the strike in sight, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday called a meeting with his cabinet colleagues including Savadi, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Revenue Minister R Ashoka and Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu. Later, Savadi met with the representatives of the agitating employees. In the minutes of the meeting released to the media, Savadi said the demand for compensation on par with corona warriors would be given. He did not spell out anything on the second demand of the agitators to recognise them as government employees. He , however, said the government will consider one of the demands on implementing the sixth pay commission report after taking into account its financial condition. Following the assurance to consider paying salaries as recommended in the sixth pay commission, the protesting employees agreed to call off the strike. "Our demand to be recognised as government employees will remain. We are not compromising on that," Chandrashekhar told the agitating employees, many of whom had camped at the Freedom Park with their families. Soon after the strike was called off, city bus, inter-city and inter-state bus services resumed. According to the KSRTC and the BMTC officials, the bus services will resume full-scale from Tuesday. Nearly 1.25 lakh employees of the various state-owned transport corporations and the 33,000 Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation employees had gone one strike putting the daily commuters of Bengaluru, inter-city and inter-state passengers to hardship. To bail out daily commuters, the government had assigned private transporters to run city buses and inter- state buses but that did not help the commuters much as they were overcharging, a few passengers told PTI. A KSRTC Union leader K Prakash, who was part of the agitation, claimed the Sixth Pay Commission report was not among the demands. "We had only two demands -- compensation on par with corona warriors and recognising us as government employees. We don't know how this Sixth pay commission popped up. We also don't know how the nine demands surfaced," Prakash added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-transport-strike-called-off-927374.html

Satej Patil, Maharashtra Minister of State for Ex-Servicemen Welfare, said that it would be on the lines of the employment given to the kin of the policemen killed in Naxal attacks. During the weekend, Patil was speaking at the meeting to deliberate over the perks and facilities to be given to the kin of the soldiers who attained martyrdom. Principal Secretary of the General Administration Department and Special Investigation Officer Seema Vyas, Deputy Secretary Sarita Bandekar-Deshmukh, and other officials were also present at the meeting. The Minister stated that the District Collectors have been asked to allot the lands to the kin of ex-servicemen and a report on this will be submitted within three months. Similarly, in Maharashtra, there are reservations of five percent for ex-servicemen and two per cent for the kin of martyrs in the housing complexes to be constructed by MHADA. The State government, in its order dated October 20, 2020, decided to give five per cent reservation to the wards of ex-servicemen in degree and post-graduate degree colleges. "We have also asked various departments and District Collectors to inform people about the Urban and Rural Development Departments' decision to waive off property tax,'' he said. The other decisions taken at the meeting include starting a website of the ex-servicemen department to resolve the various issues of ex-servicemen, martyrs, and their families, giving employment to the ex-servicemen as per their convenience, after retirement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-govt-offers-direct-employment-to-the-kin-of-martyrs-927188.html
14-12-2020||West||Maharashtra BJP legislators protest over Maratha quota issue||Legislators of the Opposition BJP squatted on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhavan building on Monday to protest against the Maharashtra government's "lackadaisical attitude" towards the Maratha quota and farmers' issues. The protest was held before the commencement of the two-day winter session of the state Legislature. The Supreme Court in September this year stayed the implementation of the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed. BJP leader and former state minister Ashish Shelar told reporters outside the Vidhan Bhavan that during one hearing in the Supreme Court on the Maratha quota case, the government's lawyer was not present. "Why did the government fall short of convincing the court (about vacating stay on the quota)?" he asked. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the "government was running away from debate". In the two-day session, 10 bills are listed, which means the government doesn't want debate, he said. However, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar hit out at the BJP for taking up these issues "in desperation". "The government is doing its best to get the Supreme Court's stay on the Maratha quota vacated. The opposition is desperate due to the stinging loss in the just-concluded Legislative Council elections," Pawar told reporters. State Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan also hit out at the opposition for resorting to "political gimmicks". "When Fadnavis was the chief minister, the Maratha quota bill was passed unanimously. Fadnavis had said the bill would pass through all legal processes," Chavan added. The two-day brief session, curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being held against the backdrop of the MVA government completing a year in office and its encouraging performance in the just held polls to half-a-dozen seats of the Legislative Council (one of them bypoll).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-bjp-legislators-protest-over-maratha-quota-issue-927210.html

On the first day of the state Legislature's winter session, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab moved a condolence motion in the Upper House, expressing grief over the deaths of Pradhan, former state minister Vinayakrao Patil and ex-Council member Sandesh Kondvilkar. "The House expresses its extreme grief over the demise of Pradhan, Patil and Kondvilkar," he said. Lauding Pradhan, who died in July this year, Parab said the former served in Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from 1952 to 1986. Pradhan, who had served as the governor of Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh, also worked as Maharashtra chief secretary, Union home, commerce, and defence secretary, and private secretary of former deputy Prime Minister Yashwantrao Chavan, Parab noted. Pradhan played an important role in Assam and Punjab accords, and Mizoram peace accord. He also did an excellent job as head of the committee formed to review security after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack of 2008, the minister said. "His image was that of a very studious and excellent administrator. Pradhan became MLC in 1990...he was a tall personality," Parab added. Leader of the Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar also paid glowing tributes to Pradhan. Paying homage to Vinayakrao Patil, who died in October this year, Darekar said, "He had all the knowledge of farming...I had seen his Nilgiri (trees) farming. People were affectionate to him beyond party lines." Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal also spoke on the motion and lauded former MLC Sandesh Kondvilkar. "Kondvilkar never carried himself as a leader, but as a worker," Bhujbal said. Legislative Council's Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe, Peasants and Workers' Party (PWP) leader Jayant Patil, Congress's Sharad Ranpise, Vijay alias Bhai Girkar of the BJP, among others, also paid tributes to the departed MLCs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-legislative-council-pays-tribute-to-departed-members-927259.html
14-12-2020||West||Devendra Fadnavis likens curbs on Maratha quota protests to 'Emergency'||BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Monday accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government of not letting the Maratha community protest over the quota issue, and likened it to imposition of Emergency in the state. A day after Thackeray said labelling farmers fighting for their rights as anti-nationals is "worse than Emergency", Fadnavis told reporters here that the chief minister should first speak about what the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has done for peasants. On Saturday, referring to the farmers' protest at Delhi borders, Union minister Piyush Goyal said the agitation no longer remains a peasants' movement as it has been "infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements". On Sunday, Fadnavis accused the Maharashtra government of imposing an "undeclared Emergency" and criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led regime for "going after" Republic TV's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami and actress Kangana Ranaut. Reacting to it, Thackeray on Sunday said, "If Fadnavis says the state government taking action against its critics is causing undeclared emergency, then labelling farmers who are fighting for their rights as anti-nationals is worse than Emergency." Asked about Thackeray's remark, Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the state Assembly, told reporters outside the Legislature building here on Monday, "The chief minister should speak on Maharashtra first." He asked Thackeray whether farmer suicides in Maharashtra have stopped. The protesters are being beaten inside their homes and also being jailed, he charged without specifying any incident. "Such an Emergency has been imposed in Maharashtra that Marathas are not even allowed to protest. He (CM) is not speaking about it," the former state chief minister said. The Supreme Court in September this year stayed the implementation of 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed. Later, members of some pro-Maratha outfits staged protests in parts of Maharashtra. Fadnavis alleged the state government has not offered help of "even a single penny" to farmers hit by floods and cyclone earlier this year, despite making promises about it. "He (Thackeray) speaks about what happened in the US, Russia or Delhi. Speak about what you have done in Maharashtra. The situation in Maharashtra is so bad," he said. Fadnavis claimed Maharashtra ministers will get "exposed" if they speak on their performance in the state. "Hence, they are speaking about what's happening in Delhi. Agitation is going on in Delhi every day, nobody has stopped the protesters," he said, seeking to underscore the difference between the Maharashtra government and the BJP-led regime at the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/devendra-fadnavis-likens-curbs-on-maratha-quota-protests-to-emergency-927267.html
14-12-2020||West||RSS may lose its influence over BJP: Farmers' leader writes to RSS chief||The losses that BJP suffered in the Graduates/Teachers constituencies in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh reflects that RSS may lose its influence over BJP, a top farmers’ leader Kishore Tiwari has claimed. In a letter to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, he referred to the recent elections/results of Graduates/Teachers seats in Varanasi, Allahabad-Jhansi and Gorakhpur-Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh and Nagpur, Pune, Aurangabad, and Amravati in Maharashtra. Talking about the polls, Tiwari, the advisor to Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray on farmers’ issues, said, “In a way, you must appreciate the fact that it is also a sample survey of sentiments of the most qualified big strata of society, constituting more than 60 lakhs people spanning Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, like a 'mini-referendum'.” The losses in Varanasi, Allahabad-Jhansi and Gorakhpur with a BJP state government, and Nagpur, the seat of RSS headquarters and also both seats at Pune and Amravati, are huge jolts for the Central and State party units, as these Graduates/Teachers segments were pillars of BJP’s support, said Tiwari, the Chairman of Maharashtra government’s Late Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission. According to him, this calls for an open debate, since these voters are the cream of Indian society – educated and well aware reformers, plus tax-payers who have always been supporting RSS-BJP. He said that the BJP lost these seats despite the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath heads the government in Centre and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, and RSS has the strongest network in Nagpur. Saying that it cannot be termed as a “normal defeat”, Tiwari, the founder of Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti and a veteran farmers’ leader, noted, "Has BJP forfeited the faith and confidence of the cream of Indian society as reflected from this largest sample survey? Is it the repercussions of the failure of the PM’s policies and the big economic crisis that burns educated poor/middle-class sections?” He also said that a message is going out that Modi is helping corporate and capitalists like “Ambani-Adani”.  "Has the PM’s so-called ‘magic’ failed the nation - especially the silent, nonvocal secular Hindus, who no longer back his extremely communally divisive policies, things like 'love-jihad', targeting sections of the population on caste and communal lines, which RSS never propagated ?” he wanted to know. Tiwari, who had switched from BJP to Shiv Sena ahead of 2019 Vidhan Sabha polls, said: “These aspects must be assessed and seriously debated in the Sangh Parivar think tank, at least, or the RSS may lose its influence over the BJP.” Based in Yavatmal, the hotbed of farmer's suicides, Tiwari, while describing the Maharashtra situation, also took a dig at Leader of Opposition and ex-Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his banker-wife Amruta. “I had even requested you check the undue interference and venom spread through the "Amruta-Vani" which the common people have resented. But no corrective measures are visible and the message being spread is “Lord Indra" and his "Amruta-Vani" are practically owners of the state BJP,” he said without naming them. Tiwari said that the “power-hungry BJP coterie” in Maharashtra is continuously targeting the Shiv Sena to push it out of the government and grab power.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rss-may-lose-its-influence-over-bjp-farmers-leader-writes-to-rss-chief-927281.html
14-12-2020||West||Opposition says Maharashtra session duration too less, Speaker agrees||Amid complaints from the BJP that the duration of Maharashtra Legislature's winter session was inadequate to take care of the business listed, state Assembly Speaker Nana Patole on Monday said proper guidelines should be framed to ensure the next budget session is not truncated. He said such a short duration session is "not good for democracy". The two-day winter session of the state Legislature, curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, began on Monday with the tabling of six ordinances and four bills. Expressing displeasure over the short duration of the winter session, Patole said proper guidelines should be framed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that the durationof the next budget session is not truncated. The state budget session is generally held for six weeks in February-March every year. "Both the government and the opposition should sit together and formulate guidelines," Patole said. The monsoon session of the state Legislature was also held for two days in September due to the pandemic. After the winter session began on Monday, six ordinances and four bills, including the Shakti bill to curb violence against women and children, were tabled in the state Assembly. Deputy Chief Minister and state Finance Minister Ajit Pawar tabled the supplementary demands worth Rs 21,992 crore which will be taken up for discussion on Tuesday. BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar wondered what was the need for so many bills to be tabled when there is no time for comprehensive discussions during the ongoing session. "What was the need for listing 10 bills? Will the House run for 10 days?" he asked. Mungantiwar complained that legislative committee meetings are not being held in view of the pandemic. "There is no problem of Covid-19 to start railway services, what is the problem in holding meetings of the legislature committees," said the former state minister, who is chairman of the public accounts committee. Some committees are not formed at all, Mungantiwar said, noting that members of the Legislative Council are also on the joint select committees. To this, state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said Governor BS Koshyari should approve the list of 12 members to be nominated to the Legislative Council from the governor's quota. Meanwhile, Sanjay Shirsat (Shiv Sena), Ashok Pawar (NCP), Sangram Thopte (Congress) and Kalidas Kolambkar (BJP) were appointed on the panel of presiding officers for the two-day session. Earlier, as the House assembled for the day, Independent MLA Ravi Rana entered the House wearing a banner highlighting farmers' issues. Speaker Patole took objection to the member's conduct and directed the marshals not to allow members with such banners in the House. Fadnavis appealed to the Speaker to take note of the issues raised by the member by wearing such a banner. Later, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray moved a condolence motion in the Assembly to pay homage to its former members and sitting MLA Bharat Bhalke who died recently. The motion was supported by Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis. The House paid homage to Bhalke, former ministers Vishnu Savra, Javed Khan, Vinayakrao Patil, former MLAs Sardar Tara Singh, Anantrao Devsarkar, Narayan Patil, Narsingrao Gharpalkar, Kisanrao Khopde, Suresh Gore and Jagannath Dhone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/opposition-says-maharashtra-session-duration-too-less-speaker-agrees-927283.html

Sarnaik, a three-time MLA from Thane district, is one of the close aides of Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray. He moved the breach of privilege motion against Ranaut on Monday, when the two-day winter session of Maharashtra legislature commenced in Mumbai. It may be mentioned that Sarnaik, the Chairman of Vihang Group of Companies,  is under investigations of the Enforcement Directorate over allegations that received kickbacks of over Rs 7 crore from security service provider Topsgrup for allegedly facilitating a contract of Rs 175 crore with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The contract for providing security guards at MMRDA was sub-contracted to Topsgrup. According to reports, during the investigations and raids, a Pakistani national’s credit card was seized from his premises. “Film actor Kangana Ranaut said in a tweet that the ‘person who was to break my jaw at the Mumbai airport’ has a Pakistani credit card,” Sarnaik said. “I admit that a probe is underway (ED)… I admit it…but no such credit card has been recovered,” he said.  “She tweeted on the Pakistani credit card that I never possessed, as she wanted to defame me,” he said, adding: "Why should I have a Pakistani credit card? What is the credit of Pakistan?". Sarnaik also said that he and his sons are cooperating with the ED. The Shiv Sena MLA has requested the Principal Secretary of Maharashtra Legislature to forward his notice/complaint to the Privilege Committee of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly so that an inquiry in the matter of breach of privilege and necessary action against Kangana and news organisations can be taken. In the previous two-day monsoon session, Sarnaik has moved breach-of-privilege motions against Republic Media Network’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and Ranaut. In fact, when the ED probe started, Sarnaik, his party Shiv Sena and its alliance partners NCP and Congress- has said that the ED was harassing him for speaking against Goswami and Ranaut.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sena-mla-moves-privilege-notice-against-kangana-ranaut-927312.html

According to a statement issued by HAM on Monday, its septuagenarian founding president was convalescing after testing positive for the coronavirus. The party office, which has been set up by the Strand Road bungalow allotted to Manjhi in his capacity as an ex-CM, has also been shut down for a week, the statement said. The party's national executive meeting, scheduled for December 18, has therefore been deferred. Manjhi had formed the party in 2015, after stepping down as Chief Minister and quitting the JD(U). He returned to the NDA ahead of the recent assembly polls, burying his differences with former mentor Nitish Kumar. His son Santosh Kumar Suman is a member of the newly- formed state cabinet headed by the JD(U) chief. The mercurial leader had on Sunday raised the hackles of the NDA by threatening to launch an agitation if the government did not implement measures envisioned by him for employment generation and reservations during his brief tenure as Chief Minister. Congress legislature party leader Ajit Sharma, however, questioned Manjhi's stance and said "what is he doing in a coalition which is paying no heed to his concerns? If he is serious, let him come out of the NDA and we will join him in his stir for job creation".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ham-chief-jitan-ram-manjhi-tests-positive-for-covid-19-927334.html

"Let us shape a glorious and Swayampurna (self- reliant) Goa by taking ahead the same trust and confidence, Sawant tweeted. Later, addressing a press conference, he said the rural voters have shown their faith in the BJP's leadership and the state government. He said the party has won with "huge margins" in many of the ZP constituencies. Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said the results indicate the support the party has earned among the voters.

The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The Union government has filed a petition in the high court challenging the October 1, 2020, order passed by the Collector allotting the land for construction of the car shed, and said the land belongs to its (the Centre) salt department. The Maharashtra government, however, opposed the plea and said the land, allotted to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for the Metro car shed, is owned by the state. On Monday, a division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was of prime facie opinion that the Collector should give a fresh hearing to all parties concerned and settle issues related to land title ownership. We cannot allow this order (Collectors order) to remain in force. Prima facie, we are of the view that the matter should go back to the Collector. Consider withdrawing it (the order). "It is better you (the government) settle all these issues before you proceed further, the court said. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said he would take instructions from the state government over the suggestion following which the court posted the matter for further hearing on December 16. The Union government, in its plea, has claimed that entire salt pan lands in the area, including the 102 acres allotted to MMRDA, belongs to its salt department. The erstwhile BJP-led government had decided to construct the car shed, part of Mumbai Metro line 3, at Aarey Colony despite opposition from environmentalists and activists who campaigned against cutting of a large number of trees for the project. The present Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by the Shiv Sena and supported by the NCP and the Congress, on assuming office in November last year, decided to shift the car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg. The Uddhav Thackeray government has now decided to construct an integrated metro car shed at Kanjurmarg for lines 3, 4, 4A and 6, instead of building separate depots for these corridors. MMRDA advocates Milind Sathe and Saket Mone on Monday told the court that the integrated car shed would cut down the project cost.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/consider-withdrawing-order-on-metro-car-shed-land-bombay-hc-to-maharashtra-govt-927379.html

The victory is expected to help Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to stamp his authority on the party apparatus in the coastal state ahead of the state Assembly elections, which are scheduled to be held in early 2022. According to data released by the State Election Commission, the BJP won 19 from the 25 seats up for grabs in the North Goa Zilla Panchayat body and 14 out of the 24 seats in South Goa Zilla Panchayat body. The main Opposition party, the Congress managed to win only four seats out of the 49 seats which were up for grabs across the two ZP bodies. Sawant, who was sworn in as chief minister in March last year, said that the polls were a major test for his government, which the BJP had won with flying colours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/congress-aap-crushed-bjp-sweeps-goa-zilla-panchayat-polls-927395.html

The prime minister will lay foundation stones for a desalination plant, a hybrid renewable energy park and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant. According to officials, Modi will also be briefed on the progress of Smruti Van located in Bhuj, which has been under construction for nearly 17 years now. Spread over 470 acres, the first phase of the memorial in the name of 2001 earthquake victims is said to be completed soon. It was first floated in 2004 when Modi was Gujarat's chief minister. A significant development project for which the prime minister will be laying foundation stone is the 30,000-megawatt hybrid renewable energy park, said to be the world’s largest, spread in nearly 1,00,000 hectares of wasteland near Khavda, close to the international border with Pakistan. Khavda is about an hour's drive from Bhuj city, which is close to Dhordo, the tent city known for the white desert festival in the winters or Rannotsav. The desalination plant is being set up at Mandvi, an hour’s drive from Bhuj, which will have a capacity of 10 crore litres of water per day. A similar project is being established in Dahej, Dwarka, Ghogha and Gir Somnath. Modi will also lay the foundation stone of a fully automated milk processing and packing plant at Sarhad Dairy Anjar, Kutch. The plant will cost Rs 121 crore and will have the capacity to process 2 lakh litres of milk per day. PM Modi will also be visiting White Rann in Dhordo, where cultural programmes have been organised.
