Also, the administrative problems in the Mutt have been sorted out. Disclosing this to media persons, Sode Vadiraj Mutt seer Sri Vishwavallabha Theertha Swami said that a disciple had been trained in various Vedic expertise, with the support of Ashta Mutt seers. The renovation work of both Shiroor original Mutt and Udupi Mutt is completed. The expenses of the Mutt and the renovation work of both the Mutts are borne from the rent received from Lakshmi Summit and the shops near Udupi Mutt. The assets of Shiroor Mutt is intact and nothing is sold or leased out to bear the expenses in the two-and-half-a-year-old administration of the Mutt and its properties. Senior chartered accountant H V Gautham said all taxes have been maintained legally. The proposed 17.34 crore pending tax is under inquiry. Sode Education Institutions’ secretary Ratnakumar said legal possibilities have been worked out to sort out the construction works of Kanaka Mahal. Besides, a senior devotee from Mumbai will take up the construction of Kanaka Mahal, under the joint development project agreement. Four floors will be built and handed over to Shiroor Mutt. An oral agreement has been worked out to support the idea of repaying the loan amount at the present book value. Rs 10.75 crore will be returned as per the agreement out of the total amount of Rs 26.50 crore. The devotee will take the responsibility of Rs 10 crore. The amount will be spent on returning the advance paid by the people for commercial complexes under the newly built Kanaka Mahal. He is also paying the amount of Rs 1.75 crore to the contractor. Rs five crore is being paid to the Mutt by the devotee, he added.

Because of which, the river may change its course, fear the environmentalists and the villagers. A hill close to the bridge on Kadebagilu end has fast disappeared while several hillocks on both the sides have been reduced to mounds of rubble due to unabated quarrying. A large extent of land close to the river has been flattened. At several points, it looks like an extended part of the riverbed. If the quarrying is not stopped, the river will change its course and may spell doom for the farmland and villages nearby, say the aggrieved villagers. Earlier, stone quarrying was done on a large-scale at Bukkasagar forest area. The government stopped quarrying following a sustained pressure by the environmentalists. The forest area was included under Daroji bear sanctuary. According to the locals, the quarry operators moved their operations to the hilly terrain close to Tungabhadra river in Bukkasagar-Kadebagilu villages. “A few years back some traditional stone-cutters used to make their living by cutting blocks/boulders on a small-scale. After the quarrying was stopped in Bukkasagar forest, the quarry owners shifted to the hillocks on Tungabhadra river bank. A few others joined them in illegal stone quarrying to make money fast. During monsoon, the river meanders its way into the farmland in Bukkasagar and Venkatapur villages due to rampant quarrying. If the quarrying continues unabated, the river may soon change its course and submerge the villages,” fear Basavaraj, Hulugappa and others of Bukkasagar village. The bridge connects the most of Kalyana Karnataka districts. The elected representatives and the officials, who take this route on regular basis, are silent to illegal quarrying operations being carried out 24X7, the aggrieved villagers complained. Meanwhile, the Bukkasagar panchayat officer said that he’s not aware of quarrying and that stringent action would be taken against those involved in such activity. Srishailagouda, PDO, Bukkasagar told DH, “We have not issued any permission for quarrying in the region. Any violations as such will be brought to the notice of the higher-ups.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/unabated-quarrying-may-change-tungabhadra-river-course-fear-villagers-924211.html
06-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Thanks to solar plant, Hubballi airport to 'foot' power bills of state's airports from March||If everything goes according to plan, from March 2021, the Hubballi domestic airport will ‘foot’ the electricity bills of airports managed by Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Karnataka (except Bengaluru and Mangaluru international airports). According to Hubballi airport director Pramod Kumar Thakre, by March 2021, the city airport is expected to generate 140 lakh units of electricity per year through its eight megawatt ground-mounted photovoltaic solar plant being installed there. The power thus generated will be fed to the high-tension grid of the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) on the drive-wheel system and take credit in the electricity bills of all Karnataka airports managed by AAI. Once completely implemented, the airport’s dependence on the external power supply will be reduced by at least 85% annually. As of now, the total power consumption of airports in Karnataka (Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Mysuru, HAL airport, Bengaluru) is around 132 lakh units per year, whereas the Hubballi airport will generate 140 lakh units. Madhav Infra Private Limited, a Gujarat-based company, has been executing the project at an estimated cost of Rs 64 crore. Laying cables, setting up transformers and other civil works have been completed, while the remaining work is expected to be completed by March-end or early-April, said Thakre. The entire project is being implemented on 38 acres of the airport land. More than 22,500 solar panels will be installed on 24 acres of land in such a way that the solar system gets maximum amount of solar radiation each day throughout the year, through orientation and tilting of the modules, thus avoiding shading, he said.  In order to achieve a higher system voltage, modules have been installed in a row arrangement, called a string. A higher system voltage has the advantage of lesser installation work, higher efficiency of the plant and use of smaller cross-section cables.  The project is being implemented as part of the union government’s plan of increased use of green and renewable sources of energy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/thanks-to-solar-plant-hubballi-airport-to-foot-power-bills-of-states-airports-from-march-924213.html

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka passed this direction in response to a PIL filed seeking direction to the state government for protection of the bird. The PIL is filed by Ballari-based conservationist Edward Santosh Martin and two others. The petition contended that illegal civil works in the habitats of the GIB is leading to its extinction. The petitioners said the Environment Impact Assessment Notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the expansion of any activity or new project in protected areas.  “The Great Indian Bustards, one of India’s Iconic birds, has now become India’s rarest bird. The respondents (state government) have chosen the specific areas within the grasslands to construct the watch towers and the anti-poaching camps which is causing extreme hindrance to the survival of the birds as the birds require open grasslands and scrublands for survival,” the petition said. The petitioner has prayed for direction for urgent implementation of conservation measures to recover, protect and preserve the endangered species.  The petition said that prominent ornithologist Dr Salim Ali had recommended that GIB be made a national bird due to its threatened status. Subsequently, GIB was adopted as the state bird of Rajasthan, where it is locally called as Godavari. The bench ordered notice to the respondents and said it is the constitutional obligation of the state to protect the wildlife. “The Wildlife Protection Act has been enacted to provide for protection of wild animals, birds and plants. The definition of animal includes birds and the definition of wildlife includes animals which include birds. Thus, it is the obligation of the state to protect the wildlife,” the court said. The bench said that under Article 48A of the Constitution state will have to protect, improve and safeguard forest and wildlife. “Apart from this, under clause G of Article 51-A, it is the duty of every citizen to protect and improve the wildlife. We direct the state to place on record the immediate measures which it proposes to take for protection of GIB,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-hc-seeks-measures-to-protect-great-indian-bustards-924249.html

This comes after a section of party legislators and leaders complained against Yediyurappa’s style of functioning — he was seen as having made some “unilateral” decisions such as the establishment of the Maratha and Veerashaiva-Lingayat development corporations, and the appointment of chairpersons/directors to various state-run companies.  Yediyurappa’s announcement that MLC CP Yogeeshwar would become a minister also caused heartburn among the legislators.  Arun Singh was in Belagavi on Friday and Saturday for the BJP's core committee and executive committee meetings. He is said to have told Yediyurappa that some “sensitive” decisions required consultation with the party.  Last week, the chief minister had to put on hold a decision on getting the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community included on the national OBC list apparently after a phone call with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.  According to the party, Singh will arrive in Bengaluru late on Saturday. On Sunday, he will be hosted by Housing Minister V Somanna for breakfast, followed by lunch with Yediyurappa.  Cabinet expansion Speculation is also rife that the much-touted expansion or reshuffle of Yediyurappa’s Cabinet will not happen until after the gram panchayat polls later this month.  However, Singh is expected to discuss Cabinet expansion with Yediyurappa on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/after-unilateral-decisions-bs-yediyurappa-told-to-consult-party-923943.html

"Earlier the British were practising Divide and Rule policy. Today, the government itself is practising this policy. They have come to power by dividing and subdividing the entire community.  "There is no unity and solidarity in our social life......Anyone who divides the people of India is ultimately dividing the nation," he said. By accusing BJP and RSS of being 'very good' at dividing people, he said, "First, they divided our people on religion, caste, sub-caste and language. Now, they started bringing about divisions between leaders who fought for our independence." In a message on Mahaparinirvan Diwas of Dr BR Ambedkar, he took a dig at the central government for subverting the constitutional ideals. "When they find it convenient, everyone who is actually against Babasaheb ideologically uses his name. On one hand, Prime Minister says his government has only one holy book – the Constitution. On the other hand, his organisation says they don’t want Babasaheb’s Constitution. They are undoing everything that Babasaheb had done." Laws should be formed to protect all citizens irrespective of caste, creed or religion. Today, laws are being made that discriminate against sections of the society, the Congress Working Committee member alleged. "Government talks about national development and economic development. Laws are being framed to help a few at the cost of many. They are not bothered that it will happen at the cost of Dalits and depressed classes. How can you build a nation if you don’t want these sections to be a part of the development?" he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-rss-good-at-dividing-people-mallikarjun-kharge-924055.html

They also extended support to the Bharat Bandh call on December 8 to protest the laws. "The organisations will launch a massive protest in front of the Gandhi statue at Maurya circle on Monday. All units of the organisations, working in different parts of the state, will extend support to the December 8 bandh call," Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka farmer organisations' union, said. Urging people from all spheres of life to back the protests and the bandh call, he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi government of conspiring to destroy the agriculture sector. "Rather than fulfilling the assurance of implementing the Swaminathan Committee report made ahead of 2019 polls, the central government has made laws to decimate farmers", he alleged. The farmers stir in Karnataka will coincide with the legislative session of the state government for the second time this year. Back in September, farmers had staged a week-long protest in Bengaluru and held an alternative 'people's session' during the monsoon session of the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/farm-laws-karnataka-farmers-to-launch-indefinite-stir-from-december-7-924071.html

Sources said many legislators singled out BJP vice president B Y Vijayendra, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s second son, in their complaints, urging Singh to rein him in. Singh also met Yediyurappa, even as confusion prevails over Cabinet expansion. While Revenue Minister R Ashoka said that the BJP high command was yet to permit the induction of new ministers, Singh passed the buck on Yediyurappa, saying Cabinet expansion was the prerogative of the CM. “The CM has to take a call. It is his prerogative,” he said. Singh held consultations with ministers including DyCM Dr C N Ashwath Narayan, Ashoka and V Somanna, MPs Pratap Simha and P C Mohan and several MLAs, including chief whip of the ruling party V Sunil Kumar. Kumar had recently written to state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel over lack of discipline in party ranks and reservations expressed by a few legislators over the functioning of the party. Sources said many of the grievances aired by legislators pertained to Vijayendra, accusing him of unnecessary intrusion in government affairs. During his meeting with elected representatives that lasted for over two hours, he also took stock of disgruntlement within BJP ranks in the state. The issue of appointments to various boards and corporations, which has also left a few BJP leaders seething, was discussed with the state incharge. Directions were issued by Singh to Kateel to convene a meeting of all party legislators, sources said, adding that the grievances raised by legislators would be addressed. He also visited Keshava Krupa in the city and held discussions with RSSleaders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-leaders-target-vijayendra-in-talks-with-arun-singh-924216.html

Chauhan's statement comes ahead of the state Legislature session starting from Monday, where the anti-cow slaughter Bill would be tabled. "We are going to table a tough anti-cow slaughter Bill in the Assembly session... the B S Yediyurappa-led government is committed to implementing the law as mentioned in the election manifesto," the Minister, who holds the Animal Husbandry, Hajj and Waqf portfolios, said in a statement. On the proposed Bill, Chauhan said a study was carried out by visiting Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, which have implemented the anti-cow slaughter law, to make the legislation in Karnataka strong. Once the ban on cow slaughter is implemented, a study would be conducted to find out the various schemes related to cows by visiting various places in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, the Minister added. According to Chauhan, the law formulated to ban cow slaughter had been passed by both houses of Parliament and sent to the President in 2010 but was returned suggesting some changes. However, the Congress government in Karnataka withdrew the revised law and continued with the old one. The BJP in its manifesto ahead of the 2018 assembly election had promised prohibition of cow slaughter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/tough-anti-cow-slaughter-law-in-karnataka-on-the-cards-minister-924227.html

The company has also sought a waiver from the Drugs Controller General of India for the mandatory clinical trial requirement, which two other imported vaccines, Sputnik (Russian) and Covishield – made by the Pune-based Serum Institute using the same master seed used in the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine – are carrying out at the moment. While Pfizer has decided on not to sell its vaccine in the private market, it is unclear at the moment whether the Union Health Ministry would buy this vaccine priced at $ 19.5 a dose (nearly Rs 1,450 per dose) in the US market. Moreover, storage and transportation of the vaccine pose a huge logistical challenge because of its ultra-low cooling needs. A company official said it would not sell any vaccine in the private market and would supply the vaccine only through government contracts after receiving regulatory approval. "Pfizer India has submitted an application on December 4 to the DCGI seeking the EUA for its Covid-19 vaccine. The firm has submitted the EUA application for grant of permission to import and market the vaccine (BNT162b2) in India," said an official. The UK on Wednesday became the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 with the UK regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency granting a temporary authorisation for its emergency use. The British regulator said the jab, which claims to offer up to 95% protection against the pandemic virus is safe for a roll-out. The vaccine comes with a huge logistical challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius temperature, The company offers three options as resolve the problem - (1) an ultra low-temperature freezer that is commercially available and can extend the shelf life of the vaccine up to six months (2) a Pfizer-designed special temperature-controlled thermal shippers that can maintain the temperature range of -70 degrees Celsius to +10 degrees Celsius for 10 days without opening and (3) refrigeration units at hospitals where the vaccine can be stored for five days at a temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius. The thermal shipper uses dry ice (solidified carbon dioxide) for cooling. Once it is opened, the vaccine has to be used within 30 days with recharging of dry ice after every five days. While five vaccines are under various stages of clinical evaluation in India, three more are under an advanced stage of development with the involvement of the Indian pharmaceutical industry. India had earlier indicated to follow a smart vaccination strategy under which only a selected group of people would be vaccinated with the aim of breaking the chain of transmission rather than following a universal vaccination policy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pfizer-seeks-emergency-authorisation-for-its-covid-19-vaccine-in-india-923965.html

Working to make India free from all forms of discrimination is the only truthful way to pay homage to him.   "Today we remember Dr Ambedkar's contribution to nation building. Working to make India free from all forms of discrimination is the only truthful way to pay homage to him," Gandhi said in a tweet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-pays-homage-to-dr-ambedkar-on-death-anniversary-924029.html
06-12-2020||National||Mahaparinirvan Diwas: Five quotes from Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar||Every year, December 6 is observed as Mahaparinirvan Diwas to mark the death anniversary of BR Ambedkar, who passed away while in his house, on this day, 64 years ago.  Parinirvan, a Buddhist principle, refers to the attainment of nirvana while alive and after death. Ambedkar, having studied the religion extensively, emerged as a Buddhist leader and guru following his conversion to Buddhism along with over 5 lakh supporters on October 17, 1956.  His mortal remains were buried at Dadar Chowpatty in Mumbai, following Buddhist rites. The site where he was buried is known as the Chaitya Bhumi. Each year, thousands of Buddhists, Dalits, and Ambekarites flock to the Chaitya Bhumi to pay their respects to Babasaheb, who emancipated scores like him, and whose work continues to do so. This year, however, visitors will not be allowed to enter the Chaitya Bhumi but will be able to watch live coverage of the proceedings. On this day of remembrance, we take a look at five of Dr Ambedkar's quotes that have served to inspire millions of people. 1. “Educate, Organise, Agitate” | This slogan from Ambedkar continues to be one of his most popular quotes, and serves as a rallying cry among Ambedkarites and other social activists. It is believed that he said this at the end of a speech at the All India Depressed Classes Conference in Nagpur.  2. "If I find the constitution being misused, I shall be the first to burn it." | Often, taken out of context, Dr Ambedkar was believed to have said this during a discussion on the (then) Fourth Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha on March 19, 1955. Dr Ambekar made this comment as a warning to end the inhumane treatment of minorities and oppressed communities in the country.  3. "The history of India is nothing but a history of a mortal conflict between Buddhism and Brahminism”  | This quote from, 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Ancient India', a book that Ambedkar authored. When one delves further into the book, they realise that Ambedkar's quote possibly refers to Brahminism's spite towards Buddhism, a religion that believed in egalitarian principles, and was growing as an increasingly popular religion, adding a number of lower caste individuals to its fold. 4. "Political tyranny is nothing compared to the social tyranny and a reformer who defies society is a more courageous man than a politician who defies Government." | Dr Ambedkar was believed to have said these words in 1936. The quote refers to the impact social ostracisation, apart from other consequences, of challenging societal norms, is far greater than defying a government.  5. "I measure the progress of a community by the degree of progress which women have achieved." | Ambedkar's comments about women empowerment and feminism at large made him stand apart from some of the other social reformers of his time, and the quote, to this day, remains relevant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mahaparinirvan-diwas-five-quotes-from-dr-bhimrao-ambedkar-924039.html

Consumers in the survey supported Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2020, including the clause to impose a penalty of Rs 100 on drivers if they cancel the ride. "The survey that collected responses from more than 16,000 consumers states that 81 per cent approve of the 1.5 times surge pricing cap and the clause of penalty of up to Rs 100 if the driver cancels a ride," the survey report said. The guidelines were released on November 27, after which Localcircles did a survey across 219 districts, covering 16,585 respondents. "Many consumers discussed this becoming a ground reality and urged the various state governments across the country to operationalise these guidelines at the earliest," Localcircles founder and chairman Sachin Taparia told PTI. In a survey done last year, Localcircles had found that consumers were facing 5-10 times rise in online taxi ride pricing. The survey this year found that 55 per cent citizens were unable to speak with app taxi customer service in case of an emergency or need. "83 per cent citizens say app taxis should not be permitted to apply surge pricing on advance or scheduled bookings," the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/over-80-consumers-support-govts-move-to-cap-surge-pricing-for-online-taxi-platforms-survey-924056.html
06-12-2020||National||Niti Aayog suggests single self-regulatory body for fantasy sports industry||Government think tank Niti Aayog has pitched for setting up a single self-regulatory organisation for the online fantasy sports industry to be governed by the independent oversight board and also suggested restricting online fantasy games to users of 18 years and above. In a draft report titled 'Guiding Principles for the Uniform National-Level Regulation of Online Fantasy Sports Platforms in India', the Aayog said that there is a public interest in the fantasy sports industry receiving government recognition as an industry and having its own identity.         A single self-regulatory organisation for the fantasy sports industry should be recognised by the government, it added. "Such self-regulatory body should be a single-purpose fantasy sports industry body and have membership of onlin fantasy sports platforms (OFSPs)operators," the report said. Noting that while OFSPs operate through online media on a pan-India basis, the report said that their regulation proceeds varied under state-wise regulatory regimes. The Aayog said, "This means that fantasy sports users' interests of transparency, OFSP operator integrity, and fairness may vary from state-to-state, resulting in an inconsistent experience and the risk of forum/jurisdiction shopping." "This may even deprive sports fans in some states of their right to engage actively on these OFSPs," it added. Online Fantasy Sports Platforms (OFSPs) offer fantasy sports contests.  Fantasy sports are not like any other form of online gaming as it is dependent on actualities, seasonality and availability of real-time sports matches, which makes it a non-addictive form of play. This sets it distinctly apart from other forms that are perceived to be in the nature of gambling or betting. "Pay-to-play formats of fantasy sports contests should not be offered by an OFSP operator to users who are less than 18 years old," the Aayog said, adding that all necessary safeguards to protect minors must be instituted.   According to the Niti Aayog draft report, the governance of the self regulatory organisation should be undertaken by an independent oversight board comprising of reputed persons with experience in governance, law and administration, who may be elected or appointed by members of the self-regulatory organisation for fixed terms. The self-regulatory organisation should establish an independent grievance redressal mechanism to handle consumer/user complaints against OFSPs as well as any disputes that arise between or relating to OFSPs, it added. As per the draft guidelines, the extant legal ambiguity and differential treatment faced by fantasy sports games across the Indian states must be addressed through the creation of a uniform national-level safe-harbour for fantasy sports games. "This will enable the implementation of a single national policy on fantasy sports and bring clarity to regulators, operators and consumers alike," it said, adding that the government must consider a light-touch regulatory framework for the fantasy sports industry given the dynamic and technical nature of the activities. This approach, according to the draft guidelines, will be facilitative of market-creation and market-growth. "Self-regulation must also be the preferred mode of governance to ensure ongoing transparency, consumer protection, and accountability," it said.         The draft document also pointed out that the independent oversight board should be responsible for the uniform guidelines and ensuring OFSPs' continued adherence and compliance.         "All OFSPs that are members of the self-regulatory organisation should enjoy the benefit of the safe-harbour exemption, subject to their adherence with the norms and procedures laid down," the report said. These guiding principles may be treated as a uniform 'regulatory sandbox' and may be recalibrated based on ongoing innovations and developments in the sector, the Aayog observed.  In a recent market report, KPMG had noted that the number of users participating in online fantasy sports in India has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 212 per cent, from 2 million users in June 2016 to 90 million users in December 2019. Further, the report estimated that the fantasy sports industry has the potential to attract foreign direct investment of more than Rs 10,00 crore over the next few years as well as generate 1.5 billion online transactions by 2023. A PricewaterhouseCoopers India's report has noted that the fantasy sports industry has the potential to generate an additional 5,000+ direct and 7,000+ indirect jobs in the next 2-3 years. It also estimates that the fantasy sports industry has the potential to contribute GST revenue of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 3,500 crore over the next five years, with income tax on winnings and corporate tax paid by OFSP operators expected to contribute between Rs 7,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/niti-aayog-suggests-single-self-regulatory-body-for-fantasy-sports-industry-924063.html

The lockdown was imposed by the central government across the nation from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, from June 8, the Centre gradually started easing restrictions under 'Unlock'. "One of the biggest worries during the lockdown was the fact that the financial crisis of families will lead them to take loans unethically. This eventually increased the vulnerability of children and their families of being lured by traffickers with the promise of a better livelihood opportunity," Dhananjay Tingal, an executive director at BBA, said. Thirteen-year-old Krishna (name changed) was one of the 1,675 children rescued by the child rights organisation between April and November. Krishna was trafficked from his village in Bihar to work in a garment factory in Gandhinagar in Gujarat, where he toiled for 12 hours a day, and stayed in a tiny room that he shared with six others like him, BBA officials said. Though they were promised payment, they were never given the promised amount. Besides this, he and the others just got half a day to rest every week and were under tremendous pressure to meet production targets, they said. Krishna landed up in Gujarat and became a victim of trafficking after his parents, farm labourers, lost their jobs with the outbreak of the coronavirus, the BBA said. Moreover, his parents had taken a loan of Rs 20,000 before the lockdown to fix the roof of their house, but being unemployed they were unable to pay their lender, the officials said. It was getting difficult for Krishna’s parents to feed a family of 11 and traffickers took advantage of the situation and for Rs 20,000, Krishna was taken to Gujarat to work, they said. For months he endured exploitation at the hands of his employer, before being rescued by the BBA in July. The story of 14-year-old Saad Khan (name changed) is no different. There were three earning members in his family, but the pandemic induced poverty forced Khan to search for work, the BBA officials said. He and his family were lured by a trafficker, who gave them an advance of Rs 5,000 and promised work for Khan. "The advance payment by any trafficker further complicates the issue as it becomes a case of bonded labour," Tingal said. Khan was rescued along with 15 other children in September while he was being transported in a bus to work at a bangle making factory in Jaipur in Rajasthan. He was rescued by BBA with the help of the anti-human trafficking unit and local police. The child rights NGO said during April to November, 1,675 children rescued from "situations of exploitation" and 107 traffickers were arrested. "During August and September 2020, 80 vehicles, including 51 buses and 29 trains were intercepted based on information received from field activists, exclusively deployed to report suspected cases of child trafficking," Tingal said, terming children as the biggest victim of the pandemic. "There is a dire need of being more vigilant and active in mapping children and families, who are especially at risk and try to stop trafficking at the source. The immediate measure that we have at hand to prevent this is to rehabilitate rescued bonded labourers, especially by ensuring that they are financially compensated and do not fall back into the cycle of exploitation," he said. Tingal said that bangle making units of Jaipur have been under the scanner for over a decade now due to children being employed. The pandemic momentarily halted production but as soon as restrictions were relaxed, manufacturing resumed, and employers started employing children, he said. Children are employed primarily for two reasons- first due to cheap labour cost and secondly, due to their small hands which helps in efficiently fitting embellishments on bangles, Tingal said. "The advent of the pandemic has seriously damaged the work done in the past two decades by child rights organisations in terms of decreasing child labour. BBA has been adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic in dealing with the steep rise in trafficking," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/1600-trafficked-children-saved-in-past-8-months-bachpan-bachao-andolan-report-924066.html

The All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) in a statement said the government should come forward and resolve their demands in the interest of the nation and farmers. Officer unions All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Indian National Bank Officers' Congress (INBOC) have also requested the government to initiate meaningful dialogue to resolve the impasse by referring the bills to a select committee by a special Presidential Order. The farming community has expressed apprehension that three new laws -- Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. "Our nation needs peace and main stakeholders of the nation should not be made to suffer, as the agriculture sector alone performed positively in the COVID-19 pandemic, which reflects the inherent strength of the sector," three officers' unions said in a joint statement. The peasants constitute 80 per cent of the customer base of the public sector banks, regional rural banks, co-operative banks and old generation private banks and thus are major stakeholders of India's banking system, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bank-unions-lend-support-to-farmers-agitation-against-farm-laws-924067.html

The total active cases were 4,02,529 on July 21.  Continuing with the trend of the last nine days, India has reported more daily recoveries than daily new cases in a span of 24 hours. "The trend of more daily recoveries than the daily cases has led to a continuous contraction of India's Covid-19 active caseload which presently consists of just 4.18 per cent of the total cases," the ministry said. While 36,011 people in India were found to be infected with Covid-19 in a span of 24 hours, 41,970 new recoveries were registered during the same period. The new recoveries have led to a net decline of 6,441 in the total active cases. New cases per million population in India in the last seven days are 186. It is one of the lowest in the world, the ministry underlined. The total Covid-19 recoveries have crossed 91 lakh (91,00,792).  "The gap between recoveries and active cases is steadily increasing and nearing 87 lakh (86,97,544) as on date," the ministry said. Of the new recovered cases,76.6 per cent are observed to be concentrated in 10  states and UTs. Maharashtra has reported the maximum number of single-day recoveries with 5,834 newly recovered cases. Kerala follows closely with 5,820 new recoveries. Delhi registered 4,916 new recoveries. Of the new infections, 75.70 per cent are from 10 states and UTs, the ministry said. Kerala reported the highest daily new cases at 5,848. It is followed by Maharashtra with 4,922 new cases. Delhi recorded 3,419 new cases. A total of 482 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Ten states and UTs account for 79.05 per cent of new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (95). Delhi and West Bengal follow with 77 and 49 daily deaths, respectively. The daily registered deaths per million population during the past week when compared globally demonstrate that India has one of the lowest at 3 deaths/million population. The total coronavirus cases mounted to 96,44,222 with 36,011 new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll crossed to 1.40 lakh with 482 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/active-covid-19-cases-in-india-down-to-403-lakh-lowest-in-138-days-924077.html

Talking to reporters here, Pawar said when the farmers are protesting on streets, it should be taken seriously. "But, unfortunately, that is not happening," the former Union agriculture minister said. "I hope wisdom dawns on the government and it takes cognisance to resolve the issue. If this stalemate continues, the protest will not be limited to Delhi, but people from nook and corner of the country will stand by the protesting farmers," he said. Thousands of farmers are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a week against the new farm laws. They have also called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8. Talks between the government and protesting farmers remained inconclusive on Saturday even as union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws. Pawar said farmers from Punjab and Haryana contribute the most to the country's agriculture and food supply. "Farmers from these states not just fill our stomach but are also major contributors to India's supply of food grains, especially rice and wheat, to more than a dozen countries," he said. Pawar said when the threefarm bills were introduced in Parliament, all parties, except the BJP, had said the bills should not be passed in a hurried manner. The parties had sought a debate on the bills and demanded they be sent to the joint select committee. "But, the government did not listen, and now they will have to bear the consequences," he said. The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, he warned those who did not shun the path of violence to get prepared to be wiped "all-out". "J-K is the crown of India and our government is sincere to take the development in the region to the top as well. We will ensure electricity, water and better roads and no load shedding and darkness which is the hallmark of Congress and Gupkar gang," Hussain, who is the BJP national spokesperson, told reporters here. The former Union minister, who has been camping in the Kashmir valley for the last 15 days in connection with the ongoing District Development Council (DDC) elections, reached Jammu on Sunday morning. He is expected to campaign for the party candidates in different areas, including Doda, for the next three days before returning to the valley. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants a pen in the hands of the local youth… Leave the gun and pick up the pen as anyone indulging in terrorism will face (operation) all out," he said, lauding security agencies for busting a plan of terrorists to carry out a major strike in the country. He said the Modi government is fighting against militancy and those indulging in dividing the people. Describing as "encouraging" the response of the people to the party's campaign in the valley, Hussain said he held a "public meeting in a village which is the native place of Pakistan-based Hizbul Mujahideen second-in-command Amir Khan on Saturday". "We unfurled the BJP flag in the village and thousands of people attended the rally," he said. "The entire route from Srinagar to Anantnag was decorated with BJP flags. I talked to the people at the grass-roots level during my visit to nook and corner of the valley and they want development and better future for their children," he said, adding that it is only BJP which can fulfil their aspirations. Hussain said the BJP is getting support from everyone across the Union Territory. "The people in Jammu have always been with the party and BJP is living in their hearts. Our aim is to make J-K the tourism hub of the world," the BJP leader said, adding the BJP government would take the UT forward and ensure enough employment opportunities to the local youth. Referring to the battery of Union ministers flocking to Jammu and Kashmir to campaign for the DDC elections which are being held for the first time in the UT, Hussain said his party has taken this election seriously. "Our rivals have raised objections as to why BJP leaders, including Union ministers are coming to J-K to campaign for DDC polls. I want to tell them that we are all workers of the BJP, whatever the position in the government or in the party. We are workers and are on a campaign trail to make lotus bloom everywhere," he said. He asked why leaders of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) are not moving around. "They are not interested (in campaigning) and just indulge in making allegations. They should stop misleading the public," Shahnawaz said. He said the BJP aims to implement the three-tier Panchayati Raj System in Jammu and Kashmir. This election of DDC, we are seeking votes for development, dynastic free and corruption free J-K. We are focused on this," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-asks-militants-to-leave-guns-pick-up-pen-as-modi-govt-will-take-development-to-new-heights-924120.html

Kinnow, known for its distinct taste and quality and rich in Vitamin C, is facing export issues due to transport problems, an official said. Farmers and traders were already apprehensive due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and their woes increased after that the farmers' agitation started, the official said. Assistant Director of the Horticulture Department Priti Garg told PTI that due to the abundant and good availability of Vitamin C, there is good demand for kinnow in the country. "But this time there is a bumper crop of kinnow in the area, and the price is comparatively low," she said. According to department officials, prices are down due to transportation problems arising due to the coronavirus pandemic. Rajkumar Jain, president of the Kinnow Club, says, "Last season, the kinnow garden priced at Rs 17–18 per kg, but this time it is Rs 12 - 13 per kg even though the crop is bumper." Most of the gardens of kinnow are in Abohar, Fazilka of Punjab and in the Ganganagar district of Rajasthan. Ganganagari kinnow is exported from Gulf countries to Russia and New Zealand. According to Jain, there is a demand for this kinnow from Mumbai, Chennai and Chandigarh. Garg said that the area and production of kinnow orchards in Ganganagar district has increased steadily. In 2016-17, there were 10,228 hectares of kinnow orchards in the district and the production was 2.60 lakh tonnes. In this season 2020-21, there are more than 11,000 hectares of kinnow gardens and the production is also estimated to be more than 37 lakh tonnes. According to the officials of the Horticulture Department, this time the produce of kinnow is going to be 150- 190 quintal per hectare, which will be called bumper. Rajkumar Jain said that farmers and traders were already apprehensive due to the lockdown and their woes increased after that the farmers' agitation started.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kinnow-price-drop-raises-worries-for-growers-in-rajasthan-924136.html

Speaking to mediapersons here on Sunday, he said Union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ready to allay all doubts that the farmers have regarding the three farm Acts introduced by the government. “We have said it in the parliament and we are saying to the farmers during the negotiation meetings that all their demands will be met. There is no need for the farmers to stage a protest,” he said. However, when asked about the specific demands of farmers regarding the rollback of the three Acts, he said the issue will be discussed again by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the December 9 meeting. Congress backing protests against railway line doubling Pralhad Joshi also charged that the protests against the doubling of railway lines in Goa is backed by the Congress. “When Congress was in power, they wanted the project to be implemented. However, now they are opposing the development work,” he said, and added that for the economy of every state to grow they need power, and coal is one of the forms of energy. The railway line is needed to transport coal, he said. Joshi said the union government will be soon coming up policies to help the mining of minerals. “Natural resources are vital for revival of the economy and mining will be allowed only after getting environment and NGT clearance,” he said, and added that it would be the state government’s responsibility to moderate mining activities. He said mining of minerals will enhance the revenue of the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/withdraw-bharat-bandh-call-we-are-listening-pralhad-joshi-tells-farmers-924141.html

Venkatesh Nayak of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative had approached the ministry seeking details of the constitution and working of the expert group such as dates of meetings, a copy of the detailed agenda circulated in relation to every meeting, presentations made before its members, and material it had shared with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Nayak had also sought to know the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances payable to the chairperson and every member of the expert group and the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances actually paid to them. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) was constituted under the chairmanship of Member (Health) of Niti Aayog V K Paul on August 7 to prepare a strategy for the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine. The information on these points was not provided by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), saying the details of meeting, agenda and material circulated during the meetings do not come under the definition of "information" which can be shared under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The CPIO said that details of the amount of sitting fees and every other remuneration or allowances payable to the chairperson and other members of the expert group are not available with the immunisation section of the ministry. Nayak filed an appeal before a senior official in the ministry challenging the order of the CPIO. The official ruled that the CPIO does not have information and does not know where the information can be. The application was also transferred to the Indian Council of Medical Research and the MEA. The ICMR said it does not have information sought by Nayak. On the NEGVAC material shared with it, the MEA cited exemption clause of national security and related issues to deny the records. Nayak said both the CPIO and the first appellate authority not knowing about the physical location of NEGVAC's papers despite the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) servicing this body is "truly perplexing". "How can people's meaningful participation be ensured if the MoHFW does not place in the public domain details of NEGVAC's working. There is a statutory requirement of proactive information disclosure under Sections 4(1)(c) and 4(1)(d) of the RTI Act about NEGVAC's working. MoHFW and other public authorities involved in the vaccination roll-out plan have a statutory duty to make all facts and figures public along with the underlying reasoning for their decisions and actions under these provisions," Nayak said. He said he would approach the Central Information Commission to challenge "the actions and omissions of MoHFW and MEA".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-know-where-records-of-covid-19-vaccine-expert-group-are-kept-says-ministry-of-health-in-rti-reply-924149.html
06-12-2020||National||Our NRI family members are backing us, willing to send funds: Protesting farmers||Farmers protesting on both sides of Delhi-Haryana border have asserted that they are self-sufficient in carrying on their agitation against the new farm laws, with some saying their NRI relatives have also extended support to sustain the momentum of the demonstration. Drawn from several parts of Punjab, aggrieved farmers have converged on an unprecedented scale at Delhi's Singhu and Tikri borders, camping on roads and braving the cold at night to press for their demands. The peasant have come to the protest site stocked up with fruits, vegetables and other household items, and local residents and volunteer groups, besides members of a gurudwara nearby Singhu Border have been offering supplies to replenish the stock. Many farmers, who have been staying put at the site said their own families and others, who are non-resident Indians, have reached out and showed solidarity with the protesting peasants. "I have a family member living in Canada, and he called me to tell that he is there to support them with funds and other ways, as much as possible. In our village in Tarn Taran, many people have NRI family members, and they too have received support from them,"  said Naunihal Singh of Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Punjab. He rode from Patti in Tarn Taran district in Punjab, about 500 km from Delhi border, on a tractor, accompanied by about 20 other farmers, including a 'Nihang' Sikhs, on the day one of the protest. Punjab's farmers sow their seeds in India, but "our family members are scattered across the world," he said. A sizeable population of NRIs or foreign citizens of Indian-origin, with roots in Punjab, are based in Canada, including in Toronto and Vancouver; the UK, the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. Tarlochan Singh Safri, 54, sporting a bright blue turban, shiny pair of shades and a flowing white beard, sat in his Mitsubishi SUV, to charge his mobile phone, a Bharat Kisan Union flag placed in a seat corner. "Punjab has made sacrifices for India, always, whether as farmers or freedom fighters. Bhagat Singh gave up his life for Azadi, and so many youth from Punjab get enrolled in the armed forces everywhere. Some people are branding us as terrorists. Is that what our ancestors made the sacrifices for?," he asked. Safri, a farmer and a businessman said many of the protesting farmers, who have come to the border, have family members or friends who are NRIs, and they are prosperous families, but still they have come here to show solidarity with other farmers. "I have two of my family members in Canada. These are young generation, and they are telling, we should soldier on and not give up, and they are standing behind us. Some NRIs have sent money, others have pledged to send funds if needed. They are giving us big moral support, even if they are staying far away from their homeland," he asserted. On Saturday, it was yet another day of protest at Singhu and Tikri Border sites, even as farmers' leaders held another round of talk with the government representatives, seeking a way out of the crisis, even though the dialogue remained inconclusive. The hardships faced in reaching the protest site and the common demand of repealing of the new farm laws, have galvanised the farmers with a tremendous sense of solidarity and camaraderie. Some had to literally "move earth" and "push boulders" to overcome obstacles on the way to Delhi from Punjab, while other got a helping hand from their brethren in Haryana. Several farmers from Haryana wearing the trademark green 'pagdi' (turban) sat in circles around a traditional hukka that was rotated among them, as they also sought complete repeal of what they alleged was a "naya kala kanoon" that will "wreck" the lives of farmers. But support of NRIs have enthused the spirit of the protesting farmer, for many of whom now their tractor-trolleys are now their temporary homes, shared with others. The back of the tractor-trolley in which Naunihal Singh of Kisan Sangharsh Committee, and other fellow farmers came from Tarn Taran has a design of a flag of Canada embossed on it surrounded by two printed flags of Khalsa Panth. Many farmers, who did not wish to be named, said, some NRIs have already sent funds to farmers and others are helping through material and medical aid. At the protest site, fiery speeches, fluttering flags of Bharat Kisan Union and other peasant bodies, and spirited 'langars' that invited everyone to join in, added to the charged atmosphere. Cries of 'Saada Haq, Aithe Rakh', 'Jo Bole So Nihal' and 'Kisan Union Ekta Zindabad' rent the air throughout the day, as coloured turbans of protesting farmers added vibrancy to the scene of agitation. Many NRIs have taken to Twitter and other social media to express their solidarity with the protests and expressed their desire to extend help to farmers picketing at the border. "This is a struggle for our rights and for our dignity. We don't want to be the mercy of the corporate firms, we will take bullets but not buckle under any pressure of the government. We are proud farmers," said Safri.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/our-nri-family-members-are-backing-us-willing-to-send-funds-protesting-farmers-924167.html

Law Ministry officials said funds to the tune of Rs 5.21 crore were released in September to set up video-conference cabins, another Rs 28.886 crore were given in October to buy additional video conference equipment, including hardware, cables and monitors. The funds are provided by the e-committee of the Supreme Court and the Department of Justice in the Law Ministry. While India has 3,288 court complexes, which house thousands of subordinate courts, the funds have been released for 2,506 court complexes to set up video-conference cabins, they said. Bigger court complexes with a large number of courtrooms would get multiple cabins as compared to smaller complexes. The size of a court complex, including the number of courts it houses, depends upon the size or population of the state. As courts continue to hear cases online amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has procured 1,500 additional video conferencing licences at an approximate cost of Rs. nine crore for providing the facility for high courts and district courts. While the procurement has been completed, the process of installation is on, an official said. Such licences are required for legal and extended use of the video conference facility software, the official said. From the day the nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus till October 28, high courts and district courts across India have heard over 49.67 lakh cases virtually, according to data collated by the Law Ministry. The Centre had imposed the lockdown from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From June 8, it started gradually relaxing restrictions under ‘Unlock’. On April 6, the Supreme Court on Suo Motu authorised all the courts to adopt measures required to ensure robust functioning of the judicial system through the use of video conferencing technologies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/over-2500-court-complexes-to-get-video-conference-cabins-924173.html

The MHA also recently told the state police forces and prisons not to approach the foreign missions on their own bypassing the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and route all such communication only through proper channels. In letters to police and prison administrations across the country, the MHA said that the MEA has informed that information about the arrest/custody of a foreign national is to be provided to the consular post only if requested by the foreigner who is arrested or detained. "In the absence of such a request, there is no obligation to notify the consular post when a national of such country is arrested or detained, unless specifically provided," MHA Deputy Secretary Arun Sobti said in the letter. The MEA is the nodal Ministry in respect of consular and diplomatic issues with foreign Governments, The letter said that the willingness to inform the foreign diplomatic mission may be taken from a foreign national in the event of his arrest, detention, custody or imprisonment in India. Along with the information, it said, his willingness to inform his Diplomatic Mission must also be forwarded to the Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division, Ministry of External Affairs. "The information regarding arrest/detention/imprisonment of a foreign national is not to be conveyed by States/UTs to local diplomatic Missions directly and has to be always routed through the Ministry of External Affairs only," the letter added. The MHA had in August last year issued guidelines on providing consular access to foreign nationals in prisons, custody or detention. Consular access is granted to foreign Diplomats or consular officers to visit the nationals of their country, who are in prison, custody or detention, as and when any such request is received by the MEA from the missions. "Consular access is to be granted only on receipt of permission letters issued by the CPV Division of the Ministry of External Affairs who are authorized to issue such permission," the guidelines had said. Regular reports of arrest or detention of foreign nationals are to be provided to the CPV Division of the MEA. "Special attention may be paid to the fact that there should be no delay in intimation of the arrest of a foreign national to MEA and MHA," the guidelines had said. The states and union territories will also have to send regular quarterly and six-monthly reports about foreign nationals in jails or Detention Centres, including the crime and current status of their case to MEA and MHA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/states-should-not-directly-approach-foreign-missions-with-info-on-foreigners-in-custody-mha-924179.html
06-12-2020||National||BJP's cup of woes filled to the brim over farmers' protests||From Award Wapasi to regional parties' call for coming together in the name of federalism, the on-going protest over new farm laws could be a major political challenge for the BJP, especially at a time when it is betting big on the 2021 West Bengal Assembly polls and prepares for elections in three more states. After SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa returned their Padma awards, India's first Olympic medallist in boxing Vijender Singh on Sunday threatened to return his Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.  Others, who made similar announcements are former national boxing coach Gurbaksh Singh, who announced returning his Dronacharya Award, and also the winners of Bhartiya Sahitya Akademi Award in Punjabi Sirmour Shire Dr Mohanji, eminent thinker Dr Jaswinder Singh and Punjabi playwright and editor of Punjabi Tribune Swarajbir. As the media went viral with the news about the 'boxer' Vijender,  BJP general secretary (Organisation) B L Santhosh reminded Vijendra had contested elections on Congress ticket earlier. "Whole of media projecting it as boxer Vijender Singh in support of farmer agitation . Also, mention that he contested LS elections on @INCIndia  ticket. Convenient deletion of details," Santosh tweeted hours after the boxer turned Congress leader made an appearance at Delhi's Singhu border where farmers have been protesting against the laws and said he would return his Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award if the Central government does not withdraw the new farm laws. Five former sportspersons from Punjab--- Arjuna awardees Rajbir Kaur and Gurmail Singh, who played hockey, former wrestler Kartar Singh, ex-boxer Jaipal Singh and Dhyan Chand Award winner Ajit Singh also joined the protest at Singhu border on Sunday. More than the award wapsi, the greater challenge for BJP is the ability of the farmer issue in galvanising the Opposition together, with the agitation building bridges beyond caste and community lines and reviving the Opposition campaign on federal rights.  While Rahul Gandhi is trying to build a 'farmer OBC Dalit' axis, SAD MP Prem Singh Chandumajra after his meeting with Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday raised the issue of Central government's interference in state governments' rights in education, agriculture and law and order. It is more than a week since Delhi Chalo farmers' protest began and the stalemate between the government and the protesting farmers continues even after five rounds of talks as the government stares at a Bharat Bandh backed by Opposition parties on December 8 on this issue. Chandumajra stressed there is a need for regional parties to unite against attempts to centralise the country's politics because if states are weak, the country will be weaker. "Even Uddhav Thackeray is of the view that rights of states need to be protected," he said. The two former NDA allies, who quit Modi government in the last one year, talking of the coming together of regional parties at a time when most regional parties including TMC, DMK,  AAP and RJD have already extended support to Bharat Bandh and are raising the temperature on farm issue is not a welcome development for BJP, which has burnt its fingers at least twice in past over farm issues.  The first time the Modi government had to go back on its decision was in 2015 after it tried to bring changes in the 2013 Land Acquisition Act passed by the UPA that kicked up a political strom and nationwide protests. Again it was on the backfoot after the killing of six farmers in a police firing in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh in 2018 after which it lost the Assembly polls in the state next year.  In West Bengal, where the BJP is betting big, Mamata Banerjee had come to power in 2011 ending the 34-year-rule of CPI-M by launching a fierce farmers' agitation in Nandigram and Singur. As the farmers' protest began last week, Mamata was quick to sense the mood and immediately declared her support to the farmers. Farm issue is a sensitive issue in rural Bengal. NCP leader Sharad Pawar has also cautioned the Centre that if the deadlock continues, the agitation would no longer be a Delhi centric affair and will be joined by people elsewhere in the country as well.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjps-cup-of-woes-filled-to-the-brim-over-farmers-protests-924189.html

Hopefully, in the 75th year of independence (2022), Parliament session will be held in the new building,” Birla said. He said that as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for lawmakers of both the Houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan. Here's all you need to know about the new building: The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project. The new building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. The structure will be built at a total estimated cost of Rs 971 crore. The Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building in September, 2020 at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at the time of bidding. The new building was designed by an Ahmedabad-based firm - HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, who have also designed the Gujarat High Court. The design will integrate 'indigenous architecture', involving nearly 2,000 workers for construction, 200 artists, and 9,000 others periphrastically, from different parts of the country, according to reports. According to Om Birla, the new Parliament will have four floors - basement, ground, first and second floors in the new building. Its height will be the same as the old building. The building will have a total of 120 office spaces including committee rooms and major offices. In the new structure, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members. Apart from the two Sabhas, the building will also include spaces for a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas. Ample parking space is also to be provided. Meanwhile, the existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces and conserved as an archaeological property of India.

RLP convenor and MP Hanuman Beniwal made the announcement on Sunday. Congress leader Sachin Pilot also supported the Bharat Bandh call, saying that all should raise their voice for their rights. "Farmers struggling for their rights have called for a Bharat Bandh on December 8. We all should raise our voice for the rights of farmers," Pilot said in a tweet. "The unsuccessful dialogue between the central government and the farmers is a sign that the BJP wants to hollow out India's agricultural foundation," he added. Talks between the government and protesting farmers remained inconclusive on Saturday even after five rounds of discussions as the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws, forcing the Centre to call for another meeting on December 9 to resolve the deadlock. The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained that MSP and Mandi mechanisms will stay.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rlp-extends-support-to-farmers-bharat-bandh-call-924199.html

The farmers’ organisations accused the government of trying to push various ideas for a compromise when there is no such possibility as they are firm on the demand for the repeal of the three farm laws. “The laws were forced despite opposition, yet it is incorrectly being argued that farmers are adamant. Truth is that the Govt. is adamant and it should listen to the farmers’ voice,” the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said. The farmer leaders held a meeting on Sunday to discuss the outcome of the meeting with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar-led ministerial team on Saturday. It was decided that the farmer leaders would attend the next round of talks with the government on Wednesday and continue with their agitation till the three farm laws were repealed and the plans to amend the Electricity Act shelved. Farmers from various states have been marching towards the national capital, blocking four national highways and more farmer groups from Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan were expected to reach Delhi in the coming days. The farmers protest entered the 11th day on Sunday and received support from transport unions and sportspersons, with the latter threatening to return their state honours if the laws were not repealed. Boxer-turned-politician Vijender Singh visited the protest site at the Singhu border with Haryana and announced that he would return the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Puraskar – India’s highest sporting honour – if the government failed to repeal the farm sector reforms.

The decision came after opposition parties, including many regional outfits such as the Samajwadi Party, came out in strong support of the 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting on Delhi's borders for 11 days demanding the repeal of the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. In the statement issued here, the Samajwadi Party said the youth and farmers from different districts will take out anti-government rallies to inform people about the "bad policies" of the BJP government of the state. Yadav will travel on a tractor from Thathia to Tirwa, covering almost 13 kilometres. "Under the BJP's rule, the farmers have faced injustice the most. The BJP is selling mandis and the farmers are not even getting the minimum support price of paddy. The prices of fertilisers and pesticides have gone up. The BJP government has shown an insensitive attitude towards farmers," the SP said in the statement. "The three farm laws, which the Centre had passed puts the ownership of land of the farmers at risk. They are being forced to go for corporate farming," the statement said. Akhilesh Yadav also on Sunday paid tributes to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar at the party office on his death anniversary. "Today, the atmosphere is that the rights of the citizens are getting snatched. Games are being played with the 'annadata' (farmers). The farmers have gathered at the border of Delhi. The BJP has got the votes of the poor and farmers, so it must listen to them. But, the irony is that the BJP wants to give an opportunity to the industrialists," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/samajwadi-party-to-organise-farmer-rallies-in-all-districts-of-uttar-pradesh-on-monday-924209.html

Sanjay Chandra was released on interim bail from Tihar Jail on Friday after 43 months after a Delhi court gave him relief on medical grounds. The company is facing multiple probes by several agencies including Delhi Police, CBI and the ED. Chandra's alleged role had also figured in the 2G Spectrum scam but he was acquitted by the trial court.  The Canara Bank has alleged that the company had been availing credit facilities from it on the basis of personal and corporate guarantees from Chandras.  Later, due to low demand in the housing market, the company started defaulting on payments. The government had taken over control of the company and the Supreme Court had ordered a forensic audit by Grant Thorton into the company's finances.  It emerged in the forensic audit that the company has diverted, siphoned off and misappropriated funds.  "Out of of Rs 1,4270 crores collected from 29,800 homebuyers, around Rs 5063.05 crore was potentially not utilised for the construction and execution of the 74 identified projects. "Similarly Unitech availed Rs 1805.86 crore from six financial institutions, out of which Rs 763 crore was not utilised for projects," the bank alleged in its complaint which is now part of the FIR. The audit also showed that between 2007 and 2010, the company made investments of over Rs 1,745 crore in Cyprus, a tax haven. The report showed alleged unexplained write-off of investments and advances to related parties, diversion of funds to offshore tax havens and related companies, it said. The company allegedly committed a breach of trust and created false ownership in favour of a third party without the knowledge of mortgagee, the bank alleged.  The bank alleged that the company has misappropriated Rs 198 crore of public money.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-books-unitech-md-family-members-in-canara-bank-fraud-case-carries-out-searches-924221.html

From Award Wapasi to regional parties' call for coming together in the name of federalism, the on-going protest over new farm laws could be a major political challenge for the BJP, especially at a time when it is betting big on the 2021 West Bengal Assembly polls and prepares for elections in three more states. After SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa returned their Padma awards, India's first Olympic medallist in boxing Vijender Singh on Sunday threatened to return his Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award.   Opposition parties on Sunday declared support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call on December 8 by agitating farmers demanding repeal of the farm sector reforms, even as Akali Dal leaders reached out to regional parties to build a coalition against the ruling NDA. Main opposition party Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, TRS, Trinamool Congress declared their “whole-hearted” support to the nationwide shutdown call and issued directions to party units to hold protests on Tuesday to express solidarity with the farmers. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP, Trinamool Congress, Left parties too have declared support to the Bharat Bandh, while Akali Dal, which was an ally of the BJP till September, was reaching out to the regional parties to form a coalition against the ruling NDA.   NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday asked the Centre to take serious cognisance of the ongoing farmers' protest and said if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting cultivators. Talking to reporters here, Pawar said when the farmers are protesting on streets, it should be taken seriously. "But, unfortunately, that is not happening," the former Union agriculture minister said.   West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday alleged that the Trinamool Congress government is distancing itself from rule of law and the governance in the state is "getting away" from the path of the Constitution. He said that a "huge blow is being struck on the soul of Dr B R Ambedkar", the chief architect of the Indian Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-boxer-vijender-singh-threatens-to-return-khel-ratna-924223.html

Chowdhury said the three laws are “anti-farmer” and corporate-friendly, and they will end up "hurting" farmers' earnings. "I request you not to make this a prestige issue,” he said in a letter to the prime minister. “The government must bow to the supreme will and aspirations of the people and accordingly repeal the farm laws at the earliest, as the livelihood of millions of farmers is at stake," he said. Meanwhile, Congress MPs from Punjab have planned a protest at Jantar Mantar for convening an early session of Parliament to repeal the farm laws. The Congress has also extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' call given by farmer unions seeking the repeal of farm laws. Chowdhury said in his letter that through these contentious laws, the Minimum Support Price guarantee, farmers' safety net since the Green Revolution of 1960s, is being "snatched away" under the pretext of giving them more playing ground and better platforms to sell their produce. The government has reiterated at multiple occasions that the new laws will not touch the MSP regime and also that these legislations will help farmers raise their incomes. "The bills have not been discussed in the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture and have been hurriedly passed amid ruckus through a voice vote. "I may like to remind you that the essence of a democracy is 'government of the people, by the people and for the people'. There have been many precedents of repeal of the bills/laws passed by Parliament," the senior Congress leader told the prime minister. In 2013, Chowdhury said, Parliament enacted the historic Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act (LARR Act), which repealed and replaced the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, following decades of conflict over compulsory acquisition of land under the 1894 Act. Similarly, the Mental Health Care Act was passed in 2017, superseding the Mental Health Act, 1987, he said. Meanwhile, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu separately wrote to the Delhi Police seeking permission to protest at the Jantar Mantar on Monday to demand the convening of a special session of Parliament to repeal the farm laws. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said since the passage of the farm laws, the Congress has been demanding a legal guarantee on MSP, continuance of food grain procurement through government agencies, barring the entry of corporates and respecting the states' right to legislate. "The farmers are demanding the same and want the Farm Laws repealed. I am happy that the Congress has supported the call of the farmers for a Bharat Bandh. The people of India must support the Bharat Bandh too," he said on Twitter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/repeal-farm-laws-dont-make-it-a-prestige-issue-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-writes-to-pm-924233.html

The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. "The laws are unconstitutional and illegal," Dave told PTI and added that he has offered to represent farmers "pro bono" in courts of law if they wish to challenge these statutes. "It would be advisable in the larger interest of the farmers and the country that either the government issues a notification stopping the implementation of the Act till the talks take place or the Supreme Court takes up the matter and grants the stay then we can save the lives of the farmers and the agony that they are going through," the senior lawyer said.   It is pertinent to mention that the top court has already decided to hear pleas of RJD MP Manoj Jha and DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, and one by Rakesh Vaishnav of Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress challenging the constitutional validity of the three laws.

A crowd of demonstrators converged on the Indian embassy, located on Aldwych, a major artery in the centre of the British capital, and groups marched around the Trafalgar Square area, a Reuters photographer at the scene said. Tens of thousands of farmers have protested in India against three laws the government says are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and give growers more options to sell their produce. Farmers fear the legislation, passed in September, will eventually dismantle India's regulated markets and stop the government from buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. Britain is home to a large Indian diaspora and many Britons who trace their family roots to India are strongly engaged with news from the country. There was little social distancing in evidence at the London protests and few participants were wearing face masks. The Metropolitan Police warned that people taking part in a gathering that did not respect Covid-19 restrictions risked being fined, and called on people to leave the area.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/thousands-protest-against-farm-laws-outside-indian-high-commission-in-london-924241.html
06-12-2020||National Politics||Rajinikanth: Mass hero faces the political 'acid test'||The fire in his eyes, the innate style quotient and an electrifying presence on the screen made Rajinikanth a phenomenon in the Indian film arena. From an ordinary bus conductor to the superstar of the celluloid world and the highest-paid actor in the country, Rajinikanth has seen the best of what life had to offer. And now at 70, the superstar wants to test his charisma among the people who worshipped him when he appeared on screen and spent sleepless nights to watch the first-day-first-show of his films at the dawn. He wants to “change Tamil Nadu’s fate” by taking the formal plunge in politics. While it is too early to assess the impact that he can make, many believe Rajinikanth’s time in politics was a quarter-century ago in 1996 and not in 2021. He could have easily repeated the magic of M G Ramachandran or N T Ramarao if he had listened to his well-wishers like veteran politician G K Moopanar and the venerable Cho Ramaswamy. The atmosphere then was conducive. J Jayalalithaa’s popularity was at its lowest, and Rajinikanth’s statement that even God cannot save Tamil Nadu if AIADMK came back to power echoed across the state. The actor ended up backing the DMK and Moopanar’s TMC, helping Karunanidhi make a comeback as chief minister. Rajinikanth was hesitant then—his film career was at its prime and he was in his mid-40s. His indecisiveness lasted till 2017, till Jayalalithaa died and Karunanidhi was confined to his home. Rajinikanth seems to have developed cold feet more than once even after an announcement in 2017 declaring his political entry, apparently realising that he may not be able to win over people just by his popularity. The suspense, however, came to an end, on December 3. Born into a Kannada-speaking Maharashtrian family in south Bengaluru as the youngest son of Ranoji Rao-Rama Bai couple, Shivaji Rao Geikwad’s transformation into Rajinikanth is self-made, of course, with help from his elder brother Sathyanarayana Geikwad and friend Raja Bahadur, who was his colleague in the then Bangalore Transport Service (BTS). Veteran K Balachandar introduced Rajinikanth in his 1975-film Aboorva Raagangal.  S P Muthuraman and J Mahendran among others brought the best out of the actor. Rajinikanth mastered the art of marketing himself as a mass hero who stands up against evil by imitating the legendary MGR as the “do-gooder”. As he nursed political ambitions, dialogues laced with politically-loaded messages in his movies kept everyone guessing about his moves for about a decade. But his 2002-film Baba bombing at the box office and his appeal to his fans to defeat candidates of PMK failing to impact 2004 elections, Rajinikanth’s films underwent a shift, getting rid of political messages or content. His critics say he always endeared himself to those in power and refrained from attacking them. Even  his current advisor Tamilaruvi Manian had used harsh words as recently as in 2017 to take a dig at Rajinikanth’s “neutrality.” Some point to his Kannada origins to take a dig at him. Rajinikanth is a man who never let his stardom come in the way of remaining close to his roots. He is known for walking the extra mile to help people who helped him. Though he lives in a palatial bungalow in Chennai’s Poes Garden, he visits the modest Hanumanthnagar house in Bengaluru, where he grew up when he is in the city. Rajinikanth stuck to his vintage ambassador car for long despite the best vehicles in the town adorning his garage. A senior journalist recalls that Rajinikanth would drive the ambassador himself after it went dark to meet Cho. Ramaswamy at his office. As he makes an effort to position himself as a politician, Rajinikanth faces a challenge. His statements on several issues were not taken lightly by people in the last three years. The term ‘spiritual politics’ which he promises to follow bewildered many. He is perceived close to the BJP, and might not sway the voters today as he would have had 25 years ago. The actor is now not in the best of his health. Rajinikanth’s mass appeal was never in doubt on celluloid. His charisma will face the acid test in the 2021 elections. The man believes in miracles. He had termed his ascension from a bus conductor to a superstar as one. Another miracle, in the offing? As Rajini often says, only God knows.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rajinikanth-mass-hero-faces-the-political-acid-test-923962.html

The BJP national general secretary accused the TMC government of not being sympathetic to the cause of the refugees. "We are hopeful that the process of granting citizenship to refugees under the CAA will begin from January next year," he told reporters on the sidelines of the party's 'Aar Noy Anyay' (no more injustice) campaign in North 24 Parganas district. "The Centre has passed the CAA with the honest intention of granting citizenship to persecuted refugees coming to our country from neighbouring nations," he added. Reacting to Vijayvargiya's comment, senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said that the BJP is trying to fool the people of West Bengal. "What does the BJP mean by citizenship? If the Matuas are not citizens, how come they voted in assembly and parliamentary polls year after year? The BJP should stop fooling the people of West Bengal," he said. The Matuas, originally hailing from East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh), started migrating to West Bengal in the 1950s, mostly due to religious persecution. The community, with an estimated population of 30 lakh in the state, influences results in at least four Lok Sabha seats and 30-40 assembly constituencies in Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas districts. A section of state BJP leadership is apprehensive that the delay and confusion over CAA implementation might turn refugee voters, especially the Matua community, against BJP in the 2021 assembly elections due in April-May next year. The community had voted hands down in favour of the BJP during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, party sources said. The CAA seeks to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi refugees who have come to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/caa-likely-to-be-implemented-from-january-vijayvargiya-924037.html

A large car caravan of protesters from various parts of California blocked the traffic on the Bay Bridge on Saturday as they moved towards the Indian Consulate in San Francisco, while several hundred gathered in downtown Indianapolis. The protesters at both places demanded the new laws be repealed, saying they would push Indian farmers towards poverty and give the corporate sectors a monopoly. "Farmers are the soul of any nation. We must protect our soul. People around the world, including many cities in the US and Canada, have come together to dispose of the bills that will open India's agricultural market to the private sector; allowing major corporations to take over independent farming communities and dilute crops’ market value," said Indiana-based Gurinder Singh Khalsa. Khalsa was one of the organizers of the rally in downtown Indianapolis attended by nearly 500 Sikh Americans from various parts of Indiana. Thousands of farmers are protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September. A day earlier, there was a gathering of Sikh-Americans in Chicago and a protest rally in front of the Indian Embassy in Washington DC. Another one is planned on Sunday. "No Farmers, No Food" and "Save the farmers" were the commonly-sighted posters at these peaceful protest rallies. "This is a peaceful protest and should serve as a loud and clear message to the Indian government. We must support our farmers," said Amandeep Singh Hundal in Indian. "This is not a request to the Indian government, rather a demand to take all three bills back," said another Sikh leader Darshan Singh Darar. The protest in Bay Area was organized by the Jakara Movement, a California-based organization that seeks to strengthen community engagement and build empowerment by focusing on issues of civic engagement, education, health, and social justice. Organizers said the caravan protest taking place on Sunday in the Bay Area - along with similar recent protests in New York, Houston, Michigan, Chicago, and Washington, DC - was meant as a show of solidarity, as Sikhs around the world urge international condemnation of the farm bills. "Without farmers, there is no food. Without farming, there is no livelihood for the millions of people in Punjab who have relied on farming as a source of income for generations. "These issues are deeply intertwined, and we will raise our voices to ensure that the families from Punjab who are putting their lives on the line to protest in Delhi can do so without facing threats from the Indian government," said Naindeep Singh, executive director of the Jakara Movement. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for the last eleven days at the borders of Delhi against three farm laws. Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislation would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sikh-americans-hold-protest-rallies-in-us-cities-against-farm-laws-in-india-924047.html

Speaking at the 'Global Heritage Series' organised by SPIC MACAY, he said there are many areas of convergence and collaboration between SPIC MACAY and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations – to try and bridge the gap between the classical and the popular. "Tradition must coexist with modernity. I am aware that systems alone cannot foster creativity. Even so, our constant endeavor must be to act as enablers of the youth — many of whom have tuned in today," he said on Saturday. Indian culture and art are integral to India's soft power, Shringla said. "Artists dedicated to Indian art forms are not merely performers but brand ambassadors who have been taking our rich cultural heritage to the global audience," he said. "At a personal level, I recall as a student at Delhi University the privilege of getting access to our best classical artists free of cost in open-air concerts of SPIC MACAY. It has been both a privilege and pleasure to have hosted some of our most distinguished artists in various diplomatic missions where I have served," Shringla said. He also reaffirmed the support of the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian missions abroad to SPIC MACAY's efforts to showcase India's classical art forms globally. "As we start to recover from the grasp of COVID-19, we look back to find that in times of crises people need nurturing of the soul," Shringla said. "We are reminded of the important role of art in giving people hope. The disruption caused by the pandemic has driven many of us to reimagine art and art forms. Taking art online has become a necessity," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/indias-culture-art-integral-to-its-soft-power-fs-shringla-924050.html

Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country have been camping at Delhi's borders for the past 10 days to demand a repeal of the agriculture reform laws. The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform commuters about alternative routes open for travelling to the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. It advised those commuting to Delhi to come via the DND instead of Noida Link road. Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to the farmers' protest near Gautam Budh Dwar. "The Ghazipur border on NH 24 is closed for traffic from Ghaziabad to Delhi due to farmers' protests. People are advised to avoid NH 24 for coming to Delhi and use Apsara/Bhopra/DND for coming to Delhi," it tweeted. Tikri and Jharoda borders are closed for traffic movement but Badusarai border is open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two-wheelers, it said. "Singhu, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh borders are closed. NH 44 is closed on both sides," the police said. It advised commuters to take alternate routes via Safiabad, Saboli, NH8, Bhopra, Apsara borders, and Peripheral expressway. People traveling to Haryana can take Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said. Enacted in September, the three farm laws are anticipated to bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop. The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to occupy toll plazas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farmers-protest-delhi-traffic-police-suggests-alternative-routes-to-enter-exit-city-924062.html

The representatives of thousands of agitating farmers, who are sitting on various borders of the national capital since November 26, have said their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 would be observed with full force. Addressing the media at the AICC headquarters here, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, "I would also like to announce that the Congress party extends its whole-hearted support to the Bharat Bandh on December 8." Former party chief Rahul Gandhi, through tractor rallies, signature campaigns and Kisaan rallies, has been raising the party's voice in support of the farmers, he said. "All our district headquarters and Pradesh headquarters will participate in this bandh. They will hold demonstrations and ensure that the bandh is successful," Khera said. "The entire world is witnessing the plight of our farmers. The entire world is seeing the horrible sight of farmers sitting outside the capital in the middle of the night in winters waiting for the government to listen to them," he said. The Congress spokesperson slammed the government for bringing the new farm laws and asked what was the hurry in enacting the legislation."In the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government in June surreptitiously brings ordinances, what was the hurry, the entire country was focussed on the fallout of Covid-19, the economic, social, health fallout, but the government was busy surreptitiously bringing ordinances to help its industrialist-corporate friends," Khera alleged. "Where was the need to bring these legislations so fast, you suspended the opposition parties from Parliament, you did not follow parliamentary procedure and hurried through the passing of the bills, why was the hurry," he said. Khera alleged that the government did not take the farmers into confidence and was now "hiding behind" the interest of the farmers. "If you were really bothered about the interest of the farmers, you would have taken their advice before coming up with these legislations," he said."What we are seeing today is the result of a conspiracy between the government and its corporate friends, wherein the victim would be the farmer, and the farmer knows this," Khera claimed. Talks between the government and protesting farmers remained inconclusive on Saturday even after five rounds of discussions as union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws and went on a 'maun vrat' seeking a clear 'yes or no' reply, forcing the Centre to call for another meeting on December 9 to resolve the deadlock. The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farm-laws-congress-backs-farmers-bharat-bandh-call-on-december-8-924064.html
06-12-2020||National Politics||Thackeray, SAD on same page over rights of states: Chandumajra||Shiromani Akali Dal MP Prem Singh Chandumajra on Sunday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray agrees with his party on the issue of the Centre's alleged interference into the "rights of state governments" in fields like education, agriculture and law and order. Talking to reporters here, Chandumajra, who met the chief minister here on Sunday, said Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, supported the Akali Dal's stand on the farmers' protest. Alleging that revenues of states were being diluted, Chandumajra said there was a need for regional parties to unite against "attempts to centralise" the country's politics. The Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP after the Maharashtra Assembly polls last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) quit the BJP-led NDA in September this year to protest against the Centre's new agri- marketing laws. Thousands of farmers are sitting on various borders of New Delhi since November 26 against the laws and have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8. "If states are strong, the nation will be stronger. If states are weak, the country will be weaker. Today, the country's political system is being centralised. The Shiromani Akali Dal is for federalism," Chandumajra said. "Even Uddhav Thackeray is of the view that rights of states need to be protected," he said. Regional parties need to be united, the leader said. "Thackeray agrees with the Akali Dal on the issue of central government's interferencein state governments' rights in education,agriculture and law and order," he said, while alleging that "revenues of states are being diluted". Chandumajra met Thackeray at 'Varsha', the official residence of Maharashtra's chief minister here. He said Thackeray supported the Akali Dal's stand on the ongoing farmers' protest. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. "We want the ongoing talks to succeed. Otherwise, all political parties should unite in two weeks and discuss the future strategy. Laws for farmers were made without asking them. People for whom the laws are made are angry and are protesting on roads," Chandumajra said. He said parties will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind on the issue. "Political parties will meet to discuss the future strategy. Thackeray agreed to attend the political parties' meeting in Delhi," he said. Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister's Office here said the Akali Dal leader stressed during the meeting that the farm laws were against the interests of farmers. Thackeray said farmers are the "backbone of the country" and resolving their problems and difficultiesshould be the government's priority, as per the statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/thackeray-sad-on-same-page-over-rights-of-states-chandumajra-924089.html

But what transpired between us can’t be disclosed to the media,” said Kushwaha, confirming that the meeting took place a couple of days ago. Amid speculations of his 'ghar wapsi' (home coming), Bihar JD (U) president Bashishtha Narayan Singh said, “Both the leaders - Nitish Kumar and Upendra Kushwaha - belong to the same branch (read: Socialist). What’s wrong if there is a reunion between them?” Kushwaha, who served as a Union Minister in Narendra Modi government for five years before quitting the NDA on the eve of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, had been in the political wilderness ever since he joined the RJD-led Mahagatbandhan. Neither his pocket organisation RLSP could win a single Lok Sabha seat in Bihar in 2019 nor could it romp home in any of the Assembly constituencies in 2020, despite the fact that Kushwaha left the Mahagatbandhan and joined hands with Mayawati’s BSP. Decimated in the state where he was once Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly (2004-05), Kushwaha now apparently wants to return to Nitish’s bandwagon – JD(U), at a time when Nitish too has been weakened by his ‘enemy within’. Kushwaha’s support for Nitish was apparent last week when he slammed Tejashwi Yadav for using unparliamentary language against Nitish in the Bihar Assembly. “The uncultured language used against a Chief Minister should be condemned by all. If anyone uses such language against Nitish, I will be the first one to defend him (CM),” averred Kushwaha, giving rise to the speculation that he may rejoin the JD(U). Kushwaha, however, remained non-committal on his party’s merger plan with the JD(U), although ruling party sources say that RLSP could eventually merge with the JD(U) and strengthen Nitish’s hands.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kushwaha-meets-nitish-fuels-speculation-of-ghar-wapsi-924091.html

Congress leaders, who were part of the gathering that was capped at 50 people at a time as per the permission granted by authorities in view of the coronavirus outbreak, demanded that the Centre scrap these newly-introduced laws as they did not benefit farmers. The Congress' Gujarat in charge Rajeev Satav and state unit leaders like Amit Chavda, Bharatsinh Solanki, Arjun Modhwadia, Paresh Dhanani and Hardik Patel were part of the dharna that was observed between 10am and 5pm. Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda said the laws and protests against it nationwide had exposed the Narendra Modi government's anti-farmer policies and intention to hand over the agriculture sector to a handful of corporates. "The BJP is creating company raj in the country to benefit its corporate friends. This will finish off farmers. All segments of society are supporting the protests as these laws intend to snatch farmers' rights," he said. He said the Union government "was firing tear gas (on protesters)" instead of finding a just solution. Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said his party would support the 'Bharat bandh' call given by protesters on December 8, and farm representatives from here will go to Delhi to lend support. Protests are being held at several places against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gujarat-congress-holds-dharna-against-centres-new-farm-laws-924194.html

"All other political parties have become confined to families, whereas ours is a party which in itself is one big family," he said. "We are an ideology-based party that does not discriminate between classes, castes and religions," Nadda said. Underlining the key role of the cadre in the party, he said even a booth level worker can be seen rising to eminent positions only in the BJP.   "Our cadre base is our speciality and it is built through booth committees," Nadda said at the meeting where he shared the dais with  Pradesh BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat, district president Sita Ram Bhatt, Mandal president Vijendra  Thapliyal and booth president Sonia Verma. Presided by Verma, the meeting was termed as "historic" by the party. It is for the first time in the country's political history that the national president of a party shared the dais with the presidents of mandal and booth committees -  two primary units of the party, Pradesh BJP vice president Devendra Bhasin said. Nadda said booth committees are crucial as they bring the voter to polling booths. "We in the BJP believe that if a booth is won the election is won," he said asking party workers to work collectively to strengthen the organisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/all-political-parties-family-centric-except-bjp-j-p-nadda-924198.html

The farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders for the past 11 days, demanding the repeal of the farm reforms. BJP leader B L Santhosh said that political parties such as NCP, DMK had strongly pushed for reforms in the agriculture sector but are now opposing the changes ushered in by the Modi government. Santhosh, BJP General Secretary (organisation), shared a letter written by the then Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar in 2010 to the then Delhi Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit advocating private participation for opening “alternative competitive marketing channels” in the farm sector. He also shared the DMK manifesto for the 2016 assembly elections, promising changes to allow farmers to sell their produce directly without any middlemen at market-determined prices. “They promise in 2016. They oppose in 2020. Hypocrites of the worst order,” Santhosh said. He also shared news reports of farmers protests in Punjab and Haryana in 2008 demanding revocation of ban on the private sector in the purchase of wheat and allowing corporate participation in the procurement of farm produce. “This was in 2008. Farmers of Punjab and Haryana demanding allowing of corporates in Agri-marketing. Just understand the duplicity of the same unions now,” Santhosh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-hits-out-at-opposition-for-backing-farmers-bharat-bandh-call-924208.html

Representatives of thousands of agitating farmers are sitting on various borders of the national capital since November 26 demanding repeal of the three agri laws. "A country is not run by stubborn attitude. It is rather run through dialogue, consultation and communication (with stakeholders). But our prime minister's attitude is like a dictator. He wants to run the country like a dictator," he said. "He thinks that the decision, which has been taken cannot be changed or amended irrespective of the fact whether it (decision) is right or wrong," the AICC general secretary told reporters here. Rubbishing the allegations, spokesman of Bihar BJP Nikhil Anand described the statement as "absurd and baseless". "The Congress should manage its own house. The BJP and PM Modi have promoted the system of dialogue and consultation in order to strengthen the democratic system in the country," Anand said. Talks between the government and protesting farmers remained inconclusive on Saturday even after five rounds of discussions as union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws and went on a 'maun vrat' seeking a clear 'yes or no' reply, forcing the Centre to call for another meeting on December 9 to resolve the deadlock. The farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained that MSP and Mandi mechanisms will stay. Mentioning that the PM "did not take anyone into confidence" while taking three major decisions which have adversely affected the common people, the senior Congress leader said that the PM took "unilateral decision" on "demonetization, GST and farm bills". The Bihar Congress would launch a movement in the state as the condition of farmers is "deplorable" because of the abolition of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in 2006, Anwar said. Meanwhile, the Bihar Congress farmers cell passed a resolution to install Rahul Gandhi as the Congres president again as the entire country, especially farmers and labourers, are looking upto him to take up leadership to fight for their rights, the AICC general secretary said. The Congress has already extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' called on December 8 by farmer unions against the new agri-marketing laws. Bihar Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha asked party workers at all levels to participate in the 'Bharat Bandh'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-wants-to-run-india-like-dictator-three-farm-bills-adversely-affected-interests-of-farmers-congress-924219.html

Sharing the content of some letters he had written to various chief ministers, the sources claimed that the BJP-led NDA government has made the same set of changes in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act as pushed by Pawar when he was the union minister. Pawar is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on December 9 over the ongoing farmers' protest against the new agrarian laws after the NCP joined other opposition parties in supporting the 'Bharat Bandh' called on December 8 by farmer unions, which have demanded the repeal of the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. The government sources said Pawar in a 2010 letter to the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit that the agriculture sector needs well-functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural area of the country. "This requires huge investments in marketing infrastructure including cold-chain. And for this, private sector participation is essential, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment needs to be in place," his letter said, calling for amending the state APMC Act. In a letter on similar lines to the then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Pawar had underlined the need for investments in post-harvest and marketing infrastructure from the farm gate to the consumer and said "private sector needs to play an important role in this regard". Earlier on Sunday, Pawar asked the Centre to take serious cognisance of the ongoing farmers' protest and said if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting farmers. The ruling BJP has accused the opposition of playing politics on the matter and noted that the manifesto of the main opposition party, the Congress, had also batted for some of the reforms the Modi government has ushered in. Prominent opposition leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, DMK chief M K Stalin and PAGD chairman Farooq Abdullah issued a joint statement on Sunday supporting the call for Bharat Bandh on December 8 by farmer groups and pressed the Centre to meet the legitimate demands of the protesters. Protesting farmer unions have demanded the repeal of all three laws Parliament had passed in the last session. The government has been holding talks with union leaders, and the next round of dialogue is scheduled for December 9.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sharad-pawar-as-agriculture-minister-sought-amendment-in-apmc-act-role-for-private-sector-govt-sources-924220.html

The country's last spotted cheetah died in Chhattisgarh in 1947. Later, the cheetah — which is the fastest land mammal — was declared extinct in India in 1952. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) some years back prepared a cheetah re-introduction project. The Supreme Court in January this year gave its approval to introduce African cheetahs to suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis. A WII team some days back visited the Kuno Palpur sanctuary in MP's Sheopur district, the Nauradehi sanctuary in Sagar district, the Gandhi Sagar sanctuary on the northern boundary of Mandsaur and Neemuch districts and the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri district, the official said. "WII's faculty of wildlife science dean Dr Y V Jhala and two other scientists inspected the four places to evaluate whether these habitats are conducive for cheetahs," Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, wildlife wing, J S Chauhan, told PTI. The home for cheetahs would be picked up considering their prey base, safety and topography. "Madhya Pradesh had in the past been home to cheetahs. The state has a long conservation history; we have the habitat. We also have a successful trans-location record," Chauhan said, referring to the tiger reintroduction program in the Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR) in 2009. MP houses six major tiger reserves, including Bandhavgarh, Pench and Kanha tiger reserves. "For the cheetah re-introduction, many things stand in our favour. We have already written to the central government that we are very much interested (in the plan)," Chauhan said. The animal is considered vulnerable under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)s red list of threatened species, with a declining population of less than 7,000 found primarily in African savannas. The Supreme Court earlier this year set up a three-member committee to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority on the cheetah re-introduction project. The panel has asked the WII to carry out a technical evaluation of all possible sites for the reintroduction of cheetah in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/wii-experts-evaluate-sites-in-madhya-pradesh-for-cheetah-reintroduction-924010.html
06-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality very poor, likely to improve||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Sunday, and is likely to improve over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed. The air quality had turned “severe” on Saturday with slow wind speed allowing accumulation of "locally-generated" pollutants, according to officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The city's air quality index (AQI) was 394 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 404 on Saturday, which falls in the severe category. It was 382 on Friday, 341 on Thursday, 373 on Wednesday, 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 430), Greater Noida (404) and Noida (404) remained in the “severe” zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The wind speed remained slow allowing accumulation of pollutants generated locally, V K Soni, the head of IMD's environment research centre, said. “Easterly winds carrying moisture also led to formation of secondary particulate matter. All these factors together pushed the air quality in the 'severe' zone,” he said. However, Soni said, the air quality is likely to be in the “poor” category by Monday due to an expected increase in the wind speed. According to the IMD, the maximum wind speed is likely to be 8 kmph on Sunday and 15 kmph on Monday. The minimum temperature was 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is likely to settle around 28 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said Delhi recorded a rise in the maximum and minimum temperature in the last few days which can be attributed to light, warm easterly winds and plenty of sunshine during daytime due to clear skies. The city is likely to record above normal temperatures till November 10, he said. However, Palawat said a fresh Western Disturbance will trigger moderate to heavy snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and upper reaches of Uttarakhand. After the WD withdraws, icy winds from snow-clad western Himalayas will blow towards the plains, leading to a drop in the mercury, he said. Shallow to moderate fog is also predicted over the next two days, the IMD said. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 1,000 m2/s on Sunday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-likely-to-improve-924020.html

He claimed there was a dispute between his father and the girl's mother over the payment of Rs 2,000 as a "commission" to her for helping him get a loan of Rs 30,000 before Diwali, due to which there were frequent quarrels, they said. The accused claimed that he was called to the girl's house on Saturday afternoon, and there was an argument between him and the girl's father. Police are carrying out an in-depth investigating, the SSP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/girl-alleges-gangrape-in-moving-van-in-uttar-pradeshs-bulandshahr-924116.html

We had information through our intelligence teams and our priority was to maintain law and order as people of both the communities live in the village," he said. Rafeeq in his statement said the girl eloped in 2019 following issues with family members. "My son is innocent; he has been framed by the girl's family.

Poonia issued a ''black paper'' listing out the alleged failures of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's government. "From villages to cities, there is an anti-incumbency wave against the Congress government. There is resentment among the common people. The government has completely failed on various issues including electricity, water, roads, law and order, farmer debt waiver, crime," Poonia said in a statement. He said that in two years, development work was blocked by the Gehlot government due to partisan attitude shown in the urban local bodies. During the coronavirus pandemic, he said, the people are demanding for a three-month electricity waiver but CM Gehlot is "blindfolded". Meanwhile, many BJP leaders have retaliated to Gehlot's allegations that ''BJP is about to resume the game of toppling their government''. Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has said that the Congress is blaming the BJP for the failure of its government. "Congress, burdened with failed leadership, is again blaming the BJP for the failure of its government in Rajasthan. Mr. Gehlot, your statements reflects that your own party is struggling with internal conflicts and factionalism. Please pay attention to your organization," Shekhawat said in a tweet. Former Education Minister Vasudev Devnani has also denied Gehlot's allegations, saying that the state government has been unstable from day it was elected. "The state government is unstable from day one. From the very beginning, it is dependent on a weak foundation of false assurances and misuse of government machinery," Devnani said in a statement. He said that Gehlot has failed to control the infighting of the Congress party and is blaming BJP based on false allegations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/anti-incumbency-wave-against-congress-govt-in-rajasthan-says-bjp-state-chief-924146.html
06-12-2020||North and Central||Pregnant Hindu woman heckled for marrying Muslim youth in UP; husband arrested under 'Love Jihad' law||A 22-year-old pregnant Hindu woman was heckled and humiliated publicly allegedly by Bajrang Dal workers for marrying a Muslim youth in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad district, about 350 kilometres from Lucknow. The woman's marriage was termed as 'Love Jihad' by the saffron outfit members. They forcibly took her and her husband to the police station. The husband and his brother, who was also with him, were arrested while the woman was handed over to her parents. The woman, a resident of UP's Bijnore district, and the Muslim youth had reached the sub-divisional magistrate's office at Kanth in the district to get their marriage registered. Bajrang Dal (BD), who had reached there by then, on getting the information, intervened and heckled her. A one-minute video of BD workers heckling the woman went viral on social media. ''Where is the permission of the district magistrate?....the new law (to tackle love jihad) has been brought especially for people like you,'' one of the BD workers was heard telling the woman. However, the woman said that she was 22 years old and that she had married the youth on her own volition and had been living with him for the past five months. The police said that the youth and his brother were arrested under the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020, after the mother of the woman alleged that her daughter had been tricked into marrying the Muslim youth. Several cases of alleged 'Love jihad' were reported from different parts of UP since the ordinance came into effect last week. A case was registered in Muzaffarnagar district against a Muslim youth for allegedly trying to 'lure' a Hindu girl into conversion. In the state capital of Lucknow, the police had stopped an interfaith couple from marrying as they had not obtained prior permission from the district magistrate. Police said that under the new law, the person wanting to convert must apply to the district magistrate at least two months in advance. The new law grants maximum imprisonment of 10 years and also a fine for religious conversion through deceit, force, allurement or any other fraudulent means or for the purpose of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pregnant-hindu-woman-heckled-for-marrying-muslim-youth-in-up-husband-arrested-under-love-jihad-law-924153.html
06-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: SAD appeals to Punjabis to support Bharat Bandh call on December 8||SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday appealed to Punjabis to support the 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 called by farmer unions against the new farm laws. Badal also said his party would work assiduously alongside the peasantry to ensure repeal of the new agri-marketing laws. Stating that "the fight for justice" had now become a fight of the 'annadaata' (someone who provides food) against the central government, the Shiromani Akali Dal chief said, "I am confident that the mass agitation will force the Centre to 'bow down' before the demands of farmers." In a statement here, Badal said it was unfortunate that the central government was "dragging its feet" and "deliberately delaying" in taking a decision on the demands of the farmer organisations. He said farmers had been protesting against the Centre's three farm laws for the last three months and were now holding a sit-in at the Delhi borders for the past 11 days. "Besides elderly, women and children are part of the protest. It is extremely unfortunate that the Centre has refused to listen to the voice of the 'annadaata' and is making them suffer in the biting cold out in the open," he said. Asking the Centre to make an "immediate course correction", Badal said it was not right on its part to "forcibly" impose the three agri-marketing laws on farmers. "The central government did not discuss the provisions of the laws with farmers and now when the farmers have made it clear that the laws are not acceptable to them, the government should not stand on false pride and should repeal them immediately," he said. Badal also took note of the fact that even the international community was perturbed at the "intransigent" attitude of the central government. He said world over the right of the farmers to peaceful protest had been lauded and everyone had stressed the need to ensure the human rights of the protesters were protected. Badal said even the United Nations had upheld the right of people to demonstrate peacefully. He said keeping all these issues in mind, the central government should accept the demands of the farmer organisations and repeal the three agricultural laws with immediate effect.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-sad-appeals-to-punjabis-to-support-bharat-bandh-call-on-december-8-924186.html

06-12-2020||North and Central||Punjab seeks priority allocation of Covid-19 vaccine once available||Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure priority allocation of Covid-19 vaccine to Punjab on account of its higher mortality rate and high levels of co-morbidities in the state. In a letter to Modi, the CM said despite its relatively low caseload, Punjab has higher fatality rate due to coronavirus, and, therefore, it needs special attention in the allocation of the vaccine once available. Punjab has so far witnessed 1.55 lakh coronavirus cases and 4,905 deaths. Pointing out that the vaccines currently under consideration would not perhaps reduce transmission much but prevent the disease from escalating to serious levels, Amarinder said their best use would therefore be among the most susceptible groups, including the elderly and persons having co-morbidities. According to a state government release, Amarinder also wanted to know if the COVID-19 vaccination exercise would be entirely funded by the Centre, including the cost of vaccines and supplies. He further asked for clarity on the principles based on which the priority groups are to be identified for sequential immunisation phases. The CM also sought expansion of the definition of frontline workers for the purpose of immunisation to include administrative officials and others responsible for essential functions. While the definition of healthcare worker was relatively precise and Punjab had compiled data based on it, the definition of frontline workers lacked clarity, he opined. As of now, it seemed to include only security forces (police, armed forces) and municipal workers, with some mention of primary school teachers. The CM said that while it appeared that private sector healthcare workers would be enumerated and that the Centre also intends to provide vaccines for them, the question did arise if the vaccines will also be provided to other priority groups and the general population, should they wish to receive from government providers. He thanked the Centre for supporting the state government during the pandemic and congratulated Modi for taking all special steps to make a vaccine available to the citizens of the country. Amarinder said Punjab has already undertaken preparatory activities for an effective vaccination programme. The CM said that the data of healthcare workers, both in government and private sectors, had been compiled and shared on the digital platform. The committees for monitoring the vaccination programme at the state and at the district/ block levels had also been formed and ithas started functioning, he said. Besides, the audit of cold-chain availability for storage and transportation of the vaccine has been conducted and the shortfall in the equipment shared with the central government, he added. The CM said that the total requirement of cold chain capacity at different temperatures cannot be clearly defined until the vaccine product is identified and the dosage availability intimated through Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-seeks-priority-allocation-of-covid-19-vaccine-once-available-924226.html
06-12-2020||North and Central||Parts of north India record above normal minimum temperatures; snowfall likely in J&K on December 7||Parts of north India experienced a dry but cold weather on Sunday, with minimum temperatures hovering above normal limits at most places, while the MeT department predicted snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and higher reaches of Uttarakhand owing to a western disturbance. Delhi has recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius and a maximum temperature of 28.2 degrees Celsius, according to the weather office. However, the minimum temperature is likely to dip again with the wind direction changing to northwesterly by Monday and a fresh western disturbance triggering snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and higher reaches of Uttarakhand, IMD officials said. Shallow fog is also predicted over the next two days, the IMD said. The city's air quality was recorded in the upper end of the "very poor" category, and is likely to improve over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed. In Kashmir Valley, Gulmarg and Baltal recorded sub-zero temperatures. Baltal was recorded as the coldest place in the valley with a minimum temperature of minus 4.8 degrees Celsius. The MeT department has forecast rain over the next few days with a possibility of snow in higher reaches owing to a western disturbance affecting the local weather system. The weather remained dry in Himachal Pradesh, with Keylong being recorded as the coldest place in the state at minus 1.7 degrees Celsius. The weather office has forecast rain and snowfall in mid and high hills of Himachal Pradesh between Monday and Thursday, and rain in plains and low hills on Tuesday and Wednesday. Dry weather also prevailed over Uttar Pradesh, with dense to very dense fog occurring at isolated places over eastern UP and shallow fog over western UP. State capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 12.7 degrees Celsius, while Banda recorded a low of 9.0 degrees Celsius. Churk was recorded as the coldest place in the state at 7.0 degrees Celsius. In Haryana and Punjab, minimum temperatures hovered above the normal limits with Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recording a low of 12.4 degrees Celsius. According to the meteorological department, in Haryana, Ambala recorded a low of 11.9 degrees Celsius, up four notches, while Karnal recorded a low of 13.8 degrees Celsius, five more than the normal. Amritsar in Punjab recorded a minimum temperature of 12.9 degrees Celsius, eight notches above normal. Maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded above normal in most parts of Rajasthan, an official said. Regional MeT director R S Sharma said due to the continuous low-intensity western disturbance, the wind pattern in Rajasthan has changed and as a result, the temperature has increased. He said another western disturbance will affect northwest India on Monday. The weather will remain dry for the next five days and there is no possibility of any change in temperature. Due to the effect of an active western disturbance on December 11 to 12, there is a possibility of cloudy sky and light rains in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/parts-of-north-india-record-above-normal-minimum-temperatures-snowfall-likely-in-jk-on-december-7-924230.html
06-12-2020||Opinion||India’s three outrages||In this pandemic-afflicted annus horribilis, three other ideas have plagued the republic. These are, the status of Uttar Pradesh (UP) as our largest state, Delhi as our capital, and making Hindi our lingua franca. All three are legacy matters the republic is unable to resolve, era after era. Such funk magnifies an unutterable truth about being Indian: That we have an ongoing capacity to accept inequality; a masochistic tolerance for maltreatment from the government or by linguistic majorities; and a proclivity to look askance at the record of India’s largest state. With each passing week, UP renews its commitment to its own wretchedness. It piles up caste, class, religious, or gender-linked violence -- a blot not just on India but on human civilisation. Scarred, wrecked societies and communities produce state administrations that believe “illegal” conversions are so widespread that they need combating with legal teeth. Their legislatures pass “love jihad” laws. Their societies offer up a Hathras every other day. In a recent one-day game between Australia and India at Sydney, an Indian spectator proposed to his Australian girlfriend. TV cameras caught it; it circulated on Twitter. One Twitter commentator quipped in Hindi, “Even I would have proposed in Australia. Real thing is, if the guy could do it in a UP stadium.” When questioned over this past and present, northerners are quick to defend the Indo-Gangetic plains and how they symbolise Hindu-Muslim confluence. If anything, UP confirms the failure of both faiths to foster a humane ethos. Many parts of UP have asked to break away. At one level, UP colonises the Union, and at another, oppresses its own distant regions. Contemporary South Asian capitals have better to marginally better living conditions than Delhi. None of the other countries are as powerful as India. Despite its many changes, Delhi ushers in feudalism into the 21st century. With its toxic air, crime, insecurity, power outages, poor public services, and its straightforward class divides, Delhi exemplifies most of India’s failings. Pendulating like a yoyo between the forces of the Centre and the state, it tells Indians, “You can’t even get your national capital right.” What a mess. Delhi, like UP, presents a picture of psychic damage. These societies cry out for healing and convalescence. (It includes nearby Bihar that went to polls in November. From what this viewer followed, there wasn’t much mention about the encephalitis-related children’s deaths that occurred 18 months ago and rattled India. In these pandemic times, was it forgotten? Those deaths showed Bihar the mirror – which it shows to itself every other day. Then, the Nitish Kumar government was questioned. Nothing much happened. Those deaths weren’t recalled much in the polls. The folks of the Indo-Gangetic plains are like that. They forgive everything. They’re inured to karma.) Hindi, with its status in our national ethos, completes the trio of disasters. How much national time have we wasted on it, instead of embracing English and powering its reach deep into our society. To make and show English as our own language. We saw Hindi being slipped in once more into the National Education Policy 2020 recommendations. For regions that don’t speak Hindi, it seems more an instrument of oppression than English during colonialism. Is the English of the past a colonial bequest or is today’s Hindi the actual one? In the early 1960s, V S Naipaul wrote in An Area of Darkness: “It is well that Indians are unable to look at their country directly, for the distress they would see would drive them mad...It is better to retreat into fantasy, to trust to the stars in which the fortunes of all are written.” In many ways, UP, Delhi and Hindi present a toxic triad that atrophies India each day. If things continue in this vein, in the coming years, a new North vs South or North vs Rest of India culture war looks set to brew.

06-12-2020||Opinion||What’s this New India’s rage against age?||The year of all years shuffles to a close, and already, much artificial optimism is being whipped up for the next. We are told by our most, arguably only, reliable source that is so low on facts that it needs no fact-checking, that a Make-in-India vaccine may be ready for roll-out in the next few weeks. I am prepared with my arms bared for any, for all vaccines, of all origins, even those from suspicious sources and sub-par supply chains. In true ‘New India’ style, I have decided to bide this waiting time for that one instance of ’acchhe din’ by fiddling around with the future, playing a game. The game is that, besides myself and my immediate family, who is that one other person in the whole wide world I want to see at the absolute front of the Covid-19 vaccination queue? For me, the answer lies in a photograph -- of Sukhdev Singh, the moonshine-bright white-bearded Sikh farmer from Punjab’s Kapurthala district, one amongst lakhs of women and men farmers currently protesting the new farm laws. Laws that New India’s foot soldiers say these people have been misled to misunderstand, before they found their way, not needing New India’s navigational help, to Delhi’s borders to withstand hardships that New India is already buckling under. Sukhdev Singh’s photograph comes alive with his ageless agility against a policeman’s raised ‘lathi’ (or cane). For me, it needed no video to kill the viral lies. Singh understands. The cognitive disability is New India’s, and that is what will be India’s Achilles’ heel. And in all humility, together with Singh, I too understand, because, whilst he and I are separated by many differences and a few decades, we are both at the receiving end of New India’s rage against age. The psychological price we, of a certain age, pay is hate. I encounter this regularly, especially since I ceased to colour my hair. Some of the reactions are comprehensible. My daughter has had to endure the peculiar tween horror of explaining to a mate that the woman who waited distractedly at the bus stop was not her grandmother. Admittedly, the last nail in my carefully coiffed coffin of ‘global’ colour was when I went and got myself the ‘mom bob’, or the ‘pol mob’ as it is also called, to indicate a personally and politically strident woman. The personality re-order was now not just complete, but also broadcast. My daughter’s father has had to learn to conceal occasional seepages of disappointment and disdain at me. At worst, there’s been some plain old-fashioned disgust, not entirely at my salt ‘n’ pepper, but at who I might have become. But that is easily remedied with a reminder that our long togetherness must leave some trace. My octogenarian mother has also found my decision discomfiting as this abandonment of my vanity reveals her tight hold over hers. But all this just classifies us as yet another ‘happy’ Hindustani family. The particular strain of Make-in-India hate that is confounding is what the likes of Sukhdev Singh and I get from New India’s new women and men. Unlike the hate that is schooled in the history department of the University of WhatsApp, this hate is designed to debase merely on the fact of a person’s age. What makes these literate but under-educated, un- or under-employed New Indians name-call me when I have something contrary to say? What is it that prevents them from making a cogent counter-argument that isn’t just ageist abuse? It’s not arrogance. It’s under confidence. And it’s Fear. The fear that, despite the ‘mandirs’ being built where the ‘masjids’ are, they themselves may never make good, as so many of us did just a decade or two ago, simply by being individuals and believing in our youth. Could it be that New India’s youth fears that their slogan-shouting mouths may forever remain open for their next morsel of food? Indeed, the emasculation of New India’s uncouth youth needs no further proof than that it needs their Government to secure their potential partners from being ‘taken’ by the ‘Other’, or the on-repeat reassurance, again from their Government, that someday, they may become atmanirbhar. Does the New Indian really believe that only one man speaks the truth? If there was a vaccine against the misuse of our youth, I, and I’m sure Sukhdev Singh, too, would put these New Indians ahead in the queue.

06-12-2020||Opinion||On the Himalayan heights in Ladakh, China faces the truth||It has been eight months since the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Eastern Ladakh-Aksai Chin region was first reported. After considerable pushing, shoving and stone-throwing, violence escalated, resulting in 20 Indian soldiers being killed on the night of June 15. The armed stalemate between the two militaries since has frittered away the 2005 “strategic and cooperative partnership” and 2014 “developmental partnership” and mutual trust between the two countries. This is despite the talks between the two sides at various levels for disengagement of troops and de-escalation of tensions in the border areas. India had suggested ushering in “peace and stability” in the border areas by restoring the situation that prevailed in early 2020. India reminded China of the 1988 conditional agreement on improving bilateral relations based on border peace and stability. China wants the border issue to be “decoupled” from other aspects of the bilateral relations. Beijing wants India to “meet half-way” from its recent encroachments in the western sector. China refuses to adhere to the bilateral agreements on peace and stability and continues to mobilise an estimated 60,000 troops despite the onset of bitter cold in the region and is waging a war of attrition against India – unsuccessfully, so far. China’s initial confidence that it can bulldoze India waned as the Indian Army upped the ante on August 29 by regaining control over five hill tops and now has a commanding position on the Kailash ranges. China’s state-media dishes out psychological warfare – that the Chinese have better winter-clothing, possible use of microwave weapons, supplies of “hotpot” food to front line troops through drones, flying the latest fighter aircraft, missiles, etc. It has all been met stoutly by the Indian mobilisation. China is fast losing its plot in Aksai Chin. Its strategic objectives since May of initiating conflict have not been met in the face of stiff Indian opposition. The political, diplomatic and military costs for China are rising due to its intervention in the western sector. The more the border stalemate continues, the more it tends to lose on multiple fronts. Beijing’s hands are tied over Aksai Chin and, despite the bluster, it cannot adequately cater to other military fronts on Taiwan, Senkaku Islands or the South China Sea. Lacking high-altitude training and warfighting experience, China’s frontline troops are suffering. Exposed to “five-star” luxuries, the troops – children of China’s one-child policy -- have lost the soldiering ethos. Combat deficiencies are staring Beijing in the face in Aksai Chin. President Xi Jinping admitted as much recently when he stated, at a commendation conference for national “model workers” and “advanced workers” on November 24, that despite having modern weaponry, China’s military has “a gap compared with the requirement of winning” and is suffering from “low quality…shortage of commanders and professional and technical personnel for joint operations.” China’s decades-old plan to shift focus towards the Arunachal Pradesh sector of the border has also failed, with the western sector now in global view. Since the issues over this sector were raised by former Prime Minister Vajpayee at a commanders’ conference in 2000, China had refused to discuss them in border talks. With the heat generated by the Trump administration on Taiwan, Tibet, Xinjiang, South China Sea and on tariffs, China’s interlocutors are reviving the old multipolarity and “strategic autonomy” prescription for India. They express concern about the consolidation of the Quad and the full-fledged Malabar Exercises recently, without first addressing India’s concerns in Eastern Ladakh. To resolve the border stand-off, India resorted to diplomacy, confidence-building measures, military mobilisation, and reaching out to the stakeholders in China and abroad. The two foreign ministers’ five-point agreement to de-escalate, signed on September 11 in Moscow, has not been realised. Eight rounds of Corps Commander-level talks have been held till November with no visible progress on the ground. The foreign ministries’ working level mechanism on the border met as well, with no improvement. Indian leaders fanned out to Myanmar, Afghanistan and Nepal in the light of alternative incentives being provided by China to these countries. China’s defence minister visited Nepal and Pakistan but was reportedly snubbed by Bangladesh. Over the past two decades, China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Aksai China and Tibet, while it has put out a demand currently that India should desist from doing the same. New Delhi not only brushed aside this double standard but quickly inaugurated 44 strategic roads in the border areas in October, providing much-needed connectivity and bolstering the troops to the border areas. While China recently raised the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Security Council, and declared the new Ladakh Union Territory “illegal”, India has desisted so far from revising the “One China” policy on Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong and other territories. India’s patience may be running out.

06-12-2020||Opinion||Rainy Day Women||While listening to Bob Dylan’s Rainy Day Women, I chanced upon an article in the Indian Express that has opened my eyes to an urgent problem plaguing college campuses all across India: not enough stone statues. As Rashmi Das, member of the Executive Council at JNU, points out in her piece, Who’s Afraid of Vivekananda?, the monk “taught us kingly values. These will permeate JNU now and make it grand.” That the honorable Prime Minister took valuable time out from steering our nation through a pandemic that has destroyed countless lives and livelihoods, crippled the economy, and taken a horrific toll on the country’s most vulnerable, in order to grace the unveiling of the Vivekananda statue, is itself clear testament to how important statues must be to the health and success of a university. And indeed, this statue will prove to be of particular effectiveness because, as Ms Das points out, “Vivekananda was a spiritual generalissimo” who “gave us our manliness.” I wonder what Vivekananda himself would have thought about such a characterisation – kingly values, spiritual generalissimo (does that sound like an oxymoron?), manliness! Moved by Ms Das’ assertion that housing the statue “will give JNU its nationalist spine,” I think we should prioritise erecting stone statuary on university campuses. In an increasingly competitive global knowledge economy, “kingly values” and “manliness” are the core needs of higher education today. For this reason, we must commission statues of Dr Harin Padma-Nathan to place on every college campus. Dr Padma-Nathan is a urologist specialising in sexual disorders, whose work led to the development of Viagra. Although he is an American, being of Indian descent, we are free to laud and appropriate his achievements as our nation’s own. And the best thing is that Pfizer will pay for it! No doubt we will face resistance from the Left, ever hostile to fresh and innovative ideas from the 19th century. As Dylan prophetically pronounced in opening Rainy Day Women, ‘Well, they’ll stone you when you’re trying to be so good’. Rashmi Das cautions us about such nefarious tendencies of the JNU faculty: “having converted their centres and schools into Leftist swamps, they have survived on past regurgitations of stale theories.” Well said. Feminist theory, critical caste theory, queer theory, disability theory — stale! Just contrast the research output and international academic recognition of JNU’s Leftist swamp creatures against those of the faculty from India’s eleven central government-funded Sanskrit universities, each of which can boast housing the imposing stone bust of at least one eminence, if not more. Perhaps you have never heard of our Sanskrit universities. Perhaps you will point out that the most significant Sanskrit scholarship and publications in the world emerge not from India, but appear in the likes of NYU’s Clay Sanskrit Library or Harvard’s Murty Classical Library of India, neither of which has a single work by any faculty from India’s prestigious Sanskrit universities. Okay, prestigious is an overstatement, but they do spend plenty of taxpayers’ money furthering kingly values (varnadharma) and working hard to promote ‘nationalist spine’ and ‘manliness’. Now, humourless feminists will also raise objections to erecting statues of Dr Padma-Nathan on college campuses, but this would be a mistake. For, the inventor of Viagra is currently at work developing a cannabis-based vaginal gel for women. He is a champion of equal-opportunity orgasm. The fact that his new medicine is marijuana-based should also help those of us who are pro-statue to win over recalcitrant JNU students. As Dylan put it, although I am not entirely sure that his song really was promoting stone statuary: ‘But I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned.’ (Aakash Singh Rathore as Dr Jekyll is a Professor of Philosophy, Politics and Law, author and editor of over 20 books and counting, and as Mr Hyde, one of India’s top-ranking Ironman triathletes.  @ASR_metta)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/rainy-day-women-923947.html
06-12-2020||Opinion||How the Modi government ‘solves’ problems||It is curious how the Narendra Modi government has gone about “solving” India’s problems one by one. Consider demonetisation, for instance. The ostensible reasons given then and subsequently were that the government wanted to end the problem of black money in one shot; it wanted to bust counterfeit notes in the economy, and thus apparently end terror funding; it wanted to reduce cash in the economy and move towards digital payments; it wanted to increase tax compliance, and so on. For a fig leaf of propriety, the RBI was asked to give its nod to the hare-brained scheme that Raghuram Rajan had warned against. The government sent the note to the RBI on the morning of November 8, 2016, and it expected the nod by the evening. The RBI Board met at 5.30 PM that evening. The minutes of the meeting show that the Board said that none of the government’s stated objectives would be served: Only 6% of the estimated black money is in cash, so it won’t be the end of at least 94% of unaccounted wealth which is in real estate, gold and diamonds; by the government’s own estimate, the amount of fake notes in the economy was only worth Rs 400 crore and it was not worth demonetising 86% of currency by value to kill this piddly amount; and so on. But the Board knew what was expected of it. So, demonetisation was declared to be “in the national interest.” By 8 pm that day, Modi was on TV. How much black money has been ferreted out and added to the national coffers since? On the “fourth anniversary” of DeMo, the government claimed that it had “drastically improved” tax/GDP ratio; had “made India a lesser cash-based economy” (sic, but true, India is a lesser economy today than it was before DeMo); “helped reduce black money, increase tax compliance”, and that it gave a “boost to transparency,” concluding that DeMo had been “greatly beneficial towards national progress.” What’s the truth? The economy is in the doldrums (and it was even before the pandemic). While the number of people filing I-T returns has risen, tax/GDP ratio has fallen from 11.22% in 2017-18 to 9.88% in 2019-20. There is more cash in the economy than ever before (outpacing the rate of economic growth by a large margin). The construction sector (which supports another 150 allied industries) collapsed, and the government has since been trying to resuscitate it; millions of daily wage workers lost wages for months on end. And that’s just a snapshot of what the government’s ‘solution’ to the problem of black money did. Or, take the problem of transparency in political funding. India had a problem of political donations being made in cash out of the black money reserves of unscrupulous businessmen. The Modi government declared that Congress had corrupted the system and that it would solve this problem. How did it do it? It made anonymous, unlimited donations to political parties legal through the Electoral Bonds scheme. Now, any corporate or rich individual can donate any amount of money to a political party by purchasing a bearer bond (which is as good as cash) and neither the donor nor the recipient political party has to reveal it. Under the Congress, unaccounted, untraceable donations were still illegal. Now, it’s legal by law. And now, hold your breath for one more such solution: an RBI internal working group (IWG) has recommended that large corporates be allowed to own banks. That is, the very ones that borrow large loans from banks to run their businesses and who often do not repay, are now to be allowed to own the banks themselves! The problem statement is like this: Banks are in the doldrums because of bad loans, and bad loans happened because of the phenomenon of “phone-banking” during the Congress regime. If a big businessman wanted a loan but the banks were not ready to lend, he would call up somebody in Delhi, and that somebody would call up the bank and the loan would be made. And given the record so far, the solution goes like this: Ha, the Congress was corrupt and so there was ‘phone-banking’ and crony capitalism. That will not happen in my regime. In my regime, the businessman will himself own the bank, and can help himself to a loan whenever he wants -- with the public’s money! After much hue and cry from the likes of Raghuram Rajan, Viral Acharya, Vijay Kelkar, etc., the RBI Governor has sought to distance the regulator from its own IWG by saying that the latter’s recommendation is not the RBI’s view. But we know how this works. The RBI did not want to give its nod to DeMo, but it had to. Will it be different this time? The IWG itself noted all the reasons why it is a dangerous thing to do, and then went on to say, well, if we improve supervision, it should be fine. What’s more, if the corporates – and we know which ones want to be banks urgently – cannot be ushered in through the front doors, there are back doors, too. For the IWG has also said that corporates that own NBFCs should be allowed to turn them into banks, and payments banks should be allowed to become full-fledged banks after three years of operations. Such are the ways in which the Modi government solves our problems.

06-12-2020||Opinion||How the Iran threat has altered contours of Middle East politics||The dastardly killing of Iranian nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, on November 27 in a terror attack once again highlights the fraught and volatile nature of politics in the Middle East. The timing of the attack, reportedly carried out at the behest of Israel, was carefully chosen to pre-empt any immediate retaliatory action by Iran. The attack was prompted by Israel’s calculation that Iran was getting too close to acquiring nuclear weapon capability, which could threaten its security, and is believed to have had the tacit approval of Washington and Riyadh. The traditional rivalry between Saudi Arabia (leader of Sunni Muslims) and Iran (leader of Shias) escalated further in September 2019 when Iran reportedly attacked two Saudi oil facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais. The placid reaction of President Trump made it clear to the Saudis that they needed additional external support for their security. Even earlier, the Trump administration’s policy of applying “maximum pressure” on Iran had failed to change its behaviour as Iran had responded with “maximum resistance” by strengthening its network of proxies in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon to attack its opponents and slashing the ‘breakout time” (window required to advance its nuclear programme to weapons production) from about a year earlier to 3 months. Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the Assad government in Syria had registered notable successes. Given that the US is now determined to reduce its military footprint in the Middle East, Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), decided to lean more and more on Israel to seek assistance in counter-terrorism, training of its security personnel and advanced technologies. Israel not only shares Saudi’s implacable hostility towards Iran but also has repeatedly shown determination to act against it. The US has also encouraged the growing ties between the Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, and Israel as it helps in retaining the key Arab countries in its sphere of influence against the advances being made by China and Russia to expand their political, economic and military influence in the region. Unlike his father, MBS attaches low priority to the return of disputed lands from Israel to Palestine and backs the solution proposed by President Trump. The Palestinian issue is getting sidelined due to divisions in the Palestinian leadership, failure to come up with more pragmatic solutions, embracing the new political realities and considerable rise in Israel’s influence in the region. Today, many Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and others attach primacy to curbing Iran’s growing influence rather than resolving the Palestinian conflict. The compromise of Saudi Arabia, UAE and other Arab states on the Palestinian issue and their thriving relationship with Israel has deepened the hostility of Iran, Turkey and Malaysia with them and accentuated divisions in the Middle East and the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia’s increased reliance on Israel for security has undercut the importance of Pakistan for it. China has an ambitious vision for investments in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE and other countries in the region but has been cool towards playing a political or security role in defence of the either party, i.e. Iran or Saud Arabia, or provide protection to the ships transporting oil from the region. The slowdown in the economic growth of China, India and many other countries post Covid-19 has plummeted the demand for oil while supply has increased due to availability of exportable surplus from the US, Russia, Libya leading to decline in the price of crude oil. More ambitious rulers like MBS have realised that they cannot continue to depend upon uncertain and falling oil revenues. They have to tap other non-oil based sources of revenue such as manufacturing, range of services like health, tourism, education and domestic consumption. MBS has promised to undertake socio-economic reforms gradually, giving more freedoms and participation to women and others. Despite their mutual contestations, India has been able to upgrade its strong ties with Saudi Arabia, UAE and other countries. India has abiding political, trade and other interests with the presence of a large diaspora. Availability of oil supply from these countries plays an important role in India’s energy security. Israel has become a significant player in counterterrorism, security and other cooperation with India. It is hoped that Biden administration’s opening to Iran will provide new opportunities to India to augment its relations with the country. US President-elect Biden is unlikely to reverse major policies of his predecessor except exploring if a nuclear deal (signed during Obama administration) could be revived with pushback of Iran’s destabilising behaviour in the region. Any solution to the mutual rivalries among the main protagonists, as described above, does not appear in sight. The Middle East will remain a hotbed of raging contestations for political and economic influence with uneasy and elusive peace prevailing in the near future. (Yogesh Gupta is a former Ambassador.

These are the crucial questions doing the rounds as Kerala is heading for three-phase polls across 1,199 local bodies beginning December 8. The next two phases are scheduled for December 10 and 14 and the counting is on December 16. Kerala witnessed a major NDA surge in the 2015 local body elections with the saffron party coming to power in one of the 87 municipalities in the state (Palakkad), coming second in the prestigious Thiruvananthapuram City Corporation and coming to power in 14 gram panchayats. The vote share of BJP also increased to 13.28 per cent, while that of LDF was 37.36 per cent and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) 37.23 per cent. As the public campaign for the first-phase polls ended on Sunday, BJP leaders were expressing a high level of confidence in the state capital. Party senior leader and former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan said that Thiruvananthapuram city was facing backwardness in all sectors and the people badly want a change from the LDF and the UDF that had been ruling the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation over these years. Hence BJP is the option, he said. For the CPI(M), the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is prestigious as they have been ruling it for the past 25 years. In the 2015 local body elections, LDF topped the overall tally by securing a majority in four of the six corporations, 43 of the 87 municipalities, seven of the 14 district panchayats, 90 of the 152 block panchayats and 551 of the 941 gram panchayats. UDF was then in power in the state and the Left-Front's upper hand in the local body elections was considered as an anti-incumbency factor against the then Oommen Chandy government that faced a series of allegations including receiving bribes from bar owners. A similar scenario is now prevailing in the state as the ruling Left-Front is facing allegations pertaining to nexus with gold smuggling accused and bribery allegations against the who's who in the government. Hence the Left-Front has serious concerns that anti-incumbency factor may work against them, especially when the Assembly polls are hardly five months away. While CPI(M) state-secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan alleged the existence of a Congress-BJP nexus, BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan alleged of Congress-CPI(M) nexus. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the nexus is between CPI(M) and BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-surge-anti-incumbency-sentiment-may-hurt-left-govt-in-kerala-local-body-polls-924145.html
06-12-2020||South||Kerala church row heading towards flashpoint||The decades-old power tussle between Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in Kerala is snowballing into a major law and order problem with the Jacobite faction on Sunday launching an indefinite protest in front of the churches taken over by the Orthodox faction from them on the basis of a Supreme Court order. The Jacobite faction also announced that members of the faction would enter and offer prayers at all the 52 churches that were already taken over by the Orthodox faction. The Orthodox faction maintained that they were not opposed to believers entering the church and offering prayers, but would not allow priests to conduct prayers. Though Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself recently initiated mediatory talks between the two factions, those remained inconclusive as both the factions remained adamant on their stands. While the Orthodox faction wants to implement the Supreme Court order granting control of about 1,100 churches to them, the Jacobite faction was insisting on a referendum on each church and urged the government to bring in a law in this regard. Similar to the Sabarimala women entry issue, the Kerala government is in a fix over the issue with an SC order in favour of Orthodox faction on one side and a prominent faction of the Christian community on the other. Already the government received strictures from courts for the delay in implementing the SC order to handover administration of 1,100 odd churches to the Orthodox faction. The state already witnessed tension at many prominent churches with the Jacobite faction members resisting moves to handover management to the Orthodox faction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-church-row-heading-towards-flashpoint-924172.html

The decision to name the new campus of Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram after Golwalkar triggered strong protest from Congress and CPM leaders alleging that it is a move to trigger communal divide. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also sent a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan urging that the premier research institute should be named after an eminent Indian scientist and thereby avoid controversies over it. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said on Sunday that there is nothing wrong in naming the institute after Golwalkar as he was a zoology professor in Banaras University and a patriot. He further pointed out that a famous boat race in Kerala, Nehru Trophy Boat Race, is named after Jawaharlal Nehru and asked what was Nehru's connection with sports and whether he was a rower. The BJP leader from Kerala also said that RGCB governing council decided the name of the institute.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-defends-naming-science-institute-after-golwalkar-citing-nehrus-name-for-kerala-boat-race-924182.html

More than 140 of the patients have returned home after treatment at the hospital while the condition of others was stable, the West Godavari district medical and health officials said. Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy spoke with AP Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney over the phone and enquired about the situation and said the Centre was ready to extend any possible help. The Union Home Ministry was also in touch with the Governor's office over this, official sources here said. Nothing has yet been established as to what caused the disease that saw people suddenly falling unconscious after suffering from symptoms of fits and nausea. Health authorities could not yet establish the cause of the sudden disease though blood tests and CT (brain) scan were performed. Cerebral Spinal Fluid tests also turned out to be normal. The probable cause could become evident only after the culture test results came in. According to district Joint Collector Himanshu Shukla, E-coli results were also awaited. Himanshu told PTI that expert scientists from the National Institute of Nutrition and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology from Hyderabad would arrive in Eluru on Monday for diagnosing the cause of the disease. A 24x7 control room has been set up in the Eluru Municipal Corporation office. Milk samples were also collected at random and sent for examination in Vijayawada. A 45-year-old man, who was admitted to the GGH in Eluru this morning with symptoms of nausea and epilepsy, died in the evening. Majority of the people who suffered the sickness had recovered within a few minutes but at least seven persons were shifted to the Government General Hospital in Vijayawada on Sunday for better treatment. All the patients tested negative for Covid-19. Special teams of doctors have been rushed to Eluru to treat the victims while a house-to-house survey has been undertaken to identify prospective patients. State Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar also rushed to Eluru to review the situation and monitor the treatment. BJP MP G V L Narasimha Rao, who spoke to state Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, said a five-member team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Mangalagiri here was sent Eluru to treat the patients. Rao said he spoke to AIIMS Delhi Director Randeep Guleria and other experts on the mysterious disease and also made them talk to the West Godavari district medical officials. Poisonous organochlorine substances could be the most likely cause of the disease, the MP said after talking to the experts. Expressing concern over the spread of the mysterious disease, state Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan directed the health authorities to ensure proper medicare to the afflicted persons. Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has scheduled a visit to Eluru on Monday to visit the patients in the GGH and later hold a review meeting with the West Godavari district officials. Deputy Chief Minister (Health) A K K Srinivas (Nani), who represents Eluru, said tests established that water contamination was not the cause of the mysterious disease. Nani visited the hospital again on Sunday and took stock of the situation and said there was no need to panic. "Most of the victims have recovered and others are stable. We have readied 50 beds in the GGH in Vijayawada to shift patients if required. Our medical teams are attending to every patient," the Deputy Chief Minister said. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh too visited the hospital and spoke to the victims. He blamed the Jagan Mohan Reddy governments negligence for the disease outbreak, though initially it was suspected that water contamination caused it. Expressing anguish over 290 people falling ill, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu demanded a full-fledged inquiry into the disease outbreak and declaration of health emergency in Eluru city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mysterious-disease-kills-one-nearly-300-take-ill-in-andhra-pradesh-924203.html

06-12-2020||State||Covid-19 pandemic fails to deter voluntary blood donors||As much as 82% of blood units received in the state’s 230 public and private blood banks, from April to October this year, are from voluntary blood donation (VBD) drives, camps and visits to blood banks. There are still five months left for this fiscal year to be accounted for. According to the Blood Safety wing of the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS), despite lockdowns and Covid fear, they had managed to collect 3,22,543 units of blood (including replacement blood units). Dr Sunil Gupta, Director of National Blood Transfusion Council said at a panel discussion of ASSOCHAM that the fear that was initially present in the minds of the staff at blood centers isn’t there now with proper sanitisation measures, social distancing and methodical way of blood collection via prior appointments. Now our collection is almost close to that of pre-Covid times, he said. “As per data of NACO, currently, 70% of blood donations are voluntary. Some states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are particularly very active in voluntary blood donations. At the same time, some states are lagging and there is a huge gap. We are trying to analyse why this gap exists in the country. We have realised that it has to do with the prevailing culture of the state and the mindset of the population. There is a need to change mindsets,” he said. Cynthiya S, Quality Manager (Lab Services), KSAPS, Blood Safety, said, “The target for 2020-21 is to collect 8,08,529 units of blood. Till October, we have collected 39.89% of that target. In a week, we will get the figures of how much we collected in November. Out of this, 2,65,825 units of blood were through voluntary blood donation. In 2019-20, 87% of the donations were through voluntary blood donation. Because of the lockdown and Covid, due to restrictions, it came down. The voluntary blood donation excludes replacement units. For example, major surgeries require replacement donation. “We have a lot of NGOs helping us. We are also mobilising volunteers from social media platforms also. Each unit of blood is around 250 ml to 350 ml. Initially, in the month of April, May and June, we had very less collection. We have four more months and are conducting more camps. People are more forthcoming now. Colleges are also open,” she said. “Our main source of voluntary blood donors are IT companies. But since most employees are working from home, that entire pool is cut-off,” Cynthiya added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/covid-19-pandemic-fails-to-deter-voluntary-blood-donors-924239.html

06-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Hubballi airport to 'foot' power bills of Karnataka airports from March 2021||If everything goes according to plan, from March 2021 Hubballi Domestic Airport will be ‘footing’ the electric bills of airports managed by Airports Authority of India (AAI) in Karnataka (except Bengaluru and Mangaluru international airports). According to Hubballi Airport Director Pramod Kumar Thakre, by March 2021, the city's airport is expected to generate 140 lakh units of electricity through its eight-megawatt ground-mounted grid-connected photovoltaic(PV) solar plant that is being installed here. The power thus generated by photovoltaic solar panels will be fed to the high-tension grid of Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited on drive wheel system and take credit in the electricity bill of all airports in Karnataka managed by AAI. Once completely implemented, the airport’s dependence on external power supply will be reduced by at least 85% annually. As of now, the total power consumption of airports in Karnataka (Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Mysuru, and HAL Airport in Bengaluru) is around 132 lakh units per year, whereas the Hubballi Airport will be generating 140 lakh units. Works in full swing Madhav Infra Private Limited, a Gujarat-based company has been executing the project at an estimated cost of Rs 64 crore. Works such as laying cables, setting up transformers, and other civil works have been completed, while the remaining work is expected to completed by March-end or early April, said Thakre. The entire project is being implemented on the 38 acres of the airport land. More than 22,500 solar panels will be installed on 24 acres of land in such a way that the PV solar system gets the maximum amount of solar radiation available each day throughout the year based on orientation and tilting of modules, thus avoiding shading, he said and added that in order to achieve a higher system voltage, modules are installed in a row arrangement, called a string. A higher system voltage has the advantage of lesser installation work, higher efficiency of the entire plant and usage of smaller cross section cables. The project is being implemented as part of the Union government’s proposed plan of increased use of green and renewable sources of energy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/hubballi-airport-to-foot-power-bills-of-karnataka-airports-from-march-2021-924122.html
06-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Assembly's Winter Session from December 7 likely to be stormy||The winter session of the Karnataka Assembly starting here Monday is likely to be a stormy affair amid speculations that the ruling BJP might introduce bills against cow slaughter and "love jihad." The House will also debate on the subject of 'One Nation, One Election' on December 14 and 15, making it the first legislative Assembly to do so, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said. While Congress has announced it will resist any move by the government against inter-faith marriages and cow slaughter, the BJP would try to corner its rival by raising the recent attacks on Bajrang Dal activists in Shivamogga and the alleged role of the opposition party in the Bengaluru violence in August. The BJP may also rake up the multi-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) investment scam in which a former Congress MLA was arrested by the CBI recently. On Saturday, the BJP's Karnataka state executive had adopted resolutions for the passage and implementation of legislation against inter-faith marriages and cow slaughter in the state. Karnataka Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan has already indicated that the anti-cow slaughter bill will be introduced during the state legislative session starting from December 7. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had said the state will have a law against "Love Jihad", and that officials have been directed to gather information on an ordinance promulgated in Uttar Pradesh in this regard. "Love jihad" is a coinage used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. Further, the controversial Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) and Development Amendment bill and the Karnataka Land Reforms amendment bill, pending in the legislative council for clearance, maybe debated again. The bills could not be cleared in the monsoon session as the ruling BJP does not have adequate numbers in the upper house despite emerging as the single largest in the council after winning four MLC seats in the recent election. The BJP has 31 seats, Congress-- 28, JD(S) -- 14 and one independent in the legislative council. The Congress may also rake up the delay in cabinet expansion and the alleged suicide attempt by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's political secretary N R Santosh. Speaker Kageri said all precautionary measures have been taken in view of Covid-19 for the ensuing session. As done last time, wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing would be made mandatory, he said. Wherever social distancing was not possible, fibre sheets have been put up, he told reporters. He said more than 10 bills will be taken up for discussion in the session. Further, the House will discuss 'One Nation, One Election' on December 14 and 15, the last two days of the session, Kageri said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently said 'One Nation, One Election', was the need of India as polls taking place every few months impact development works. Meanwhile, Congress leader Siddaramiah held discussions with his party MLAs regarding the session starting tomorrow.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-assemblys-winter-session-from-december-7-likely-to-be-stormy-924160.html

06-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka farmers to launch indefinite stir on December 7||The united front of farmer, labour, Dalit and progressive organisations will launch an indefinite stir in Bengaluru on Monday, in solidarity with the demonstrations being held in Delhi against the controversial farm laws. They also extended support to the Bharat Bandh call on December 8 to protest the laws. “The organisations will launch a massive protest in front of Gandhi statue at Maurya Circle on Monday. All units of the organisations, functioning in different parts of the state, will extend support to the December 8 bandh call,” Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka farmer organisations’ union, said. Urging people from all spheres of life to back the protests and the bandh call, he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi government of conspiring to destroy the agriculture sector. Rather than fulfilling the assurance of implementing the Swaminathan Committee report made ahead of 2019 polls, the central government has made laws to decimate farmers, he alleged. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha president Kodihalli Chandrashekhar said that the farmers would lay siege to Vidhana Soudha on December 9 to protest the farm laws and ordinances issued by state governments. The farmers’ stir in Karnataka will coincide with the Legislature session of the state government for the second time this year. Back in September, farmers had staged a week long protest in Bengaluru and held an alternative ‘people’s session’ during the monsoon session of the government. Meanwhile, speaking to reporters in Hubballi, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said that the Centre was ready to address all the issues raised by the farmers. “We have said it in Parliament and we are saying to the farmers during the negotiation meetings that all their demands will be met. There is no need for the farmers to stage a protest,” Joshi said and urged the farmers to withdraw their ‘Bharat Bandh’ call. However, when asked about the specific demand of farmers regarding repealing of the three Acts, Joshi said the issue would be discussed again by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in December 9 meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-farmers-to-launch-indefinite-stir-on-december-7-924212.html

06-12-2020||West||Amarjeet Singh Manhas frontrunner for Mumbai Congress chief’s post||A low-profile leader and a grassroots worker Dr Amarjeet Singh Manhas has emerged as the frontrunner for the coveted post of Mumbai Congress chief. The Congress high-command initiated a major exercise to scout for the new president of Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC), one of the most powerful units of the party in the country. Among those who occupied this coveted post include SK Patil - who is often referred to as “Uncrowned King of Bombay”, Rajni Patel, the barrister-politician and Murli Deora, the politician, businessman and social worker. What works in Manhas’s favour is that he had worked very closely with successive MRCC presidents including Murli Deora, Gurudas Kamat, Kripshankar Singh, Janardan Chandurkar, Sanjay Nirupam, Milind Deora and Eknath Gaikwad. He has been among the key team members that planned and organised the rallies of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi in Mumbai. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) wants to declare the new MRCC president at the earliest so that they can launch preparations for the 2022 elections to the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). AICC general secretary HK Patil, who is the general secretary in-charge for Maharashtra, has held a series of discussions in batches in Mumbai to finalise the name. Besides Manhas, others in the reckoning are Suresh Shetty and Mohammed Arif Naseem Khan – both ex-ministers in the erstwhile Congress-NCP Democratic Front government and senior leaders Bhai Jagtap, Charan Singh Sapra and Madhu Chavan. “During the meetings that HK Patil had in Mumbai, a majority of the people, cutting across factions, had suggested the name of Manhas. However, the Congress high-command would take a final call depending on circumstances and their independent evaluation,” a senior Congressman, who was privy to the meetings, told DH. A Sikh, Manhas, is an ex-senate member of the management council of the University of Mumbai and former MHADA chairman. In Mumbai Congress, he had served as treasurer and vice president. Manhas though a frontrunner has a big competition. Shetty is a former health minister, while Khan is a former minority affairs minister. An MLC, Sapra is a veteran and often appears in TV debates giving Congress perspective. Jagtap has started off as a trade unionist and has a good hold. Chavan is a veteran of Mumbai Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/amarjeet-singh-manhas-frontrunner-for-mumbai-congress-chief-s-post-923998.html

06-12-2020||West||'Delhi Chalo' march: Maharashtra's MVA govt extends support to farmers, Uddhav Thackeray to attend meeting in Delhi||As farmers intensified their protests around Delhi, the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government has backed the farmers with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar coming out in support of farmers. Thackeray asserted that farmers are the backbone of the country and resolving their problems should be the government’s priority. The observation came when a delegation of Shiromani Akali Dal led by MP Prem Singh Chandumarja called on him in Mumbai and urged him to join a meeting of major Opposition and regional parties from around the country in New Delhi scheduled within a fortnight to draw out the future strategy. Thackeray assured that he would join the meeting and also expressed full support to all programmes in the farmers' unrest over the farm laws. “The chief minister has assured support to all the farmers' agitation and would also come for the meeting in Delhi,” Chandumarja said after the meeting. On the other hand, Pawar, a two-time Union agriculture minister, is expected to call on President Ram Nath Kovid on Wednesday. “When the farm bills were being passed, the Opposition parties had urged the government not to hurry. We had requested that a discussion is needed, it should be sent to a Select Committee, but that didn’t happen and the bill was passed quickly. Now, the government is facing problems because of that haste,” Pawar said. "I sincerely hope wisdom dawns on the government and it takes cognisance to resolve the issue. If this stalemate continues, the protest will not be limited to Delhi, but people from the nook and corner of the country will stand by the protesting farmers," Pawar said. Maharashtra Congress chief and state’s Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said his party is with the farmers in this do-or-die battle for justice from the BJP-led Central government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/delhi-chalo-march-maharashtras-mva-govt-extends-support-to-farmers-uddhav-thackeray-to-attend-meeting-in-delhi-924144.html
