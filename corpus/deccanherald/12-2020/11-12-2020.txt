Vaccinations have started, though on a limited scale, and one of the front-runners in the vaccine race, the Pfizer vaccine developed in the US, has already been put into action. Pfizer has applied for permission for emergency use of the vaccine from the Indian regulatory authority, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGA). As have the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is manufacturing the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, and the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. The Pfizer vaccine has got approval from the UK regulator. Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for vaccines is not a common practice. Vaccines usually take years to be researched, developed and tested. Since Covid-19 vaccines are being developed in a matter of months, they need to be examined by regulatory authorities even more closely than usual for both their effectiveness and likely side effects for all categories of people. The DCGA has done well to seek more data on the clinical trials carried out so far from the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech. The SII has been told to provide updated safety data, data from trials held in India and the UK, and the outcome of the UK regulator’s assessment. Bharat Biotech has been told to present safety and efficacy data from its ongoing trials. Many vaccines are being developed the world over on various platforms using various techniques. Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have published data on the efficacy and safety levels of their vaccines, but it has been noted that some of the data need more clarity. The demands for such clarifications are related to the age groups and categories of people on whom trials were conducted and the effectiveness of the vaccine in various groups.  Therefore, caution is the watchword in dealing with requests for EAU. Though some countries like the US and the UK have provisions for it in their regulatory scheme, there is no clear provision for it in India and thus there is a need for special care. The regulator should not only be completely satisfied with all aspects of safety and efficacy but should also ensure that the relevant data is available in the public domain for scrutiny. No compromises should be made. Transparency is essential for creating public confidence which is required for the success of the vaccination project. Though most people are waiting for a vaccine, there is some vaccine hesitancy among sections of people. Any slip-up or lapse in any respect is likely to lead to serious setbacks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/covid-19-vaccine-no-compromises-should-be-made-925915.html
11-12-2020||In Perspective||Is the Trans Persons Act inclusive?||In a male-dominated society, the transgender community is not only marginalized but also largely forgotten. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 passed by the Parliament of India was enacted with the apparent objective to safeguard and protect the rights and interests of transgender persons. However, various provisions of the 2019 Act are regressive and violative of the fundamental rights that have been upheld by the Supreme Court in the cases of NALSA vs. Union of India and Navtej Johar vs Union of India.  The 2019 Act attempts to control gender non-conforming identities and non-biological family relations in a manner that keeps them subordinate to the hetero-normative patriarchal family structures. Section 12(3) of the Act that compels transgender persons to either continue living with their birth family or to be placed in rehabilitation centres upon the orders by a competent court is violative of the rights of transgender persons under Article 19 of the Constitution of India, 1950. The Article guarantees to every citizen the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. It does not make any distinction in treatment between minors and adult transgender persons and is an intrusive manner of regulating the choice of where these individuals can choose to live. Denying transgender persons’ the choice to live in any alternative arrangement, say for instance the choice of living as a family within a transgender community, could be seen as an instance of interference with their decisional autonomy recognized by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of K.S. Puttuswamy vs Union of India. Gender non-conformity among transgender persons begins at a very young age, which very often results in their own families banishing them from homes as they do not fit in the gender binaries. Any diversion from pre-set social norms is considered abnormal which compels transgender persons to seek shelter outside their homes that are accepting of who they are. This is when the guru-chela system, the alternative family structure comes into play. However, these structures are not immune to the vices of exploitation. The hijras are systematically organized as hierarchical communities within themselves. The guru, like an elder in a family, is expected to take care of the chela’s material needs and the chela is expected to show respect and obedience to the guru and give the guru the earnings. Every hijra joins the community under the sponsorship of a guru, who is ideally her guru for life. Once there’s a newcomer, gurus bid for the chela and whoever bids the highest price gets to become the guru of the new transgender person. The guru chela system is hierarchal, rooted in graded inequality and creates exploitative spaces. Transgender persons are expected to earn for their gurus through begging and sex work. The hijra community has developed effective mechanisms of social control over its members, in the event that chelas do not earn or carry out the instructions of their guru. The hijra community does not empower chelas by encouraging them to study, which would mean that members would not be dependent on their gurus. The hijra community cultivates systematic dependence. Transgender persons are often not accepted by their biological families for being who they are and are exploited in the hands of gurus who provide alternative family structures. The only solution to break the patterns of discrimination and oppression undoubtedly is to raise awareness and break the stigma, empowerment through education, employment and skill-building of the transgender community can be facilitated through reservations. Reservations are crucial for integrating transgender persons into mainstream society by enabling them to receive education and gain employment in public office. Reservations will ensure that transgender persons are provided with the means to actively participate in social life in the future. Furthermore, this will also ensure there is greater diversity and representation in public appointments. The appropriate method of providing reservations for transgender persons would be horizontal reservations which would cut across the vertical reservations provided based on caste categories and indicators of backwardness. Horizontal reservations recognize that an individual can come from a marginalised caste background and can have other vulnerabilities such as disabilities and transgender status which will essentially address the intersectional discrimination faced by Dalit and Adivasi trans persons. The Apex court in NALSA held ‘sex’ as a protected characteristic under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution to include ‘gender identity’, which would mean that sex-based protections should extend to transgender and intersex persons. The Court also identified transgender and intersex persons as socially and educationally backward citizens. Therefore, transgender persons are entitled to reservations in the matter of appointments, as envisaged under Article 16(4) of the Constitution. Moving forward, the challenge will be to create social welfare schemes and measures to uplift and empower the trans community which will aim to embrace gender diversity and fluidity.

NEKRTC bus services have been hit severely as drivers and conductors of Kalaburagi district extended their support to the ongoing strike demanding the state government consider them government employees. The drivers have parked the buses out of the platforms at the bus stand. They refused to perform their duty despite a repeated appeal from officials. A bus driver said the government has not responded positively to their long-pending demand for them to be considered government employees and those who have staged a protest at Bengaluru on Thursday night have been arrested. Condemning the government’s attitude, we have launched a strike, he said. Bus service was normal in the morning in the city. About 40 schedules from Sedam and Chincholi depots were cancelled due to shortage of staff, said Kalaburagi Depot-1 traffic controller Santoshkumar. An official on condition of anonymity said that NEKRTC buses should have been operated in 1769 routes by 11 am but they have been operated in 1140 routes and about 629 routes were cancelled. More routes have been cancelled in Vijayapura, Koppal, Ballari and Raichur districts, he explained.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/kalaburagi/strike-hits-nekrtc-bus-services-in-kalaburagi-926129.html

11-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Panchayat seat auctions: Going, going, gone for Rs 1 crore!||The auctioning of gram panchayat seats in parts of Tumakuru district would leave the IPL auction in the shade. The panchayat seats in the district are being auctioned off to highest bidders in violation of the People’s Representation Act. A few GP seats are said to have ‘sold’ for Rs 1 crore. One such GP seat at Bettahalli in Paduvagere Gram Panchayat limits under Amruturu hobli of Kunigal taluk was sold for Rs 1 crore in an open auction held recently. A businessman from Bengaluru has bought the seat for the astronomical sum (considering the fact that it was for a panchayat seat). The person in question had reportedly told the villagers that he would give more, post-election. A local leader, on the condition of anonymity, told DH that the money would be used for renovation of Anjaneya Swamy temple and for development works in the village. A stern warning issued by the state election commission against the auctioning of GP seats has failed to deter the villagers from ‘selling’ the panchayat seats for huge sums. With December 11 being the last date for filing of nominations for the first phase of GP polls, scheduled for December 27, the bidding process has gathered steam in the last two to three days in several villages of Kunigal taluk, where the panchayat membership is sold for a few lakhs. Three seats at Kadumattikere in Kittanamangala GP went for Rs 12 lakh, Rs 11.75 lakh and Rs 1.45 lakh. Likewise, a panchayat seat in Sondekoppa was auctioned off for Rs 16 lakh and two Chowdanakuppe GP seats sold for Rs 5 and Rs 3 lakh. The trend is fast catching up with border villages of Pavagada taluk. Three seats of Chikkahalli in Nagalapura GP combined comes with a price tag of Rs 20.6 lakh.  ‘Nothing wrong’ The highest bidders will be elected unopposed, provided if they pay the bid amount before the filing of nomination. If they fail to do so, then the next highest bidder will be allowed to file nomination. If in case a villager contests the election after the auctioning of seat, he will have to face the boycott. Defending the sale of panchayat seats, a leader from Kittanamangala told DH, “The money received from the auctioning of panchayat seats will be used for development works of the village. This process will prevent groupism and political rivalry, which is common in many villages during the elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/panchayat-seat-auctions-going-going-gone-for-rs-1-crore-925911.html

Owing to this, movement of all KSRTC buses were halted across the district on Friday. The unaware passengers, who arrived at the bus stand, were left stranded. Except for a handful of staff at the bus stand, most of the employees remained absent for duty. The passengers were seen waiting for hours hoping that the buses would start the service. But after they realised that the buses would not get on the roads, they took the private buses. The passengers coming from far off places experienced inconvenience. The drivers got the buses to the bus stand early in the morning. A few buses started functioning as usual. But, as the strike was confirmed, drivers and conductors stayed away from duty. They staged a protest for sometime symbolically and went home. Thus, the movement of buses was completely halted. The protesters said that they are in a difficult situation. They do not get facilities like government employees. They demanded that the government should consider them as government employees. They said that they are getting 50% lesser salary than the government employees. They are facing difficulty in managing children's education, healthcare and family. The government should look into all this and consider our just demand, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ksrtc-employees-stage-stir-passengers-face-inconvenience-926185.html

11-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||House adjourned: Anti-cow slaughter bill not tabled in Council||The state government’s joy of getting its ambitious Cow slaughter Bill passed in the Legislative Assembly turned out to be a short-lived one as the bill failed to get the approval of the Upper House (Legislative Council) on Thursday. The Council was adjourned sine die on Thursday even before the government could table the bill for discussion. Unable to get the bill cleared in the Council, the government, according to constitutional experts, has to go the ordinance way to promulgate its decision. Interestingly, the Council proceedings scheduled for Thursday had reference to the discussion on the Cow Slaughter bill. But when BJP MLCs demanded that their no-confidence motion reference be taken up for discussion, Congress MLC B K Hariprasad referred to the Cow Slaughter bill discussion in the proceedings and demanded the Chairperson to allow debate on the bill. Responding to the suggestion, the Leader of the House Kota Srinivas Poojary said that the bill can be taken up for discussion on Friday as the minister concerned was not present in the House. When BJP MLCs insisted on discussing the no-confidence motion, Chairperson Pratapchandra Shetty adjourned the House sine die much to the surprise of BJP leaders. Unable to pass the bill that was already passed in the Assembly, the state government has no alternative than to promulgate an ordinance to enforce the provisions of the bill till the next session of the State Legislature. Even though BJP MLCs had demanded the extension of the House proceedings till December 15, the Congress MLCs refused to fall in line with the saffron party leaders. Stating that he would pronounce his decision on the floor of the House, Chairperson Pratapchandra Shetty adjourned the House sine die when BJP members insisted debate on the no-confidence motion against him. In the meantime, the state government has decided to write to the Council Chairperson Prathapchandra Shetty to conduct the session till Tuesday. “We decided to adjourn only the Assembly sine die and not the Council,” Law Minister J C Madhuswamy told reporters. He alleged that the Chairman had adjourned the Council all of a sudden and set a bad precedent of defeating government bills repeatedly. The Law minister further said that the Deputy CM Laxman Savadi and Opposition chief whip in the Council Mahantesh Kavatagimath had even met the Governor on Thursday evening to bring the matter to his notice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/house-adjourned-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-not-tabled-in-council-925962.html
11-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Now, HD Kumaraswamy bats for farmers over anti-cow slaughter Bill||The anti-cow slaughter Bill is likely to hit dairy farming in the state, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy has warned.  In an official statement on Thursday, the former chief minister said the Bill, in its current form, gave scope for officials to harass farmers.  Kumaraswamy’s pro-farmer stand comes after he was criticised for his ‘anti-farmer’ stance, when his party helped the BJP in getting the land reforms Bill passed in the Legislative Council earlier this week.  The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill was passed in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. “The Bill mentions that farmers have to take a permit from the animal husbandry department for cattle transport. Officials can misuse this power,” Kumaraswamy said. Further, Kumaraswamy said the farmer will be held responsible for the slaughter of cattle. “Once he sells, how can he be sure where the cattle land? The Bill also says that police and officials can inspect the dairy farms. All these clauses will only create more scope for irregularities and the possibility of the farmer being harassed by officials,” he said.  Moreover, farmers find it difficult to manage male calves as they are neither useful for dairy nor for agriculture, he argued. “With so many restrictions on the sale of cattle, it will impose a financial burden on farmers to maintain cattle. Unless the government provides alternatives for taking care of cattle, this Bill will be detrimental to farmers,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/now-hd-kumaraswamy-bats-for-farmers-over-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-925963.html
11-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Why won’t BJP ban beef export? asks Siddaramaiah||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Friday claimed that some of India’s leading beef exporters were BJP supporters, even as he mounted a fresh attack on the BJP government over the anti-cow slaughter law. "Why won’t they (BJP) ban the export of beef? Those exporting beef are BJP supporters so that they can make money,” Siddaramaiah told a news conference, naming some of these companies and their owners.  "In several states, there are no anti-cow slaughter laws. Is it there in Kerala, Goa, and northeastern states? Why only Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh?”, Siddaramaiah said.  Armed with statistics, the Congress leader warned that the proposed law would spell doom for farmers as well as SC/STs who depend on the leather industry.  “It is estimated that 3.4 crore male calves are born every year and about 3.5 crore cattle will reach reproductive age. If the average lifespan of a bull is considered 10 years, there will be 34 crore bulls in the next ten years. About 6 crore cows, out of 27 crore livestock, become unproductive. Who will take care of all them?”, Siddaramaiah said.  The proposed law will make life more difficult for farmers, he argued, while quoting figures from the 20th Livestock Census. "There are 39.08 lakh mixed breed cattle and 45.60 lakh pure breed. There are 25.75 lakh families who have cows and 13.17 who keep buffalos. These animals need 23 lakh tonnes of fodder every month - that’s 2.76 crore tonnes a year. Is there enough fodder,” he asked.  Siddaramaiah said that the government’s claim of opening new Gau Shalas was impractical. “Who will pay for their maintenance? Almost 90% of farmers are small and marginal. Where will they get the money? Will the government pay? Those behind this Bill are those who've never domesticated cows, buffalos, and oxen,” he said.   The 1964 Act in force allows the slaughter of non-mulching or handicapped cattle, he said, adding that total prohibition on slaughter will be “a big burden” on farmers. “By simply worshipping the cow, it can’t be protected. Before bringing a law, the government should study the economic and social impact it would have,” he said, calling the Bill “draconian and unscientific.”  Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar said the Congress will design an outreach initiative against the BJP's 'anti-farmer' policies after the gram panchayat elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/why-won-t-bjp-ban-beef-export-asks-siddaramaiah-926215.html
11-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||ST tag: BJP should fight with Centre, say Cong Kuruba MLAs||A section of Congress leaders has demanded that the BJP government take up the issue of inclusion of Kurubas under ST category with the Centre.  While RDPR KS Eshwarappa, a Kuruba himself, is leading the demand for ST reservation for Kurubas, Congress leaders from the community alleged that the state's BJP leaders were creating unnecessary confusion. Speaking to media persons here on Friday, Congress' Kuruba leaders Raghavendra Hitnal, Byrathi Suresh and Yathindra Siddaramaiah demanded that the state government take this representation before the Centre. "Eshwarappa is leading the demand for ST reservation for Kurubas. The BJP is ruling both in Centre and in Karnataka. Why are the party's own ministers protesting against their government? The state government should get it approved from the Centre instead of its leaders protesting on the streets," Hitnal, the Koppal MLA, said.  When the Siddaramaiah-led Congress was in power, a proposal was sent to the Centre for Kurubas and Halumatha communities from Kalaburagi, Yadgir and Bidar districts, to be included under the ST category. "This proposal is gathering dust for the past five years. When the Centre has not considered this proposal, BJP leaders here are demanding that it be extended across the state. Why are they silent on the pending proposal," the Congress MLAs asked.  While the demand for ST reservation has gathered steam in the state, Siddaramaiah, who is seen as a tall Kuruba leader, has distanced himself from the protests. He has alleged that the ST Horata Samithi was backed by the RSS with the sole intention of dividing the community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/st-tag-bjp-should-fight-with-centre-say-cong-kuruba-mlas-926225.html
11-12-2020||Main Article||Farm laws: Reforms by regressive ways?||Many of the actions of our governments, both at the Centre and in many states, remind you of an ancient fable about a cock and a cat, attributed to Aesop. The cat is looking for any pretext to make a meal out of the cock. It accuses the cock of disturbing people every morning with its crowing. The cock argues that it is serving people and its activities benefit society. But the cat ends the dialogue observing that it is now her breakfast time. "Cats don't live on dialogue." Neither do monarchs. But democracies function effectively only through dialogue and discourse.   The three farm laws rammed through Parliament and given Presidential assent in a hurry have incurred the wrath of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have been protesting for two weeks and have laid siege to Delhi. Opposition parties across the country and many trade bodies and unions are opportunistically supporting their agitation, reminiscent of when a moribund BJP revived itself by jumping onto the Anna Hazare-led India Against Corruption bandwagon. Now the boot is on the other foot. The ruling party is trying to discredit the farmers, comprising of a large body of sturdy, stout and hearty Sikhs, and attempting to drive a wedge between different farmers’ groups. The farm bills contain far-reaching reforms that could be of benefit to small farmers, who comprise 85% of the farming community. One law unshackles the farmer from the clutches of the APMC mandis and frees him from strangulation by the cartels of brokers and traders in nexus with government inspectors by allowing him to sell where he wants and to whom he chooses anywhere in the country, through physical markets or from his farm gate or via e-markets. The second does away with the Essential Commodities Act and its restrictions on those crops that came under it, allowing greater leeway both in the free movement and storage of produce. The third law is aimed at contract farming directly with farmers and encourages start-ups to innovate and create new markets -- domestic and exports -- which are presumed to attract massive investments by corporates in procurement, processing and cold storages. These laws together are expected to result in better prices for farmers, by reducing wastage of perishables and by increasing competition among buyers, and also pave way for massive employment in agriculture. The laws do not per se seek to dismantle APMCs or do away with Minimum Support Price (MSP). This, in essence, is the premise of the three laws. Howsoever noble the intentions, though, we know from the past that these issues pertaining to agriculture are so intricate and complex that there is no silver bullet to solve them by just passing ordinances or ramming laws through Parliament. Reforms, to be successful, need continuous tweaking to remove bottlenecks, while preventing the formation of cartels. The three laws are important and are inextricably entwined. They will have far reaching impact on farming practices, the livelihood of farmers and farm labourers, supply chain linkages from the farm to retail shelves to your dinner plate. They could turbocharge agriculture start-ups and giant corporates and interconnect the millions of small-time traditional buyers, wholesalers and agents who all form part of the tangled web that will continue to be the backbone of our economy for many years to come.  There are also the ancient weekly village fairs and local markets, as old as our hills, which are probably the best free markets that give access to farmers and artisans to sell their farm produce and vend their pots, their baskets and wares, and also help them market their cattle, sheep, and poultry and pigs as well as buy their weekly needs. And there are the APMC yards, instituted in the 1960s, which serve a good purpose in a number of states, are absent in a few states, and are an anomaly in many other states, having become moribund and cesspools of corruption. Let us also remember that there are only a limited number of crops that come under the APMC. There are dozens of other crops, fruits and vegetables, flowers and livestock and dairy produce that affect more farmers than those whose crops come under the APMC Act. These crops are not eligible for the government’s MSP, and complaints persist that these benefits are not reaching such farmers.  We must recognise that the bills can do enormous good but also have many attendant dangers. Government monopolies like the APMCs are inefficient and indifferent to customers The private sector, on the other hand, maybe efficient but it's a rapacious, predatory monster. There are legitimate concerns that let alone MNCs, Indian corporates and crony capitalists could turn out to be unscrupulous and venal when they become monopolies or form cartels. There is a genuine fear that APMCs may collapse as a result of these laws and farmers will then be at the mercy of large business houses who will eliminate competition and prey on them -- a trend that started long ago and has steadily grown, with the increasing influence of a few big business houses on government policy. When procurement through MSP is delayed or denied, farmers under duress will fall into the clutches of corporations run by oligarchs. The unsolved question is, therefore, how to ensure that the reforms do not lead to monopolies or cartelisation  Equally important is the issue of federalism. Agriculture is a state subject under the Constitution, and the states play a critical role in the sector, but they have scarcely been involved in the framing and passing of the laws.    When leaders in government admit that they may not have all the answers, that no one has a magic formula for societal and economic problems, it will open up avenues for dialogue and debate and lead to faster, amicable and simpler solutions through consensus instead of conflict.  Tagore's lines of penetrating insight may serve us well: "The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of the well-wisher...the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe."  (The writer is a farmer, soldier and pioneer of low-cost airlines in India)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/farm-laws-reforms-by-regressive-ways-925916.html

As the State government passed the Bill during the Assembly Session on Tuesday, they demanded that the law be enforced in a comprehensive manner, across the district. Hundreds of workers, swaying party flags, launched the march, by performing puja to cows, on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. They submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Dr M V Venkatesh. Several bullock carts too participated in the rally and traffic was affected on the highway for a while. The demonstrators alleged that the Police department has failed to take strict action against those involved in illegal animal trafficking. The animals are being transported to Kerala from Hassan, via Kunigal-Maddur-Malavalli route. Police should take legal action against them, they stressed. They pointed out that instead of taking action against those involved in illegal animal transportation, the police have been filing cases against the informers. The government has even provided compensation to the traffickers, who were killed in an attack on Police. The  police and other officials should provide protection to those fighting to save cattle, they demanded.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/bjp-workers-demand-implementation-of-anti-cow-slaughter-act-925931.html

Not only students, working professionals too have gained weight due to lack of physical activity, stress, and other reasons. Covid has disrupted routines for many families. For children and teens, late night sleep and waking up late has disturbed normal life and activities. Due to Covid, a majority of the people concentrate more on personal hygiene. Many maintain distance and wear masks for hours. Meanwhile, people, particularly in urban areas have no option for physical activity, resulting in obesity. Ramya Arun Kumar, mother of a 9-year-old boy, says, her son gained 12 kg since the lockdown in March. "He sleeps late in the night and wakes up only after 9 am and attends classes online. His lifestyle has changed a lot. I don’t allow him to go out to the playground and thus he has to stay indoors. He used to wake up at 6 am during regular school days and he used to play football every day. Now, he is reluctant to go for a walk, either in the morning or in the evening," she said. Subhash, a 33-year-old, working from home, said, he gained 15 kg in just four months, from April to July. "Now, it is difficult to reduce weight. By practicing yoga, I reduced four kg. I put on weight due to lack of physical activity during lockdown," he said. According to health professionals, eating the right food at the right time has a huge impact on either gaining or losing weight, particularly for kids and teenagers. "Children must eat three meals a day and one snacks. A minimum physical activity is must, to maintain a healthy body. Consuming more liquid food and vegetables will help to reduce weight. One gains weight even due to stressed life," said Dr Uday Kumar.  Physical fitness trainer Balchandra said, "Due to the outbreak of Covid, many could not do physical exercise and parks were closed for strollers. Though the people eat healthy food, calories must be burnt to maintain a healthy physique". According to another fitness trainer M G Sukesh, after lockdown, many are reluctant to attend gym for exercises. He says, without physical activity, it is not possible to reduce weight and to maintain health.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/with-schools-closed-kids-gain-weight-parents-worried-925932.html

The Mysuru-Bengaluru buses that operate every 10 minutes were seen reaching the bus stand at a gap of one hour. As a result, there was a heavy rush for the buses, with the people ignoring the Covid-19 norms. The buses to other districts like Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Hassan stayed away from the roads in the morning. However, the bus service to rural areas was not affected.

This came following a report submitted by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar on the incident that took place in Kolkata's Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, on Thursday. Nadda's convoy was attacked with stones and sticks and Dhankar had alleged that violators had the protection of the state government. Sources said Bengal Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and Director General of Police Virendra have been summoned on next Monday and are likely to be asked about the law and order in the state as well as steps being taken to prevent political violence. Though the Centre has received a report from the Governor, the MHA is yet to receive one form the Mamata Banerjee-led government despite asking details of the "security lapses" that led to the attack on the visiting BJP president. The incident had further intensified the war of words between the Trinamool Congress and BJP ahead of the Assembly elections in April-May next year when the saffron party hopes to unseat the Banerjee-led party. Banerjee had called the incident a "drama" created by the BJP while the Governor targeted the Trinamool Congress saying the law and order situation is deteriorating in the state. He also said the Chief Minister should desist from calling the BJP a party of outsiders. On Thursday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted, "Bengal has descended into an era of tyranny, anarchy and darkness under the Trinamool rule... The manner in which political violence has been institutionalised and brought to the extreme in West Bengal under TMC rule is sad and worrying". तृणमूल शासन में बंगाल अत्याचार, अराजकता और अंधकार के युग में जा चुका है। टीएमसी के राज में पश्चिम बंगाल के अंदर जिस तरह से राजनीतिक हिंसा को संस्थागत कर चरम सीमा पर पहुँचाया गया है, वो लोकतांत्रिक मूल्यों में विश्वास रखने वाले सभी लोगों के लिए दु:खद भी है और चिंताजनक भी। Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had also spoken to the West Bengal chief secretary on Thursday after Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh shot off a letter to Shah complaining about the incident. Ghosh had alleged, "during his (Nadda's) different engagements in Kolkata, it was observed that there were serious lapses on security arrangements, purportedly due to negligence and/or casual approach of the state police department."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mha-summons-west-bengal-chief-secretary-dgp-on-december-14-over-alleged-attack-on-naddas-convoy-926058.html

A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh dismissed the petition after the petitioner sought to withdraw it with liberty to approach the Supreme Court. "Advocate Yash Chaturvedi for the petitioner seeks liberty to withdraw the petition with liberty to further prosecute the petition seeking similar relief instituted by him herein before the Supreme Court. Leave and liberty granted The petition is dismissed as withdrawn," the bench said while dictating the order. The bench said once the petition has already been filed in the Supreme Court with similar prayers, it cannot keep it pending here. The petition filed by Mumbai-based lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay has also sought direction to the NIA to investigate the matter in a time-bound manner and the probe be monitored by the high court, alleging that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite lapse of considerable time. It had claimed that the crime branch of Delhi Police has miserably failed in tracing out/ apprehending/ arresting Maulana Saad, despite lapse of considerable time and his photograph being published in electronic media. “It is virtually impossible for Maulana Saad to hide himself for such a long time and that too in the capital of the country. Performance of Delhi Police has been pathetic from the very inception and outset. Failure of the Delhi Police is explicit from the fact that despite there being lockdown and curfew-like situation, Maulana Saad was able to arrange a gathering of thousands of people belonging to Tablighi Jamaat in the capital of India,” the plea claimed. The plea alleged, that “from media reports and evidence so far collected by Delhi Police Crime Branch, it is now axiomatic that Maulana Saad and his henchmen conspired to spread and transmit coronavirus in different parts of the country, with oblique and ulterior motive of causing massive deaths all over the country and thereby to derail the Government of India in preventing the deadly disease.” The Delhi Police's crime branch had on March 31 lodged an FIR against seven persons, including the cleric, on a complaint by Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station here for holding a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat followers in alleged violation of the orders against large gatherings to contain the spread of coronavirus. The Enforcement Directorate has also filed a money laundering case against Saad, trusts links to the Jamaat and others. The plea alleged that the acts of omission and commission of Saad and his associates/Tablighi Jamaat constitute “terrorist acts/activities” as defined under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and claimed that the Delhi Police has failed to arrest the leader despite lapse of considerable time. It said people of Tablighi Jamaat have been spreading the deadly virus all over the country not only by defying the national lockdown, but also by assaulting corona warriors who have been treating the patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-high-court-rejects-plea-to-transfer-tablighi-jamaat-case-to-nia-926086.html

Farmers from different states have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) border points for nearly two weeks now to demand a repeal of the farm laws enacted in September. "Essentially the farmers are acting out of pure suspicion of the government's motives. What they are saying is not that these reforms could not be good, they are saying 'we think that this is the thin end of the wedge and something else, much worse is about to happen'," Banerjee said, speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. Reiterating that there is a general loss of trust, between the government and its people, Banerjee said the agitation is illustrative of what happens when those very far away from its people, with little connection to them, make large-scale legislations. On Thursday, farmer unions threatened to block railway tracks across the country and all highways leading to Delhi if their demands are not met. The announcement came a day after farmers' leaders rejected the government's offer to amend the new agri laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system. “It is not so much that you could not make a case for getting rid of many of these very old-fashioned institutions we have in the agriculture sector, we absolutely could, but the lack of trust is massive," he added. Flagging the finer issue in the 'centre vs states' problem, which inadvertently feeds large-scale agitations, Banerjee made a case for more federalism within states. The Nobel laureate flagged how the size of India's states is disproportionate to the number of MPs allocated: "Indian states are way too big, too clunky and too unable to focus on specific areas. We need much more federalism within the state... The Indian constituencies are so big that if I were an MP I can’t really be useful to most people in my constituency. At all levels, we have not adjusted to the scale." The states are partly acting out of their own political interest but the broader paradigm of lack of trust is key to the issue, and federalism is only one pieze of the puzzle, Banerjee explained. Farmers worry the newly passed farm laws will eliminate the safety net of MSP and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.

The former party chief cited a media report that claimed that an agricultural household in Punjab earns the highest in a year, while it was lowest in Bihar. "The farmer wants his income to be as much as that of farmers of Punjab. The Modi government wants the income of all farmers of the country to be as much as that of Bihar farmers," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.  The survey cited by Gandhi showed that an average Indian agricultural household earns Rs 77,124 in a year, with Punjab farmers earning Rs 2,16,708 annually and that of Bihar only Rs 42,684. Congress has been attacking the government over the new farm laws and has alleged that these will lower farmers' income. The party has also been alleging that the farm laws seek to end the minimum support price regime and abolish the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act. The government has claimed otherwise and has said that the laws will help increase farm income.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-attacks-modi-govt-over-farmers-incomes-926099.html

The Indian Medical Association (IMA), which had given the nation-wide call on December 1, has demanded withdrawal of the notification. Doctors at AIIMS, and various Delhi government-run facilities, including LNJP Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, DDU Hospital, GTB Hospital, BSA Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, and civic-run Hindu Rao Hospital performed duties while wearing black armbands and ribbons. The Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS-Delhi, in a statement said, "This step will not only encourage already rampant quackery, but also undermine the safety of public. We request the government of India to retract this notification immediately". "We stand with our medical fraternity in this regard and support the strike called by Indian Medical Association," it said. Shivaji Deb Barman, president of FORDA, an apex bodies of various RDAs in Delhi, said, doctors in Delhi will observe black ribbon protest, but "will not withdraw any services". The IMA has given a call for withdrawal of non-essential and non-Covid services between 6 am and 6 pm on Friday to protest against the notification.   The notification by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) to allow legal practice of surgeries by Ayurveda practitioners and the formation of four committees by NITI Aayog  for integration of all systems of medicine will only lead to "mixopathy", the IMA has said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/integration-of-medical-systems-will-lead-to-mixopathy-doctors-join-ima-call-for-protest-926105.html

The court declined to consider a PIL for directions to confiscate 'Benami' properties and disproportionate assets in cases of corruption and award life term to offenders. A bench presided over by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said, "Personally, I feel, we in society should change our thinking. For every person taking money, there is a person distributing money." The court asked petitioner, BJP leader and advocate A K Upadhyay to withdraw his PIL and approach the Law Commission with his idea to punish the corrupt and the criminal by confiscating their 100% assets and hand them out life term. The bench, also comprising Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said that Upadhyay was trying for a "Utopian situation". The court finally allowed senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana to withdraw the plea. It also said it cannot issue a mandamus to Parliament to pass a law in this regard. In his plea, Upadhyay claimed due to weak and ineffective anti-corruption laws, India has never been ranked even among the top 50 in the Corruption Perception Index. He also contended the Centre has not strengthened the laws to weed-out the menace of corruption, which brazenly offended rule of law as well as the right to life liberty dignity guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cant-direct-parliament-to-make-law-for-life-term-in-graft-cases-sc-926130.html
11-12-2020||National||BJP lawmaker likens Mamata Banerjee to 'Tadaka' ||Controversial BJP legislator Surendra Singh likened West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to the demoness 'Tadaka' and said that she would be ousted from power by the trio 'Rama, Lakshman, Hanuman' (Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath). 'Tadaka' was a demoness, who, according to the Hindu mythology, used to harass saints and sages worshipping in the forests. She was killed by Lord Rama and his brother Lakshman. The demoness finds mention in the Hindu epic 'Ramayana'. ''Mamata Banerjee is Tadaka of democracy... No one is safe in West Bengal under her government... Tadaka's vadha (killing) is certain as Rama, Lakshman and Hanuman have arrived,'' he said referring to the alleged attack on the convoy of BJP president J P Nadda at Diamond Harbour near Kolkata on Thursday. Singh said that there, however, were many, who would not care even if shot, and hoist the saffron flag in West Bengal. ''Mamata is certain to lose power in the state,'' he added. The BJP lawmaker had earlier also likened Mamata to 'Surpanakha' (the sister of demon king Ravana, whose nose had been chopped off by Lakshman). The MLA had also said that Mamata was getting help from foreign powers. Nadda's convoy was allegedly attacked by TMC workers, while it was passing through the area. BJP alleged that scores of vehicles in the convoy were damaged. Mamata, however, termed the allegations as blatant lies and accused the saffron party of staging attacks to remain in the news.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-lawmaker-likens-mamata-banerjee-to-tadaka-926131.html

The Bill is in circulation to get suggestions and opinions from the stakeholders and general public after which it would be placed before both Houses of Parliament, IOV president P K Thiagarajan told reporters here. On the basis of a committees recommendation formed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Bill is exploring to establish a National Institute of Valuers (NIV), he said. The NIV would serve the purpose of developing the profession of valuers and regulating the market of valuation service, he said at the sidelines of the two-day 51st Indian Valuers Conference 2020. A committee has also been set up to promote practices and standards of professional conduct for valuers and reports submitted to the Ministry, he said. Once the Bill becomes an Act, the valuers would have their own standards like doctors and CAs and become a part and parcel of the economic growth of the country, IOV Coimbatore branch chairman, M Adakkalayan said. As such there are more than 30,000 valuers in the country and nearly 8,000 in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and the youth, who after passing out Plus-two, can join the continued education course to become a valuer who can become a registered valuer after 10 years, he said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parliament-nod-awaited-for-valuers-bill-926133.html

The plea argued that the new farm laws are unconstitutional and anti-farmer and these laws will make farmers position vulnerable to corporate greed of multinational companies. “That these laws would dismantle the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) system intended to ensure fair prices for farm products," it claimed, adding that these laws were passed in haste.   The plea said the farmers are very much afraid that the corporates will twist and turn words to wind them in an unfavourable contract just like money lenders.  It also claimed that the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act would facilitate black marketing, thus attacking the very foundation of the agriculture fabric of the nation. The apex court had already issued a notice on a batch of petitions filed by Siva, RJD MP Manoj Jha and others against the three farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-body-moves-sc-says-new-farm-laws-will-make-them-vulnerable-to-corporate-greed-926158.html

11-12-2020||National||Set up toll-free helpline numbers, special surveillance to tackle human trafficking: NHRC||With the Covid-19 pandemic "disproportionately" impacting the vulnerable sections, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the Centre and state governments to set up round-the-clock toll-free helpline numbers for real-time reporting and special surveillance in railway stations, bus depots and airports. The 'Advisory to Combat Human Trafficking in the Context of Covid-19 Pandemic' also urges the governments to activate Anti-Human Trafficking Units (ATHUs) in all districts and immediate release of funds to the victims who are rescued. Keeping in mind Covid-19 protocol, online skill development training programmes should be organised besides helping child survivors to resume education. It noted that the Ministry of Women and Child Development received 27 lakh distress calls and intervened in 1.92 lakh distress on the ground. Out of these interventions, at least 32,700 were cases of trafficking, child marriage, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, forced begging and cybercrimes. Village vigilance committees should be set up to record details of migrants going in and out of villages and to intercept cases of trafficking. Arrangements should also be made at village level to identify children who are not attending schools as well as drop-outs, the advisory said. To tackle the possibilities of trafficking, the NHRC also wants the government to take adequate steps to provide livelihood opportunities through schemes like MNREGA, PM-GKY and DDU-GKY. The NHRC also wants the governments to activate ATHUs in all districts. The Ministry of Home Affairs had earlier this month asked states to take steps to set up ATHUs in all districts and give the mandate to women help desks at police stations to handle cases locally, DH reported. Shelter homes for both male and female survivors must be established in all states and it should be open round-the-clock. Counselling services also should be provided to trafficking survivors. The financial assistance of Rs 20,000 under the central sector scheme for bonded labourers must be paid without any delay and compensation of up to Rs 3 lakh should be provided immediately after the issuance of release certificate by the District Magistrate. It also asked the state governments and district administrations to put in place foolproof measures to closely monitor the functioning of private recruitment agencies within their jurisdiction. According to the advisory, a 24X7 toll-free helpline number must be in place for real-time reporting, tracking and monitoring cases related to human trafficking. Special surveillance should be put in place at railway stations, bus depots, airports and routes to remote villages to trace children travelling without adult supervision, suspicious persons and to identify vulnerable spots in the region concerned with trafficking.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/set-up-toll-free-helpline-numbers-special-surveillance-to-tackle-human-trafficking-nhrc-926166.html

He said India is the only G20 nation to be in compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Addressing a press meet on the eve of 'Five years of Paris Agreement', the minister said India is "walking the talk" on climate change as it has already achieved 21 per cent of its target of reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35 per cent by 2030. "India's historical contribution to this phenomenon of climate change is only three per cent. India is not responsible for the problem of climate change. Still we will do our bit. Presently, we are contributing only 6.8 per cent of global emissions and per capita emissions is only 1.9 tonnes. Thus, our historical as well present contribution to Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is low. "We are among the few countries who are Paris Agreement compliant i.e. our actions lead to maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius which is to be achieved by the year 2100. India is the only G20 country which is complying to the Paris Agreement," Javadekar said. The G20 or Group of 20 countries comprises the world's largest and fastest-growing economies and accounts for 85 per cent of the global GDP and two-thirds of its population. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 countries in Paris on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. India submitted its ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in 2015 under the Paris Agreement for the post 2020 period with three quantitative goals. "One of the NDCs is to reduce emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35 per cent by 2030 over 2005 levels. I am happy to say that we have already achieved 21 per cent and the remaining will be achieved in next 10 years because Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 but its implementation begins in 2021," he said. Javadekar also said that the developed nations did not fulfil their financial and technological commitments in 11 years. "It was decided that every year the world will set aside 100 billion USD for developing nations to combat climate change. But now more than one trillion USD is pending. Technology transfer is not happening. If climate change is a disaster, there should be no profit in technology transfer," he said. The other important NDCs of India include achieving 40 per cent electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and to create carbon sink of 2.5 - 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through afforestation. Five other targets include sustainable lifestyles, climate friendly growth path, adaptation, finance and capacity building and technology. The minister highlighted that presently USA contributes 13.5 per cent CO2 emissions globally or 15.5 tonnes per capita emission, China contributes 30 per cent or 8.12 tonnes per capita, European Union and UK contributes 8.7 per cent of total emissions and 6.47 tonnes per capita emission. As per the minister, besides India, the other countries which are complying with the Paris Agreement are Costa Rica, Philippines, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Morocco and Gambia. "None of the developed countries are Paris Agreement compliant," he said, adding that USA, Russia and Saudi Arabia are among the countries which will cause temperature rise of 4 degrees Celsius while China, Japan, South Africa, Singapore, Chile, Argentina, and UAE will cause less than 4 degrees temperature rise. The countries which may cause temperature rise of up to three degrees include EU, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. Referring to some reports released this year, Javadekar said as per Climate Transparency Report 2020, India is the only G20 country to meet its climate commitments/NDCs. Another report - Climate Action Tracker - said India is among the few countries which are on track to achieve its NDCs. "UNEP Emission Gap Report said India's per capita emissions are 60 per cent lower than global average. Emissions grew just 1.4 per cent in 2019 which is much lower than the average of 3.3 per cent per year over the last decade. "Last report, Climate Change Performance Index 2020, said India is among the top 10 high performers rated very high for their well below 2 degrees Celsius compatibility," the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-not-responsible-for-climate-change-contributes-only-68-of-global-emissions-javadekar-926174.html

A three-judge bench presided over by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul told petitioner BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay it cannot entertain the plea. The petitioner led by senior advocate Anupam Lal Das contended that some baby steps have been taken but unless fair investigation was undertaken, nothing could be done. He also pointed out Lokpal did not have an independent investigating agency. The bench, however, suggested, in jest, the petitioner should write a book, instead of filing petitions. In his PIL, Upadhyay asked the court to direct the Lokpal-monitored investigation of the criminal political nexus, as referred by the Vohra Committee and directed by the Supreme Court in 1995. He pointed out the Committee headed by 1959-batch IAS officer examined the problem of criminalisation of politics and the nexus among criminals-politicians-bureaucrats. The panel's report contained serious observations made by central agencies on the criminal network which was virtually running parallel government.  It also discussed about criminal gangs who enjoyed patronage and protection of politicians and public servants and revealed that politicians had become the leaders of the gangs.  "The unpublished annexures of the Vohra Committee report contained highly explosive material that’s why the Supreme Court recommended establishing a high level committee for comprehensive investigation into the findings of the Vohra Committee and to secure the prosecution of all accused," he claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-refuses-plea-asking-govt-to-act-on-vohra-committee-report-926175.html

In the wide-ranging talks, Modi and Mirziyoyev strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed the determination of their countries to combat the menace by "destroying" terrorist safe-havens, networks, infrastructure and funding channels, according to a joint statement. Ways to speed up connectivity projects linking central Asia was a major focus of the summit and the Indian side welcomed a Uzbek proposal to hold a trilateral dialogue among India, Iran and Uzbekistan to promote connectivity through the Chabahar port. The statement said the two leaders discussed the situation in Afghanistan and noted that establishment of peace and stability in that country is of great importance to the security and stability of the entire region. In his opening remarks, Modi said the peace process in Afghanistan must preserve the achievements of the past two decades. "We also have a similar approach on regional security issues. We agree that the restoration of peace in Afghanistan requires a process that itself is led, owned and controlled by Afghanistan. It is also necessary to preserve the achievements of the last two decades," he said. The joint statement said India and Uzbekistan expressed their unanimity in their support for a united, sovereign and democratic Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Holding that the current level of bilateral trade does not reflect the true potential, the two leaders also instructed officials concerned to fast-track the conclusion of an ongoing joint feasibility study that will pave the way for commencement of negotiations on a preferential trade agreement, it said. The agreements signed are aimed at expanding cooperation in a range of areas including new and renewable energy, digital technologies, cyber security, community development projects, and in sharing of information on movement of goods. The statement said the Indian side confirmed the approval of USD 448 million of Line of Credit for four developmental projects in Uzbekistan in the fields of road construction, sewerage treatment and information technology. India had announced a USD 1-billion line of credit to Uzbekistan in 2018. In his remarks, Modi also said that India wants to further intensify its development partnership with Uzbekistan and expressed happiness that many projects are being considered in that country under the Indian Line of Credit. He referred to cooperation between the two countries in key areas of defence, space and atomic energy sectors. "Our security partnership is becoming a strong pillar of bilateral relations. Last year, the first joint military exercise between our armed forces took place. Our joint efforts are also increasing in the areas of space and atomic energy," he said. Modi also said India was ready to share its expertise and experience with Uzbekistan as per its development priorities. "India has great potential in areas such as infrastructure, IT, education, health, training and capacity building, which can be useful for Uzbekistan. The establishment of a joint working group on agriculture among us is an important and positive step," he said. Uzbekistan is a key country in Central Asia which India considers as its 'extended neighbourhood'. The bilateral ties now encompass a wider canvas of cooperation including in areas of defence and security, trade and investment, energy, agriculture, education and science and technology. "The leaders agreed that both sides should work towards an early conclusion of Bilateral Investment Treaty which shall facilitate investment promotion and protection for further improvement of trade and economic cooperation," the statement said. Highlighting the importance of connectivity projects to boost trade, the Indian side said the Chabahar post could be a fulcrum of connectivity to Central Asia. It also requested Uzbekistan to consider joining the international North-South Transport Corridor. On confronting the threat of terrorism, the two sides underlined the need for every country to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks against other countries. Both sides called for an early finalisation of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. The joint statement said the two sides called for comprehensive reform of the UN structures including the UN Security Council with expansion in both categories of membership. Uzbekistan reaffirmed its support to India's candidature for permanent membership of the UN Security Council and congratulated India on its election as a non-permanent member of the body for the term 2021-22.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-uzbekistan-ink-9-pacts-resolve-to-conclude-investment-treaty-soon-926195.html

The meeting was scheduled to be held on December 14 in Delhi. The development comes after the Union Home Ministry asked the state’s Chief Secretary and Director General of Police Virendra to come to Delhi to explain the law and order situation in the state. The Union Home Home Ministry’s decision came following West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s report to the Ministry over the attack on BJP President J P Nadda’s convoy at Diamond Harbor on Thursday. “While further reports are being obtained and complied, in the circumstances, I am directed to request you to kindly dispense with the presence of the state officials in the meeting, considering that the State Government is already addressing this issue with utmost seriousness,” stated Bandyopadhyay. The Chief Secretary wrote that “ elaborate arrangements” for security coverage of “certain Z category protectees” was made by the state government during their visit to the state on Thursday. He also stated that apart from providing a bulletproof vehicle and a pilot to Nadda in addition to the escort comprising of vehicles by state, CRPF personnel, and PSOs (CRPF) there was heavy police deployment by the State Government. “The DIG (Police) of the range was stationed in the area to personally supervise the police arrangements while 4 Additional Sps, 8 Deputy Sps, 14 Inspectors, 70 Sis/ASIs, 40 RAF personnel, 259 constables and 350 members of auxiliary forces were deployed on the route and at the venue at Diamond Harbor,” stated Bandyopadhyay. He also stated that despite the security arrangements made by the state administration and the “Central protectees” own Central protection arrangements, the tagging of many vehicles with the convoy made the “situation unwisely” as typically the security authorities were to handle “ a protectee convoy of a few vehicles only.” Earlier in the day, TMC MP Kalyan Bandopadyay alleged that the Centre had no legal authority to summon the Chief Secretary and DGP over law and order in Bengal as it was a state subject. “The Centre’s move to seeks a report from the State Government is unconstitutional. The Union Home Ministry’s decision to summon the Chief Secretary and DGP is totally unacceptable,” he said. Earlier West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioned the authenticity of the incident of attack on Nadda alleging that perhaps it was perhaps staged. She further alleged that BJP workers were attacking each other at armed rallies in a bid to malign the TMC Government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/combative-mamata-govt-decides-not-to-send-cs-dgp-to-delhi-despite-mha-summons-926196.html

Urging farmers to withdraw their protest after the Centre's promise to make seven amendments to the new agri laws keeping in view the objections raised by them, Chugh said the protesters should not get misled by the "false propaganda".             The Centre's seven undertakings including that the MSP and mandis would continue as it is, should dispel all doubts of the agitating farmers and they should repose their faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said in a statement here.             Several farmers are protesting at Delhi borders seeking repeal of the new laws enacted by the Centre recently.           Chugh said that the Modi government has all along been empowering farmers sincerely in a bid to double their income and make agriculture profitable.           Whether it is the decision to transfer money directly to the bank account of the farmers, MSP increases or pension scheme, our focus has been to empower farmers, he said.             Chugh said these reforms will boost investment in the agriculture sector, through better-assured prices, and contracts for farm services.             "In contract farming, the agreement is made between the farmer and buyer even before the crop is sown. Farmer already knows what MSP he can get for his crop. So, the farmer will negotiate a price above the MSP," he said.             Chugh rebutted the "misleading propaganda" that corporate houses would grab farmers' land. "No corporate house or private buyers can touch the land of a farmer", he said, adding that the laws provide adequate protection to farmers on that count.           The impact of these reforms will transform India's agriculture and food processing industries, he said.            Private sector investments will pour in across the entire cold chain, reducing losses and ensuring better prices for farmers, he said.            Bringing farmers together through farmer producer organisations will enable bargaining capacity and economies of scale for even small farmers, he said.           Chugh said under the new laws farmers have got the freedom to sell their products anywhere in the country. It is sure to ensure farmer welfare and revive the rural economy, he added. "These decisions have identified the farmer as a producer and his produce as a product. Now, farmers are being helped to grow into a big market force," he said.         He urged the agitating farmers to review their stand and withdraw their protest in the interest of the nation and for the sake for their own prosperity and empowerment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-falling-prey-to-misleading-mischievous-propaganda-bjp-926197.html

Food, Railway and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal was more direct in his charge, alleging that certain Leftist and Maoist elements seem to have taken "control" of the agitation and rather than discussing on farmer issues, they seem to be having some other agenda. Goyal along with Tomar is among the key government ministers involved in talking with protesting farmer unions.   Tomar said the government is sensitive towards farmers and is in discussion with them and their representatives to resolve their concerns. "A proposal to resolve the farmers' objection has also been sent to the farmers union and the government is ready for further discussion," Tomar tweeted. Tagging a media report about posters coming up at farmers' Tikri Border protest site demanding release of some activists arrested under various charges, he said, "Anti-social elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasant movement under the guise of farmers." "I appeal to the peasant brothers to be vigilant and not provide their platform to such anti-social elements," he added. In a tweet, Goyal said, "People of India are watching, seeing what is happening, observing how across the country Leftist-Maoists are not finding any support & therefore they are trying to hijack this farmers agitation & trying misuse this platform for their own agenda". Farmer leaders had on Thursday insisted that their ongoing protest against the Centre's new farm laws was "apolitical", after photos of protesters at the Tikri Border went viral in which they were seen holding posters demanding the release of writers, intellectuals and rationalists, arrested under various charges, on the occasion of the Human Rights Day. Addressing a press conference at the Singhu Border, another protest site, farmer leaders said that they had refused many political leaders to use their platform. When asked about supporters of a farmers union at the Tikri Border demanding the release of writers, intellectuals, and rationalists by displaying posters of people like Umar Khalid and Sudha Bharadwaj among others, who had been arrested under several charges, the leaders said they were not sure of what went on at the Tikri Border. They said the incident at the Tikri Border may be the farmers' way of observing Human Rights Day. Thousands of farmers have been staying put at Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) -- for nearly two weeks against the Centre's new farm laws. In September, former JNU students' leader Khalid was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his alleged role in the February northeast Delhi riots. Delhi Police had in November filed a supplementary charge sheet in a court here against Khalid and JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to the alleged larger conspiracy in the communal violence. The government had on Thursday asked farmer groups to reconsider its proposals for amending the Acts to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want, but protesters remained defiant and threatened to block railway tracks too in addition to highways. At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the central government and representatives of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws and repeatedly rejecting the Centre's offer to make some changes in law and give written assurances or clarifications on few issues such as MSP and mandi systems. When asked at a press conference on Thursday whether there was some other force behind the protest, Tomar did not give any direct reply and had said: "Media's eyes are sharp and we will leave to it to find out." "The press has to explore and use your investigation skills to find out," Goyal had said in reply to a similar question. "We believe that the farmers had certain issues. We respect farmers came and discussed with us. We tried to address the issues that came up during the course of the discussion. If there are other issues which are to be discussed or need clarification on the current proposal, we are ready for that. Whether there is any other reason holding them back, we will leave that to your wise counsel," Goyal added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-allow-anti-social-elements-to-use-your-platform-tomar-to-protesting-farmers-926200.html
11-12-2020||National||From the Newsroom: Bharatiya Kisan Union approaches SC challenging validity of farm laws||In your evening news brief, From the Newsroom, Bharatiya Kisan Union has approached the Supreme Court challenging the validity of recently enacted three farm laws; Prakash Javdekar says India is not responsible for the problem of climate change; New Year celebrations in all public places and high streets like MG Road and Brigade Road banned; Filmmaker-choreographer Remo D'Souza was admitted to a hospital here on Friday after he suffered a heart attack, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued the starkest warning yet that the UK could be out of the EU on January 1, 2021.  Here is the top news of December 11, 2020: India is not responsible for the problem of climate change and is presently contributing only 6.8 per cent of global emissions, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Friday. He said India is the only G20 nation to be in compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Addressing a press meet on the eve of 'Five years of Paris Agreement', the minister said India is "walking the talk" on climate change as it has already achieved 21 per cent of its target of reducing emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35% by 2030. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenue Minister R Ashoka and Health and Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar at a press conference here said that New Year celebrations in all public places and high streets like MG Road and Brigade Road are banned. Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar added that BBMP will be asked to withdraw passes that have already been issued. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bharatiya Kisan Union has approached the Supreme Court challenging the validity of recently enacted three farm laws, which has triggered massive farmers' protests at Delhi borders. Farmers’ union president Bhanu Pratap Singh filed an intervention application in the PIL filed by DMK MP Tiruchi Siva against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any adverse effects from Covid-19 vaccines are for national authorities to review, the World Health Organization said on Friday in response to questions about Britain warning people with a history of anaphylaxis to avoid the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. "But people should not be too anxious. Remember there are a number of vaccine candidates coming online at the same time," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Filmmaker-choreographer Remo D'Souza was admitted to a hospital here on Friday after he suffered a heart attack. According to sources close to the family, the 46-year-old director is in the Intensive Care Unit of the Kokilaben hospital. "He had a heart attack. There was a blockage. For now, doctors have done angiography and he is currently in the ICU," sources told PTI. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has issued the starkest warning yet that the UK could be out of the EU on January 1, 2021, without a trade agreement in place as the two sides remain divided on key areas amidst last-ditch talks between the chief brexit negotiators. After Johnson’s urgent talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels failed to break the logjam over the European Union (EU) fishing rights in UK territorial waters as a non-member and competition rules for businesses, the Prime Minister admitted that a Sunday deadline for their next discussion does not hold out great promise.   Source: DHNS / PTI/ Reuters ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is it today, From the Newsroom.

In an address at the Global Dialogue Security Forum, he underlined the need for India to put greater focus on having strong bilateral, trilateral and multilateral arrangements with like-minded countries to maximise its strategic leverage in the region. Gen Rawat's comments came in the midst of China's growing military muscle flexing in the Indian Ocean as well as the Indo Pacific that has triggered renewed global concerns and apprehensions. Referring to India's aspirations to become a major global power, he said the country will have to achieve while living in a "tough neighbourhood" and in an "increasingly contested" region. "At present, there are over 120 warships of extra-regional forces deployed in the Indian Ocean Region in support of various missions. Till now, the region, by and large, has remained peaceful albeit under contestation," Gen Rawat said referring to deployment of warships by countries outside the region. The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical for India's strategic interests. China has been making concerted efforts to increase its presence in the region. "Of late, along with geo-strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific, we are also witnessing a race for strategic places and bases in the Indian Ocean region, which is only going to gain momentum in times to come," the Chief of Defence Staff said. China has already set up a major military in Djibouti and developing the Gwadar port in Pakistan to have leverage in the maritime domain having strategic interests to India. "In recent years, China's economy and military rise coupled with competition to increase the influence in the region has attracted a great deal of interest," Gen Rawat said. He said India will have to focus on its ties with blocs like Japan-Australia-India and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to pursue its strategic interests. "Most of the countries in the region are seeking to reap the economic dividends through improved maritime connectivity and harnessing blue economy for which infrastructure development is a prerequisite," Gen Rawat said. "Residents' powers and extra-regional powers have shown a renewed interest in investing in infrastructure development in these countries in order to maintain and increase geopolitical influence," he said. The Chief of Defence Staff said the Indo-Pacific region in general and the Indian Ocean region in particular will remain vital for transit and world trade. "Based on the challenges that we face as a rising regional power, we require structured long-term planning for capability building and capability development of our defence forces," he said. "In our quest to build a stronger India, we need a peaceful and stable security environment. We need to maintain our strategic autonomy, cooperative relations with extra-regional powers underscored by strong regional linkages that would provide us with a greater degree of strategic leverage," Gen Rawat said. He also talked about the importance of technology for the defence forces. "In the military field, technology must be a means of deterrence not a source of destruction. Our approach to security hence needs to shift from unilateral to the multilateral mode which mandates increasing training engagements with partner nations in order to fortify the future," he said. Gen Rawat said the modernisation programme of the armed forces must be undertaken following a careful assessment of the security challenges. "Today, we are facing increasing security challenges, and to my mind, the best guarantor of peace and stability is to have dissuasive deterrence. For a nation like India, the security of land borders remained our primary concern," he said. "Therefore, there is a need to develop integrated structures to ensure modernisation programmes to be undertaken by our armed forces based on careful assessment of the nature of threats and challenges," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/race-for-strategic-bases-in-indian-ocean-region-to-intensify-over-120-warships-deployed-gen-bipin-rawat-926209.html

The novel mRNA vaccine candidate, HGCO19, is supported with seed grant under the Ind-CEPI mission of the Department of Biotechnology. The mRNA vaccines do not use the conventional model to produce immune response.  Instead, they carry the molecular instructions to make the protein in the body through a synthetic RNA of the virus.  The host body uses this to produce the viral protein that is recognised, thereby, making the body mount an immune response against the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/countrys-first-mrna-vaccine-candidate-by-gennova-gets-nod-for-conducting-human-trials-dbt-926210.html

The TMCP and the ABVP accused each other of using rods and hockey sticks during the clash at Gobardanga Hindu College. The injured, belonging to both the groups, were rushed to the local hospital by the respective student bodies, they said. An altercation began with TMCP members when ABVP supporters were going to submit a memorandum to the college authorities, over a recent incident, culminating in the clash, the college official said. The union room and common room of the college were also ransacked after the clash. The TMCP alleged that the ABVP was trying to "disrupt" the peaceful academic atmosphere of the college even during the pandemic when classes are not taking place. The ABVP countered the charge, saying the TMCP does not believe in democracy and were dissuading students from joining the right-wing students organisation of the RSS. Policemen from Habra and Gobardanga police stations are on the spot.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tmcp-abvp-clash-in-bengal-college-several-students-injured-926217.html

New Delhi dismissed Beijing’s bid to lay at its door the blame for the seven-month-long stand-off along the disputed boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh. Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said the stand-off was the result of China’s actions “to effect a unilateral change in status along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)” with India. He said China’s actions violated the bilateral agreements and protocol it signed with India for ensuring peace and tranquillity along the LAC. He reiterated New Delhi’s position that China had violated the 1993 and 1996 agreement it inked with India. The agreements required both sides to refrain from amassing a large number of troops in the border areas, to strictly abide by and respect the LAC and to avoid taking any unilateral action to alter it. He reiterated that China’s move to violate the agreements with India resulted in the stand-off. Srivastava referred to the comment made by his Chinese counterpart Hua Chunying on Thursday. Hua said China always strictly adhered to the agreements it signed with India, was committed to resolving the boundary dispute through negotiation and consultation and remained committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas. Srivastava tacitly countered the claim made by Hua and told journalists that India would expect China to match its words with actions. His comment on the state of relations between the two nations came just a day after China hinted that its negotiation with India for resolution of the stand-off would remain suspended, unless New Delhi acted on the “consensus” the two sides had reached during earlier rounds of parleys. Srivastava, however, said that India and China had continued to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels. “It is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” he said in New Delhi. The negotiation between India and China to pull back troops from the face-off points and resolve the stand-off along the LAC apparently hit an impasse once again. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had held the eighth round of talks on November 6. Though the talks had ended without any breakthrough, the two sides had agreed to have another round of meeting soon. But neither the military commanders, nor the diplomats of the two nations had any engagement in the past four weeks to end the stand-off. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar too on Wednesday alleged that China had violated its agreements with India and “literally brought tens of thousands of soldiers in full military preparation mode right to the LAC in Ladakh”. He said that Beijing had so far given New Delhi five differing explanations for its build-up along the LAC. "Naturally, the relationship would be profoundly disturbed by this,” Jaishankar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-asks-china-to-match-its-words-with-actions-says-violation-of-agreements-by-chinese-pla-resulted-in-lac-stand-off-926218.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday welcomed Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s proposal for a trilateral dialogue involving his Central Asian nation, Iran and India. New Delhi and Tashkent are now set to discuss the proposal with Tehran. It will also add momentum to India’s effort to promote connectivity with other Central Asian nations through the port on the southwestern coast of Iran. Mirziyoyev proposed the India-Iran-Uzbekistan trilateral initiative during a virtual summit with Modi on Friday. New Delhi and Tashkent signed nine pacts on the sideline of the summit, including one confirming $ 448 million of Line of Credit to be extended by India for four developmental projects in Uzbekistan in the fields of road construction, sewerage treatment and information technology. Uzbekistan conveyed its desire to explore the possibility of implementing priority developmental projects as part of the $ 1 billion Line of Credit offered by India for Central Asian countries. The Prime Minister pointed out that the Chabahar Port in the southeastern coast of Iran could be a “fulcrum of connectivity” between India and Uzbekistan as well as other Central Asian nations. India also requested Uzbekistan to join the International North-South Transport Corridor, which would add to the overall improvement of connectivity in the larger Eurasia, according to a joint statement issued by the two sides after the summit. India is participating in the development of the first phase of Shahid Beheshti Port in Chabahar in cooperation with Iran. The port opens up sea-land connectivity between India and Afghanistan as well as Central Asia and beyond, bypassing Pakistan. The India Ports Global Limited has taken over port operations at the Shaheed Beheshti Port in Chabahar in December 2018 and has been handling cargo since then. Afghanistan also started using the port facility to send its first export consignment to India early last year. Though the sanctions the United States re-imposed on Iran since 2018 significantly curbed economic cooperation between India and the West Asian nation, New Delhi secured a waiver for continuing its role in developing and operating the Chabahar Port as it convinced President Donald Trump’s administration that the sea-land connectivity was important for continued supplies to Afghanistan as well as to provide the conflict-ravaged nation economic alternatives, without requiring to rely on Pakistan. Pakistan has been blocking several connectivity initiatives in the region, particularly the ones envisaged for India’s trade and economic linkage with Afghanistan, the Central Asian nations – Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan – and beyond. With its combined annual trade volume with the five Central Asian nations still below $ 2 billion, India is keen to promote the Chabahar Port to overcome the problem of lack of overland connectivity with the region. The Prime Minister and Uzbek President on Friday discussed the situation in Afghanistan and noted that the establishment of peace and stability in the war-torn country was of great importance to the security and stability of the entire region. They called for the settlement of the Afghan conflict on the principle of Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process. India and Uzbekistan expressed their unanimity in their support for a united, sovereign and the democratic Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, according to the joint statement issued after the summit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-plan-to-use-chabahar-port-in-iran-for-connectivity-to-central-asia-gets-support-from-uzbekistan-926221.html

The government on Thursday asked farmer groups to consider its proposals for amending the Acts to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want. "They (government) should first tell us when and where they want to meet us as they did for previous formal talks. If they invite us for talks, we will discuss that with our coordination committee and then take a decision," Tikait told PTI. The BKU leader said there was no question of returning home until the government repeals the three laws. Asked whether the government has sent any invite for further discussion, he said the farmer unions have not received anything as such. "One thing is very clear that farmers will not accept anything less than scrapping of new agriculture laws," he said. Farmers leaders on Thursday announced they would block railway tracks across the country if their demands were not met by the government and would announce a date for that soon. However, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed hope there would be a resolution soon. "The government is keen and ready for further discussions with protesting farmers... To clear their apprehensions, we have sent our proposal to farmer unions. "I want to urge them to fix a date for discussion as early as possible. If they have any issue, the government is ready for discussion," he had said during a address to reporters along with Food, Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. The agriculture minister had also said it was not proper on the part of the farmer unions to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing, and urged them to return to the discussion table. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) condemned Tomar for his comments and claimed it was the government which remains adamant on not repealing the laws. In a statement, it remarked that the farmers' organisations were ready for talks and have responded for every previous discussion proposed by the government. Another farmer organisation --- the All India Kisan Sabha -- said, "AIKS rebuffs the allegation of Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar that the kisan organisations were wrong in intensifying struggle while discussion was going on." It stated that the farmers' struggle would be intensified in the coming days until their demands were met. At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting on various borders of the national capital for about two weeks, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws. The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was cancelled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/if-centre-wants-to-talks-to-farmers-it-should-convey-that-formally-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-926226.html

A government statement quoted him as saying that "high prevalence of drug abuse in the northeastern states abutting the Myanmar border is a major cause of concern for India". The discussion was held during the India-Myanmar bilateral meeting on drug control cooperation that was held on Thursday over a web link. The NCB, the country's federal anti-narcotics agency, the team was led by Asthana during the talks, while the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) of Myanmar was led by the commander of the drug enforcement division (DED)-cum-joint secretary of the CCDAC Police Brig-Gen Win Naing. "Apart from porosity of the India-Myanmar border, drug trafficking through the maritime route in the Bay of Bengal has emerged as a new challenge for both countries." "The NCB has remained committed to strengthening the existing mechanism of sharing information and assistance with Myanmar for combating the drug menace in the region," Asthana said during the meeting. He also highlighted other issues, particularly the trafficking of heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) in the country. The statement said Naing spoke on the "growing threat of the production of yaba tablets (methamphetamine) which has caused a grave concern in the region, even though the cooperation mechanism between Myanmar and India has been enhanced over the past years". The Myanmar official urged India to develop frequent information exchange on the trafficking of drugs and precursor smuggling activities at every level.  "Both countries agreed on the exchange of intelligence information in a timely manner to conduct follow-up investigations in drug seizure cases, new psychotropic substances and their precursors," it said. "They also agreed to conduct border level officers and field level officers meetings on a regular basis to strengthen the existing cooperation on drug law enforcement," the statement said.  It was also decided to exchange information on "illegal entry and exit points of illicit drug trafficking on the Myanmar-India borders" and information on the technology being used to interdict drug trafficking.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/narco-trafficking-through-bay-of-bengal-maritime-route-a-new-challenge-ncb-dg-926229.html

MM Naravane discussed bilateral defence cooperation and issues of mutual interest with the UAE's Commander of the Land Forces Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri, the Indian Army said on Friday on his historic visit to the key Gulf nation. Gen. Naravane visited the United Arab Emirates from December 9 to 10. The Army chief will then travel to Saudi Arabia for the second leg of his tour from December 13 to 14. This is the first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army to the two strategically important Gulf countries. According to the Indian Army, Gen. Naravane on Wednesday received a Guard of Honour at the headquarters of the UAE's Land Forces and laid a wreath at the Martyr's Point. “#COAS also interacted with Major General Saleh Mohammed Saleh Al Ameri, Commander #LandForces & Staff and discussed issues of mutual interest & defence cooperation,” the Indian Army’s Additional Directorate General of Public Information said in a tweet on Friday. It said that Gen. Naravane also visited the Land Forces Institute, Infantry School and Armour School on Thursday. The Army chief’s visit to the UAE aims to further strengthen bilateral defence cooperation, it added. His visit is seen as a reflection of India's growing strategic ties with the two countries and is expected to further open up new avenues for cooperation in the defence and security sphere. Gen. Naravane's visit comes in the midst of fast-paced developments in the Gulf region including normalisation of Israel's relations with several Arab countries as well as situation arising out of the assassination of Iran's top nuclear weapons scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Ahead of his visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Army said in a statement in New Delhi that "During the visit, he will be meeting his counterparts and senior military leadership of these countries. The visit is historic in the sense that it will be the first time an Indian Army chief is visiting the UAE and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Gen. Naravane's visit to the Gulf region comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's trips to Bahrain and the UAE during which he called on top leaders of the two countries. In the last few years, India's ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE have witnessed a major upswing. Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone. In October, Gen. Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-general-naravane-holds-talks-with-uaes-land-forces-commander-on-defence-cooperation-926233.html

The State BJP leadership said that Shah took serious note of the attack on BJP president J P Nadda by alleged Trinamool Congress (TMC) cadres and spoke to Nadda and national vice president Mukul Roy. State BJP general secretary Saytyantan Basu said that “although the Union Home Minister’s visit to Bengal was being planned for the last few days but the schedule was recently finalised.” Speaking to reporters earlier in the day Roy said that Shah had called him to inquire about the attack on Nadda. “ I told the Union Home Minister that a total lawlessness and anarchy was prevailing in the State.” He further alleged that the attack on Nadda’s convoy was “pre-planned” and the BJP president remained unscathed only because he was traveling in a bulletproof vehicle. State BJP sources said that during his upcoming visit Shah would raise the issues of law and order in the state in relation to the attack on Nadda. Nadda’s convoy was attacked by alleged Trinamool Congress (TMC) cadres in the Diamond Harbor area of South 24 Paraganas district on Thursday while he was on his way to a party rally. Several senior BJP leaders including Roy, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya were injured in the attack.

The country has so far exported over 20 million PPE and over 40 million N-95 masks, she said while speaking at the virtual launch of a study by the Institute for Competitiveness. The study chronicles India's success in going from being import-dependent for high-quality PPE kits to becoming self-sufficient. She said Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed the industry and government officials who were "adamant" on not diluting international technical standards despite "huge pressure" on the government. "The direction that we took was that if we are to dilute international standards, we expose health workers to tragedies," Irani said. She also said that in the state of lockdown, 5 lakh sustainable direct jobs have been ensured as part of the PPE and testing swab revolution. According to the study, in 60 days, India developed an indigenous network of PPE fabric and garment manufacturers and by July, it was able to export PPE kits to other countries. It said the government's 'Go Local' initiative turned the crisis of acute shortage into an opportunity to develop an indigenous supply chain for manufacturing Class-3 PPEs and testing swabs. The capacity building stage was dividing into five sets of activities, with each set assigned to a group of officers from the textiles ministry, according to the study. The Institute for Competitiveness is part of the Microeconomics of Competitiveness, an affiliate network of Harvard Business School. On January 30 this year, when the first coronavirus case was reported in India, PPE kits including full-body coveralls suits for Covid-19 (classified as Class-3 protection level under ISO 16603 Standard) were not manufactured in India. While countries began to limit their export of PPE kits, India was estimated to require more than 20 million PPE kits and 40 million N-95 class masks by July 2020. "Beating all odds, India developed an indigenous network of PPE fabric and garment manufacturers in just 60 days. By mid-May, India had the capacity to manufacture 4.5 lakhs pieces of body coveralls and 2.5 lakhs N-95 masks per day," it said. So, India also began exporting PPEs to the US, the UK, Senegal, Slovenia, and UAE, it added. The study said the scale of masks manufacturing has increased at such an exponential rate that by October, 60 million PPEs were produced, of which, 20 million were exported. Over 150 million N-95 masks were also produced, of which 40 million were exported. Currently, 200 domestic manufacturers produce 32 lakh N-95 masks per day, making India the largest exporter of masks to the world, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-produced-60-million-ppes-150-million-n-95-masks-till-october-from-zero-in-march-irani-926241.html

Responding to questions on Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan quoting an EU disinformation lab report to accuse India of subversive activities through fake media organisations and similar allegations by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said that as a responsible democracy, India does not practice disinformation campaigns. "In fact, if you are looking at disinformation, the best example is the country next door which is circulating fictional and fabricated dossiers and purveys a regular stream of fake news," he said at an online media briefing. Disinformation is practised particularly by those who have records to hide such as sheltering international wanted terrorists including Osama bin Laden, and seek unsuccessfully to cover up their own tracks such as on the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Srivastava said, hitting out at Pakistan. Asked about Pakistani media reports quoting unnamed sources to claim that India was planning false flag operations, the MEA spokesperson said the best example of a country practising disinformation is the country next door. "Our position in this matter and the facts on the ground are well known, I don't want to dignify such propaganda by responding to it," he said. To a question on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar announcing at the Geneva Donors Conference recently that India will be constructing the Shahtoot Dam, Srivstava said the minister had made the announcement that India and Afghanistan have reached an agreement on the dam. The agreement is expected to be signed shortly, he added. Asked when would the Nepalese foreign minister visit India, Srivastava said he is expected to be in India shortly for the next joint commission meeting, but the dates for it are yet to be worked out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-circulating-fabricated-dossiers-purveys-regular-stream-of-fake-news-india-926242.html

Responding to a media query on the statement by Kuwait Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmed Nasser Al-Sabah that there has been progress in resolution of intra-GCC crisis, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, "We have seen the statement from the Kuwait side that fruitful discussions have taken place towards resolving the rift in the region." "We have also seen statements from other countries in this regard. We welcome these announcements," he said. India shares close civilisational, economic, political and cultural ties with all the Gulf countries, Srivastava said. "We hope for harmonious relations between all the countries in the region," he said. According to media reports, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmed Nasser Al-Sabah had said last week that "fruitful discussions have taken place in recent days to resolve the Gulf crisis". "All parties involved in recent talks expressed their desire to find a final and lasting solution to the GCC crisis for the benefit of their people," the Kuwaiti foreign minister was quoted as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-welcomes-fruitful-discussions-among-the-gulf-countries-to-resolve-rift-in-region-926245.html

Vaccine hesitancy is a concern that remains in the minds of senior government officials entrusted with preparing India’s Covid-19 vaccination strategy. Such hesitancy or doubts occur in the minds of individuals with limited or inaccurate health information or who have concerns and questions about any given vaccine and its safety before accepting it. "Please have faith on what science decides and the regulator decides. When our regulator or science institutes decide on a vaccine, please have faith,” Vinod Paul, NITI Ayog member and a former professor at AIIMS, Delhi said at a press conference earlier this week. "Don’t succumb to contrary news and fake news. Come back to us, we will clarify with the right information for which we are accountable. Fight against the pandemic will be weakened if you believe in such (fake) news.” Writing in the journal Lancet on Thursday, an international team of researchers including Gagandeep Kang of Christian Medical College Vellore observed that weaknesses in the implementation of a wide-scale Covid-19 vaccination strategy would reduce the efficacy of the vaccine as reported in clinical trials. The researchers pointed out that a top–down one-size-fits-all approach was unlikely to resolve the hesitancy issues as seen in the past several times. “The public is not a homogeneous entity. It is complex, composed of individuals, families, and other groups shaped by contexts, experiences, and desires in a constellation of communities with different patterns of health literacy, values, and expectations.” The issue of vaccine hesitancy, according to Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, was inherent to any vaccination campaign irrespective of any adverse effect incident. “A detailed guideline is being prepared, which would be shared with the states,” he said. Meanwhile, India inches towards having one crore Covid-19 positive cases with the addition of more than 29,000 cases in the last 24 hours that took the tally to nearly 98 lakh. The death toll is 142,186 of which 414 was added in the last 24 hours. The number of active cases remains at 3.63 lakh, the lowest in 146 days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/have-a-plan-in-place-to-tackle-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-who-advises-india-926253.html
11-12-2020||National||Doctors in West Bengal stage protests against Centre's policy||Doctors of different hospitals across West Bengal Friday staged protests against the Centres move to allow postgraduate practitioners of Ayurveda to be trained in performing surgical procedures. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has demanded the withdrawal of the notification. Doctors in various hospitals in the city and in Murshidabad, Nadia, Malda, Uttar Dinajpur, North and South 24 Parganas districts wore black bands but carried on normal duties. Some of them protested by waving placards which had the message 'Protest Day against National Medical Commission' and 'We oppose commercialisation of Medical Science'. "No to a mixture of modern medicine homoeopathy and Ayurved,", Kaushik Bhattacharya of Doctors' Forum said. "We are against the commercialisation of medical education and the nominated members of the National Medical Commission. We want self-governance of our elected representatives," he added. "We did not want the treatment of the patients to be hampered and that is why we did not go for a total strike," Hiralal Konar of the Joint Platform of Doctors told PTI. IMA West Bengal secretary Santunu Sen, when contacted told PTI "The government of India started gradually centralizing the entire controlling power since long. They started dissolving the democratically elected bodies like the Medical Council of India and replacing them with handpicked people. Through the National Education Policy, they have planned to ruin the Medical Education System. The Centre, instead of promoting individual age-old ancient system of medicine is "simply promoting quackery and mixopathy". "Will they themselves go to an Ayurved surgeon for their own surgeries?" Sen asked. On November 19, the Centre in notification listed specific surgical procedures that a postgraduate medical student of Ayurveda must be practically trained to acquaint with, as well as to independently perform. It invited sharp criticism from the IMA who questioned the competence of Ayurveda practitioners to carry out these procedures. It gave a call for the withdrawal of non-essential and non-COVID services between 6 am and 6 pm on Friday to protest against the notification.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/doctors-in-west-bengal-stage-protests-against-centres-policy-926255.html
11-12-2020||National||India says no event to mark 70 years of its ties with China has been launched so far||With soldiers of the two nations engaged in a stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, New Delhi on Friday clarified that the proposed celebration of the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China had not yet been started. New Delhi dismissed Beijing’s allegation that the proposed release of a postal stamp commemorating the establishment of the diplomatic relations between the two nations had to be called off as India did not provide China with any feedback before the time of the launch mutually agreed by both sides. “This is factually incorrect,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said. He was reacting to a tweet by Ji Rong, the spokesperson of the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in New Delhi, blaming the lack of feedback from the Government of India for the cancellation of the release of the commemorative stamp by the State Post Bureau of the communist country. “It may also be noted that the launch of the 70th-anniversary celebrations itself has not taken place yet, and therefore, the issue of going ahead with joint activities under its ambit does not arise,” Srivastava told journalists in New Delhi. He said that the joint release of commemorative stamps to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and China was one of the activities agreed upon by New Delhi and Beijing last year. But, the MEA spokesperson added, the two sides had no discussion on any date for the release of the stamp. India and China established diplomatic relations on April 1, 1950. The two sides had planned to hold 70 events in 2020-21 to commemorate its 70th anniversary. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their second “informal summit” at a seaside resort near Chennai, they had discussed commemorating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. New Delhi and Beijing, however, had to postpone all such events in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Modi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang had written to each other exchanging greetings on April 1 this year. So did Xi and President Ram Nath Kovind. But no other event could be held, not only for the Covid-19 pandemic but also because the two nations got engaged in a military stand-off, which brought the relations to a new low over the past seven months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-says-no-event-to-mark-70-years-of-its-ties-with-china-has-been-launched-so-far-926260.html
11-12-2020||National||India pledges $2 billion to strengthen care for women, children, adolescents||India on Friday pledged a commitment of $2 billion at the World Health Organisation's 'Lives in the Balance' summit to provide essential services to women, newborns, young children and adolescents across the world. The summit organised by WHO's The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health (PMNCH), a global alliance of more than 1,000 organisations, registered a total commitment of $20.6 billion from a group of high income, low- and middle-income countries and charitable foundations across the world. "USD 6.6 billion (32 per cent) of the total pledge is from money committed by low and middle-income countries themselves, including Afghanistan, India, Kenya, Liberia, and Nigeria. An additional USD 14 billion (68 per cent) is from official development assistance and grants given by Germany, Canada, Sweden, UK, USA and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation," the PMNCH said in a statement. India's commitment of $2 billion will be used to strengthen all levels of care in response to the pandemic and to ensure essential public health functions during the year 20-21. "As important as this $20.6 billion is, it only will partially solve the problem of providing basic essential services for women, newborns, young children and adolescents," Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said. "Comprehensive efforts and collective advocacy are needed to ensure availability of substantially enhanced financial resources for this noble cause," he said. The recent WHO data from 105 countries shows that 90 per cent of countries have experienced disruptions to health services, with low- and middle-income countries reporting the greatest difficulties. According to early estimates of the indirect impact of Covid-19 on child and maternal mortality, more than 2 million additional deaths are estimated over 12 months (2020-2021) above the pre-pandemic level because of disruptions to essential health and nutrition services. "The health and well-being of women, children and adolescents are now at great risk, with inequities compounded by narrowing access to essential health services such as antenatal care, skilled assistance at childbirth, postnatal care, immunizations and family planning. Our concern is that resources - insufficient to begin with - are being diverted away to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic," Helen Clark, Chair of PMNCH and former prime minister of New Zealand, said. As of November 2020, 2.8 million children and adolescents have contracted Covid-19 in 87 countries, according to UNESCO. It said that in April, 1.5 billion students were affected by educational institutions closures in 195 countries this year, leading to loss of school meals and critical impacts on child nutrition. "These findings show how weak our health systems are at protecting women, newborns, children and adolescents, and how much basic primary health care matters in saving lives and protecting rights. This funding will ensure women, children and adolescents can access health services and priority social protections throughout the COVID-19 crisis and recovery periods," Clark said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pledges-2-billion-to-strengthen-care-for-women-children-adolescents-926265.html

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday cited the report by EU DisinfoLab on a 15-year-long disinformation campaign run purportedly to serve the interests of India. “The international community needs to take notice of a rogue Indian regime that now threatens the stability of the global system,” Khan posted on Twitter, seeking to take advantage of the EU DisinfoLab’s claim that the disinformation campaign run by a network of fake media outlets and dubious NGOs in Geneva and Brussels was aimed at discrediting Pakistan. “In fact, if you are looking at disinformation, the best example is the country next door which is circulating fictional and fabricated dossiers and purveys a regular stream of fake news,” Srivastava said in New Delhi on Friday, reacting to the remarks by Pakistan Prime Minister. “Disinformation is practised particularly by those who have records to hide such as sheltering international wanted terrorists including Osama-bin-Laden and seek unsuccessfully to cover up their own tracks such as on the 26/11 Mumbai attack,” said the MEA spokesperson. Khan’s Government in Islamabad last month handed over to António Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, a “dossier” accusing India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan. New Delhi reacted by reminding that Abbottabad in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan was the place where elusive Al Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden had been killed by the United States commandos on May 2, 2012. The killing of the much-wanted terrorist leader at a house near Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad had brought to light that he had been hiding in the country since long and it had been possibly known to the top brass of the military and intelligence agencies of the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-hits-back-after-pakistan-seeks-to-take-advantage-of-eu-disinfolabs-report-926284.html

The assertion came two days after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western powers of pursuing an "aggressive and devious" policy to engage New Delhi in "anti-China games" by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies. Reacting to Lavrov's comments, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India stands for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and that its relations with Russia stand on their own merits. "As unequivocally outlined by the Prime Minister during his speech at the Shrangi-La dialogue in June 2018, India does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a strategy or as a club of limited members or as a grouping that seeks to dominate. It is not directed against any country. It stands for a free, open and inclusive region," Srivastava said. His response came at a media briefing when asked about Lavrov's remarks. Speaking at a meeting of the state-run think-tank Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday, Lavrov accused the US-led West of attempting to "undermine" Russia's close partnership and privileged relations with India. Lavrov said: "India is currently an object of the Western countries' persistent, aggressive and devious policy as they are trying to engage it in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called 'Quad'." The Quad or Quadrilateral coalition comprises India, the US, Japan and Australia, and its primary focus has been to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. "India has always pursued an independent foreign policy based on its national interest. India's relationship with each country is independent of its relations with third countries. We hope that this is well understood and appreciated by all our partners," Srivastava said. The MEA spokesperson also referred to India's long-standing relations with Russia, which he said is characterised by a 'Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership'. "This year marks the 20th anniversary of our strategic partnership with Russia. Our relations with Russia stand on their own merits including in the sphere of military technical cooperation," Srivastava said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-pursue-an-independent-foreign-policy-india-on-russian-foreign-ministers-comments-926289.html

The Prime Minister’s appeal came on a day the agitating farmers intensified their protests and are gearing up for blocking the Delhi-Jaipur highway and stage sit-in protests at district commissioner’s offices and residences of BJP leaders across the country. “There will be no programme to block railway tracks,” Balbir Singh Rajewal, President of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), told reporters here. “My two cabinet colleagues Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal have spoken in detail about the new farm laws and the demand of farmers. Do hear them out,” Modi said sharing a video link of the press conference by the two ministers on Thursday, virtually ruling out any fresh amendments than those offered by the government. Launching a massive counter-offensive, top BJP leaders will fan out across the country to address press conferences, while the party will organise kisan sammelans and small meetings in every district over the next week to highlight the benefits of the new farm laws. “We will be organising hundreds of kisan sammelans and kisan chaupals across every district from December 11 to 16,” Rajkumar Chahar, head of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha told DH. The BJP also launched an online campaign to highlight various initiatives taken by the Modi government – PM-KISAN, crop insurance, farmers pension, fertiliser subsidies – for the welfare of farmers. BJP leaders will also distribute pamphlets and booklets highlighting the benefit of the farm reforms during the chaupals which are planned at wholesale markets to ensure that the message reaches the farmers. Agriculture Minister Tomar also cautioned agitating farmers not to allow their agitation against farm laws to be hijacked by anti-social elements who are keen to vitiate the atmosphere in the country. The minister’s word of caution came amid reports that a section of farmers are demanding the release of Delhi riots accused as part of their protests.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-plans-massive-outreach-as-farmers-set-to-intensify-protests-926007.html

PUBG was among 118 Chinese mobile applications banned by the government in September this year. The government had said these apps "are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, the security of the state and public order". PUBG, which was earlier distributed in India by China's Tencent Games, has sought permission from the government to relaunch in the country. In a meeting called to discuss the proposal, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) chairperson Priyank Kanoongo "strongly recommended" against the relaunch of the mobile app in India until appropriate legislations are in place for such online games, the officials said. When asked about it, Kanoongo said an internal meeting was held to discuss the matter. "It was an internal meeting and prima facie, the NCPCR is not in favour of recommending such games in the country," Kanoongo told PTI. During the meeting, it was also pointed out that the game led to loss of many lives in the country, a senior official said. No response had been received from PUBG to queries sent by PTI on the matter till the time of filing this report.

However, emergency medical services will remain unaffected as they have been exempted from the purview of the agitation. The IMA has called for the withdrawal of all non-essential and non-Covid-19 services between 6 am and 6 pm on Friday across the country against the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) decision to allow Ayurvedic doctors to conduct certain surgical procedures after the completion of their 3- year PG course, said IMA office-bearers here. The IMA is the apex body of allopathy doctors in the country. "However, emergency services, including casualty, labour rooms, emergency surgeries, ICU and critical care service will continue. "Over 30,000 of our member-doctors from Gujarat, including 9,000 from Ahmedabad, have joined the protest today," said Dr Kamlesh Saini, secretary, IMA (Gujarat branch). "We demand withdrawal of the CCIM Act notification and the NITI Aayog committee for integration (of all medicine systems). "We urge the government to take into account the grievances of doctors against this mixopathy. The IMA will continue its agitation till our demands are met," said Saini. Mona Desai, a senior doctor from the city, said the government must not play with the health of people by allowing Ayurvedic doctors to do surgeries after a three-year course as principles of Ayurveda and modern medicines are different. "The CCIM order says that post-graduate Ayurvedic students will be given some training about modern medicine during their 3-year course after which they can perform 58 different types of surgeries. "Modern medicine doctors spend 8 to 10 years learning the same. So if that can be achieved in just three years, why are we spending so many years learning them?" asked Desai, immediate past president of the Ahmedabad Medical Association.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/over-30000-doctors-in-gujarat-join-ima-call-for-protest-926120.html
11-12-2020||National Politics||Modi employed autocratic style of functioning, Sonia unable to handle Congress affairs: Pranab's autobiography||Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed a “rather autocratic style of functioning”, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was “pre-occupied” with saving the UPA that took a toll on governance while Sonia Gandhi was “unable” to handle the affairs as Congress “lost” political focus ahead of Lok Sabha polls, former President Pranab Mukherjee has written. The assessments of Mukherjee, who passed away on August 31, come in the fourth volume of his autobiography – 'The Presidential Years: 2012-2017' – that he finished days before his passing away. It will hit the stands next month. In the book that focuses on his time in Rashtrapati Bhavan, Mukherjee stated that the moral authority to govern is vested with the Prime Minister and the overall state of the nation is reflective of the functioning of the Prime Minister and his administration. "While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature, and the judiciary," Mukherjee writes.  Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014 while Mukherjee, who was Finance Minister under Singh,  was elected as President in July 2012. "Only time will tell if there is a better understanding of such matters in the second term of this government", Mukherjee was quoted by the publisher Rupa Publisher as writing in the book. Mukherjee also analysed the Congress’ dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 when its tally was reduced to a dismal 44 and he appears to believe that his elevation as President and leaving active politics had an impact on the party’s functioning. "Some members of the Congress have theorised that, had I become the Prime Minister in 2004, the party might have averted the 2014 Lok Sabha drubbing. Though I don’t subscribe to this view, I do believe that the party’s leadership lost political focus after my elevation as President," according to Mukherjee. "While Sonia Gandhi was unable to handle the affairs of the party, Dr Singh’s prolonged absence from the House put an end to any personal contact with other MPs," Mukherjee writes. Mukherjee's comments are coming out in the public domain at a time a section of the Congress leaders are up in arms on the leadership question, amid indications that Sonia may not continue as party chief for long. The autobiography also reveals the inner workings of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and reveals for the first time a "minor" diplomatic issue that arose during the visit of the then United States President Barack Obama in 2015. The US Secret Service insisted that their President travel in a specially armoured vehicle that had been brought along from the US, and not in the car designated for use by the Indian head of state. "They wanted me to travel in the same armoured car along with Obama. I politely but firmly refused to do so and requested the Ministry of External Affairs to inform the US authorities that when the US president travels with the Indian president in India, he would have to trust our security arrangements. It cannot be the other way around," Mukherjee writes.  Sources said that the book will also have Mukherjee's views on the controversial imposition of President's Rule in Arunachal Pradesh, demonetisation and surgical strikes, and his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first volume of his autobiography -- 'The Dramatic Years: The Indira Gandhi Years' -- focussed on his relationship with the former Prime President, the Emergency years, and Congress losing power. 'The Turbulent Years: 1980-1996' -- the second volume -- recorded the events, including the return of Congress to power, Indira's assassination, his falling out with Rajiv Gandhi, return to Congress after forming his own party, and the Narasimha Rao years. In the third volume -- 'The Coalition Years: 1996-2012', Mukherjee dealt with the United Front days, the ousting of Sitaram Kesri as Congress president, Sonia Gandhi's leadership and UPA years till 2012 July when he was chosen as the President.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-employed-autocratic-style-of-functioning-sonia-unable-to-handle-congress-affairs-pranabs-autobiography-926142.html

A mother came to me and said how her 14-year-old daughter was misled and taken away. Our police found her in Noorganj near the Nepal border. "There are many such cases where women and girls have been subjected to coercion, allurement, deception and fraud. I have set up a team to investigate how many of our daughters have been taken away like this and pushed to a life of hell,” he added. Earlier this month, Chouhan announced that the Madhya Pradesh government will make legal arrangements to curb the alleged practice of 'Love Jihad' in the state. Madhya Pradesh was the third BJP-ruled state to announce its intention to make legal provisions against forced conversions for marriage, which has been termed as 'Love Jihad' by right-wing activists. Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh govt passed an ordinance to make forced conversions for marriage illegal.

11-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi AQI 'poor'; likely to improve 'significantly' over next two days||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Friday, and is likely to improve “significantly” over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed and light rain. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 271 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 284 on Thursday. The neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 330), Greater Noida (322) and Noida (310) recorded air quality in the “very poor” category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to improve “significantly” on Saturday and Sunday owning to better ventilation conditions and rainfall. The India Meteorological Department said the national capital and its neighbouring cities are likely to receive light rainfall on Friday and Saturday under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance passing over the Himalayas. The maximum wind speed is predicted to be 15 kmph, favourable for dispersion of pollutants, it said. “After the Western Disturbance withdraws, icy cold northwesterly winds blowing from snow-laden Himalayas will bring temperatures down in the plains,” the IMD said. The minimum temperature is expected to drop to 8 degrees Celsius by Monday, according to an IMD forecast. The city recorded a minimum of 10.9 degrees Celsius on Friday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 29 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-aqi-poor-likely-to-improve-significantly-over-next-two-days-926033.html
11-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protest: Several roads remain closed in Delhi; avoid these routes||With thousands of farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri laws staying put at Delhi borders, several routes in the national capital remained off bounds for commuters on Friday. The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform people about road closures and advised them to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience. Farmers from different states have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) border points for nearly two weeks now to demand a repeal of the farm laws enacted in September. In a series of tweets, the Delhi Traffic Police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are closed for traffic movement, while Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrians. Those travelling to neighbouring Haryana can take routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said. On Thursday, farmer unions threatened to block railway tracks across the country and all highways leading to Delhi if their demands are not met. The announcement came a day after farmers' leaders rejected the government's offer to amend the new agri laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system. Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of MSP and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-several-roads-remain-closed-in-delhi-avoid-these-routes-926053.html

Both the DCP-rank officers are in isolation, he said. Hundreds of police personnel have been deployed at the Singhu border point to prevent the protesters, demanding a rollback of the new farm laws, from entering the national capital. "Two senior police officers deployed at Singhu border tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago. Both of them are currently in isolation," a senior police officer said. Thousands of farmers agitating against the centre''s new agri laws have been camping at multiple border points for two weeks. On Thursday, they threatened to intensify their agitation with a plan to block railway tracks if their demands are not met soon. The announcement came on a day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table. The farmers claim the new agri laws are aimed at benefitting corporates by weakening the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime for procurement of farm produce.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/2-delhi-cops-overseeing-security-at-singhu-border-test-positive-for-covid-19-926072.html

Sources said Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has approved a fresh budget for the J&K police under the police modernisation program (PMP) to procure 100 UAVs/drones, which will be the biggest procurement by the force so far.  “While the police had already procured some UAVs and drones out of its own budget in the past few years, the fresh consignment of around 100 UAVs will be added in the months ahead,” they said. As per the police specifications, the UAVs will be of category 3, which is considered the latest and equipped with all sorts of technology required by the police in Kashmir keeping in view the terrain and mountainous region. With the procurement of the new drones, the J&K Police will be better equipped to handle not only anti-militancy operations but also anti-India protests. After the August 5, decision (scrapping of Article 370), it was observed that drones acted as a major deterrent for protests to take place. A senior police officer said that UAVs will help the force to trace militant locations and also help in the aerial sanitisation of an area where there is a VIP movement. “At the moment drones are only available with the force in sensitive districts that include south Kashmir and Srinagar. The plan is to provide at least two drones to each police station in a phased manner,” he said, adding the procurement of 100 drones is just a beginning and in the months ahead, each police station will be covered. In 2019, J&K Police had floated tenders to procure 50 drones but due to technical glitches, the process couldn’t be completed. So far, the Army had been using UAVs in Kashmir to track the movement of infiltrators along the Line of Control (LoC) and forest areas. There have also been reports of the Army using small UAVs during encounters with militants in hinterland.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-police-to-acquire-100-more-drones-for-aerial-surveillance-926078.html

The convict -- Ehtesham Qutubuddin Siddique -- who has been sentenced to death in the case has also sought the Andhra Pradesh government's dossier on the probe into the alleged involvement of the Indian Mujahideen (IM) group in the blasts. On July 11, 2006, seven RDX explosions ripped through as many Western line local trains in Mumbai, leading to the death of 189 people and injuring 829. Siddique has claimed that he was falsely implicated in the blasts case and therefore, it amounts to violation of his human rights. During the hearing on Friday, his counsel argued before Justice Navin Chawla that there is a high court order of 2019 which states that certain information can be provided under the Right to Information Act if violation of human rights was involved. The court, thereafter, asked advocate Arpit Bhargava, appearing for the convict, to file the 2019 order and listed the matter for hearing on January 13, 2021. Central government counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate C K Bhatt, appearing for the Ministry of Home Affairs, opposed the plea and said the information sought cannot be provided. They also contended that several similar requests have been made by the convict under RTI in the past.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/2006-mumbai-train-blast-convict-moves-delhi-hc-for-reports-on-probe-926106.html

An illicit liquor smuggler allegedly dug a 40-foot deep well at his residence at Chausangi village in Uttar Pradesh to store large quantities of country liquor. According to sources, cops, during a routine check in the vicinity on Thursday, nabbed two youths, Tinku and Dharmendra, and recovered seven boxes of illicit alcohol. During questioning, Tinku revealed that he had stored dozens of boxes of country-made liquor in a dry well near his residence at Chausangi village. In his revelation to the cops Tinku said that he told fellow residents he was installing a septic tank. ''No one doubted his intention...the local villagers thought that it was a septic tank,'' an official said. Tinku stored the illicitly procured liquor inside the well and used a rope to bring out the pouches whenever required. This clandestine business illegal business was booming especially when licensed liquor shops were closed due to an occassion Police were trying to ascertain if there were more such wells in the area.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/police-raid-uncovers-a-well-of-liquor-in-up-village-926127.html
11-12-2020||North and Central||Bihar farmers to face DBT heat for stubble burning||The farmers in Bihar, who have shown utter 'disregard' to the government's directive not to burn crop residue, are now likely to face the DBT heat. At least 900 such farmers have been identified in the state who will be denied the benefit of government subsidies and incentives through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) for stubble burning in their farm land. Though no FIR will be registered against such erring farmers who continue to burn crop residue, the move to deny them DBT benefit is seen as a deterrent that would eventually dissuade them from stubble burning. The state, with a population of around 12 crore, has 1.6 crore farmers registered with the Agriculture Department who get DBT benefits in the form of subsidies and incentives for farm equipment. Out of 900 farmers identified to be penalised, 462 are from Rohtas, 133 from Kaimur and 100 from Nalanda. Rohtas and Kaimur are also known as the 'rice bowl of Bihar' and are the major paddy growing districts. Government sources said that the identified farmers won’t get DBT benefits for three years. “The move to deny DBT benefit to erring farmers is to dissuade others from burning crop residue. The action has been initiated after getting feedback from kisan mitras (agriculture coordinators) who monitor farmland and reports about stubble burning,” said State’s Agriculture Secretary, N Saravana Kumar. The government, meanwhile, has launched an awareness drive among the farmers informing them that stubble burning not only causes air pollution but it damages micro nutrients in the soil. Bihar is arguably the first state which is penalising its farmers for stubble burning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bihar-farmers-to-face-dbt-heat-for-stubble-burning-926147.html

The recent survey involving a sample of 4,678 people was conducted among randomly selected districts and population of the state, Health Secretary Hussan Lal said in a statement. Nearly 96 per cent of the people were found asymptomatic. According to the statement, 24.19 percent of Punjab's population has been infected by coronavirus, as per the second serosurvey conducted in 12 districts of the state. In the urban areas, seroprevalence was found among 30.5 per cent of the population, while in rural areas, the percentage was 21 per cent. In Ludhiana, the seroprevalence was found in 54.6 per cent of those surveyed with 71.7 per cent in urban pockets alone. The survey was also conducted in districts like Ferozepur, Jalandhar and SAS Nagar (Mohali). “Female positivity was found to be higher in both urban and rural areas in the survey,” the statement said. Each district was assigned the task of completing a sample size of 400, with 200 samples each from rural and urban areas, it said. A serosurvey involves testing the blood serum of a group of individuals for the presence of antibodies against the infection to know who has been infected in the past and has now recovered. Last month, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh gave the go-ahead for the second serosurvey to be conducted across a larger sampling area to assess the spread of coronavirus in the state. At a virtual Covid-19 review meeting last month, the chief minister had agreed with health experts on the need to find the extent of spread of SARS CoV-2 outside the containment zones, in contrast with the first serosurvey that was conducted in August in five containment zones across five districts. The first survey conducted in one containment zone each in Patiala, SAS Nagar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar had found 27.8 per cent seroprevalence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/2419-seroprevalence-found-in-punjabs-12-districts-finds-serosurvey-926177.html

Addressing a series of public meetings as part of the District Development Council (DDC) election campaign here, Singh said the district got the rare distinction in the country as it has received two national river and water rejuvenation projects, namely the Devika river project and the Mansar lake project. Singh, Union Minister for the PMO, said in addition, a centrally funded state-of-the-art health and wellness centre is coming up at Mantalai at the site which had been "dumped" by the then Congress government after the demise of Dhirendra Brahmachari over three decades ago. The minister said Udhampur-Kathua-Doda is possibly the only Lok Sabha constituency in the entire country which has received three centrally funded medical colleges in four years, one of which is for Udhampur. In addition, the first two highway villages of the country are also coming up in Udhampur and Kathua respectively, he said. Not only this, he said, a passport office has been opened at Udhampur, a centrally funded multipurpose indoor sports stadium has been started here and a radio station also set up which assumes significance because the demand for it was for the first time raised by the people of Udhampur way back in 1965, when the Indo-Pak war broke out and Radio Pakistan signal needed to be countered for its false propaganda. Similarly, the minister said, Devika bridge, inaugurated this year and constructed by the BRO, has overcome the bottleneck at the military hospital crossing on the main highway. The irony, however, is that those who are claiming that nothing has happened are at the same time not reluctant or ashamed of taking all the benefit of development as well as the welfare schemes, he said. Singh said the high speed development started in this region will continue in future as well and it will gain momentum as well as greater relevance with the constituting of District Development Councils and setting up of three-tier grassroot democracy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/unprecedented-development-in-jk-mos-jitendra-singh-926227.html
11-12-2020||North and Central||UP: Cops act on 'love jihad' complaint, stop wedding of Muslim couple||Police in neighbouring Kushinagar stopped a wedding function and took the couple to the police station for interrogation after a complaint that it was an interfaith marriage involving a minor girl. The man and the woman turned out to be both Muslims and adults. The man told a newspaper later that he was thrashed with a leather belt at the station, an allegation denied by the police. Kushinagar Superintendent of Police Vinod Kumar Singh said someone from Gurnia village had informed them on Tuesday that a couple was getting “quietly” married there, and suspected it to be a case of “love jihad.” The term is used by right-wing activists to refer to marriages allegedly performed for the sake of religious conversion. A police team reached the spot and found a 'maulvi' and the couple there and brought them to police station for interrogation, the SP said. He said police later established that both were adults and belonged to the same faith. The two eloped 13 days ago from Azamgarh and the woman’s family had lodged a missing person’s report at the police station, he said. “No policeman beat the man or harassed the couple,” the SP said. He said after counselling by police on video call, the parents of both the man and the woman attended the wedding at Kasia in Kushinagar on Wednesday. Arman Khan, a local social worker, also rejected the allegation that police beat up the groom.“I was with them at the police station and no policeman had beaten them,” he said. He said some right-wing people had told police that it was a case of “love jihad”. "However, when police found that both were adults and also of the same faith, they talked to the woman's family on video call,” he said. The social worker claimed that the ‘maulvi’ too was not ready to perform the marriage and was seeking the presence of a lawyer of the woman’s family members. Khan said the groom has a shop at Gola bazar in Kasia and had sought his help to marry the woman, whom he had met on a train to Narkatiaganj in Bihar a year ago. According to him, the two started talking on the phone and later decided to get married, but the woman’s family did not initially agree to it. The recently promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance punishes forcible or fraudulent conversions, and requires a two-month notice if some wants to convert. The controversial law also nullifies marriages performed for the sake of conversion. The UP Police have acted swiftly in recent days after being tipped off about interfaith marriages. Last week, a ceremony in Lucknow was stopped with police asking the couple to meet with the the legal provisions first.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-cops-act-on-love-jihad-complaint-stop-wedding-of-muslim-couple-926238.html
11-12-2020||North and Central||Punjab CM orders extension of night curfew till January 1||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday ordered an extension of the night curfew in all cities and towns in the state till January 1, an official statement issued here said. Earlier, the decision to impose the night curfew (from 10 pm to 5 am) from December 1-15 was taken amid apprehension of a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. Taking cognizance of complaints of various violations of the Covid-related curbs at weddings and parties, Singh directed Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta to strictly enforce the restrictions at wedding venues and other places and slap penalties on the hosts in case of violations. He ordered a restriction of 100 people on indoor and 250 people on outdoor gatherings at marriage functions and parties in the state till January 1, the statement said. Earlier, the restriction was 200 for indoor gatherings and while there was no upper limit for the number of people at outdoor gatherings, directions were issued to ensure social distancing at such events. Singh stressed the need to step up testing in the containment and micro-containment zones and ensure 100-per cent sampling. He also asked the health department to monitor the health of the farmers returning from the protest sites near Delhi in view of the risk to them due to the high caseload there. Chairing a high-level Covid review meeting here, the chief minister said those above the age of 70 with comorbidities cannot be kept in home quarantine if adequate medical facilities are not available at home. Health Secretary Hussan Lal pointed out during the virtual meeting that a large number of Covid deaths were being reported from home-isolation cases. To further check the Covid-related fatality, Singh ordered a thorough check of all the private hospitals in the state to ensure that only those with adequate "Level 3" infrastructure (to deal with critically-ill Covid patients) and manpower be allowed to admit coronavirus patients. Hospitals lacking such facilities should refer the patients to other hospitals, he said. At the meeting, Singh also took stock of the state's readiness regarding the Covid-19 vaccine that will be rolled out in future. The statement said as Punjab gears up for the mega exercise, the chief minister directed the health department to incorporate the results of the recent second sero-survey in the state's strategy when the vaccine is rolled out so that the high-risk population is covered first. He noted the state's readiness for the vaccine rollout in terms of a database of priority lists, the infrastructure for cold-chain management, identification and training of vaccinators etc. On the Covid situation in the state, Singh said though the declining positivity trend over the past three weeks is welcome, the fatality rate remains a matter of concern and directed the DGP to ensure strict compliance to the coronavirus-related safety protocols, including wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. The health secretary informed the meeting that around 35 lakh samples have been tested for the disease so far in the state, of which 1.5 lakh were found to be positive. "Though the second wave in Punjab has so far been mild, the health authorities are fully geared to tackle any eventuality," he said. Lal noted that 87 per cent of the Covid victims in the state were over the age of 45, with about 50 per cent of the deaths taking place at private tertiary care centres. As of Thursday, Punjab had recorded a Covid death toll of 5,007 while the infection count in the state was 1,58,556. On the Covid vaccine issue, Singh said apart from vaccine safety and vaccination site safety, correct and timely information communication is critical to a successful rollout of the vaccine, which is expected to be available soon in India. Besides a state-level vaccine store, 22 district-level and 127 block-level stores are being prepared for the vaccine rollout in Punjab, which will also have 570 cold-chain points, he added. Besides a walk-in freezer at Ferozepur, the Union government has decided to provide one more at Chandigarh, the chief minister said. The state has 1,165 "ice-lined refrigerators" and 1,079 deep freezers, according to the statement. In line with the Centre's guidelines, the data of about 1.25 lakh healthcare workers (government and private) has been compiled by the state government for the first phase of vaccination, it said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-cm-orders-extension-of-night-curfew-till-january-1-926243.html

The three mayors have claimed that Rs 13,000 crore in total was due to the north, south, and east corporations from the Delhi government. The AAP, however, said, "Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCD know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests". On Thursday, North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi Mayor Anamika and East Delhi Mayor Nirmal Jain held a joint press conference at the sit-in site and said the protest "will continue democratically, so that we can pay salaries to corporation employees on time". On Friday, they held another joint press conference and said, "All the three mayors will run their offices from the dharna site outside Chief Minister's residence from Monday". Prakash said that till the chief minister of Delhi "does not release the dues of Rs 13,000 crore to all the three corporations, we will continue to sit on the dharna outside his residence". In its statement, the AAP retorted the mayors were well aware that the Delhi government has "given all the funds due" and alleged it was because of their "corruption and inefficiency that the municipal corporations are facing financial ruin". "Since they have decided to only protest rather then govern, it is best that they resign and let the AAP run the municipal corporations. We will run the MCD efficiently and within the same budget," it said. Earlier in October, the three mayors had staged a sit-in outside the CM residence on Flagstaff Road in Civil Lines, with the same demand. "On behalf of CM Arvind Kejriwal, his minister Satyendar Jain had assured us to release the dues in 10 days, but till date the outstanding money has not been given. We ended our dharna by believing Minister Satyendar Jain, but the Kejriwal government betrayed us," the North Delhi Mayor alleged. "This time we will not end the dharna until the corporation gets the money for its its rightful fund," he said.  Meanwhile, the wedding anniversary of a senior civic leader was marked at the protest site with a poster.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-run-our-offices-from-outside-delhi-cms-residence-from-december-14-mayors-926254.html

Nine newborns, all of them between one and four days old, died at the J K Lon Hospital on Thursday, within a span of hours, a year after the same facility had hit national headlines over the deaths of an unusual number of infants. On Friday, three more newborns -- two born just a day ago and another a month old -- died at the hospital, said its Superintendent Suresh Chand Dulara. Kota–Bundi MP and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla called a meeting of district and medical officials at his office in Kota on Friday. He asked the officials about the reason behind the deaths and directed the authorities to improve the condition of the hospital so that no infant dies due to lack of facilities and timely medical treatment. Expressing grief over the deaths, Birla stressed on proper monitoring in the hospital. "I have spoken to the hospital management and got a report on the matter. Whatever facts come out, I would discuss it with the state government," the MP told the media after the meeting. Hospital Superintendent Dulara said a newly constructed 12-bed NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) level-3 ward, which was ready to go functional, was made operational on Friday with 10 nursing staff. Kota District Collector Ujjawal Rathore, who also attended the meeting, said some pieces of equipment at the hospital were certainly reported to be lying unused, but their number is "not considerable". Such equipment would soon be replaced as there is no lack of budget, Rathore told media persons after the meeting. Asked about it, Dulara said the equipment are "not dysfunctional but beyond economic repair since 2018". The Rajasthan government on Friday constituted a four-member committee to investigate deaths of the newborns at the hospital, officials said. According to state health minister Raghu Sharma, the committee, which includes Medical Education Commissioner Shivangi Swarnkar and other officials, will visit the J K Lon Hospital and investigate every case of infant death at the health facility. In December 2019, over 100 infants died at the hospital, triggering a furore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/three-more-newborns-die-at-rajasthans-kota-hospital-toll-12-in-2-days-926261.html
11-12-2020||Opinion||Donald Trump tries to kill coronavirus relief||By Paul Krugman The next few months will be terrible. Several thousand Americans are now dying from Covid-19 every day; given the lag between cases and deaths, the daily toll will almost certainly rise through the end of this year, and if people are careless over Christmas it could surge even higher in the new year. Economic recovery has stalled, with employment still down almost 10 million from pre-pandemic levels. The most we can hope for at this point are policies that mitigate the suffering, getting us through the horror while we wait for widespread vaccination. And a few days ago it seemed possible that we would in fact get some good news on the economic front. A bipartisan group of senators seemed close to agreement on a Covid relief bill that would fall far short of what we should be doing, but would be much better than nothing. Then the lame-duck Trump administration intervened — destructively. Before I get to what’s wrong with the administration’s proposal and why it may do a great deal of harm, let’s talk about what the goal of economic policy ought to be right now. I still keep seeing news reports that frame congressional arguments about relief bills as a debate about “stimulus.” But stimulus is what you do when unemployment is high because people aren’t spending enough. And that’s not the problem we face. Think about it. Why are there still 2 million fewer workers in “food services and drinking places” than there were before the coronavirus struck? It’s not because people can’t afford to eat out or go to bars. It’s because eating out and gathering in bars are dangerous activities. In many parts of the country these activities are, rightly, either banned or sharply restricted; even where they’re allowed, many people, understanding the risks, choose to stay home. The role of economic policy in this situation isn’t to bring those jobs back while the pandemic is still raging — we actually don’t want a resurgence of employment in high-risk sectors until vaccines are widely available. What we should be doing, instead, is minimising the suffering while we wait. That is, the issue isn’t stimulus, it’s disaster relief. What should this relief involve? It should provide support for the unavoidably unemployed, sustain businesses through the dark months ahead and aid state and local governments that are suffering severe declines in revenues and that will otherwise be forced to make drastic cuts in essential services. And no, this last problem isn’t restricted to blue states. In fact, six of the seven states expected to face the biggest revenue declines have Republican governors. House Democrats have always been willing to pass a relief bill along the lines I’ve described. And as I said, until a few days ago the Senate appeared to be moving toward a bill that, while much smaller than Democrats wanted, would be better than nothing. The main obstacle seemed to be the determination of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to include a poison pill — a blanket exemption of businesses from any liabilities related to exposing their workers to Covid-19 risks. But observers were hopeful that an agreement could still be reached. Then came the Trump administration intervention — a proposal from Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, that McConnell quickly endorsed even though it was disastrously wrongheaded. I’m not sure whether the coverage of this discussion has fully explained just how bad Mnuchin’s proposal is. Many headlines emphasized the cost, a bit over $900 billion, which was similar to that of the emerging bipartisan bill, suggesting that the administration was weighing in with something positive. In fact, however, the administration proposal completely eliminated the most important piece of any relief deal — expanded benefits for the unemployed — replacing it with one-time $600 checks that would be sent to everyone. Again, think about it. For Americans who won’t be able to return to work while the pandemic is still raging, a one-time payment of $600 is grossly inadequate, while for those who haven’t lost their jobs it’s unnecessary. It’s true that people might spend some of the grant, boosting overall demand — but overall lack of demand isn’t the main problem right now. So what is Mnuchin thinking? We can’t rule out sheer ignorance. It is, sad to say, entirely possible that, nine months into the pandemic slump, administration officials still don’t understand the basic logic of relief. Or they may be in thrall to the thoroughly debunked myth that unemployment benefits actually cause high unemployment. Or maybe this proposal reflects the expiring administration’s special combination of delusion and cynicism. President Donald Trump is still trying, in ever more desperate and destructive ways, to overturn the results of the election. And in his madness he may imagine that he will gain more politically from sending everyone another check with his name on it than from helping those truly in need. Whatever the motivation, Mnuchin’s proposal couldn’t have come at a worse time. It may well undermine the economic relief millions of Americans need.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/donald-trump-tries-to-kill-coronavirus-relief-925981.html
11-12-2020||Opinion||Did we really miss international cricket in 2020?||2020 has been an unusual year. International cricket has suffered too. Frankly, this is a minor matter in the overall scheme of things, but where would we be without our little indulgences? Despite a crammed December calendar featuring eight teams, the year will see less than 25 Tests and around 50 one-day internationals (ODIs). This is roughly half the annual average action of about 45 Tests and 135 ODIs since 2000. Comparable levels of action were last witnessed in the eighties, a time when Brian Lara and Shane Warne hadn’t even debuted and Virat Kohli and Steve Smith were still in diapers. If the near-100 T20s of 2020 are considered full day exertions, it would be nineties level of business. The larger point remains unchanged. 2020 has been a slow year in international cricket. India, among the busiest sides alongside Australia and England in recent decades, have had it no different. 1995 was the last time they played fewer international games (excluding T20s). Now, one would imagine Indians – said to be the game’s most passionate followers, breathing cricket and so on – to be experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms on account of the dry-up. That hardly seems the case. Grumbles have been mild and occasional, often lumped with general and progressively perfunctory-sounding longings for the pre-Covid normal. How has a supposedly cricket-mad country managed without its accustomed doses of the game? For one, amidst the anxieties the pandemic has spawned, other matters – far more pressing ones such as life and livelihood – have come to occupy people’s mindspace. Crises are known to put things in perspective, trigger introspections and prioritisations. So, even sworn cricket fans have had the opportunity to locate the game in life’s larger schema. And they have quite likely discovered that cricket’s grip on their selves is not as strong as nostalgia, television, and water cooler conversations have led them to believe; that sporting interests can be properly nourished only in times of relative certaint and that what has for long been assumed an essential pre-occupation has merely been an engrossing frill. The game may return and sweep them – us – once again like an old vice, but we now know that some of its potency is imagined. A second factor that has helped Indian fans cope is the Indian Premier League (IPL). In short episodes played out back-to-back over a seven week period, the domestic T20 tournament’s 13th edition, like previous ones, served everything audiences look for in the game: drama, suspense, intense competition, heroic performances, spectacular failures. This exciting offering, its glitzy packaging, and the breathless pace with which it is delivered, has provided fans not just the cricket fix they needed but also the sated, hung-over feel necessary to endure the drought in prospect. Reports that administrators are plotting a bigger IPL window to take advantage of what they think could be a longer than anticipated slowdown in international cricketing activity are not surprising. What about the ‘international’ in international cricket? Did Indian cricket fans not miss the energy and edginess of a country versus country face-off? Not as much as one would think. The quality of IPL cricket is some notches below international, but the tournament musters enough foreign names to have an international flavor. It is more than adequate for the modern Indian cricket fan. Because most modern Indian cricket fans are more fans of Indian cricket than Indian fans of cricket. Their primary interest is not the sport itself but their national team and the men in it.  Nothing wrong with that, except that it closes them to the delights unfolding in neutral contests, from the bats and arms of stars from lands foreign. This is different from, say, the tennis or football fan in India whose love for the sport is determined by the rhythms of the sport and the performers who illuminate the playing arena, whose joy from sport is not contingent on the national side’s or a compatriot’s achievements (though there could still be pride in it). Indian cricket fans of a certain vintage – even some modern ones for that matter - will know the feeling, the thrill derived from reading the exploits of David Gower and Abdul Qadir, from videos of Kumar Sangakkara in full pomp or Allan Donald in full tilt. It is pure love for sport, needing no coat to enhance its appeal. As for the rest, the IPL works nicely, and could well become part of the new normal. Quite likely it already is.

11-12-2020||Opinion||Pakistan on the brink again||This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of the disaffected and the angry will converge on Lahore, Pakistan’s political nerve centre, where the government of Imran Khan will face another tirade from the rising star in the political firmament, Maryam Nawaz of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and the powerhouse of the Jamiat ul Islami, Maulana Fazlur Rahman. But unlike the five rallies that preceded Lahore – in Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar and Multan – which saw Opposition anger rise to a crescendo but little else, Lahore could be the game-changer, the tipping point for its drive against Pakistan’s ‘deep state’ and its star protégé, Imran Khan. And it’s not just because the wrecking ball with the names of 11 Opposition parties written on it has been gathering popular momentum as it heads straight for Islamabad and Parliament square. This time, Imran Khan faces the embarrassment of a no-confidence motion that will play itself out not in the National Assembly (NA), as he said it should, but out on the streets, where the Opposition will live up to its threat and resign from the House, en masse. Adding to that will be a long march to the capital in January. Unless, that is, Imran Khan gives in, and steps down. So far, the prime minister has dug his heels in, scoffing at the Opposition threat to quit the NA by saying that he would simply call for bypolls to the seats vacated, and win them. But there is a singular difference between the rallies that preceded Lahore, and Sunday’s jalsa – the Opposition isn’t stopping with demanding just Imran Khan’s head. The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the 11-party alliance formed in September, wants more heads to roll. In the PDM’s crosshairs are no less than the Chief of the Army Services Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and the ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the two men they believe have brought Pakistan to such a pass by meddling in politics and propping up an inept prime minister. Gen Bajwa, incidentally, was given an extension as Army chief by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, just as the latter did with Gen Pervez Musharraf, under the mistaken belief that Bajwa, being from a minority community, would pose no threat. Musharraf, a Mohajir, was not supposed to, either. Sharif was proven wrong both times! Imran’s response As a frantic establishment works the phones behind the scenes to reach out to leaders of the PDM, pleading with them not to escalate matters further, in public, pro-establishment figures are resorting to the usual dirty tricks, throwing mud at Opposition leaders, hoping some of it will stick. The most damaging is Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari, a close aide to Imran Khan, claiming that the Opposition is being funded from abroad. The government also sought to use the cover of Covid-19 to shut down the rallies, but it couldn’t stop the earlier ones. In Multan, for instance, the PDM drew far bigger crowds than anyone had anticipated. Former Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, a Multan native, brought in the huge crowds, despite the best efforts of Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to scupper the rally.     Imran has now decided to let Lahore happen. But at what cost? His reputation as a much-loved iconoclast, political outsider and anti-corruption crusader is at stake. Despite his tirade against politicians, who he claims have only come out on the streets to pressure the government into lifting the corruption cases against them, the numbers at the anti-government rallies have grown. But in attacking Opposition leaders, instead of opening up channels of communication to bring down the temperature, his ability to guide Pakistan out of these troubled waters is in question. More so, as the Opposition seems to be in no mood to back down, and have privately told interlocutors that Imran Khan’s vendetta politics that targets politicians and journalists, indeed anyone who questions him, must be brought to an end. In a sign of his growing intolerance to criticism, he withdrew, abruptly and without explanation, from social media last week after TV anchor Hamid Mir roasted him on his talk show. Imran’s refusal to lift the corruption cases has also fed into the Opposition's narrative that the establishment is targeting them selectively, victimising leaders like Zardari and Nawaz, forced to retreat to safe havens in Dubai and London, respectively. The Opposition’s challenges Political commentators in Pakistan who lean towards the all-powerful Army have been quick to highlight the many schisms within the 11-party alliance. Others are talking up the differences within Sharif’s PML-N itself. The perceived rift between Nawaz and his brother Shahbaz, in fact, stems from the latter’s soft side. He argues for compromise and meeting the Army half-way, even though he has been at the receiving end of Army ire and, alongside his son Hamza, faces multiple jail sentences. The rise to prominence of Nawaz’s daughter Maryam Nawaz as the face of the Opposition during the PDM rallies, eclipsing Shahbaz’s sons, has not helped matters. Maryam’s feisty persona and her refusal to be intimidated by the scare tactics of Imran’s government are backed by Nawaz, who is set to speak at Lahore, and Fazlur Rahman, who wants Imran Khan gone at any cost. The resignations from the National Assembly will impact neither her, nor Nawaz or Fazlur, none of whom are members, but it will affect Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the PPP, both members of the National Assembly. The government’s votaries therefore do have a point. Neither the PPP nor the Awami National Party (ANP) are amenable to sacrifice their hold over the respective provinces that they dominate, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, at the altar of the PDM’s plans to bring down the Imran Khan government. The divisions within the PDM may give the cricketer-turned-politician some comfort, say insiders, as the schism within the Muslim League itself is a worrying development, as is the perceived softer stance of the PPP and the ANP and their ambivalence over the planned mass resignations from the national and provincial assemblies, which, if it comes to pass, will put the government on the mat. Will the Army self-correct? But it’s cold comfort. Nawaz Sharif is already in receipt of 14 resignations from his own parliamentarians. In Balochistan, three legislators have offered resignations. The PPP is also coming round to the view that the strategy of quitting the National Assembly to force Imran Khan to resign is a viable option that could let the party retain its hold on Sindh while the Muslim League returns to power at the centre. The parallels with the past are uncanny, presaging the future. A judges’ street protest against the sacking of a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by Gen Musharraf led to him stepping down as President in 2008, and his subsequent retreat to Dubai. It had the blessings of then Army chief Gen Ashfaq Kayani. This time, too, insiders say that the Opposition is working on the stratagem that the Army will correct itself. The Army’s second-rung generals are deeply troubled by the developments that have pushed Pakistan to the brink, just as the US has come looking to Pakistan to be the stabilising force in the Af-Pak region. But will the Army go far enough and replace Bajwa or Faiz Hameed or both, as well as Imran Khan, is the question.    (Neena Gopal is a senior journalist who has worked in the Middle East and reported from various hotspots.

11-12-2020||Panorama||India, Pakistan, China must stop thinking of weaponising water||Why should the Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat be stoking an old controversy by saying that the Indian government was planning to stop water supplies to Pakistan from the three eastern rivers allocated to India under the Indus Water Treaty? The ostensible reason for wanting to stop these waters is Pakistan’s refusal to end state-sponsored terrorism. But a statement such as this serves no purpose except to exacerbate an already difficult relationship, given that India is not in a position to fully utilise the waters of the three eastern rivers, namely the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej.  The question of using the waters of the western rivers, namely the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, allocated to Pakistan, is fraught with even more difficulties. Following the 2016 terrorist attack on the army camp in Uri in J&K, Prime Minister Modi had declared that “blood and water cannot flow together.” This was a clear warning that India would not hesitate to block Pakistan’s share of the river waters, a threat repeated by the then Minister of Water Resources Nitin Gadkari who, after the Pulwama attack, had tweeted that India would not hesitate to plug the flow of water into Pakistan. Riverine experts caution that this is not a tap that can be switched on and off at will. If India did decide to stop the flow of water from its eastern rivers, it would mean inundating large tracts of its own farm and forest lands. Uttam Sinha, a Research Fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses and author of “Riverine Neighbourhood and Hydro-politics in South Asia” points out that we already have 3.6 million acre feet (MAF) excess water flowing into Pakistan only because we lack the storage capacity to utilise that water. The Indus Water Treaty also allows India to use the waters of the Chenab and Jhelum for non-consumptive purposes such as hydro-electricity generation, after which the water flows back to the river. The question of using the Indus waters does not arise because the Indus turns upward from Ladakh through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, where the Chinese are building two huge dams for Pakistan -- the Bhasha and Bunji -- at a cost of nearly $30 billion. When India lacks the capacity to use the eastern river waters, where is the question of us utilising the western river waters, too? Experts therefore believe that the key step is to be able to optimise the treaty rather than thinking in terms of abrogating it. Of course, following the Uri attack, India asked its Ministry of Water Resources to prepare a Detailed Project Report on how we could best utilise the waters of the Chenab and Ravi for run-of-the-river projects. The Baglihar Dam, built on the Chenab, started much before the Uri attack. It has been completed but its utilisation has not been without hiccups. Another dam started on the Jhelum river was the Kishanganga Dam. Pakistan, determined to create impediments, even took the issue of its construction to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in India’s favour. Work on this dam was completed in 2018. For the present, the swift-flowing Chenab remains the focus of India’s attention. Two DPRs were prepared for the Sawalkot and Bursa dams to be built on the Chenab. But the local population in J&K are strongly opposed to their construction. They believe that these projects are being pushed through without proper environmental assessment and cumulative studies of their impact on the ground. Already the regional environmental departments in J&K have given a negative report on these dams, having raised issues of ecology, seismic concerns and environmental flows were these dams to be operationalised. The government has therefore changed tack and shifted its focus on the early completion of the Kiru hydroelectric power project being built in Kishtwar tehsil of Doha district at a cost of nearly $800 million. Another dam lined up for early completion is the Pakul Dul Dam. India has listed 33-36 projects to be developed on these rivers. That is all very well, but the government needs to take note of the fact that China is the new elephant in the room. With Pakistan and China operating in concert, any step India takes to impose curbs on the flow of water into Pakistan could see the Chinese doing the same to us. Apart from building two massive dams on the Indus river in Gilgit-Baltistan, China is also building 55 reservoirs on the Tibetan plateau from where both the Indus and the Jhelum originate. They are also building 28 dams on the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. This is bound to affect the water-sharing balance in North East India and Bangladesh. Some experts like Sinha argue that the Indus Waters Treaty has become an albatross around our neck and should be done away with, or at least updated. New designs in dam construction need to be incorporated. There is also a need to ensure better river flows. There are other experts, such as Prof Vikram Soni of the JNU, a physicist who works on water issues, who maintains that the Indus Water Treaty is one of the few treaties that have worked between India and Pakistan in the last 70 years, and should not be tampered with. Neither India nor Pakistan and China should be thinking in terms of weaponising water, which is now a swiftly diminishing commodity for all of humanity, but especially in South Asia. Both India and Pakistan are water-scarce countries whose irrigation and drinking needs are met by these rivers. The need of the hour is to opt for better utilisation of our river waters. Also, in the long run, smooth sharing of river waters should help India build bridges of friendship in this hostile neighbourhood.

11-12-2020||Panorama||Delirium is slow to fade||The rising elderly population could lead the requirement of hospitalisation to increase in cases of delirium. This condition occurs due to an underlying physical health problem. Delirium involves one or few of the following signs: Sudden onset or change in behaviour or loss of memory function, fluctuating in severity including occasional periods of normalcy, clouding of consciousness that may start close to the sun-set, which is why typically it is known as sun-downing and also worsened behaviour throughout the night with impaired sleep and either restlessness or under-activity. Quite often, a sudden behavioural change accompanied by forgetfulness is the initial symptom. Many times, hospitalisation is required unless there an experienced home nursing care or access to specialists. For family members, a common worry is whether it is Dementia or a psychiatric disorder, but it is neither.  There are a number of underlying physical conditions that can trigger delirium. Some of the common ones include infections in the urinary tract or in the lungs and either high or low levels of glucose or sodium in the blood. Constipation, pain, deafness and multiple medications also contribute to delirium. It can also be caused due to life-threatening problems like clots, leading to blockage or bleeding or infection in the brain that warrants urgent treatment under a Neurologist. Unfortunately, ICU stay can itself occasionally contribute to abnormal experiences and staff members call this as ICU psychosis. It does take time to detect the underlying cause. Even after the problem is detected and fixed, delirium takes its own course, and resolves slowly, so family members and other caregivers need to be patient.   Repeated episodes or prolonged course of delirium may be an early warning sign of dementia that needs assessment at a later stage. It is possible to reach their previous level of memory functioning after delirium resolves itself in most cases. The patients in hospital wards benefit from a side room, with optimal noise and light, minimal staff movement, by repeatedly being informed that they are in a confused state, being reminded of the date, day, and assisted in the identification of people around them.  Some patients may become aggressive due to fear. Changes in the level of consciousness can create confusion for the patient, they may try to escape from the place, remove intra-venous lines leading to injuries or even push staff members away. Physical restraints are in practice to ensure patient safety in some hospitals as medications do not have much evidence on their effectiveness. Sedation may not be appropriate and other common medications which are known to have anti-cholinergic properties are avoided wherever possible.  Delirium is a condition that requires regular reviews from specialists including physicians, neurologists, liaison psychiatrists and others depending on the underlying cause. Delirium, during the first week after a surgical procedure that involved general anaesthesia, is very common in elderly persons. Appropriate measures, preparedness, environmental modifications, repeated reassurances will help manage the condition better. Delirium is thought to occur because of various immunological mechanisms that assist during the recovery of the underlying condition. Some chemicals are released to which the elderly brain is sensitive, unlike the adult brain. The cause of this condition is still being researched. Once the underlying cause is treated and the severity of delirium comes down, it is possible to manage with home nursing care.  A sudden change in behaviour was the only complaint in a few patients with Covid-19 recently. Similarly in certain patients, urinary tract infections are detected without associated complaints such as fever, or problem in passing urine and even change in blood counts which is why urine tests are necessary. Delay in treating the underlying cause could be life-threatening. With a rising elderly population, there is a definite need for more geriatric experts.  (The writer is a consultant psychiatrist with geriatric psychiatry experience)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/delirium-is-slow-to-fade-925921.html
11-12-2020||Panorama||This too shall pass||“This too shall pass”, these magic words teaches us the power of impermanence. The basic idea of these words is to remind us that, whatever situation we are currently going through in life, is temporary and will change. Legend has it, that these words were engraved on a monarch’s ring, by his wise men to remind him that joy, sorrow, exultation of victory or desolation of defeat are temporary. Nothing is permanent in this world. Everything changes except the law of change. We have experienced many elated moments and sorrows, support and setbacks, victories and defeats. They all have passed away over a period of time, maybe short or long, but have eventually passed away, leaving us to face the oncoming task with more vigour and resolution.   Therefore, let us rest assured that, these days of trial and trouble, hardship, pain and grief caused by the pandemic throughout the world, will not last forever. “This, too, shall pass away”. At the same time, let us try to live in the present and welcome each day, experience it, understand it and face it with courage and intelligence to ultimately enjoy it, because as Alice Morse Earle says “Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.”  Gautama Buddha emphasises the significance of living in the present by saying “The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly”. God has bestowed the greatest gift of analyzing and adaptation to us human beings to cope with any uncertainties and calamities. The present, if well spent, will be the happy memories of tomorrow and a foundation stone for what is in store for us in the future. Because, in today lies all the “truth and reality of our existence” as said by the great court poet Kalidasa in the 5th century “Look to this day, For it is life, the very life of life, For yesterday, is but a dream, And tomorrow is only a vision; But today well lived makes yesterday a dream of happiness, And every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore, to this day! Such is the salutation to the dawn”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/this-too-shall-pass-925923.html
11-12-2020||Right in the Middle||The inimitable five||University professors are made of varied dispositions. As college students, we had this uncanny talent to promptly identify each professor’s traits and idiosyncrasies and also quickly give them suitable sobriquets. Here I will describe five distinctive types of professors that we were blessed to learn from.    The first and most popular type was the Pompous Professor(PP). We could easily sight him from a distance. Indifferent to the vagaries of the Indian climate, eternally attired in elegant western formals we could never escape his indomitable presence. Every class of his would invariably begin with elaborate descriptions of his exploits abroad and end on the same tenor.  The second category was the Garrulous Professor (GP). Many of us understood the full meaning of the idiom ‘gift of the gab’ only after attending his classes. His ability to wax eloquence on any topic under the sun and his adept skills at relating to current affairs were unparalleled. The most potent pedagogical weapon in his armoury was the day’s newspaper always tucked under his arm. Until all its contents were shared we would not be spared.   The third in line was the ‘Omniscient Professor’ (OP). A walking library brimming with ideas and knowledge waiting to part with them at the slightest opportunity. No question was silly to him. At the end of the profound discourse we would all be tongue-tied and spellbound.  The ‘Humanitarian Professor’ (HP), the fourth type in the list was simple, kind, gentle, naïve and usually unmindful of the noise or our pranks. Very often he would turn to address the quiet ceiling and the mute trees seen through the window, obviously a ploy to shut himself to the happenings inside the classroom.  The icing on the cake, however, was the ‘Emirates Professor’ (EP). His penchant for travel and obsession for the Emirates airlines were well known. His handbag would perpetually sport the bright red tag of the airliner. One day we were misinformed that he was on leave and a delightful scream ‘Emirates professor is on leave’ was beginning to reverberate when the professor actually entered. He threw a stern glance at us and after a minute broke the silence, “Well, thank you for that title. I’m not sure if the university would confer the title of Emeritus professor on me. But you have given me one already, not exactly the same, but comes close to that. After all, the difference is only a couple of vowels.” He was smiling and all of us burst into laughter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/the-inimitable-five-925919.html
11-12-2020||Second Edit||Tree felling: Officials’ callous attitude||While Bengaluru has lost most of its green cover over the years, civic agencies like Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) continue to adopt a callous attitude towards protecting trees, even in the face of several strictures from the courts. The latest controversy is over the BBMP notification for felling of 106 trees for the Namma Metro project without adopting a transparent procedure. Activists have described the notification as a sham and an eyewash, because of the discrepancies between what exists on paper and the actual ground realities. As it is, the capital city finds itself in a precarious position with an Indian Institute of Science (IISc) study revealing that Bengaluru has lost 89% of its tree cover in the past four decades. The study also predicted that the green cover will reduce to a mere 2.96% by 2020-end. The number of trees per person has gone down drastically to one tree per seven people, while the ratio should have been 1:1. Ironically, according to an RTI reply, no additional saplings were planted in the city during 2017-18 and 2018-19. What is appalling is the manner in which these agencies are ignoring court orders with impunity. Though the Karnataka High Court had pulled up BBMP last year for issuing a defective notification for removing trees for the Metro project and had issued certain directions, they are followed more in the breach. Even an order of the high court to conduct a tree census in Bengaluru is yet to be implemented. The BDA’s attitude towards environmental issues is even worse. The agency had incurred the wrath of the Supreme Court by first claiming that about 500 trees would be felled for the peripheral road project around Bengaluru, and then revising it to nearly 34,000. While giving BDA a piece of its mind, the court had then noted that it could not “gloss over the patent contradiction” in disclosing the existence of forest land. More recently, the apex court had denied permission to the Uttar Pradesh government to cut about 3,000 trees for road widening without first evaluating their oxygen-producing capacity. But Bengaluru’s civic agencies are impervious to such orders. As the authorities often resort to removing trees in a piece-meal fashion as an when the need arises, without making a holistic assessment, the total environmental impact of a project like the Metro remains unknown. Bureaucrats appear to be emboldened due to court’s liberal attitude towards them and it might be a good idea to send a few thick-skinned officers to jail for their deliberate act of contempt.  Only such stern action can save Bengaluru from going barren.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/tree-felling-officials-callous-attitude-925942.html

The incident took place at Irikkur, near Mattanur, on the suburbs of Kannur district on Thursday afternoon. Forty-six-year-old Ubaima was washing clothes in the backyard of her house when the land caved in and she fell into it. People who heard her screaming rushed to the spot and saw a tunnel formation on the ground. On subsequent search, following Ubaima's screaming sound, she was spotted in a well situated in the neighbouring plot, which was around 10 metres away from the spot the tunnel was found and which was around 35 feet deep. Fire and Rescue Service Personnel reached the spot and rescued her. She suffered only minor injuries but was under severe shock. Hence she was hospitalised. Senior fire and rescue officer G Manoj Kumar told DH that it was indeed a narrow escape for the woman as she did not get trapped in the tunnel but fell directly into the well.  The tunnel was in a 60-degree-slanting position and had a length of around 35 feet. If she was trapped in the tunnel, it would have been very risky rescue operation. The well is around 40 feet deep and the tunnel's opening was at around 35 feet.  Prima facie, it seemed like soil pipping. Local people said that a cave formation in the well was spotted earlier also. The earth there could have become loose owing to frequent wetness. Geology experts would be visiting the spot to evaluate the exact cause.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/woman-slips-into-a-35-ft-deep-tunnel-as-earth-caves-in-926123.html

The Kerala State Commission for Child Welfare has taken serious note of the incident that took place in January and has now recommended to the government authorities issue directives to all schools to avoid any sort of punishments that may affect the morale of students. The commission also directed the police to initiate legal action if any criminal offence was involved. The nine-year-old boy studying at St. Patrick's School at Mananthavady was made to stand on the dais during the school assembly on January 31 and scolded by school principal. He was also made to stand backwards and his hair was displayed to the students and insulted. Afterwards, he was suspended from school for three days. The child's mother said in her petition to the commission that the child who was good at his studies was mentally upset over the incident and even refused to eat. The school principal stated before the commission that the student was made to stand on the dais in order to make teachers understand the indiscipline committed by the student as most teachers  were not familiar with such hairstyles. The District Child Protection Officer and District Police Chief said in their reports that the allegations raised by the parent were true. After considering the matter, the commission member K Nazeer and Babitha B said in the order published on Thursday that the incident amounted to serious violation child rights. School authorities can take actions to ensure discipline in the school. But such actions should be only in accordance with the extent of violation by the student. Actions like scolding and insulting children in front of other children amounted to serious violation of child rights. The commission recommended to the Kerala education department, Central Board of Secondary Education and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations to issue directives to all schools in this regard. The commission did not order any action against the school authorities as the child's mother said in her statement to police that she initiated the complaint out of the emotions on seeing the child mentally upset and did not want to pursue any action against the school authorities. However the commission directed the police to take detailed statement of the child and parents and if any criminal offence was involved, a case shall be registered. Proceedings in the case was delayed owing to Covid-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-class-3-student-reprimanded-punished-for-mushroom-hair-cut-rights-panel-condemns-926187.html

In its order in September 2018, granting compensation to ISRO former scientist Nambi Narayanan in the case, the Supreme Court had constituted the D K Jain committee to find appropriate actions against three police officials who took key roles in initiating the case in 1994. All the officers have already retired from service. Then DIG (Crimes) Siby Mathews, who headed the special team that probed the case, former DySP K K Joshua, who was a member in the team, and former special branch inspector S Vijayan, who initiated the cases against the Maldivian women in 1994, are the three officers facing the axe. The committee has informed Narayanan that it would be holding sitting in Thiruvananthapuram on December 14 and 15. One of the three police officers told DH that even as the committee's mandate was to find out ways and means to take appropriate steps against the 'erring officials', it was an opportunity for the ex-police officers to present their stands once again. The ISRO espionage case began with the Kerala police registering cases under the Foreigners Act and Official Secret Act against two Maldivian women and two scientists of VSSC alleging of espionage in 1994. Apart from Narayanan, another ISRO scientist was also arraigned. Then Chief Minister K Karunakaran was also in a tight spot as his close confident IPS officer Raman Srivastava was also alleged to have links with the case. But the CBI which later took over the probe dismissed the charges as fabricated and recommending action against the police officers. Subsequently. Narayanan initiated a legal battle seeking action against the police officials and seeking compensation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/keralas-over-25-year-old-isro-espionage-case-continues-to-haunt-police-officers-926234.html

Temple authorities, however, cautioned that such devotees coming for the darshan of Lord Venkateshwara would be at their own risk, as no special queue line arrangements have been made for them. "They have to duly keep in view the Covid-19 norms prescribed by the central government," TTD says. The decision comes at a time when the government officials and health experts are warning the public, institutions on the possibility of a Covid-19 second wave in the country. Even after the temple reopened in June following the unlock guidelines, people of above few categories were, till now, barred from the temple visit, considering their higher vulnerability to the present pandemic. Temple officials say that their decision was compelled by the public demand. “Since June, we have been receiving a huge number of emails, and other forms of appeals from devotees to allow them to fulfil long-pending vows like tonsuring and rituals like ear piercing, annaprasana of infants and also celebrate shashtipurti etc anniversary events at the abode of Lord Venkateswara,” officials said. “As such requests are based on their deep sentiments, traditions and practices followed by the devotees, we have decided to resume the Srivari darshan for above category of devotees henceforth but within the framework of Covid-19 guidelines and all health safeguards prescribed by the authorities,” TTD said in a statement on Friday. “(But) these devotees have avail darshan in the general queue lines as no special arrangements are made,” officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/visit-at-your-own-risk-ttd-allows-senior-citizens-pregnant-women-for-tirumala-darshan-926248.html

Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) investigators believe organochlorine, organophosphorus found in the serum samples to be the origin. The Hyderabad based NIN's researchers have also found mercury in the samples of rice they collected from the affected area households. “We have also found organophosphorus in the blood samples. It has to be determined how these elements entered the human body,” the NIN experts told chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy during his virtual mode review with officials and experts on Friday, on the still elusive cause. Simultaneously, investigators from the IICT, another Hyderabad based central institute, revealed that they found organochlorines and lead in the blood samples of the patients. The NIN, which formed a nine-member committee to solve the riddle, also said that pesticide residues were found on tomato samples. “Our tests on the food samples are going on,” they said. In the last few days, various research, medical organisations postulated different possible reasons for the illness that affected around 600 people in the Eluru municipality area, with sudden symptoms of 3 to 5-minute epilepsy, fainting, nausea, anxiety and headache. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tests detected lead and nickel particulate matter in the blood samples of the patients, while experts from the World Health Organisation have suspected bleaching and chlorine used in Covid-19 sanitization measures as the reason. Officials said that only two locals were affected by the Eluru disease since Thursday night and that 13 people are under hospital treatment as of Friday evening. The Eluru government hospital saw a rush of the patients beginning last Saturday. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh government has constituted a chief secretary headed multi-departmental committee of senior officials and experts from the AIIMS, NIN, CCMB, WHO, IICT, NIV, NCDC etc institutions to investigate the source of the Eluru illness infection, and suggest remedial measures to prevent such occurrences anywhere in the future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/a-week-since-the-onset-cause-of-eluru-mystery-illness-remains-elusive-926270.html

The inhumane act took place near Chengamanad in the suburbs of Ernakulam on Friday morning. The incident came to light after a two-wheeler rider who spotted the dog being dragged shot it using a phone camera and posted it on social media. Yusuf, 62, a native of the locality, was held by the Chengamanad police by evening. He was learnt to have told the police that his family was not happy with the pet dog and hence he made a bid to abandon it. After the video of the inhumane act went viral on social media, an animal rights forum reported to the police and the police traced the accused. The dog, that was abandoned by Yusuf, was shifted to a shelter run by Daya Animal Welfare Organisation. Akhil, who shot the video, said that once he enquired Yusuf why he was dragging the dog like this, to which the latter responded rudely. Various Sections of IPC and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act would be invoked against the accused, said the police. Yusuf, who is a taxi driver by profession was held by the police using his vehicle's registration number. The state Motor Vehicles Department was also initiating steps to suspend his driving license.

The state resorted to using the machines for testing Covid samples when the pandemic began. So far, 29,599 Covid samples have been tested using CBNAAT method. There are eight to nine government Covid testing labs that have GeneXpert machines in the state. Dr Ramesh Reddy, joint director, TB, Health department, said, “Cartridges for GeneXpert machines are supplied by the Government of India. We cannot procure them locally. Around 3,000 cartridges arrived two months ago. Further supply will not come. We cannot do anything. We are left with 500 cartridges to test Covid samples.” Rapid antigen/RTPCR Now, the labs have to use rapid antigen method and RTPCR machines for Covid-19 tests. Eliminating TB  “We have received guidelines that we have to use TrueNAT and CBNAAT machines to test TB samples as we have a goal to eliminate TB. If we use the machines for Covid testing, we cannot do TB testing. Even though Nimhans did not ask for the cartridges, we gave it to them, to exhaust them. Active case finding is underway for TB and door-to-door survey will be done.” The Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS) started CBNAAT testing on May 6 and has so far tested 286 Covid samples with the technology. Quick tests for emergencies Dr Mahantesh Parande, HoD, microbiology, BIMS, told DH, “We use CBNAAT only in emergency situations, because we have shortage of cartridges. We last got 360 cartridges from the Health department on November 10. The advantage of using CBNAAT is, in cases of emergency surgery, we can get the Covid test result in three hours, while RTPCR takes eight hours for a cycle.” While TrueNAT results come in one-and-a-half hour, only four samples can be mounted at one go. The GeneXpert system is available in a one, two, four, and 16-module configuration. Gadag Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) started CBNAAT testing on April 24. Dr Mahesh Baragundi from GIMS said, “We tested 193 Covid samples with CBNAAT and then stopped, as despite repeated requests, we were not supplied cartridges.” Dr Channamma Katti from the Vijayapura district hospital said, “We have tested 200 Covid samples with CBNAAT so far. We could not use more than 400 cartridges supplied more than two months back, because our GeneXpert machine was taken away by the Health department for TB testing.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/after-covid-19-test-duty-genexpert-machines-revert-to-tb-testing-925910.html

Under the banner of Aikya Horata Samiti, farmers, trade union members and workers from various organisations raised slogans targeting both the state and the central government over the recent pieces of legislation.  The farmers also vented ire against JD(S), whose support helped BJP to pass the law in the Legislative Council. The move by farmers to take out a rally to Rajbhavan, to press on the Governor not to sign the Land Reforms Bill, put the police under the pressure initially. Ultimately, farmers had to give up their plan to lay siege to the Rajbhavan. Many sat on the road and continued the protest. Later, many met Governor Vajubhai Vala and submitted a memorandum. A member of the Samiti said that Vala had assured of looking into the matter and to consider their opinion before signing the bill.  On the other hand, the employees of state-run transport corporations from several districts, who came to Bengaluru along with family members also took to streets. The protesters demanded that they be considered government employees. The demand was raised days after Transport minister said that the move would cause a financial burden on the government. Meanwhile, Raitha Sangha’s Kodihalli Chandrashekhar expressed support to the cause of the transport corporation workers. “The government should not ignore them. We are ready to lay siege to Vidhana Soudha and go to jail to support their cause,” he said.

"We will promulgate an ordinance. As you know, the Legislative Council Chairperson did not cooperate," Yediyurappa said.  The Legislative Council was adjourned sine die on Thursday. Before promulgating the ordinance, the government will look to get the Legislative Council convened again.  The government has asked Council chairperson K Pratapachandra Shetty to convene the House again on Tuesday. "We've also petitioned the Governor. The Council Chairperson has no right to abruptly adjourn the House sine die the way he did. The Council Chairperson was there when it was decided in the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) to conduct the session till Tuesday or Wednesday," he said.   "The whole world knows that cows are revered in the Hindu dharma. In India, which is agrarian, animal husbandry is a source of income for agriculturists and cattle are used in farming activities. In this backdrop, cows are considered as an asset in the Indian culture. The Legislative Assembly has passed the Bill, which further strengthens the existing law," Yediyurappa said.  As per the Bill, cow slaughter will attract imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh, the CM said. "There is a provision to set up special courts, protection for those who protect cows and there's a ban on inter-state movement of cows," he said.  The state government will make arrangements by setting up an infrastructure where cows can be taken care of.  "Ninety per cent of the state's people are happy with the Bill.

As a result, several trips that were planned for Friday had to be cancelled besides affecting the regular operations.  In Bengaluru, most of the buses at Kempegowda Bus Terminus and BMTC bus stations remained off the roads. In various depots of the BMTC across Bengaluru, employees refused to go on regular trips leaving the buses stationed inside the depots. The sudden strike by the employees left hundreds of students, senior citizens and inter-district commuters on work purpose undergo severe hardships. Several colleges and universities in different parts of the state had planned for examination and tests. However, due to the non-operation of the buses, many students missed out on the examination. Similar was the situation in Haveri, Belagavi, Chitradurga, Hassan and other districts with all buses remaining off the roads.    Pressing for their demands, the employees had staged a protest in Bengaluru on Thursday and tried to sneak into Vidhana Soudha to make the government listen to their demands. Sources in the transport sector and employees federation revealed to DH that the strike will further intensify with the return of buses that were stuck in various destinations after the night services.  In the meantime, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi has appealed to the Employees Federation to withdraw their strike and said that it is impossible to consider their demands during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as it would be an additional burden on the state exchequer.  Refusing to withdraw from the protests, Chandrashekhar, President of the Employees Federation said, “The police have released the protesting employees late in the night on Thursday. We will fight and protest until the government listens to our demands and no bus will be operated till our demands are met with.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/transport-services-hit-across-karnataka-as-employees-go-on-strike-926039.html

The biennial aero show is scheduled to be held from February 3 to 7 at the Air Force Station in Yelahanka. Suggesting that some of the participants shall be allowed to take part in person while a few others shall be allowed to visit the five-day show virtually, the Health Department has written to the Defence Ministry to organise it in a ‘hybrid' mode. However, the final decision on the recommendation will be made in the first week of January 2021, according to the sources, depending on the number of Covid-19 cases in the state.  In a letter dated December 5, addressed to Cdr Achal Malhotra, Director, Defence Exhibition Organisation, MoD, Karnataka Health Department commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey had written, “The draft document for Covid-19 guidelines for Aero India 2021 is comprehensive and adequate. However, the programme will be in a hybrid mode (both virtual and in-person). The final decision for this will be taken in the first week of January 2021, after reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state."  Commenting on the issue, Pandey said, “Subsequent to the meeting with the Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, we have decided that the cap on the number of people in person and its ratio to those who will attend virtually will be decided in the first week of January depending on the number of Covid cases. The Centre is okay with it. They sell various kinds of passes for the common public and can mention on it that the pass can become valid only for a virtual entry. If there are five categories of passes, they can probably allow one or two categories and turn-down the rest." As per the guidelines issued by the Defence Ministry for Aero India 2021, "One holding bay will have 1,000 people. One person for every 3.25 square metres or 15 people in two guntas."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-wants-aero-india-2021-to-be-held-in-hybrid-mode-926041.html

On Wednesday, Karnataka’s BJP government passed the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020. Cow slaughter has been prohibited in the state since the 1960s but this bill adds bulls and buffaloes under 13 years of age into the definition of ‘cattle’. It has also made the punishment for slaughter stricter. Violent incidents related to cattle slaughter have been on the rise since 2015, wherein 46 people across the country have died and 146 were injured, according to data quoted in the report. None of these people were cattle vigilantes according to NDTV. But Narayan has said that in Karnataka, only cow vigilantes “have lost their lives”.  “People in the (cattle) trade were completely armed. They were taking lives and killing people. It is not the vigilantes,” he added. The Bill contains within it Section 17, which protects ‘persons acting in good faith’. Narayan said this provision has been made keeping in mind cow vigilantes. “Vigilantes or anyone who is working for a cause and the law of the land should definitely have a scope to work in this provision,” he said. Narayan said that this is not an agenda, because BJP is already in power. This is only a means for the state to preserve and promote its culture. The Bill’s objectives state that the government wants to ensure “preservation and improvement of breeds of cattle” and “organization of agriculture and animal husbandry”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/earlier-cow-vigilantes-were-at-risk-karnataka-deputy-cm-ashwath-naryan-on-anti-cow-slaughter-law-926045.html

In a letter to the Union Minister, KCCI president Issac Vas said the overall potential of coastal districts can be fully exploited only if the region is administered by a single zone. He said Mangaluru is now fortunate to have train connectivity to Bengaluru, Kerala and Mumbai. However, being under the control of three railway zones (Southern Railway, SWR and Konkan Railway Corporation), train operations are getting complicated due to lack of coordination among the zones. Many development proposals including the introduction of new trains and modification of existing services did not materialise due to the lack of coordination, Vas said in the letter. He said the Railway Ministry had in 2004 decided to hand over the Mangaluru railway network to Mysuru division of SWR after the completion of the gauge conversion between Mangaluru and Hassan. The Ministry has not implemented the decision even 14 years after the gauge conversion. Vas said freight movement between New Mangalore Port Trust and other parts of Karnataka will improve if Mangaluru comes under SWR. With the proposed expansion of MRPL, bringing Mangaluru-Thokur line under SWR will also enhance the operations in the region, he said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bring-mangaluru-railway-network-under-swr-kcci-926088.html
11-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka gears up for possible second Covid-19 wave, purchases equipment and drugs||Anticipating a second wave of Covid-19 infections, the state government has got into a preparatory mode. The Covid-19 task force on Friday resolved to ramp up testing and ensure adequate supply of oxygen and medicine to district and taluk hospitals across the state. The ministerial task force, headed by Deputy Chef Minister Govid Karjol and comprising ministers S Suresh Kumar, K Sudhakar and C C Patil, Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar and senior officials, discussed Covid preparedness for the next three months.   “If the second wave starts, we do not want a shortage of oxygen, which we experienced a few months ago. In this respect, oxygen generators by both technologies, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), will be installed in 10 district hospitals and 30 taluk hospitals. Rs 37.72 crore has been approved for the same,” Sudhakar said.   "We have decided to have oxygen generators in 10 district hospitals, 30 taluk hospitals. We have given administrative approval to buy oxygen generators.... at an estimated cost of 37.72 crore," Sudhakar told reporters after chairing the Covid-19 Task Force meeting. The government has also sanctioned Rs 45 crore for purchase of equipment, including ten lakh rapid antigen test kits at a cost of Rs 11.32 crore, and emergency drugs worth Rs 22.50 crore, he said. "Just because the positivity rate of coronavirus is less, we should not believe that we can escape the second wave. The Technical Advisory Committee (on Covid-19) has recommended enhancing the testing," he added. The Task Force held a detailed meeting with the officials from the districts of Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ballari, Yadgir, Dakshina Kannada, Belagavi, Bidar, Haveri and Udupi, which Sudhakar said were conducting less tests. Under no circumstances, targeted testing should be reduced. On the plans for delivery of the vaccine once it was available, Sudhakar said a new mobile application has been developed. The officials have been asked to input details of vaccine administering centres in the application and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. The first vaccine beneficiaries of the vaccine will be the front-line workers including healthcare personnel in private and government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. Testing kits For the next 90 days, 10 lakh Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits worth Rs 11.32 crore will be procured. “We have already given approval for purchasing RAT kits worth Rs 45 crore. Further, a Rs 22.5 crore has been sanctioned to procure emergency medicines,” the Sudhakar said. The minister said that the private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 1,800 - Rs 2,000 for a Remdesivir vial. “It has been brought to our notice that private hospitals are charging around Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000 for a Remdesivir injection. The government is getting it at Rs 1,800 per injection. Hence, private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 1,800 - Rs 2,000 per injection. Under KPME Act, action will be taken against them,” he said. For RT-PCR test consumables, the task force has approved Rs 10.22 crore for 90 days. Testing targets The virus-hit Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Bidar, Bengaluru Urban, Belagavi, Vijayapura, Haveri, Yadgir, Bengaluru Urban, and Ballari districts were given targets for testing in a video conference held on Friday between the minister and administration of respective districts. “The testing rate in these districts was low compered to other districts. Under any circumstance, the targets set for Covid tests have to be met,” Sudhakar said. Vaccine storage “We have observed lapses in uploading of vaccine storage details in certain districts. We have told them that by Saturday the details have to be updated,” the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-gears-up-for-possible-second-covid-19-wave-purchases-equipment-and-drugs-926204.html

Talking to reporters, the former Union agriculture minister also said that the protest at Delhi borders may spread elsewhere if no timely decision was taken by the Centre on the farmers' demands. He maintained that the farm Bills concerned were passed in a "hurried" manner in the Parliament despite the opposition parties calling for a detailed discussion on them. Farmers from different states have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) border points for nearly two weeks to demand a repeal of the farm laws enacted in September. Farmers say these laws will eliminate the safety net of minimum support price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop. "Today, farmers have made the extreme demand for withdrawing the laws first and said the issue can be discussed later. The Centre's position on the same, however, does not seem to be favourable. Hence, there are signs that the deadlock may continue for some more days," Pawar said. The veteran leader said that more people travelling in around 700 tractors joined the ongoing protest near Delhi border on Friday morning. "The protest is restricted to Delhi border. But it cannot be ruled out that it may spread elsewhere too if no decision is taken in time. "We insist the Government of India that the farmer is the 'annadata' (food provider) of the country, his tolerance should not be tested," he added. Pawar also refuted speculations made in a section of media on Thursday about him becoming the chairman of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). "It was a false news. Do not run such false news," he said in response to a query. Pawar also criticised Union minister Raosaheb Danve over his "China and Pakistan behind farmers' protest" remark, saying that such comments should not be given importance. "Some people are such that they do not have the sense of what should be said where and how. He had made such statements in the past too," Pawar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/dont-test-tolerance-of-farmers-sharad-pawar-tells-centre-926119.html

The recovery of bodies in the Umbarkhand-Paccharpur jungle has come as a shock in the Mumbai metropolitan region. The four were missing from 21 October and a missing complaint was lodged. The deceased were identified as  Ranjana (30), her two daughters Darshana (12) Rohini (6) and son Rohit (9). The bodies have been sent for post-mortem at the government hospital. Padgha police station’s inspector DM Katke said that the bodies were found hanging from the tree and the incident was reported to the police. After seeing the bodies, Ranjana’s husband and the father of the kids, Sripat Bangri (35), attempted suicide by consuming poison. He has been admitted to the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital for treatment. Sripat’s brother who had gone to the jungle to get woods saw the skeletons of the four hanging and alerted his brother. A forensic team has been called for investigations. The identity of the bodies could be established on the basis of the clothes. An accidental death report has been registered and investigations are underway. “We are investigating the case from various angles,” said Katke. Initial investigations also reveal that Sripat had married another woman.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bodies-of-woman-and-her-three-children-found-hanging-in-thane-man-attempts-suicide-926146.html

"Most of the ruling party MLAs and ministers are voracious beef eaters. Are they listening to these cries of anguish over fears of beef drying up from the state's markets? Christmas is already around the corner and a beef shortage is a reality," Congress spokesperson Trajano D'Mello said. D'Mello's comments appear to be aimed at the 15 MLAs in the BJP's 27-member strong legislative party, who are Catholics. "Beef is already scarce and the prices of commodities like fish, vegetables, cereals, etc are already beyond the reach of the common man, which is likely to push him to starvation. The shortage will highly impact the food industry serving beef which is popular among tourists visiting Goa," D'Mello said. Beef is a routinely consumed commodity in Goa and is served in restaurants in the coastal fringes of the state, which are frequented by nearly eight million tourists every year. More than 25 tons of beef is consumed in Goa every day, most of which has been imported from Karnataka's Belagavi district. The Goa Quraishi Meat Traders Association has already said that the impact of the new law in Karnataka will not just be felt adversely on people who consume beef, but also on families involved in the meat trade. Goa Forward president Vijai Sardesai said that even former Chief Minister late Manohar Parrikar had assured the state assembly in 2017, that even if beef is banned throughout India, he would make sure it is made available in Goa. "What is this government doing to ensure that beef is made available to our state's sizable population? Are they going to let down late Parrikar's assurance to Goa?" Sardesai said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/karnatakas-anti-cow-slaughter-law-makes-political-ripples-in-goa-926161.html

These polls would be a litmus test for the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi and the opposition BJP to check their base and penetration in the hinterland. The State Election Commission announced the schedule for polls on Friday. “The code of conduct has come in force,” State Election Commissioner UPS Madan said. The elections are being held in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the globe and the possibility of a second wave early next year.

According to state health minister Raghu Sharma, the committee, which includes medical education commissioner Shivangi Swarnkar and other officials, will visit the J K Lon Hospital and investigate every case of infant death at the health facility. Nine newborns died at the hospital within a span of hours, a year after the same facility had hit national headlines over the deaths of an unusual number of infants. Five of the babies died during Wednesday night and four more on Thursday at the J K Lon Hospital. All of them were between one to four days old. Sharma said the committee will look into overall arrangements at the hospital such as requirement and availability of medical staff, availability of medical equipment, and medicines. It will submit its report to the state government in three days, he said. The Rajasthan health minister also directed all principals of all medical colleges of the state to take special care towards the treatment of newborn children, according to a release. Rajasthan Human Rights Commission secretary B L Meena and registrar Omi Purohit will visit the JK Lon hospital on December 14. They will also hold meetings with the divisional commissioner, IG, collector, SP, chief municipal health officer and other officials. Meanwhile, the opposition BJP slammed the Congress-led state government over the deaths of the infants and also formed a committee which will visit the hospital. Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia said 107 infants had died in the same hospital last year but the government "took no lessons" and now nine infants have died in the hospital. The committee consists of deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore, the BJP's state general secretary and MLA Madan Dilawar, MP Jaskaur Meena and MLA Sandeep Sharma.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rajasthan-government-constitutes-panel-to-investigate-death-of-nine-newborns-at-hospital-in-kota-926203.html

Besides, they have to wear Khadi on Fridays. The general administration department (GAD) has come out with a detailed circular on Friday, which said: “The Maharashtra government directs all employees and those who work on contract to wear appropriate formal clothes and appear professional, as they are the face of the administration for all people ranging from the commoners to the elected representatives and others”. While male staffers are recommended to wear formal shirts, pants, trousers, they must avoid dark, multihued or attire with loud printed or glitzy designs. Similarly, it is suggested that women should come in saris, salwar kameez, kurta and if required with a dupatta. The staff has been asked to avoid wearing casuals like jeans, T-shirts, skirts-and-tops.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/khadi-on-fridays-and-no-jeans-or-t-shirts-new-dress-code-for-maharashtra-govt-employees-926220.html

The BTP had stood by Gehlot when he was battling a rebellious Sachin Pilot in July that had pushed the Congress government to a minority. BTP chief Chhotubhai Vasava was incensed when BJP and Congress came together to deny the district chief post to a BTP-backed independent candidate in Dungarpur. Of the 27 district council seats in Dungarpur, BTP-backed independent candidates had won 13 seats, while BJP and Congress had won eight and six seats respectively. BTP was hoping to win the district chief’s post with support from the Congress, but in a surprising turn of events, Congress backed the BJP candidate to the post. “BJP and Congress are together. All the political parties across the country should take note of this alliance and stay away from them in future elections,” Vasava said. Vasava also accused the Congress of forcibly standing with the farmers in their agitation against the farm laws with the sole intention to weaken the protests. “Congress will weaken the farmers' agitation as the entire debate would be Congress versus the BJP, pushing farmers’ issues to the background,” Vasava said. The BTP’s announcement of the withdrawal of support to the Rajasthan government will have little impact as Gehlot enjoys the support of 118 MLAs in the 200-member assembly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/btp-withdraws-support-from-ashok-gehlot-government-926236.html
