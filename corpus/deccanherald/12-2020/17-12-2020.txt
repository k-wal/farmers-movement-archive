The terminal is expected to start functioning from February 2021. Airports Authority of India (AAI) - Cargo Logistics & Allied Services Company Ltd, subsidiary of AAI, has given in-principle approval for conversion of the old passenger terminal into the cargo handling section. Hubballi Airport Director Pramod Kumar Thakre informed DH that the upcoming cargo terminal (at an estimated cost of Rs 60.6 lakh) shall have secured storage space for both inbound and outbound cargo, a dedicated room for valuables and dangerous goods, along with provision for commercial space that can be utilised by airlines, major freight forwarders/logistics players like postal authorities and e-commerce players. The 700 square metre cargo terminal shall have annual cargo holding capacity 15,000 MT, he said. He said the regulatory authorities have completed their preliminary inspection and the final inspection is expected by end of January. “We are hopeful of commissioning the facility before the end of this financial year - after complying all the statuary regulations in respect of aviation security,”(sic) he said. Industries and progressive farmers of the region are hopeful that the commencement of cargo terminal will boost the economy of North Karnataka. Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Mahendra Ladhad said that the commencement of the cargo terminal can be a game changer for the industries here as it would speed up transport of agro-based products (including food processing), chemicals, automotive parts among others. Currently, 35-40 export-oriented industries are making use of the cargo service provided by Indigo Airlines. However, if the dedicated cargo terminal starts operating, it would help several other industries to flourish in the next 15 to 20 months. Horticulture farmer Shanmugappa Munavalli of Bagalkot said that earlier his grapes and raisin used to be sold in neighbouring districts and states. “With cargo facility, I can even plan to export it to other countries and improve my earnings,” he said. Thakre said the current operating airlines: Indigo and Star Air, which are connected to major gateway ports like Chennai, Bangalore and Mumbai, have expressed their interest in operating through this terminal. Hubballi airport is also hopeful that airlines such as Air India and Alliance Air will start cargo service, as the demand increases. Cold storage for Covid-19 vaccine Hubballi Airport Director Pramod Kumar Thakre said that the proposal has been sent to officials concerned for release of funds for setting up of cold storage at the Hubballi Airport to store vaccines against Covid-19. As per the recent orders from the Union government, all cargo terminals in the country should have a cold storage unit for storing of Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected any time soon. "As per the guidelines, we have sent a proposal for release of Rs 5 lakh for constriction of the cold storage at the airport. We are expecting its approval in a few days. A tender will be called to set up a cold storage with 3 to 4 tonnes of storage capacity and maintain a temperature of 2-4 degree Celsius. By March we are hopeful of the cold-storage,"(sic) he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hubballi-dharwad/hubballi-airport-to-house-north-karnatakas-first-cargo-terminal-928378.html

She also asked the secretary to pay the pending bills pertaining to the 2,344 works completed already. Only Rs 533.45 crore has been spent till the end of November 2020. If the board fails to spend about 78% of funds released through the first and second instalments, the government will not be able to release the next instalment, she said. KKRDB Chairman Dattatraya Patil Revoor told DH that after Covid-19 outbreak, about 1,200 works were kept in abeyance for about six months on the directions of the government and the contractors stopped the works in villages due to labour problem triggered by the Covid-19. Now, most of the works have been sped up, he explained. "There will be no issue at all now and the on-gonging works will be completed in the stipulated time," he explained. However, KKRDB Secretary N V Prasad was not available for his reaction to the letter. KPCC spokesperson and Chittapur MLA Priyank Kharge alleged that the State government is not concerned about Kalyana Karnataka region. "Though Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chauhan is from the region, he does not know anything. A cabinet minister should be made the KKRDB chairman as he has to attend cabinet sub-committee meeting where he could bring more funds and also get the funds for pending works released for the region. How can an MLA attend such a meeting though he was accorded the cabinet rank status?" he asked. The Finance Department has given its concurrence for Rs 952.22 crore action plan for 2020-21 submitted by the board. The administrative department has directed the Finance Department to release this fund along with the budgetary allocation of the next year, he explained.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/additional-chief-secretary-shalini-upset-over-not-utilising-funds-released-for-kkrdb-928482.html

In a press conference here, Lakshmana said, “Beef exports increased by 25% after Modi became the PM and a majority of the people involved in the business have identified with the BJP.” Lakshmana suspected a scam of crores of rupees at Pinjarapole Society in Mysuru. Several cattle were housed at the society. But, there is no accountability. District In-charge Minsiter S T Somashekar should conduct an inquiry,” he said. Lakshmana said that a man from Gujarat is managing the society, but, there is no clarity on it. “Is the society private or government agency. How much funds the government releases to the society?” he asked. Lakshmana took severe exception to privatisation of Indian Railways and said that the PM is selling off the country. “Railway is the lifeline of daily wage workers and employees. But, the Union government is selling off the railways to private people. Though the railway has good income, the government has privatised 60%. If the railway is privatised, the passengers have to pay to use even toilets,” he said. Congress leader Ramappa said that Education Minister S Suresh Kumar is creating confusion by making several statements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-congress-leader-dares-pm-modi-to-ban-beef-exports-928499.html

Addressing a media conference here, on Thursday, Ravichandregowda was reacting to Vishwanath, who on Wednesday, ridiculed the JD(S), describing the party as a child, which favours the person who offers sweets. To a query on JD(S)’s support to the BJP in the Legislative Council, Vishwanath had said that the JD(S) has become like a child between the Congress and the BJP, and will go with whoever offers sweets. “While he was in the Congress, he describe the party as his mother. When he joined the JD(S), he described former prime minister H D Deve Gowda as a father figure. Now, he is in the BJP. Thus, he should tell how is he related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he asked. Pointing at the Supreme Court order about the disqualification of Vishwanath, Ravichandregowda said that as a lawyer, who understands its interpretation better, Vishwanath should resign as MLC, if he has self-respect. “The SC order issued on November 13, 2019, states, a member disqualified under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution shall be subject to sanctions provided under Articles 75(1B), 164(1B) and 361B of the Constitution, which provides for a bar from being appointed as a minister or from holding any remunerative political post from the date of disqualification till the date on which the term of his office would expire or if he is re-elected, whichever is earlier,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/which-sweet-took-you-to-mumbai-jds-asks-ahv-928501.html
17-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Siddaramaiah to chair Grama Janadhikar Samavesha||Opposition Leader and former chief minister Siddaramaiah is slated to chair ‘Grama Janadhikar Samavesha’ of Congress of Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency, in the wake of Gram Panchayat (GP) elections, scheduled to be held on December 24, in Mysuru taluk. However, the meeting, scheduled to be held at Kalabhyraveshwara Convention Hall, Niveditha Nagar, Mysuru city, on December 18, Friday, and the GP election itself are expected to have far-reaching effects on the next Assembly election, said a senior Congress leader. “During the preliminary meeting of ‘Grama Janadhikar Samavesha’, held on December 14, Monday at Congress Bhavan, a few leaders and workers of Chamundeshwari constituency complained that they are left to fend for themselves, without a leader, to either lead or guide them, since the defeat of Siddaramaiah in the 2018 Assembly polls,” said the leader. “Congress workers, mainly candidates contesting GP polls, who used to have a straight fight with JD(S) supported candidates, till the last election, face a changed situation. With the BJP, which is not a major force in Mysuru region, also taking the GP polls seriously, the contest dynamics has changed a bit. Even if the BJP supported candidates do not win, the votes they would poll would affect the winning prospects of either the Congress orthe  JD(S) supported candidates. Whom it would affect negatively has to be seen,” another Congress leader said. Meanwhile, pointing at the complaints of Congress workers about not having a leader in Chamundeshwari Assembly segment, a KPCC member said that since his defeat, Siddaramaiah has not lost touch with leaders and workers in Mysuru region, especially Mysuru district. “However, he has not done much for party workers of Chamundeshwari segment. Whenever, he comes to Mysuru, he meets only a select few leaders. Ordinary leaders and workers do not have access to him. He has toured his son Dr Yathindra’s Varuna constituency. But, except for some personal visits, he has not toured Chamundeshwari segment,” the KPCC member said. A ZP member said that former ZP president K Marigowda had plans to contest the 2018 Assembly poll in Chamundeshwari. "But, as Siddaramaiah’s late son Rakesh nursed an ambition for the same constituency, he side-stepped. Even though Rakesh was not there, during 2018 polls, Siddaramaiah chose Chamundeshwari to make way for his son Dr Yathindra in the more safer Varuna. Not knowing whether Siddaramaiah would stick to his present Badami segment or come back to Chamundeshwari, Marigowda is not proactive in the constituency,” the ZP member said. A former GP member said that present MLA G T Devegowda, who trounced Siddaramaiah with a huge margin in the 2018 polls, is a force to reckon within Chamundeshwari segment. “Devegowda is a grassroots-level leader. With or without party support, he wields enormous influence among the people of the segment. With neither Siddaramaiah nor any other Congress leader doing much in the segment, Devegowda has become more confident. Even though Devegowda is maintaining a distance from the JD(S) and its leaders, former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy and his lieutenant, also KR Nagar MLA, Sa Ra Mahesh have tried to reach out to him. That is his clout, in rural areas,” the ex-GP member said. Siddaramaiah should either announce that he will come back to Chamundeshwari, for the next Assembly poll, or name a Congressman, who can lead the people and contest the election, to fill confidence among party workers, said the ex-member of GP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/siddaramaiah-to-chair-grama-janadhikar-samavesha-928502.html

In a letter addressed to the chief electoral officer, Shivakumar said voter lists should be printed at the Government Press only. "There are widespread complaints that the means of certain categories of voters are getting deleted from the final list of the voters at the time of printing," Shivakumar stated. "It is alleged that certain outfits affiliated to a political party, through various means, manipulate the lists at the time of printing and see that the names of certain categories of voters are omitted in the list." Since political parties cannot set right this anomaly, voter disenfranchisement is "sheer mockery" of democracy, Shivakumar asserted. "In order to ensure that no manipulation takes place in the printing of voters' list, the Election Commission has to take the precaution that private operators do not sneak into the system," he said. Shivakumar's letter to the Election Commission comes just days before the gram panchayat elections. During the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll last month, the Congress had alleged voter disenfranchisement, accusing the BJP of preventing genuine voters from exercising their right.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/print-voter-lists-only-at-govt-press-urges-d-k-shivakumar-928494.html

The website will connect interested investors to relevant government agencies such as APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) for agricultural exports from India, Indian trade portal for trade with India and Invest India for inward investment respectively, he said. "As additional secretary Harish reminded us, in line with our Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of doubling our farmers' income by 2022, the website highlights the opportunities for our agricultural exports abroad," he said. The MEA through its missions and posts plays an increasingly important role in facilitating, in providing inputs to the APEDA, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, for diversifying markets and enhancing the incomes of farmers through exports, Jaishankar said. "Through a specific focus on the government of India's ease of doing business initiatives, policy reforms and incentives aimed at attracting foreign investment, the website positions a multi-dimensional and dynamic brand India to the global business community," he said. "We aim to connect businesses seeking to conduct trade and investment overseas with Indian missions and posts, and alert them to the relevant guidelines. Indian missions and posts abroad can also access periodically updated business related information on India aimed at important stakeholders in the overseas Indian community as well as potential foreign investors," Jaishankar said. In pursuit of the prime minister's call of an 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat', the MEA has been working in collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the minister of tourism and other line ministries to promote what was called the three T's -- trade, tourism and technology -- into India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mea-launches-website-to-boost-two-way-economic-engagement-928172.html

Mohan deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, chaired by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. The panel had called him on the issue of the citizens' data safety. Mohan was accompanied by Shivnath Thukral, the public policy director of Facebook. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, along with Tharoor, questioned Mohan about a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report suggesting that the social media giant is reluctant on banning the Bajrang Dal on its platform due to financial reasons and concerns over the safety of its staff, the sources said. The WSJ report suggested that despite an internal assessment calling for a ban on the Bajrang Dal, Facebook has not cracked down on the Hindu nationalist group due to these reasons. Replying to queries, Mohan suggested to the panel members that the Facebook fact team consultant has so far not found any such element in the content posted by the Bajrang Dal that is violative of its social media policies. Further quizzing him, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey asked if the Bajrang Dal content was not found to be violative of its social media policies, then why did the Facebook not deny the WSJ report and termed it as fake.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bajrang-dals-content-doesnt-necessitate-ban-facebook-india-head-ajit-mohan-928237.html

On Wednesday, the top court observed that the Centre's talks with the protesting farmers have "not worked apparently" and were bound to fail, and said it will form a committee having representatives of both the sides, but the agitating leaders dismissed it as no solution. There was a disruption of traffic movement on key routes in the national capital on Thursday, the 22nd day of the farmers' protest. Farmers camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur border points have led to the closure of several routes in Delhi. According to the city police, Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Sabholi and Mangesh borders are closed. Commuters have been advised to take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad and Singhu school toll tax borders, while traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road, they said. The Outer Ring Road, GTK road and NH-44 should be avoided, the police said. Those travelling to Haryana can take Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, the police said. Gazipur border also remains closed for traffic coming from Gaziabad to Delhi. Commuters have been advised to take alternate routes via Anand Vihar, DND, Chilla, Apsara and Bhopra borders, they added. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-traffic-disrupted-on-delhis-key-routes-thousands-stay-put-at-border-points-928277.html

17-12-2020||National||Supreme Court order on contempt plea against Kunal Kamra, Rachita Taneja on December 18||The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its order on a batch of contempt petitions filed against stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra and another comic artist Rachita Taneja over their tweets mocking the top court. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said it would pronounce the order on Friday. Advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar, appearing for the petitioner, a law student, pointed out multiple scandalous tweets were made by Kamra against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India. He also said the Attorney General K K Venugopal had already granted consent for initiating contempt. When the advocate started to read the tweets, the bench told him that it was unnecessary.  The counsel said even when someone pointed out to Kamra that he would be liable for the contempt, he again said, "You mean contempt of joke?"  The counsel said, "He (Kamra) is comparing the Supreme Court to a joke." Arguing for another contempt case against cartoonist Taneja, senior advocate P S Narasimha contended her tweets were clearly calculated to undermine the confidence of the public in judiciary. He said the Attorney General was clearly of the opinion that there were instances intended to scandalise the judiciary. "There were allegations that the Supreme Court is biased in favour of the ruling party," he said. The court said it would pronounce order in her case as well. Armed with mandatory consent from the Attorney General, a batch of petitions were filed against Kamra by Abhyudaya Mishra, Shrirang Katneshwarkar, Skand Bajpai against Kamra and one by Aditya Kashyap against Taneja. Kamra had posted "objectionable tweets" against the Supreme Court and its judges, including Justice D Y Chandrachud for taking up bail plea by Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.  Similarly, following the top court's order granting bail to Goswami, Taneja through a Twitter handle @sanitarypanels posted a number of tweets including one in which she described the Supreme Court as "Sanghi Court of India". Other tweets that were found "objectionable" were posted by her in August. One was related to alleged quid pro quo on the nomination of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha and the other on the Ayodhya case judgement by a five-judge bench in November 2019. A consent by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is mandatory under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act for initiating such a petition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-order-on-contempt-plea-against-kunal-kamra-rachita-taneja-on-december-18-928296.html

A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A, however, clarified that the HC order on preventive detention won't impact criminal cases and those would be decided on their own merits. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, contended that the HC had substituted subjective satisfaction of the district magistrate. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, however, said, "it seems to be a good order". "We see no reason to interfere with the HC order. But the observations will not affect the prosecution on criminal cases," the court said, dismissing the petition filed by the state government. Khan was detained under the stringent law after he was granted bail by Aligarh court on February 10 in connection with his alleged inflammatory speech during anti CAA-NPR-NRC protest. In its plea, the Yogi Adityanath government contended the speech delivered by Khan on December 13, 2019 in AMU campus had provoked students to march towards the city, which might have created a law and order problem and disturb the communal harmony. Justifying his detention, the state government claimed Khan had a history of committing various offences, resulting into disciplinary action and suspension from service, lodging of FIRs and imposition of the NSA. Khan was a lecturer at department of Paediatrics at B R D Medical College in Gorakhpur, where over 60 children had died within a week in August, 2017 due to Japanese encephalitis and many reportedly for want of oxygen whose supply was disrupted after bills were not paid to the vendor. He was then arrested for his alleged negligent role and suspended from the hospital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-dismisses-up-govts-plea-against-quashing-of-detention-of-dr-kafeel-khan-928300.html

The school was closed for months amid the pandemic, but even since it reopened Dhiru’s mother Rekha Devi is afraid to send her son to class. Unlike some schools, Dhiru’s doesn’t offer online instruction -- and even if it did, the family doesn’t own a computer or a smartphone to access the internet. “The school is now saying, ‘Come and attend class,’ but we don’t want to take the risk,” said Rekha Devi, a domestic helper near New Delhi. “Unlike rich people, we don’t have the option of online classes. So we’ve started private tuition for him, but I’m not sure he’ll be able to pass the exams without any schooling this year.” Plenty of Indians are facing a similar predicament: As many as 80% of Indian students couldn’t access online schooling during the lockdown, and many might not return to classrooms when they reopen, according to a recent study by Oxfam. That’s just one example of how the pandemic has exacerbated the country’s digital divide -- the gap between those with the means and knowledge to benefit from the internet, and those without -- worsening already stark levels of inequality and weighing on economic growth. While the divide isn’t unique to India, it’s especially acute in a nation where more than half the population of 1.3 billion people is under 25 years old.   When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced lockdowns earlier this year, services from banking and schooling to medical consultations and job searches moved online, and in some cases remain there nine months later. Many companies see “work from home” as the new normal. Before the pandemic, government researchers estimated India’s digital shift could unlock as much as $1 trillion of economic value over five years. But the crisis is spreading those benefits unevenly and widening socio-economic inequalities, with girls suffering more than boys and rural areas more affected than cities. “The digital divide in India is an ongoing problem and the pandemic has definitely made it worse,” said Sumeysh Srivastava, a New Delhi-based internet-access researcher at Nyaaya, an open-access platform that provides simple and actionable legal information. “The government needs to ensure that all Indians are in position to benefit from digitization, otherwise we’re at risk of creating a new class of digitally poor citizens.” Internet AccessIndia has the world’s second-largest pool of internet users, about 600 million, comprising more than 12% of all users globally. Yet half its population lacks internet access, and even if they can get online, only 20% of Indians know how to use digital services, according to government data. Every 10% increase in India’s internet traffic delivers a 3.1% increase in per-capita gross domestic product, according to a 2018 report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. But the benefits of those gains aren’t reaching everyone: Srivastava said government-run digital literacy programs cover 5% or less of the population, are focused only on rural areas and suffer from various design and implementation issues. “The digital revolution has made services more tradable and enabled India to grow rapidly with a different growth model compared to China,” said Ejaz Ghani, a former economist at the World Bank. “But this is now being restrained by the digital divide.” The launch of online job portals for laborers and e-passes to move around during the lockdown meant Indians who aren’t digitally literate could have lost out on livelihood opportunities. The government said last week the pandemic “has necessitated delivery of stable and high-speed broadband internet services to an increasingly large number of subscribers in the country,” and allowed for public Wi-Fi networks to be established. That will create employment, boost small businesses’ income and raise GDP, the government said. “Reducing the digital divide will be through increased investments in digital infrastructure,” Ghani said. “China has marched way ahead of India and closed the gap with the U.S. on the digital revolution. We have a long way to catch up.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amid-covid-19-indias-digital-divide-risks-a-lost-generation-928303.html

According to the latest data released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the death toll crossed to 1,44,000 on Wednesday, with active cases at 3,22,366. Maharashtra is leading with the most number of infections, state-wise. The recovery rate in India is at a strong 95.3 per cent, with total recovered cases in India reaching 95 lakh.  Covid-19 trajectory in India The increase in the number of cases in India was late but rapid. The country first crossed the 20-lakh mark only on August 7. It crossed 30 lakhs within the following two weeks on August 23. The tally crossed the 40-lakh mark on September 5, the 50-lakh mark on September 16 and the 60-lakh mark on September 28. The caseload crossed 80-lakh mark on October 29 and 90 lakh on November 20. But October was the first month that the number of fresh infections and fatalities saw a fall. The month saw 18.3 lakh new cases, down from 26.2 lakh cases registered in September. The caseload in October was even lower than that in August. The death toll from September to October also fell by 30 per cent. The numbers in December have also been steadily falling. It was reported earlier this week that Tuesday was the eighth consecutive day that the active caseload remained below four lakh. Why the falling numbers? It was also feared that with the festive season and winters approaching, India would likely see a strong second wave of the virus, as social distancing rules became blurred. But the past month has brought good news for the country. It was reported earlier today that the active caseload remained below 4 lakh for the eleventh consecutive day on Wednesday. Vaccine status The Indian drug regulators are still studying proposals of pharma company Bharat BioTech’s vaccine and the Serum Institute of India vaccine before giving their go-ahead.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-s-total-covid-19-cases-approach-1-crore-mark-a-look-at-its-trajectory-928310.html

Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been protesting at various border points of Delhi, including Singhu and Tikri, for over a fortnight, demanding that the Centre repeal the three new farm laws. "It pains me that many people who are sitting in protest probably are not aware of what they are protesting against... Government is still sending a message to all the farmers that please come and talk," Puri said at an online function of industry chamber HDCCI. There were three demands -- MSP (minimum support price) should not be taken away, mandis should stay and nobody should in a clandestine manner usurp the farmers' land -- and all these have been granted, he added. "There has been a big misunderstanding... we are willing to sit with anyone and sort this out," Puri added. The minister, who also holds the civil aviation portfolio, expressed confidence that by the end of December and the first quarter of 2021 (January-March) "we will be back to pre-Covid levels". He said that all the normal civil aviation operations were closed when India went in for a lockdown in March and reopened on May 25, with just 30,000 passengers a day. "A few days ago, we had more than 2,53,000 passengers... I am confident that by the end of December and the first quarter of 2021 (January-March 2021), we will be back to pre-Covid levels," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-govt-willing-to-sit-with-farmers-to-sort-out-issues-hardeep-singh-puri-928329.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Health Ministry and the commission seeking their stand on the petition by a doctor who has claimed that under the Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Amendment Rules, 2020 persons with MSc or PhD degrees have been allowed to sign medical diagnostic reports. Dr Rohit Jain, a practicing pathologist, has contended that every report requires application of mind by a qualified pathologist in the first instance.  "Medical reports not countersigned by a qualified pathologist may lead to misdiagnosis or late-diagnosis putting lives of public at large at serious risk. Such arbitrary distinctions will lead to quackery, corruption and may put the public at the risk of misdiagnosis or late-diagnosis which can be fatal," the petition, filed through advocate Mrinmoi Chatterjee, has said. Jain has contended that amended rules are "illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional and ultra vires of the parent act itself" and has sought a declaration to that effect from the court. He has also sought an order from the court directing that lab reports can be countersigned only by a registered medical practitioner with a post-graduate qualification in Pathology, Microbiology, Biochemistry or Laboratory Medicine.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-seeks-govt-stand-on-non-medical-persons-signing-lab-reports-928344.html

Travellers from across the globe had come to Mumbai – and had mixed up with local communities. And of course, food and the style of cooking in this city have been influenced by the people coming over for years. Mumbai is perhaps one of those cities where you get masala that is made and used across India and the world. Kashmiri chillies, Karnataka’s Byadagi chillies, and Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur chillies can be found in the Crawford Market Mirchi Gully. From turmeric, dried flesh of coconuts, cinnamon powder to nutmeg, ground pepper, and coriander powder – you can get at the Lalbaug Masala Gully. Similarly, at the Kalbadevi Masala Gully, you would get anything that you can think of. At the APMC in Navi Mumbai, you will get all the spices that you need to cook an Indian meal. Masala or spices in it is a complex subject – but Anjali Koli Cooper can break it down and make it simple. “Species elevates the taste of food. It is all about proportion, colour, need, accuracy,” says Anjali, who runs a popular blog AnnaParaBrahma.A veteran culinary expert, she hails from traditional fisherfolk of Koli community who is married to a Parsi family. Anjali would take people to a virtual Masala Trail at the Jashn-e-Dastaan-e-Mumbai festival hosted by the Mumbai Research Centre (MRC) of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai. Speaking about the Indian spices, she said: “Clearly the spice mixes of India have undergone a transformation after the Portuguese brought chillis…When people from various religions and communities came and settled in Mumbai, they added to the culture and food.” She traces the spices to their origin and also traverses through the route it has travelled before landing in the Indian sub-continent. Speaking on Jaiphal-Javitri, she said: “Jaiphal-Javitri, Nutmeg-Mace these are the twin spices obtained from the same tree. The story of Nutmeg and Mace is fascinating. It was available wild only in Banda Islands for centuries. The fragrance of which first attracted seafaring traders. First Indian and then Arabs and finally the Europeans. The Dutch controlled it for a long time. When there is control then there are unnatural prevention methods of propagation but nature rebels and birds carried the seeds of the nutmeg to other islands. India was among the early cultivators. Since it came via Javanese traders it got the name Javitri for mace.” On the famous Dalchini, she points out: “Dalchini which means a branch or twig from China. That is where the first uses of Cassia are seen. Cassia is used as a medicine for respiratory and circulatory and antibacterial effects. The flavour of the aldehydes in Cassia is sharp and pungent. This is the external bark of the Cinnamomum cassia. In the Indian cuisine, meat and poultry dishes use Cassia. It is a garam spice, so a component of garam masala. It helps make meat better for consumption as it is a blood thinner and lowers cholesterol.” About coriander, she said: “Dhana is grown majorly in two states in India one in Rajasthan and the other Madhya Pradesh. However, Dhana is not a desert crop. It needs a well-hydrated soil but nevertheless is intense in this desert land like nowhere. While Dhana is used widely in the Northern and Southern states it is agreed that everyone likes a bite of dhana in their bhajias and kababs but in curries, we love the mellow woody fragrance from the powder. Fresh ground is always better.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/anjali-koli-takes-people-to-a-masala-trail-928350.html

A three-judge bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah said the High Court in appropriate cases can very well under Section 482 of CrPC (inherent powers of high court) or in any other proceeding can always direct trial court to expedite the criminal trial and issue such order as may be necessary. "An application by a person who is in no way connected with the criminal proceeding or criminal trial under Section 482 CrPC cannot ordinarily be entertained by the High Court. "A criminal trial of an accused is conducted in accordance with procedure as prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Code. It is the obligation of the State and the prosecution to ensure that all criminal trials are conducted expeditiously so that justice can be delivered to the accused if found guilty," the bench said. The observation came on an appeal against a judgment of the Allahabad High Court which directed the trial court to expedite the criminal trial and conclude the same at the earliest. The Uttar Pradesh police had lodged a case against one Sanjay Tiwari in 2006 and filed a charge sheet after 14 years. The HC had ordered the lower court to speed up the trial on the plea of social activist Tripuresh Tripathi. The apex court said this was not a case where prosecution or even the employer of the accused have filed an application either before the trial court or in any other court. The apex court said it has held in earlier judgments that it is for parties in the criminal case to raise questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants.   The top court said in a criminal case, an outsider could not have any legal role.  “But the present is a case where proceedings initiated by Tripathi do not appear to be bona fide proceedings. He is in no way connected with initiation of criminal proceedings against the appellant,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hcs-cant-order-to-speed-up-trial-on-application-by-person-not-connected-with-case-supreme-court-928351.html

India's donation comes at a time when the country's anti-doping program has been adversely affected by suspension of its suspended National Dope Testing Laboratory, which is to be inspected by WADA early next year. The proposed funding will allow WADA to develop innovative anti-doping testing and detection methods. The money will also be used to further strengthen WADA’s independent Investigations and Intelligence Department. According to a statement issued by the Sports Ministry, "India's contribution of is the highest among contributions made by other world governments, including China, Saudi Arabia and Egypt." The total contribution of all member nations will be matched by an equal sum by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to create a corpus of USD 10 million. The release further stated that the decision to build this corpus was made at WADA's Fifth World Conference on Doping in Sport held in Katowice, Poland in 2019. This contribution is over and above the annual contribution made to WADA's core budget by India. "I am happy to share with you that the Government of India is pledging a 'one-off' financial support of USD 1 million to this WADA Fund for scientific R&D and (I&I) with the hope that this contribution from India will boost the efforts to achieve the target of USD 10 million for this fund," Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju wrote to WADA President Witold Banka. In a previous meeting with the WADA President, held on September 8, 2020, through video conference, Rijiju had stressed on the need for clean sport and the Indian government's commitment to strengthen the anti-doping programme globally. He had also requested WADA to lift the suspension on NDTL, asserting that that lab is now compliant with the world body's testing regulations. WADA thanked India for the contribution. "This is a massive boost for WADA and for Clean Sport. The agency is grateful to the Government of China, Egypt, India and Saudi Arabia for supporting the protection of sport in this way," WADA chief Witold Banka said. "These generous contributions can be seen as a strong commitment from these nations and will be put to good use enhancing scientific research, as well as the work of WADA's independent (I&I) department. "Both areas have delivered significant achievements in recent years and these additional resources will contribute greatly towards WADA's mission for doping-free sport."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pledges-1-million-to-wada-for-scientific-research-928356.html

The satellite, which has a life span of seven years, lifted off from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, 100 km from here, at 3.41 pm. After 20 minutes and 12 seconds, the rocket injected CMS-01 into its intended orbit. This is the second launch by ISRO this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The space plans of the ISRO hit a roadblock due to the lockdown that prolonged for a few months. After injection of the satellite in its orbit, the solar panels of CMS-01 were automatically deployed and ISRO’s Master Control Facility at Hassan has assumed control of the satellite. In the coming days, orbit raising manoeuvers will be executed to position the satellite in the Geostationary Orbit at its designated location, the space agency said. Congratulating scientists for the successful launch, ISRO Chairman Dr K Sivan appreciated the tireless efforts of both the satellite and launch vehicle teams in realising this mission amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. CMS-01 is a communication satellite envisaged for providing services in Extended-C Band of the frequency spectrum which will include Indian mainland, Andaman-Nicobar & Lakshadweep Islands. The ISRO chairman said the upcoming PSLV-C51 mission will mark the fruition of the space reforms recently introduced in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-launches-latest-communication-satellite-cms-01-on-board-polar-rocket-928367.html

The tally is only second to the United States, where over 1.7 crore people have so far tested positive for the disease. India's fatality and recovery rate stand at 1.45 and  95.40 per cent, respectively, making it the best in the world. While Kerala was the first state to register a person who tested positive for Covid-19 on January 30, Karnataka was the first state to record a fatality due to the disease, when on March 12, a 76-year-old man from Kalaburgi, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia tested positive and was admitted to a hospital. At the time, India's Covid-19 tally was 74 odd cases. Just three days later, on March 15, the country reached the 100-mark for total positive cases, and towards the end of the month posted an encouraging statistic - 100 recoveries from the virus, however, it had, by then, already crossed over 1,000 cases. It has been nearly ten months since the first Covid-19 case landed on Indian shores, and while fatality and recovery rates are encouraging, the pandemic is far from over. As India inches close to the 1-crore mark, here's a look at the states which were hit worst by the deadly virus. Total Cases With one of the highest population densities in the country, Maharashtra holds the record of registering the most number of Covid-19 cases. With a total of over 18.84 lakh cases infections, a large chunk of the cases emerged from the state's capital, Mumbai, where the total caseload has nearly hit 3 lakh. The state's total positives account for nearly 19% of India's Covid tally.  Karnataka has the second-highest number of positive Covid cases, albeit half of Maharashtra's tally. A big chunk of its tally of over 9.05 lakh like Maharashtra, stems from the capital city, Bengaluru, which accounts for 3.8 lakh cases. A surge of infections after Unlock-I saw the Covid tally skyrocket in Bengaluru (Urban), which accounts for nearly 42% of the state's Covid caseload. Andhra Pradesh, where over 8.77 lakh people have tested positive, has cases distributed across all its 13 districts, although the East Godavari district has the state's highest tally of 1,23,166 cases. Tamil Nadu with over 8 lakh confirmed cases has the fourth-highest number of cases in the country. Chennai, having recorded over 2.2 lakh cases so far, accounts for 27% of the state's caseload. In fifth place is Kerala, which has thus far recorded 6,83,441 positive cases. The state that recorded the country's first Covid-19 case in the end of January, has a caseload that accounts for 6.86% of India's near one-crore cases.   Fatalities Even as India's fatality rate is 1.45%, its total fatalities add up to 1,44,789. With the highest number of cases, Maharashtra also reported the highest number of deaths due to the coronavirus. Of the near-19 lakh people that tested positive, India's third-largest state saw close to 49,000 patients succumb to the coronavirus.  Karnataka saw the second-highest number of deaths in the country. In the state that witnessed the first death due to Covid-19, nearly 12,000 people of the total 9.05 lakh who tested positive died. Tamil Nadu also registered almost 12,000 deaths due to Covid-19 from a total positive case tally of a little over 8 lakh.  The national capital, which also witnessed a fatal second-wave amid terrible smog and pollution, saw nearly 10,200 people give in to the virus out of 6.1 lakh individuals tested positive. West Bengal, which has a relatively lower positive case total of 5.3 lakh, stood in the top five states with the highest number of deaths. Over 9,200 individuals lost their lives to Covid-19. Recoveries However, India's Covid-19 curve which looked steep in the first few months seems to have flattened out in the past few months. India's total recoveries now stand at 95,20,827, which is a recovery rate of 95.40%.  Among the states, Andhra Pradesh has the best recovery rate in the country, amassing a staggering 98.68 per cent. Next in line is Odisha, which has posted a recovery rate of 98.59%.  Tamil Nadu has registered a 97.29% recovery rate while Karnataka have put up a respectable recovery rate of 96.99%. Delhi, considered one of the worst-hit in the last few montsh owing to the virus underlined by low temperatures and shortage of hospital beds, showcased a recovery rate of 96.35%. While a number of states and union territories witnessed even better recovery rates, they also had some of the lowest case tallies. Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, for example, posted a recovery rate of 99.49%, but had only seen a total of  3361 positive Covid-19 test cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/as-indias-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-crore-heres-a-look-at-the-states-worst-hit-by-coronavirus-928376.html
17-12-2020||National||Highway dhabas wait for customers, count their losses as Covid-19 and farmers’ stir take a toll||The highway much-travelled is now the road hardly taken and scores of dhabas along the Delhi-Punjab route that once buzzed with truckers, tourists and others say their earnings are down by up to 90 per cent – done in by the coronavirus pandemic and now the 22-day farmers’ protest. The stretch of National Highway 44 that makes it way from Delhi to Haryana, Punjab and thereon to Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir is famed for its many eateries, necessary pitstops not just to stretch your legs but also to tuck into paranthas, ‘dal makhani’ and steaming cups of tea. But the road ahead is uncertain, putting a question mark on the future of the establishments and hundreds of employees who work in them. Several dhaba owners along the route said their earnings have reduced drastically with thousands of farmers occupying a 10-12 km stretch of the highway, starting from the Singhu gateway out of the national capital, as they demand a repeal of the Centre’s new farm laws. “Do you see anyone here? The situation has been the same since November 26, when farmers arrived at the Singhu border,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, pointing to the vast expanse of his Rasoi Dhaba. "We thought the farmers' protest would last two-three days. Now, we don't know how long it will continue. Our earnings have reduced by over 90 per cent. It will be difficult to pay full salaries... I cannot even send my workers home," Singh said as his employees stand in a circle around him. The huge, yellow-red hoardings of Rasoi Dhaba, a landmark along the Delhi-Karnal highway, are hard to miss. On another day, in what now seems a distant past, the place would be bustling with activity. Today, it’s mostly empty and the stoves in the kitchen are off. Four people sit in a distant corner of the 150-seater restaurant spread over one acre. "They are farmers. They come to sit for a while or use the toilets," Singh said. The restaurant employs around 60 workers belonging to different states and the salary bills amount to Rs 5 lakh a month. Singh is worried and so are his workers, wondering how they will manage if they don’t get their wages. "First, it was coronavirus. Now, the farmers'' protest. This has been a terrible year," said Gopal Bhim, 37, a worker from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh. The langar, the community kitchens that have come up at the protest site to feed the farmers, have taken the place of dhabas, he said. The highway continues, winding, long and mostly empty and there are many other eateries like Rasoi Dhaba that is now eerily quiet. The story of uncertainty, for employers and employees, turns many pages further down the road. About 3.5 kilometres away, Dhaba Bollywood is also empty. In another year, in another time, days leading up to Christmas and New Year would be occasion to string up fairy lights, rustle up some special dishes and even organise live music. "There is nothing this year. It’s a cold, quiet place now," said its manager Raj Kumar Dahiya. His earnings have reduced by 70 per cent and the number of employees has come down from 125 in March, when the nationwide lockdown started, to 50 now. "Our customers are those who travel to Delhi from Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The road is closed now. The traffic is being diverted from Bahalgarh village in Sonepat," he said. "First, it was Covid-19. Now, it is the farmers'' protest. It has been tough." Notwithstanding his economic woes, Dahiya said he is also a farmer and the protesters should get their due. No injustice should be done to anyone. The empathetic tone carries forward at Golden Hut, about 10 km from Singhu, where tractor-trolleys fill the parking area. The roadside restaurant, which has opened its toilets for farmers to use, has been incurring losses since it was inaugurated in June and sales are now down by 50 per cent. “Covid-19 messed up our start. We were barely back on the track that the agitation started,” General Manager Sachin Kapoor said. The farmers, he said, can rest at his premises and even get a discount on meals. Not far away is Balaji Ka Dhaba, which has had to shut its kitchen. As his staff stands in a group watching television, the owner, Chetan Prakash, said there is barely any work and they spend their time cleaning and talking to policemen deployed to maintain law and order. Prakash said he has been running the restaurant on a rented property for 13 years and 10 of his employees come from other states, including West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, and he may have to send them back home. "Zero," he said when asked about his earnings since November 26. He will manage to give salaries for December but will have to introduce cuts. His despondency finds an echo in Murthal, dominated by eateries on both sides of the highway that are famous for their stuffed paranthas and frequented not just by travellers but also those who drive down from Delhi just for a meal. Amrik Singh who runs the Amrik-Sukhdev dhaba said the number of customers has been steadily dipping since the farmers’ protest began. "People feel uncertain about the situation. They have changed their plans about trips to the hills due to farmers'' protest,” Singh said. Ravi Kumar, 62, was a frequent weekend visitor, driving down from Delhi for a day out in the ‘country’. “When the situation improved and Covid-19 restrictions eased, my wife and I planned a weekend lunch at a dhaba in Murthal in September. But then came news that many workers at a couple of eateries there had tested Covid-19 positive and we shelved our plan,” he said. “We planned a trip to Shimla for mid-December and intended to have lunch either at Murthal or Karnal, but again we had to postpone our plans due to the farmers’ stir,” he added.      Lekh Raj, the manager at Mannat Haveli, another well-known Murthal eatery, said they were hoping for a turnaround in business hit by Covid-19 but that hasn’t happened. At Zhilmil dhaba, the manager said their only new customers are farmers travelling to the protest site near Delhi and those returning home after spending at few days there. “We hope this issue gets resolved soon because already the Covid-19 thing earlier this year has badly hit trade,” he says. Farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various border points into Delhi in their push for a rollback of the three farm laws, which they say will eliminate the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Enacted in September, the laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/highway-dhabas-wait-for-customers-count-their-losses-as-covid-19-and-farmers-stir-take-a-toll-928379.html

Speaking to reporters, Yediyurappa said the state government would extend all support to the company for it to carry out its operations safely. “The government has initiated action. The incident was unfortunate and the state government would take all measures to ensure that such incidents do not recur,” Yediyurappa said. Last week, violence erupted at the Wistron factory premises at its Narasapura plant in Kolar. The incident was said to have been triggered over unpaid dues to workers. The police have arrested over 140 people in connection with the incident." The Centre has also stepped in with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) asking the government to complete its inquiry into the incident at the earliest. State Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar on Wednesday had said investigations into the violence were on and a report was likely in a couple of days. He expressed hope about the factory restarting production soon with the central government also involved in addressing issues. The Union Commerce and Industry Ministry has advised the state government to complete inquiry into the violence at the earliest and to ensure that investor sentiment was not affected by this one-off incident. Meanwhile, state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai in a tweet has said the Police has taken prompt action in connection with the incident and arrested 164 people. "The Wistron company which said Rs 437 crore loss earlier, now has in writing (said) that loss is Rs 43 crore, therefore, some international media is blowing (it) out of proportion," he said.

Tiwari, who was the Paschim Bardhaman district chief of the Trinamool Congress, hailed Suvendu Adhikari as the second-most important leader of the party after Mamata Banerjee. "I have resigned from the post of the chairman of the Board of Administrators of Asansol Municipal Corporation. If I am not allowed to work, what will I do with the post? So, I resigned," he told reporters in the afternoon. Hours later, he announced that he has also resigned from the primary membership of the party, giving up the post of district president. "There is no point in continuing in the TMC as I am not being allowed to work for the people," Tiwari alleged. However, he has not quit as the MLA of Pandabeswar. Tiwari wrote to state Municipal Affairs Minister Firhad Hakim a few days back, stating that the Asansol Municipal Corporation has been deprived of Rs 2,000 crore central funds as the state government had created hurdles in its selection in the smart city project. Training his guns at the minister, Tiwari said, "Sycophants like him are destroying the party." "The best way to save the party is Mamata Banerjee announcing Suvendu Adhikari as her successor. After her, Suvendu is the biggest mass leader in the TMC. If you deny the fact, then your defeat is imminent," he added. Asked if he would join the BJP, Tiwari said he will not speak about the matter in the press. He alleged that his MLA office was attacked after he resigned from the civic body, forcing him to quit the TMC. "I had earlier said that whatever I had to do, I will do after talking to Mamata Banerjee. But after I resigned from the Asansol Municipal Corporation, my MLA office was attacked. This was done on the instructions of a senior TMC leader. So I decided to quit the party," he said. He was supposed to meet the chief minister in Kolkata on Friday but is now unlikely to meet her, sources said. Tiwari met Adhikari, who quit the party and the government, at TMC MP Sunil Mandal's residence in the Kanksa area of the district on Wednesday evening, even as he skipped an earlier meeting with the party's leadership to iron out the differences. The Trinamool Congress called him a "traitor". "Who was Jitendra Tiwari, till a few years back? Whatever he is today, he is because of the party. Now if he is leaving the party, then he is nothing more than a traitor and a weathercock," TMC spokesperson Saugata Roy said. Tiwari recently also resigned from the board of governors of a college in Asansol.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mla-jitendra-tiwari-quits-tmc-hails-suvendu-928383.html

He was addressing the Annual Leadership Summit of the Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) here. “Private security industry will have a big role to play in the distribution of Coronavirus vaccine as it will be a big task for the government, police or officials to distribute and administer vaccine to 130 crore people across the country. With such a large workforce only security guards can ensure wider and faster distribution of vaccine and ensure that every household is covered in the vaccination programme,”(sic) said Reddy. He also ensured that the Home Ministry will discuss GST regime relaxation for the private security industry with the Union Finance Ministry. Speaking at the event, Vivek Bhardwaj, Additional Secretary at the MHA, said the Home Ministry would write to the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry to include private guards in the frontline workers list so that they could also be inoculated in the first phase of the vaccination programme. CAPSI Chairman Kunwar Vikram Singh said that the association has entered into tie-ups and agreements with various global agencies to improve the employability of private security guards globally.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-to-take-help-of-90-lakh-private-security-guards-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive-928404.html

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked the parties to file compiled written submissions and subject index in the matter. During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group claimed that there was a breach of Articles of Association and provisions of the Companies Act in the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016. The Tatas denied the allegations and claimed there was no wrongdoing as they were well within their rights to remove Mistry. The apex court had on January 10 granted relief to Tata group by staying the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order of December 18 last year by which Mistry was restored as the executive chairman of the conglomerate. Mistry had succeeded Ratan Tata as chairman of Tata Sons in 2012 but was ousted four years later on October 24, 2016. The top court on May 29 had issued notice to Tata Sons and others on a cross-appeal filed by Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd. Tata Sons had earlier told the top court that it was not a 'two-group company' and there was no 'quasi-partnership' between it and Cyrus Investments Pvt Ltd. Tata Sons had made the averments in an affidavit filed in the apex court while responding to the cross-appeal filed by Cyrus Investments seeking removal of alleged anomalies in the NCLAT order for getting representation on the TSPL's board in proportion to the stakes held by his family. Mistry had also filed an affidavit to the apex court saying the Tata Group had an adjusted net loss of Rs 13,000 crore in 2019 -- the worst losses in three decades. In his reply to the Tatas' petition challenging his reinstatement by the NCLAT last December, Mistry had also demanded that group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata should reimburse all the expenses to Tata Sons since his departure in December 2012 in keeping with best global governance standards. Mistry is seeking representation in the company in proportion to the 18.37 per cent stake held by his family, the cross-appeal has said. Reinstating Mistry as the chairman, the NCLAT had also termed the action of the Registrar of Companies to allow conversion of Tata Sons into a private limited company illegal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-reserves-judgment-in-tata-mistry-case-928418.html

"We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said. In a written order passed on a batch of petitions against on-going protest for affecting people's right to movement and essential supplies, the bench said, "We are of the view at this stage that the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police." During hearing the court, however, orally asked Attorney General K K Venugopal if the Union government can say no executive action will be taken under the three laws to facilitate the negotiations. Venugopal sought time to take instructions, though initially expressing difficulty. He maintained the farmers unions cannot say either repeal or will continue their protests indefinitely. "The damage caused by 22 days of blockade is enormous. People are not able to go for jobs. Ambulances are not permitted to move. Also there is risk of Corona virus. When protesters go back to their villages, they will spread coronavirus like wildfire," he said. Venugopal also complained that the farmers unions said they have come prepared for six months. "This kind of blockades cannot be permitted. This happens only during a war where you cut off supply etc and block borders," he said. Earlier, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for a petitioner, suggested that the court may pass an order directing the authorities and police to ensure that the life in city was not affected by the blockade. He said the protest was seriously inhibiting the supply of essential goods to the city, which would result into sharp increase of price rise. He said the fundamental right to protest cannot extend to holding the city to ransom. He asked the court to ensure the government put a protocol that a person calling for the protests will identify himself so that he can be held accountable for damages. The court, for its part, again suggested for forming an independent panel for "an effective solution to present stalemate". It broached up the name of noted journalist P Sainath for the purpose. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed that some persons of eminence could facilitate a talk. The court directed for serving a notice to various farmers Unions and indicated to put the matter for consideration before another bench during winter vacations, starting from Saturday. The court clarified that the petitions filed by DMK MP Tiruchi Siva and RJP Manoj K Jha against the validity of laws would be taken up subsequently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/right-to-protest-is-part-of-fundamental-right-sc-declines-to-intervene-into-farmers-protest-928436.html

The NIA Speical Court at Patiala House, New Delhi pronounced the judgement against Mohammad Naser on Wednesday. The case, registered by the NIA in December 2015 under sections of the IPC and UA(P) Act, pertains to the criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths for ISIS, a proscribed terrorist organisation, through different social media platforms. "As a result, a few known and other unknown Indian youths expressed their solidarity, allegiance and support to the ISIS in different forms and left India or their place of residence for abroad and joined ISIS under the influence of persistent indoctrination by their handlers," an NIA spokesperson said. After completion of investigation, the NIA filed chargesheets against 16 accused including Naser on June 3 this year. In this case, 15 accused were earlier sentenced to up to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by the NIA Special Court on October 16 this year for the conspiracy hatched by ISIS handlers based in Syria and subsequent formation of a group namely “Junood-ul-Khilafa-fil-Hind” owing its allegiance to ISIS. Naser, a BTech (IT) and certified Ethical Hacker from Chennai, was working as a Web Developer and Graphic Designer in Dubai in 2014, the NIA official said. He got radicalised and motivated to join ISIS through the lectures delivered on YouTube by Islamic scholars namely Anjem Choudary and Abu Barra, the official said. Naser was fully convinced that ISIS was following the true edicts of Islam and struggling to create a Caliphate, which will be governed on the basis of Sharia, the NIA official said. Hence, he made frantic efforts to find persons who could facilitate his travel to Syria/Libya for joining ISIS, the official said. On persistent efforts, he came across some online handlers and left Dubai to join ISIS/ISIL for Libya via Sudan, but, he was interdicted by the Sudanese authorities and deported to India in December 2015, according to the NIA official. After completion of investigation and subsequent trial, the NIA Special Court convicted Naser for the various offences committed by him and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for seven years and slapped a fine of Rs 40,000 on Wednesday, the official said. Trial continues against chargesheeted accused Imran Khan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/special-nia-court-jails-btech-graduate-from-chennai-in-isis-conspiracy-case-928441.html

The recent passenger and commercial vehicles come with GPS. The government is likely to announce steps to install GPS systems in old vehicles too. “We have thoroughly examined and finalized the GPS-based toll collection system with the help of the Russian government. And within 2 years, India would be toll booth-free. The GPS system will be used to track the vehicles and the due amount would be deducted from the respective bank accounts,” Gadkari said. He also said once the GPS based toll collection system introduced, the National Authority of India (NHAI) could attract a revenue of Rs 1.34 lakh crore in 5 years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-to-introduce-new-toll-collection-system-for-highways-gadkari-928450.html

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a media briefing the two sides continue to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels and these discussions have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other's positions. Asked about reports that at least one member of the Chinese Community Party was recruited by Indian consulate in Shanghai, Srivastava said he was not in a position to independently verify the information. "We have noted the media reports in this regard. We are not in a position to independently verify the data. In certain countries, hiring of local staff requires the approval of local authorities. However, all our missions and posts ensure due security precautions in this regard," he said. Responding to a media query on the matter, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said the allegation is "groundless". Srivastava, when asked about the next round of Sino-India military and diplomatic talks on the over seven-month-long border standoff, did not give a direct reply but said India expects that further talks will help in reaching an agreement for complete disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh. "It is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible," Srivastava said. Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff. China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May. The last round of military talks had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-expect-further-talks-will-help-in-achieving-agreement-on-resolution-india-on-ladakh-standoff-928451.html

A task force comprising representatives from the airline, hospitality and travel sectors have also urged the government to expand the travel bubble arrangements to allow tourists to visit India. The unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic has led to massive fall in demand for leisure and vacation travel and the sector was staring at a potential loss of 0.9-1.2 trillion dollars worldwide, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation has estimated. The task force of representatives from the airlines such as IndiGo, Vistara, GoAir, travel associations such as the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH), Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), and airport operators have been meeting government officials, seeking steps to revive the demand in the tourism sector. IATO and TAAI representatives have met officials in the ministries of Civil Aviation, Tourism and Home Affairs and also written to them to open up tourist visas, as it would give a much need push to struggling tourism and hospitality industry. Also, Air Travellers Association (ATA), in a letter to Minister of Civil Aviation  Hardeep Singh Puri, requested the government for resumption of all visas, including Business, Tourist and Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) categories, the inclusion of more countries into air bubble agreement and opening of international travel in a phased manner. Pre-Covid lockdown, leisure and holiday travel was the biggest segment of travellers accounting for approximate 20.3 million annually, which was approximately  41% of the total traffic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pandemic-hit-travel-sector-urges-centre-to-resume-tourist-visas-928453.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian would consider the three separate petitions filed by Karnataka government and Baskar and Dr B R Ambedkar Dalita Sangharsha Samiti against the High Court's judgement of December 4. Karnataka HC had also directed for holding the BBMP polls as expeditiously as possible by publishing the election programme within the maximum period of six weeks. The petitioners, for their part, questioned the validity of the HC's directions, saying the state legislature has already passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2020 to increase the seats for Councillors from 198 to 243 by a notification on January 14, 2020. This was done to give due representation to Scheduled Castes and other marginalised communities in the municipal council of a large and growing city like Bengaluru, they pleaded. The petitioners also contended the HC passed "erroneous" judgement on a writ petition filed by State Election Commission and others. The SEC neither had any locus standi nor authority to file a writ petition against validly enacted legislation. It had rather no choice but to give effect to the amendment, they said. The SEC, for its part, claim the Delimitation Commission had yet not submitted its recommendation for dividing the corporation into 243 wards and the exercise would take considerable time to complete. The term of BBMP corporation expired on September 10, 2020, not due to inactivity of the state but in view of the prevalent pandemic, the petitioners claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-karnataka-governments-plea-on-bbmp-polls-challenging-high-courts-order-928459.html

Keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a $5 trillion economy in the next five years, the government is targeting to invest Rs 25 lakh crore in the road sector, he said. Two major highway projects – Amritsar-Ajmer and Delhi-Amritsar-Katra - worth Rs 65,000 crore were also being planned, he said. The minister added that the government is committed to providing a favourable environment and a transparent policy framework for investors and that he is confident that India will become a major global investment destination. Several reforms introduced by the government including reduction of corporate tax rates, 100% tax exemption to investors, and implementation of GST have positioned India as a competitive market in the world, particularly in terms of ease of paying taxes, he said. "The Government is also planning to expand the contribution of the MSMEs from the current 30% to 40% of the GDP,” Gadkari added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-plans-invest-rs-111-lakh-crore-in-infrastructure-projects-under-nip-gadkari-928461.html

"There has been a 55 per cent hike in steel prices in the past six months. I have written to PM and Steel Minister (Dharmendra Pradhan) for a decision on this," Gadkari said while addressing the ASSOCHAM Foundation Week on 'national infrastructure pipeline critical for economic revival across sectors. Had the price hike been in the range of 15-20 per cent, it could have been justified but it was abysmally high. Producers should curb the practice of exorbitant hike of prices, otherwise the government will have to change policies and encourage alternative technologies in projects. Too much costly steel makes the project unviable, he said. "A long-term policy is needed for steel and cement manufactures. A uniform policy," he said and added that "They can enhance productivity and earn profit. Else, projects will become unviable," he said and elaborated that steel and cement accounted for 40 per cent of the project cost. Alternatives are being explored for steel like Malaysian ad Singapore technology. Earlier, when cement makers started profiteering, the government had to stop 100 per cent concrete road-building and revert to bitumen model, he said. "Exorbitant hike of steel prices is not good for infrastructure and real estate," he said. The Minister also said a GPS-based system will be introduced for toll collection with Russian expertise where toll amount will be deducted from the commuter account or e-wallet on the basis of distance traversed. This will be rolled out within two years, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-cautions-steel-makers-against-profiteering-928463.html

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the national capital is one of the sites conducting the final phase of the trial of the vaccine, "Covaxin", and it needs around 1,500 volunteers for the purpose. Covaxin has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). "We wanted 1,500-2,000 participants but so far, we have been able to recruit only around 200 participants. People are unwilling to participate in the exercise thinking why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon for everyone," Dr Sanjay Rai, professor in the department of community medicine at the AIIMS and also the principal investigator of the study, said. He said volunteers are opting out when the procedure, about it being a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in which 50 per cent would be administered the shot while the other 50 per cent would receive the placebo, is being explained to them. "People are refusing to participate in the clinical trial after knowing about the procedure, saying why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon," Dr Rai said. He said when the phase-1 trial was to begin, they needed 100 participants but received over 4,500 applications. Even during the phase-2 trial, the hospital received around 4,000 applications. Dr Rai said people should come forward to participate in the trial and they are planning to raise awareness through advertisements, e-mails and phone calls on why it is important to take part in the clinical trial to get a safe and efficacious vaccine. According to the "Covid-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines", which have been issued to the states by the Centre recently, the Covid-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 50 years of age, followed by those below 50 years of age with associated comorbidities, based on the evolving pandemic situation, and finally, to the remaining population, based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability. The priority group of above 50 years may further be subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 and 60 years of age for phasing of the rollout, based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability. "The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections will be used to identify the population aged 50 years or more," the guidelines stated. In the first phase of the vaccination, it is planned to vaccinate nearly 30 crore people. Twelve photo-identity documents, including Voter ID card, Aadhaar card, driving licence, passport and pension documents will be required for self-registration on the Co-WIN website.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aiims-unable-to-find-required-number-of-volunteers-for-phase-3-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-928465.html

Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points for the last 22 days to press for repeal of the Centre's new farm laws. An official of the Madhya Pradesh Public Relations Department on Thursday said the PM would address the farmers in the state around 2 pm. The MP government has organised a state-level 'Kisan Kalyan' event in Raisen district, wherein Chief Minister Shivraj Singh will transfer the relief amount of Rs 1,600 crore into the bank accounts of nearly 35.50 lakh farmers for the damaged kharif crops, the official said. Nearly 20,000 farmers will take part in the state-level programme in Raisen, he added. "After the chief minister's speech, PM Modi will address the farmers of the state around 2 pm through video conference and explain to them in detail the beneficial provisions of the new agricultural laws," he said. Meanwhile, the chief minister on Thursday reviewed the preparations for the four-tier Kisan Kalyan programme and directed the collectors of all districts to make necessary arrangements for the event and ensure that information about it reaches the cultivators. Similar events will also be organised at district, block and panchayat levels in the state, the official added.

The notice has been sent to Johar to check the video's veracity, an NCB official said. The central agency is conducting an anti-drugs probe that began in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June this year. The video, which also shows several top stars, is being investigated as part of NCB's probe, the official said. The NCB had received a complaint regarding the video of a party, which was attended by top Bollywood stars last year, the official said. The complaint was about movie stars apparently seen in a 'drugged' state in the video. Shiromani Akali Dal leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa had sent the video to NCB and his complaint was marked to the agency's Mumbai zonal unit, the official said. After the video went viral, Johar had issued a public statement in connection with that video, saying reports of drug consumption at his party were slanderous and malicious.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/drugs-case-ncb-issues-notice-to-karan-johar-over-viral-video-928470.html

Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya represented Twitter Communications India Pvt Ltd.  The plea claimed Vinit Goenka, former National Co-Convener of the BJP IT cell and other complainants alleged that Twitter had taken financial consideration to promote Pannun's tweet, but the micro-blogging site had already disabled the tweet and suspended his account.  Twitter said Goenka launched a public smear campaign against it alleging the platform is anti-India and operating against the sovereignty of the country.  The plea said given Goenka’s political stature and the provocative nature of his public exhortations, he has been able to successfully campaign to encourage the filing of criminal complaints against Twitter India.   Citing Arnab Goswami case, Twitter also sought consolidation of all FIRs filed against it into one complaint at Tinsukia.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-seeks-centre-states-reply-on-plea-by-twitter-to-quash-firs-928473.html

The development comes days after the varsity's search committee had sealed the name for the post. The institute, which completed 100 years of existence in October, had announced Rajendra Khimani, former registrar and currently the honorary director at the institute, as the new VC to replace Anamik Shah, who is completing his second term next month. The decision to put the appointment on "hold" was taken on Thursday following a meeting of varsity's trustees, which was convened in the "extraordinary circumstances" arose due to the objection raised by the Ministry of Education (MoE) earlier known as the Ministry of Human Resource Department. Officials said the varsity was forced to take this "embarrassing" decision after it received a communication from MoE last week, which raised objections in the manner in which the selection committee was set up to choose the new VC. The communication has stated that the search-cum-selection committee didn't have a Central government's representative as mandated in a Memorandum of Association (MoA), February 2019. The MoA states: "Vice-Chancellor shall be an eminent academic and shall be appointed by the Chancellor on the recommendation of a search-cum-selection committee consisting of a nominee of the government who shall be nominated in the consultation with the UGC, a nominee of the Chancellor and that of the Board of Management." However, Vidyapith "ignored" the rule by not asking the Central government's representative in the committee. Confirming the development, Vidyapith's registrar Bharat Joshi told DH: "We have kept the decision of the selection committee on hold and have asked the MHRD (MoE) to decide its representative to be part of the committee. Once it is decided, we will see the next course of action. But for the time being, the decision (to make Khimani as new VC) has been kept on hold." Once known for providing space to voices against the establishment, Vidyapith in recent years has ceased to be what it stood for. During the protest against the controversial citizenship law, the varsity officials allowed the police to enter the campus and detain students who had planned to stage a protest. It has also been denying its space to groups which are critical of the present government. The campus still practices Gandhian ideas, including khadi dress code. One of the conditions for the vice-chancellor aspirants is that he or she must be a "habitual khadi-wearer." A few years ago, it bent the rule by accommodating a person who is willing to wear khadi once appointed for the office. Its students are known for spinning charkha to mark their protest. Officials said the varsity is also in deep financial crisis as the University Grants Commission is not releasing entire funds for the past seven to eight months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mahatma-gandhi-founded-gujarat-vidyapiths-decision-on-a-new-vc-put-on-hold-after-centres-objection-928474.html

We have been negotiating it for some time...To my mind, it is a mistake, RCEP allowed a very long adjustment period," he said.         Ahluwalia blamed substantial lobbying by small and inefficient industries for India's decision to pull out of the RCEP.         "This is only the result of substantial lobbying by small and inefficient industries ... We should join RCEP as soon as possible," he asserted.         The eminent economist also pointed out that before 1991, India's policies were described as protectionist.          "We went down the trade liberalisation route and did well. India grew rapidly after 1991. We did very well in terms of growth, we also did very well in reducing poverty," he said.         "Somewhat we appear to be stepping back, in the last 3-4 years, there have been increases in tariffs," he added.       Ahluwalia noted that India failed to create high-quality jobs in manufacturing.            The RCEP deal signed in November comprised 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and five of the bloc's dialogue partners -- China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.          India, one of the leading consumer-driven market in the region, pulled out of talks last year, concerned that the elimination of tariffs would open its markets to a flood of imports that could harm local producers.         The RCEP was first proposed in 2012 and loops in 10 ASEAN economies- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia- along with China, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pulling-out-of-rcep-a-mistake-india-should-join-bloc-as-soon-as-possible-montek-singh-ahluwalia-928485.html

He made these remarks at a virtual event of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). The theme of the event was "Build Back Better: building resilient health infrastructure and supply chains", a health ministry statement said. Speaking on the Covid trajectory in India, Vardhan said, "It has been almost one year since the outbreak of Covid-19. While the caseload infection in many parts of the world is decreasing, many others are experiencing a second or even a third peak. Fortunately, in India, the cases are steadily coming down. We recognised the threat early and pursued a scientific evidence-based approach." Highlighting the steps taken by India to handle the unprecedented humanitarian crisis, he stated, "Our first step was to expand our present capacities swiftly, whether it was for testing, PPE production, or hospital beds. We looked at the problem in greater granularity and scaled up at an incredible pace." "We also repurposed our capacities from multiple research disciplines across a wide range of public and private institutions. We repurposed defence research capacities for quickly erecting hospitals with enhanced capacity. From being an importer of PPEs before the pandemic, India is now a net exporter of PPEs.  We scaled up our testing capacity from a few hundred tests per day to a million tests per day. The nimbleness that the Indian research institutions have shown needs to be not only preserved but also encouraged," he was quoted as saying in the statement. Vardhan also detailed on how effective communication strategy has been a cornerstone of the approach. "We have used every possible means to mobilise everyone. The prime minister himself has led this effort and addressed the citizens directly. He has also emphasised the spirit of cooperative federalism, wherein the state and central governments worked hand in hand at each stage," he said. Emphasising upon the multipronged approach to combat Covid, the minister said, "Apart from this, we recognised early that while the health sector has to be at the forefront of combating Covid-19, it requires involvement of all of the government functions - disaster management, industry, civil aviation, shipping, pharmaceuticals, and environment and so on. We innovated early on to establish an institutional platform in the form of 'empowered groups' to bring together these multi-sectoral functions in a cohesive manner." He also commented, "We made innovative use of a range of digital technologies to track, monitor and control the disease. In a country like India - with a large digital divide - we had to ensure that we use a judicious mix of different technologies so that no one is left behind." Vardhan said, "I believe that some of the good practices that have been developed in many countries of the world during the pandemic need to be institutionalised. We do not need to reinvent these in the future. At the same time, we have to think about how we could have done this better. We need a deeper conversation about what 'building back better' in the context of public health infrastructure would mean!..." Reiterating that disaster resilience is an essential area of common interest globally, he stated, "Over the past decades, India and nations of the world have seen unprecedented progress in economic and human development. However, as Covid-19 has shown, all of this notable progress is at risk if we do not make our systems resilient. The key lesson from the pandemic is that the principles of resilience must be integral to our quest for economic growth as individual nations and the international community. "Our lives and livelihoods may very well depend on it. In doing so, we have to make our systems resilient to not only pandemics but all types of risks, including those emerging from the effects of climate change." He added, "We must forge a global dialogue and chart directions for a resilient future for humanity at large. This would be the most worthy tribute to our people - particularly health workers, emergency responders, frontline workers - who have put the world's safety before their own personal safety."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-recognised-covid-19-threat-early-pursued-scientific-evidence-based-approach-vardhan-928487.html

With the Supreme Court now taking note of the farmer agitation and the Centre's strategy of "no repeal and fresh appeal" strategy not working, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar wrote a letter to farmers giving a fresh assurance about the continuance of minimum support price (MSP) after Home Minister Amit Shah huddled with senior ministers and BJP general secretaries to find a way out of the stalemate. The Supreme Court on Thursday acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and suggested that the Centre put on hold the implementation of the three contentious laws. However, sections in the government believe that efforts should be made not to withdraw the laws and allay the fears of farmers by keeping open the doors of dialogue. Tomar, in his letter, addressed to "farmer brothers and sisters", insisted that the farm laws will lay the foundation of a new chapter in Indian agriculture, he also had a separate meeting with farmer producer Organisations (FPOs) and tweeted about their "support to farm reform laws". The government-issued e-book - 'Putting Farmers First' - highlighting the success stories of farmers who benefited from contract farming after enactment of these legislations, to buttress the point that farm laws are not against the interests of farmers who are protesting on Delhi border for the last 22 days. The booklet sought to project the new laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the agriculture minister has attempted a "polite dialogue" with the farmers. "My request to all Annadatas is that they must read it," he said. After Shah's meeting, which went for over an hour, at the BJP head office on Thursday was attended by Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal, Narendra Singh Tomar and party's general secretaries C T Ravi, Dushyant Gautam and Arun Singh among others, Tomar issued a letter. BJP has got into a real mess over the farm protest issue, with its own allies deserting it or asking it to act on the demand of farmers. There is a realisation in the government and the party that the agitation cannot be allowed to linger on for long and pressure is mounting on them to end the standoff. BJP's plans to explain the government's side of story Having burnt its fingers twice on farm issues in past--in 2015 over land bill ordinance and over Mandsaur police firing in 2017, BJP is not taking the farmers protest this time lying down and has organised outreach programmes through press conferences and chaupals (small open public meetings) at district levels. This is an attempt to communicate to people and farmers the government's side of the story on the new farm laws and to allay apprehensions. The party will be holding 700 press conferences and 700 small public meetings. While the Supreme Court on Thursday acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and suggested that the Centre put on hold the implementation of the three contentious agri laws, there is a view in the government that efforts should still be made not to withdraw the laws and allay the apprehensions of farmers by keeping open the doors of dialogue.   NCP on Thursday joined other Opposition parties in demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi convene a special session of Parliament to address the concerns of the agitating peasants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farm-laws-bjp-centre-in-catch-22-as-farmer-protests-set-to-enter-23rd-day-928488.html

In an apparent attack on the left parties, the minister said they were still speaking the language they used in 1962 when India went to war with China. The minister, in an eight-page open letter to farmers, said the Modi-government was committed to their welfare and stressed that the new legislations were aimed at benefitting small and marginal farmers. Assuring that the minimum support price (MSP) will continue and the existing mandi system will be strengthened, the minister appealed to the farmers to dismiss "white lies being spread by politically motivated people". Tomar, who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, asserted that there were no provisions in these laws for corporate firms to take control of farmers' lands. "Many farmers' unions have supported farm laws. But some farmer groups have created confusion. Being an agriculture minister, it is my duty to remove misconceptions and address concerns of every farmer. It is also my duty to expose the conspiracy being hatched around Delhi and present the truth and facts before you," he said in the letter. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi's borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between three Union ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock. The unions, however, are demanding complete roll back of the central laws. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. In the open letter, Tomar highlighted that the government in the last six years has taken various measures to boost farmers' income and make the agriculture sector profitable, including cash transfers under the PM-KISAN scheme and Rs 1 lakh crore agri-infrastructure fund. Stating that about 80 per cent of Indian farmers are small with landholdings of 1-2 acres, Tomar said these three laws will benefit them as it gives them freedom to sell their produce outside the APMC mandis. "It is imperative to understand the conspiracy being hatched by some political parties and organisations. It is unfortunate for the country that some intellectuals, claiming to be neutral, are shamelessly speaking contrary to their earlier positions," he said. Tomar said he wondered how the Congress government, which did not implement the Swaminathan panel report for 8 years, has started talking about welfare of farmers. He said the Congress in its election manifesto had talked about providing alternative avenues for the sale of farm produce. He also attacked the AAP and Akali Dal for change of their stance with regard to reform in the agriculture marketing system. Tomar also criticised some farmer unions, who had earlier welcomed these new laws but now have joined the protests. The minister cautioned the farmers about the entry of people and organisations that have nothing to do with farming and are "trying to spread anarchy and fuel discontent". Such elements, he said, were taking advantage of the farm agitation to pressurise the government to release people accused of spreading violence from prison. He said some people even desecrated the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the name of farmers' protest. The minister said people should understand the motives of those persons who are asking consumers to boycott products of domestic companies at a time when the country was moving towards becoming self-reliant following the government's call for 'vocal for local'. Tomar said the people who stopped trains from carrying supplies for army personnel deployed in Leh and Ladakh cannot be called as farmers. The government had to spend taxpayers' money on transporting supplies to army through air and other modes, he added. Farmers should ponder what was the aim when they started the agitation and what is being talked about now, he said. "Through this letter, I appeal to farmers with folded hands not to fall prey to any falsehood and think on factual basis only," the minister said, while asserting that these new laws would lay the foundation of a new chapter to strengthen farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-fall-prey-to-lies-of-opposition-on-new-farm-laws-agri-min-tomar-in-open-letter-to-farmers-928490.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart in Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, formally restored a defunct rail-link between Haldibari in West Bengal and Chilahati in the neighbouring country. The two governments also inked seven pacts on the sideline of a virtual summit between the leaders. The pacts included one on cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector and another for India’s support for implementation of community development projects in Bangladesh. A bilateral protocol on transboundary elephant conservation and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation in agriculture were also inked on the sideline of the virtual summit between the two leaders. India offered Bangladesh collaboration in therapeutics and partnership in production of Covid-19 vaccine. New Delhi’s move to reach out to Dhaka and consolidate bilateral development and connectivity cooperation amid China’s renewed bid to expand its geo-political influence in the neighbourhood of India, including in Bangladesh. The two Prime Ministers stressed on “importance of safe, speedy and sustainable return” of the Rohingyas from the refugee camps in Bangladesh to Myanmar. Modi lauded the generosity of Bangladesh in sheltering and providing humanitarian assistance to the 1.1 million “forcibly displaced persons” from the Rakhine State of Myanmar. Hasina expressed “Bangladesh’s expectation to see India assist in the repatriation of the forcibly displaced Rohingyas back to Myanmar”, according to a joint statement issued after the virtual summit between the two leaders. New Delhi invited Bangladesh Government to join the New Development Bank launched by the BRICS – a bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Dhaka expressed keen interest in the ongoing India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway project and sought support of New Delhi for enabling Bangladesh to connect with this project with a view to enhance connectivity between the regions of South and South East Asia. New Delhi also requested Dhaka to allow connectivity from West Bengal (Hilli) to Meghalaya (Mahendraganj) via Bangladesh. Hasina once again nudged Modi to convince West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to lift her objection to the proposed interim agreement for sharing of the waters of the common river Teesta. Though the agreement was finalized in 2011, it could not be signed due to objections from the West Bengal Government. Modi reassured Bangladesh Prime Minister of continued efforts of the Government of India to clear the hurdles for signing of the agreement. They underscored the need for early conclusion of Framework of Interim Agreement on sharing of waters of six other common rivers, namely, Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-hasina-summit-india-moves-to-expand-trade-and-economic-engagement-with-bangladesh-928495.html

The Rs 10,500 crore proposal to develop half-a-dozen advanced airborne early warning and control system (AWACS) using the six Airbus planes as the platform has been approved by the Defence Acquisition Council headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh as the Centre tweaks an earlier plan to boost India’s air surveillance capability. This is one of the seven proposals worth Rs 28,000 crores that were approved by the DAC giving a boost to the Make-in-India programme. Six of the seven projects worth Rs 27,000 crore would be sourced from Indian industry, a defence ministry spokesperson said. The most crucial of the seven projects is the indigenous AWACS programme, which would uplift India’s ability to keep a watch on the neighbourhood from the air. Currently, the forces rely on three IL-76 based vintage Phalcon AWACS and two home-made Netra air-borne radar mounted on Embraer Emb-145 platforms with limited ability. The Netra system – developed by the DRDO after nearly two decades - has limitations in terms of vision and capability. Unlike the 360 degrees vision of the Israeli Phalcon AWACS, the indigenous Netra can’t see all around as its radar has only 240 degrees coverage. In contrast, China has nearly 20 airborne radars with 360 degrees view whereas Pakistan has eight such platforms. To overcome the shortfall, the Centre in 2015 sanctioned two brand new AWACS based on the Airbus’s much bigger A330 platforms. The plan was to convert the aircraft and deliver them to the forces by 2024-25. That scheme has now been replaced with the new programme where smaller A320 family aircraft would be used. The new AWACS would be equipped with advanced sensors and avionics, making them much superior surveillance platforms in the air. The aircraft would be sent to the Airbus unit at France where the modifications would be carried out and the AWACS would be delivered to the forces 4-7 years after the commercial contract is signed. Other projects that received DAC’s approval include indigenous manufacturing of six more Next Generation Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Indian Navy taking the total number of such vessels to 11 and modular bridges for the Indian Army.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/defence-ministry-allows-drdo-to-convert-six-a320-family-aircraft-into-advanced-airborne-radar-928498.html
17-12-2020||National||For every one Covid-19 case detected, Karnataka missed 90; 60% of Indians exposed to coronavirus by now||For every Covid-19 positive case it detected, Karnataka missed 90 cases while more than 80 crore Indians may have been exposed to the virus by now even though most of them don’t have any symptoms. These are the new findings of an Indian Covid-19 supermodel, which in its latest run with data till December 13, has found that nearly 60% of the Indian population may have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, making it harder for the virus to find susceptible individuals. Also, there was an uptick in the numbers in November, but the rise was not as much as feared, according to the model created by a group of scientists put together by the Department of Science and Technology. "This may be an explanation why India never saw a second surge in the epidemic as apprehended. This, however, is only a finding of our model and there is no independent validation," mathematician Manindra Agrawal, dean at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and one of the members of the DST team told DH. Why India never witnessed a second peak remains a scientific puzzle while such a surge has already been seen in the USA, Spain, Turkey, UK and Brazil. Going by the supermodel’s prediction in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, for every detected Covid positive case, there have been around 300 individuals who escaped the surveillance net. Delhi and Kerala have much lower ratios as opposed to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar indicating a possible variation in how the virus is affecting people in different regions. The national average is 1:90, which is the same as Karnataka's.  This, however, didn’t mean a flaw in the existing surveillance system, Agrawal explained. These individuals may not be having any symptoms and were unaware of their Covid status. Besides Agarwal, the supermodel team includes former DRDO scientist M Vidyasagar, who is currently the chairman of IIT Hyderabad governing council; Gagandeep Kang of Christian Medical College, Vellore; Lt Gen Madhuri Kanitkar a senior medical officer from the Defence Ministry, Biman Bagchi of Indian Institute of Science and Arup Bose and Sankar Pal from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. They also predicted that the epidemic in India would taper off by February 2021. The model, however, attracted criticism from several scientists for the methods adopted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/for-every-one-covid-19-case-detected-karnataka-missed-90-60-of-indians-exposed-to-coronavirus-by-now-928503.html

The issue figured prominently at a virtual meeting of the India-Australia joint working group on counter-terrorism. "India and Australia strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and emphasised the need for strengthening international cooperation to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner. Both sides condemned the use of terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism," a joint statement issued after the meeting said. It said both sides underlined their commitment to coordinate and collaborate to counter terrorism in sync with the comprehensive strategic partnership established by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison at their virtual summit in June. "The two sides reviewed threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasised the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks," the statement said, adding that views were exchanged on proscription of terrorists and entities as a tool to combat terrorism. "Australia reiterated its condemnation of terrorist attacks in India, including 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot and Pulwama and reiterated its support for the people and the government of India in the fight against terrorism," it said. The two sides underlined the urgent need for all countries to take immediate, sustained, verifiable and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under their control is used for terrorist attacks and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, the statement said. Both sides also exchanged views on various areas of cooperation in the sphere of counter-terrorism including confronting radicalisation and violent extremism, combating financing of terrorism and ways to enhance information sharing. They also discussed counter-terror cooperation in multilateral forums such as the United Nations, G20, Global Counterterrorism Forum, ASEAN Regional Forum and Financial Action Task Force. The Indian side was led by Mahaveer Singhvi, Joint Secretary for Counter Terrorism in the Ministry of External Affairs while the Australian delegation was headed by Tony Sheehan, Deputy Secretary of International Security, Humanitarian and Consular Group in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-australia-take-a-swipe-at-pakistan-condemn-use-of-terrorist-proxies-for-cross-border-terrorism-928518.html

"The Trust chose January 26, 2021 for laying the foundation stone of the Ayodhya mosque as on this day our Constitution came into effect over seven decades ago. Our Constitution is based on pluralism, which is the leitmotif of our mosque project," said Athar Hussain, secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF). The IICF was set up by the Sunni Waqf Board six months ago to build the mosque. The blueprint of the mosque complex, which will include a multi-specialty hospital, a community kitchen and a library, will be unveiled by the IICF on December 19 as the plan for the project has been finalised by its chief architect, Professor S M Akhtar. "The mosque will have a capacity to hold 2,000 namazis at a time, and the structure will be round-shaped," Akhtar told PTI. The Supreme Court on November 9 last year had paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the town in Uttar Pradesh. The state government allotted a five-acre land in Dhannipur village in Sohaval Tehsil of Ayodhya. "The new mosque will be bigger than Babri Masjid, but won't be a lookalike of the structure. The hospital will take centre stage in the complex. It will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the Prophet in his last sermon 1,400 years ago," Akhtar said. "The hospital won't be a usual concrete structure but will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed specialty unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing," he said, adding that "the mosque will be self-efficient for power as it is designed based on solar energy and a natural temperature maintenance system." "When we talk about the hospital project at Dhannipur, one thing is sure that it will be a multi-specialty hospital," Hussain said. The community kitchen will serve good quality meals twice a day to cater to the needs of nourishment of the poor people living nearby, he added. "We can establish a nursing and paramedic college to provide human resources to the hospital. We can manage doctors from local resources from Faizabad, and for specialised needs in terms of critical surgeries, we have a group of doctor friends in prominent government and private institutions who want to offer their services," he said. "We are looking forward to corporate funding for the hospital. There are many donors who are willing to contribute when we have 80 G approval. After that, we will go for FCRA and seek foreign funds from Muslims of Indian origin," the IICF secretary added. The Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992 by "kar sevaks" who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/foundation-stone-for-ayodhya-mosque-to-be-laid-on-republic-day-blueprint-to-be-unveiled-this-week-928290.html
17-12-2020||National Politics||Winter Session cancelled to evade discussion on farmers' protests: Shiv Sena||Criticising the Centre's decision not to hold the winter session of Parliament, the Shiv Sena on Thursday claimed the Union government wants to evade discussion on issues like the ongoing farmers' protest, country's economic situation and border standoff with China. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said the session has been cancelled so that the Opposition does not get an opportunity to ask questions on these issues. "What democratic practice is this? The country will remain alive only if voices from the opposition benches are strong in a democracy. The democratic traditions in Parliament inspire the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must follow these traditions," it said. The central government recently conveyed to the Opposition that the winter session of Parliament will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the budget session will be convened in January 2021. "The Covid-19 did not stop election of a big democratic country in the world. But we are not allowing (even) four-day winter session of Parliament. "The US held polls and changed the guard in a democratic manner. This is the democracy of the super power; (while) we locked the supreme temple of democracy," the editorial said. Referring to the Maharashtra BJP unit's criticism of the state government over holding a curtailed, two-day, winter session of the Legislature due to Covid-19, it said the BJP's views on democracy change "as per its convenience". The Marathi publication said Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi had talked about having spoken to all parties on not holding the winter session. When and where the discussion was held? it asked. "Prime Minister Modi and his colleagues inspire people to fight Covid-19, but are leaving the ground when it comes to themselves?," it alleged. Citing Covid-19 to cancel Parliament session is a "sham" as Modi himself addressed campaign rallies during the recent Bihar Assembly polls, the editorial said. It also referred to BJP president J P Nadda's visits to West Bengal, which goes to polls next year. "People in the BJP took to streets several times seeking reopening of temples (in Maharashtra), but for them to think about not opening the supreme temple of democracy must be said is a kind of pretension," the Shiv Sena alleged. All other people are going to work, but those running the country have "locked" Parliament fearing Covid-19, it said. "Why this rule is limited only to Parliament session? (We) should get answer about whether jawans deployed on border, too, should return home due to Covid-19," it said. The editorial asked why a new Parliament building is being constructed if the Lok Sabha is to be "locked" due to Covid-19. "Rs 900 crore will be spent on constructing the new Sansad Bhavan, is it for locking from outside?" it asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/winter-session-cancelled-to-evade-discussion-on-farmers-protests-shiv-sena-928299.html
17-12-2020||National Politics||Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says 'India is true friend' as both countries sign 7 pacts||Premier Sheikh Hasina on Thursday told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India is Bangladesh’s true friend and expressed her gratitude to the country for the support during the 1971 liberation war against Pakistan, as the two countries signed seven agreements to enhance bilateral ties. Addressing a virtual summit with Modi, Hasina said that she is happy to meet her Indian counterpart again, “particularly on this month of victory”. On Wednesday, Bangladesh celebrated the 49th anniversary of its victory against Pakistan. Bangladesh won the war against Pakistan on December 16, 1971 with Indian support. “December evokes in all Bangladeshis the spirit of joy, freedom and celebration as we recall with deep gratitude our ‘Father of the Nation’ Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Under whose dynamic leadership we earned our great independence,” she said. “India is our true friend,” the Bangladesh Prime Minister said. During the summit, India and Bangladesh signed seven agreements to expand cooperation in diverse areas, and restored a cross-border rail link which was in operation till 1965. Seeking enhanced integrated ties with India to move up to the regional and global value chains, Prime Minister Hasina said: “I believe both our countries can move up the global and regional value chains by further integrating our economies taking advantage of available synergies. “We believe India will play an even more important role in the global economy through your policies taken”. She said that the two economies appeared to have developed a growing inter-dependence as a huge number of Indians are employed in Bangladesh's manufacturing and service sectors while India receives its "highest number of tourists and medical patients from Bangladesh”. “We happily recognise the growing mutual dependency of the economies of Bangladesh and India," Hasina said. She described the ongoing connectivity initiatives between the two next-door neighbours as a catalyst to enhance economic and trade ties. The two premiers reopened the railway connectivity on the route between India's Cooch Behar and Bangladesh's northwestern Chilahati, 55 years after it was stalled during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. Hasina mentioned that throughout 2020, the two countries witnessed a number of initiatives such as trade through railway routes, high-level visits and meetings, capacity-building initiatives, the first trial run of Indian cargo from Kolkata to northeast India and above all, cooperation on Covid-19. She said that Bangladesh’s relations with India have embarked on a "landmark moment" coinciding with the 50th year of establishment of bilateral ties. “Yesterday (Wednesday), Bangladesh celebrated 50 years as an independent nation. Bangladesh and India have also stepped into the 50th year of establishment of diplomatic relations,” she said. Hasina said that Bangladesh's founder Bangabandhu’s birth centenary celebrations were underway while "just a few months ago, we concluded celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of your Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi”. "In Bangladesh, we released a special postal stamp as a mark of tribute to Bapuji,” she said. Hasina conveyed her gratitude for India's “so spontaneous" response to jointly mark these important occasions. “The crowning glory of our joint commemoration would be your presence in Dhaka for the celebrations on March 26, 2021”. Hasina and Modi had their last meeting in October last year in New Delhi. She said the Covid-19 appeared to have affected most the people-to-people contacts and "our hopes to welcome you in Dhaka earlier this year could not be fulfilled” due to the pandemic. “Yet, I commend the manner in which concerned authorities on both sides have taken forward our bilateral cooperation during these trying times, as per directives of our last summit,” she said. Hasina commended her Indian counterpart's handling of the pandemic "in one of the world’s most affected and populated zones" and “apart from the health care packages, the economic packages introduced under your initiative of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' is admirable”. “I hope India will contribute significantly in recovery of global economy,” the Bangladesh Prime Minister said. She paid rich tribute to members of the Indian armed forces martyred in the 1971 Liberation War. “I pay deep homage to the three million martyrs who laid down their lives. I pay tribute to the members of the Indian armed forces martyred in the war and to their families. I pay my gratitude to the government and the people of India who extended their whole hearted support for the cause of our nation,” she said. The war in 1971 broke after the sudden crackdown at midnight past on March 25, 1971 in the erstwhile East Pakistan by the Pakistani troops and ended on December 16. The same year Pakistan conceded defeat and unconditionally surrendered in Dhaka to the allied forces comprising the freedom fighters and the Indian soldiers. Officially three million people were killed during the nine-month long war. Modi and Hasina jointly inaugurated a digital exhibition on Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi in an effort to celebrate the life and legacies of the iconic leaders. The ties between India and Bangladesh have witnessed a significant upswing in the last few years. Both sides have scaled up trade and economic engagement besides implementing a number of connectivity and infrastructure projects.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-says-india-is-true-friend-as-both-countries-sign-7-pacts-928318.html

He also dismissed a South Asia State of Minorities Report 2020 that has reportedly claimed that India has become increasingly intolerant of religious minorities, and asserted that the country is "safest" in the world for the people of minority communities. In an interview with PTI, Naqvi said such "experimental reports keep coming" but a lot of work has been done for the social, economic and educational empowerment of the minorities in the last six years which will continue going forward. Asked about the perception of the Modi government among minorities, he said, "Apart from the traditional and professional Modi bashers, among the minorities, he is the most acceptable leader." "Majority among the minorities are admiring Modi, his government's working and the atmosphere of equal opportunities," Naqvi said, stressing that he was not talking in terms of votes. No person from the six notified minorities -- Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Zorastrians (Parsis) -- can say that there is discrimination done against anyone under Modi's rule, he said. Minorities have an equal share in all development schemes and there is an atmosphere of equal opportunity, the minister said. "Under Modi 's rule, over four crore children of minorities get scholarships, drop out rates among girls from the minority communities has gone down, their participation in central government jobs has gone up to 10 per cent and also in the civil services, in the last few years so many from the minority communities have been selected," he said. Their selection in civil services is not because of the government but due to their own hard work. However, the atmosphere of discrimination was done away with by the Modi government, he said. The minister also hailed the District Development Council (DDC) and the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council polls in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, and said the response of people, who are openly participating in the democratic process, was "very encouraging". Separatists, terrorists and anti-India forces have been isolated by the people there, Naqvi said. Now Waqf boards will also be established there with separate Shia and Sunni Waqf boards in Kashmir and another Waqf board for Ladakh, Naqvi said. "Earlier, either one family used to rule or another and if not them then a super family from Delhi used to come to power but now this dynastic politics has come to an end and people are getting to directly participate in the democratic process which is free and fair," he said in a swipe at the Mufti, Abdullah and Gandhi families. On preparations for Haj 2021, the minority affairs minister said the government is carrying out its preparations in full swing and the entire process has been made completely online. He said a final call on the pilgrimage in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic will be taken after the decision by the Saudi government and his ministry was also in touch with the Health Ministry for priority inoculation of the Haj pilgrims when vaccines against the virus are available.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-most-acceptable-leader-for-majority-of-people-from-minority-communities-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-928327.html

Kejriwal said he cannot betray the farmers and questioned the hurry in which the laws were passed in Parliament during the Covid-19 pandemic. The chief minister's action in the Assembly came amid farmers' protest at Delhi borders demanding the repeal of the laws amid both the protesters and the Centre not willing to blink. He and his supporters had earlier sat on a fast earlier expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers. In 2013, in an embarrassment to his own government, Rahul Gandhi displeased with a controversial ordinance brought forward by the UPA to negate a Supreme Court verdict on convicted lawmakers termed it as "complete nonsense" and said that it should be torn up and thrown away. He had torn a copy of the ordinance back then. After the Assembly passed the resolution by voice vote, AAP MLAs trooped into the well of the House and tore copies of the laws, raising slogans demanding its repeal. The session was called amid the AAP levelling allegations of misappropriation of around Rs 2,500 crore by the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot moved a resolution demanding the repeal of the three laws. The discussion on the resolution started and later AAP MLA Mahendra Goyal first tore a copy of the farm laws during his speech in the Assembly, saying he refused to accept these "black laws", which are against farmers. Addressing the Assembly, Kejriwal said it has happened for the first time that three laws were passed without voting in Rajya Sabha. “I am pained that I have to do this. I did not intend to, but I cannot betray the farmers of my country who have been sleeping on the streets in the cold... when the temperature is just 2 degrees Celsius,” Kejriwal said while tearing up the copies of the three laws. He said he is a citizen of this country first, a chief minister later. This Assembly rejects the three laws and appeals to the Central government to meet the demands of the farmers, he said. "Twenty protesting farmers have died so far. When will the Centre wake up? The Centre should not be under the impression that the farmers camping at the protest sites will simply return to their homes. In 1907, a farmers' protest continued for nine months till the British rulers repealed some laws," Kejriwal said. “When asked about the benefit of the laws, every BJP leader says farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the country… But where should farmers go to sell their crop at minimum support price (MSP)?” the CM asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/arvind-kejriwal-goes-the-rahul-gandhi-way-tears-copy-of-farm-laws-in-delhi-assembly-928388.html

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, contended that the HC had substituted subjective satisfaction of the district magistrate.   A health worker in Alaska had a serious allergic reaction after getting Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Tuesday and was hospitalized, according to three people familiar with official reports of the person’s health. The person is in stable condition. Government officials were scrambling Wednesday to learn more about the case. It was not immediately clear if the worker had a history of allergies, which makes it difficult to assess the broader significance of the incident as millions of Americans are vaccinated over the coming weeks. The reaction was believed to be similar to the anaphylactic reactions that two health workers in Britain experienced after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week. Both of them recovered.   Cryptocurrency Bitcoin has surged about 20% this week, breaching $22,000 for the first time and stirring predictions that more gains lie ahead for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

Rahul, a Lok Sabha member from Wayanad, sought the intervention of the Speaker to ensure that members were allowed to speak freely during the meetings of the parliamentary committees. In his letter, the former Congress president urged the Speaker to ensure that the right of elected MPs to speak freely in parliamentary panel meetings was protected. He also said the Speaker, being the custodian of Parliament, should ensure that the discussions and presentations in the panel on defence are in consonance with its role and objectives. Rahul and Congress members Rajeev Satav and A Revanth Reddy had walked out of a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Defence on Wednesday contending that it was wasting time discussing uniforms of the armed forces instead of issues of national security. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar had accused Rahul of insulting the parliamentary system by walking out of the meeting and asked him to learn to respect constitutional institutions. "In the last one-and-a-half years, there have been a total of 14 meetings. He was present in just two of the meetings. He was absent in the other 12. He was not even present in the agenda-setting meeting for the year," Javadekar said. "It is the right of a member to point out digressions from the agenda and the purpose of the Standing Committee. The committee is free to disagree with what I say, but the fact that the chairman does not even permit a member to speak is a sad comment on how the government handles military affairs," Rahul said in his letter to the Speaker. "Sir, as Speaker of the Lok Sabha and custodian of the House, I urge you to intervene and ensure that the discussion and presentations held in the defence committee are in consonance with the role and objective of the institution and that the right of elected MP''s to speak freely is protected," he said in the letter. Rahul also expressed his dismay over the contents of the meeting and the manner in which it was conducted. He said the committee was meant to provide legislative oversight on the policies and decisions of the defence ministry and not being the premier interface between the defence forces and elected representatives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-writes-to-lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-claims-he-was-not-allowed-to-speak-in-parliament-panel-meet-928403.html

The MHA said the Centre prevails over a state government in case of any dispute on the deployment of IPS officers as per rules, while officials warned the IPS officers that they may face action if they do not report for duty at their respective positions. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit back at the Centre saying they "would not allow this brazen attempt by the Centre to control the state machinery by proxy! West Bengal is not going to cow-down in front of expansionist & undemocratic forces". The three officers -- Bholanath Pandey, Praveen Tripathi and Rajeev Mishra who were in charge of BJP president JP Nadda's security during his recent visit -- were summoned for central deputation on charges of alleged dereliction of duties after the leader's convoy was attacked in Diamond Harbour. Pandey has been posted as Superintendent of Police in BPRD, while Tripathi has been appointed as Deputy Inspector General in SSB and Mishra in ITBP as Inspector General. While Pandey's deputation is for four years, the others have a five-year deputation in Centre. In the letter, the MHA said the West Bengal government has failed to adhere to rules and cited Section 6 (1) of IPS officers - “in case of any disagreement, the Centre government’s decision shall prevail”. Mamata tweeted, "GoI’s order of central deputation for the 3 serving IPS officers of West Bengal despite the State’s objection is a colourable exercise of power and blatant misuse of emergency provision of IPS Cadre Rule 1954. This act is nothing but a deliberate attempt to encroach upon the state's jurisdiction and demoralise the serving officers in West Bengal. This move, particularly before the election, is against the basic tenets of the federal structure. It is unconstitutional and completely unacceptable!" The state government had on December 12 conveyed to the MHA that it would not be able to spare the three IPS officers. On December 14, the West Bengal Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and Director General of Police Virendra did not appear before the MHA for an explanation on the law-and-order situation in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mha-asks-west-bengal-to-relieve-3-ips-officers-immediately-mamata-calls-it-brazen-attempt-to-control-state-before-polls-928409.html

She said his government in Delhi was among the first to notify one of the central laws related to agriculture. The Delhi Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre's three new agriculture laws with Kejriwal tearing their copies, saying he cannot betray farmers of the country. In a statement here, Badal said the Delhi CM was known as a “dramebaaz” but this time he indulged in "cheap theatrics" and "unparalleled hypocrisy" by tearing the same laws in the Vidhan Sabha, one of which he had notified on November 23. Asking Kejriwal to have “mercy” on farmers, Badal said it is strange that the Delhi CM has suddenly discovered that farmers are sitting out in the open in cold wave conditions and over 20 of them have died. “The Delhi chief minister is only shedding crocodile tears in a desperate bid to wipe away the blot he has put on his name by rushing to notify the farm laws on the directions of the central government. These dramas however won't help. Farmers know that Kejriwal and AAP have never supported their struggle and Kejriwal has always danced to the tune of the central government,” she alleged. The Bathinda MP and the SAD leader said this is not the first time that Kejriwal has tried to “befool” farmers. “Earlier also the Delhi chief minister first notified the farm laws secretly and when this fact came out in the open, he tried to win the sympathy of farmers by going in for a farcical inspection of a few toilets near the Singhu border," she said. This latest “antic” of tearing copies of the farm laws has also been done to save Aam Aadmi Party's “sinking ship” in Punjab where the party has been “thoroughly discredited and become redundant”, said Badal. “Such low-level tactics won't help. Punjabis have seen through AAP and will never trust the party ever again,” Badal added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kejriwal-indulged-in-cheap-theatrics-by-tearing-copies-of-farm-laws-harsimrat-kaur-badal-928444.html

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, who along with 22 party colleagues created a storm by demanding a more visible leadership in the Congress, will be among the leaders who is scheduled to meet Gandhi on Saturday. It was not immediately clear whether Azad would be accompanied by some of the other signatories to the controversial letter that plunged the party into further turmoil in August, after its successive electoral losses. Gandhi, who had been unwell and away in Goa to avoid the air pollution in the national capital, is also expected to discuss the transition of leadership with senior leaders against the backdrop of organisational elections scheduled early next year.

The social media giant's India head, Ajit Mohan, told a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, that Facebook's fact-checking team has not found any content that necessitates a ban on the Bajrang Dal, sources had said. Mohan had deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, chaired by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor. The panel had called him on the issue of the citizens' data safety. Tagging a Wall Street Journal report which claimed that Facebook's safety team had concluded that the Bajrang Dal should be banned from the platform, Gandhi tweeted, "Facebook US says Bajrang Dal content is offensive and should be banned. Facebook India tells our Parliamentary panel that Bajrang Dal content is not offensive." "Is Facebook lying to India and its Parliament?" he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-cites-us-media-report-asks-if-facebook-is-lying-to-india-on-bajrang-dal-928511.html

The Federation of Indian FPOs and Aggregators (FIFA) is the sixth group of farmers that has extended support for the laws in the last two weeks. The previous groups were from Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. FIFA represents 15 states and around 500 farmer producers organisations (FPOs) in the country. "They (FIFA) expressed their support for the recent agricultural reforms by the Government of India. They thanked the minister for the enabling environment which these Acts have created to scale business of FPOs to benefit the small and marginal farmers," an official statement said.

Kejriwal assailed the BJP-ruled Centre over the recent farm laws during a special session of the Delhi Assembly and tore the copies of the three legislations, saying he cannot betray the farmers. Gupta said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief converted constitutional dignity into a "gimmick" by tearing the copies of the farm laws in the Assembly. "Kejriwal's opposition to the farm laws is just a political stunt. When he found out that a section of the farmers of Punjab is opposing the new farm laws, to save political land in the state, he started pretending to oppose it," he said. No immediate reaction was available from the AAP on Gupta's charge. The AAP is the main opposition party in Punjab, where the Assembly polls are scheduled in 2022. "It was the Kejriwal government that notified one of the three new farm laws in Delhi," Gupta said. Kejriwal had earlier said it was not possible for the states to stop the implementation of central laws and if that was the case, the farmers would be protesting against the state governments and not the Centre. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states are camping at Delhi's borders for three weeks, demanding the Centre to scrap the three farm laws and extend a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops. BJP leaders and workers also staged a protest near the Delhi Assembly on Thursday claiming that payments of Rs 13,000 crore were due from the Kejriwal government to the city's municipal corporations. The mayors and leaders, including many women councillors of the BJP-ruled civic bodies, are staging a dharna outside Kejriwal's residence for days now. Twenty of the protesters, including the mayors, sat on an indefinite hunger strike on Thursday claiming dues of Rs 13,000 crore from the Delhi government. Delhi BJP leaders and workers also observed a fast across the city in support of the protesting municipal corporation leaders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gimmick-in-view-of-punjab-politics-bjp-on-kejriwal-tearing-copies-of-farm-laws-928517.html

17-12-2020||North and Central||In 31 years, Jammu and Kashmir lost 1,700 policemen in anti-militancy operations||Nearly 1,700 policemen have been killed in the line of duty in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the insurgency in the erstwhile state, now union territory (UT), in 1989, official figures reveal. Established in 1873, the Jammu and Kashmir Police force has been at the forefront of fighting Pakistan-sponsored proxy war in the UT since the late 1980s and it has lost nearly 1,700 personnel including officers of different ranks in the line of duty. Apart from counter-insurgency operations and law and order duties, policemen are also deployed for VIP security. Among the 1,700 slain personnel, 508 include personal security officers (PSOs), who were deployed for protecting the politicians and other important persons, across the UT, the data reveals. “Majority of the PSOs lost their lives while protecting the person/politician they were deployed with.” The J&K police have lost men from low-ranks to DIG-level officers during the last more than three decades. In 2004, a deputy inspector general of police was shot dead outside a masjid in Srinagar. On June 14, 2018, prominent journalist Shujaat Bukhari was assassinated along with his two PSOs outside the Press Enclave in Srinagar. While Bukhari’s killing was rightly condemned on every forum, no one knows about the two PSOs who lost their lives in the line of duty. A PSO deployed for the protection of a politician in Srinagar said that the life of a policeman like him was so tough that he had to think twice and sound an alert before taking dinner, lunch or breakfast. “Fear always looms over on our head. Our nature of the job is full of risk. You never know when and where we can be attacked,” he told DH on the condition of anonymity. But, the PSO said, life goes on as “this is our duty and we will perform it to the best of our capabilities.” Besides the long duty hours and the shadow of death looming large, these policemen also have thoughts of the welfare of their relatives to reckon with. Militant organisations like Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba have several times released threats on social media warning policemen and other security personnel to resign or face dire consequences. “Local policemen are unsung heroes as it is their efficiency that a large number of militants and top commanders have been eliminated. And whenever terrorists face losses at the hands of security forces, they try to find soft targets and sometimes off-duty policemen become easy targets for them,” a senior police officer said. In recent years, the policemen have even been advised to avoid visiting their homes and if they do, they have been asked to take “extreme precautions” particularly in volatile south Kashmir districts of Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/in-31-years-jammu-and-kashmir-lost-1700-policemen-in-anti-militancy-operations-928295.html
17-12-2020||North and Central||At minus 6.4 degrees Celsius, Srinagar records season’s coldest night||As the cold wave further tightened its grip over Kashmir on Thursday, Srinagar witnessed the coldest night of the season and the third-lowest December temperature in the past one decade as the mercury plummeted to a bone-chilling minus 6.4 degrees Celsius. A Met department official said the mercury dipped to minus 6.4 degrees Celsius in Srinagar on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday from minus 4.8 degrees Celsius on the previous night. The lowest minimum temperatures in the last 10 years in December were minus 6.5 degrees Celsius on December 21, 2016, and minus 7.7 degrees Celsius on December 25, 2018. The lowest ever recorded temperature in December in Srinagar has been minus 12.6 degrees on December 13, 1964. Portions of the Dal Lake in Srinagar city and other water bodies had frozen four days ahead of the peak of the harshest 40-day period of winter, locally known as the ‘Chilla Kalan’. Dal Lake was completely frozen in 1965 when a jeep crossed the frozen surface from one end to the other. It was again frozen in 1986 when people played ice hockey and cricket besides taking photographs on the frozen surface. People in some areas, particularly in the outskirts and Lake area, complained of water shortage as the taps had frozen. Some were seen trying to de-freeze frozen taps by burning wood in the morning. People near the banks of the lake were seen throwing stones and paper on the frozen parts of the lake. People at other places in Kashmir Valley also shivered due to the drop in temperature. The minimum temperature in Pahalgam hill resort in south Kashmir settled at minus 8.9 degrees Celsius from the previous night's minus 7.4 degrees Celsius, the official said. In the ski resort of north Kashmir’s Gulmarg, the minimum night temperature settled at minus 11.0 degrees Celsius, the same as the previous night. In Leh town of the frontier Ladakh region, the mercury settled at minus 14.9 degrees Celsius against the previous night’s minus 14.6 degrees. The neighbouring Kargil town was the coldest place in the region with a low of minus 16.4 degrees Celsius. The Met has forecast dry weather during the next three days with the likelihood of a further fall in night temperatures due to a partially clear sky.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/at-minus-64-degrees-celsius-srinagar-records-season-s-coldest-night-928304.html
17-12-2020||North and Central||Cold winds, 'poor' air quality persist amid clear skies in Delhi||Despite clear skies and lots of sunshine, the minimum temperature remained close to four degrees Celsius in most parts of the national capital on Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of 4.6 degrees Celsius as frosty winds from the western Himalayas continued to sweep across Delhi. The Ayanagar and Ridge weather stations recorded minimum temperatures of 3.8 degrees Celsius and 3.5 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 18 degrees Celsius, the IMD said, predicting 'cold day' conditions at a few places. The IMD had declared a cold wave in Delhi on Tuesday as icy winds blowing from snow-covered western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 4.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the city this season so far. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature is likely to remain around five degrees Celsius till Friday. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the western Himalayas recorded widespread snowfall due to strong western disturbances and now frosty winds have been blowing towards the plains, bringing the mercury down. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. "However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day," Srivastava said. A "cold day" is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is 4.4 degrees Celsius below normal. The air quality was recorded in the "poor" category. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 248 at 11 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 262 on Wednesday and 230 on Tuesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cold-winds-poor-air-quality-persist-amid-clear-skies-in-delhi-928305.html

A police official said the militants lobbed a grenade at a CRPF party near Bijbehara hospital, leaving one paramilitary personnel injured. He was shifted to a hospital, where his condition is stable, he said. The injured CRFP man was identified as Patil Padmamakar of 40-Battalion. Reports said immediately after the attack, the area was cordoned off to nab the attackers. There has been a spurt in grenade attack cases in Kashmir in recent months and the latest attack comes at a time when first-ever district development council (DDC) polls are going on in the union territory. On December 9, six civilians were injured when militants lobbed a grenade at security forces in Singhpora area of north Kashmir's Baramulla district. Prior to that, a dozen civilians were injured when militants lobbed a grenade at security forces in Kakapora area of south Kashmir's Pulwama district on November 18. A senior police officer involved in counter-insurgency operations said militants are targeting forces with grenades just to create an impression that they were present and militancy was alive in the Valley. “After facing heat across Kashmir due to relentless operations by the security forces, militants are trying to revive the strategy of lobbing grenades at security forces and on busy roads. Throwing grenades at busy places is either aimed to provoke the security forces to fire indiscriminately or create a fear among them that they are vulnerable to such attacks,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/crpf-jawan-injured-in-anantnag-grenade-attack-928315.html

The SIT has arrested two detainees from Central Jail Srinagar after their names surfaced in the murder. They have been identified as Muneer Aziz War alias Qari of Kupwara and Tawseef Ahmed Shah of Srinagar and both were under detention when the killing took place. Earlier, the SIT had arrested three accused in the killing of Qadri. Identified as Shahid Shafi Mir, Zahid Farooq Khan and Asif Bhat, the trio were residents of Srinagar. While Zahid is a 'chronic' stone-pelter and had been detained under Public Safety Act in August 2019, Tauseef had been jailed previously in a militancy case and Muneer in a murder case. Sources said that all the three accused have been identified by family members of Qadri and their domestic help and sent to judicial remand to Central Jail, Srinagar till December 26. “The arrested trio stated that they received directions from two persons for the killing of Qadri who were lodged in Central Jail Srinagar. It was on the basis of their revelations that the SIT arrested Muneer War and Tawseef Shah from the Central Jail. They are being questioned and in the coming days, other accused may be also identified,” they revealed. Qadri was shot dead at his Hawal residence in old city Srinagar on September 24 by two masked pistol-borne youth, who entered his house posing as clients. The SIT is now investigating how Tauseef and Muneer passed directions to the trio for the killing of Qadri from the Central Jail. In late 2017, months before Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Naveed Jatt alias Abu Hanzulla’s escaped from police custody, Jammu and Kashmir CID, in a confidential report, had termed Srinagar Central Jail as a hub for recruiting militants with inmates establishing a “parallel administrative setup.” In a shocking revelation, the CID report had mentioned that the role of the jail is so important that every new militant is only recruited after ‘approval’ from inside the prison. Immediately after Jatt’s escape, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had raided the Jail and recovered over two dozen mobile phones, incriminating documents, a Pakistani flag and jihadi literature. Later in August 2018, the NIA arrested a deputy jail superintendent and a militant for allegedly hatching conspiracy inside Central Jail, Srinagar to recruit youth into the militancy. Immediately after Jatt’s escape, “higher and high risk” category prisoners were shifted secretly from Srinagar Central Jail to various prisons in the Jammu region including Udhampur, Kotbalwal and Hiranagar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/conspiracy-to-kill-babar-qadri-hatched-in-srinagar-central-jail-reveals-jk-police-probe-928320.html

His Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh also expressed grief over the death of the 65-year-old preacher. Police said Sant Ram Singh allegedly died by suicide near the Singhu border on Wednesday. A handwritten note in Punjabi, purportedly left behind by the deceased, says he was unable to bear the "pain of farmers". The note is being verified by the police. An official of the Sonipat police said they had received a call that Sant Ram Singh (65), who hailed from Singhra village in Nissing area of Karnal district, allegedly shot himself. He was rushed to a hospital in Panipat where doctors declared him brought dead. Khattar said Sant Ram Singh's death "is an irreparable loss for the Sant Samaj, the country and the state". संत बाबा रामसिंह जी का निधन संत समाज, देश, राज्य तथा मेरे लिए अपूरणीय क्षति है। यह अत्यंत दुख का क्षण है, बाबा जी की आत्मा, परमात्मा में विलीन हो। हम उनके दिखाए मानव-कल्याण के मार्ग पर चलने को संकल्पित हैं, यही उनके प्रति सच्ची श्रद्धांजलि होगी। The Haryana chief minister added that the demise was also an "irreparable loss" to him. "This is a moment of great sorrow," he said in a tweet. Khattar said the real tribute to Singh would be to walk the path of human welfare shown by him. Amarinder Singh too said he was saddened on learning about the preacher's death. "Extremely shocked and saddened on learning the tragic news of Sant Ram Singh ji of Nanaksar Singhra wale from Karnal ending his life at Singhu Border in protest against the Centre's Farm Laws. My prayers are with his family and supporters in this time of grief," he said in a tweet. Sant Ram Singh's body was on Wednesday night taken to the Nanaksar Gurdwara in Singhra village in Karnal, where a large number of his followers had gathered. Many recalled that he had dedicated his life in service of humanity and also used to organise 'satsangs' (prayer meetings) and 'langars' (community kitchen) for thousands of people. Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union chief Gurnam Singh on Thursday said Sant Ram Singh was a noble soul who dedicated his life to humanity's service. "Being a pious soul, he was deeply hurt on seeing the pain and sufferings of thousands of farmers, many among them old and women too, out there on roads during cold wintry days and nights for past several days seeking repeal of anti-farmer laws," he said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had on Wednesday said the Modi government should quit its "stubbornness" and withdraw the new farm laws that the farmers are protesting. Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said he was anguished to hear that the cleric allegedly committed suicide. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been protesting near Delhi's borders for over three weeks, demanding that the Centre's new farm laws be repealed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/amarinder-khattar-condole-loss-of-sikh-preacher-ram-singh-at-singhu-border-928337.html
17-12-2020||North and Central||Supreme Court 'sympathetic' to cause but wants farmers to hold talks||The Supreme Court on Thursday acknowledged the farmers right to protest against the three recently passed agricultural laws but emphasised that they must hold talks to resolve the issues, arising out of blockade of Delhi roads, and to serve their purpose. "We are familiar with the plight of the farmers. We are Indians. We are sympathetic to the farmers. But we are on (looking into) the manner of protest. You have a right to protest which we are not going to interfere with. You carry on the protest. The purpose of protest must be served to talking to someone. You cannot sit in protest for years," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde told a farmers' union. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for a petitioner, suggested that the court may pass an order directing the authorities and police to ensure that the life in the city was not affected by the blockade.  "It is high time that a declaration comes from this court regarding the contours of the right to protest," Salve said, adding no right is absolute and the fundamental right to protest cannot extend to holding the city to ransom. Nobody can have a quarrel with what Salve said, the court said, adding that it can pass an order only after hearing the farmers' unions. "There is a protest that is going on. It is constitutional as long as it does not damage property and lives. It is an absolutely perfect protest. But the purpose cannot be realised if they continue to sit without talking. They have to talk to each other," the bench said. Salve again stressed the cause of the protest cannot be protest. "The cause of protest is to articulate a view. Protests for the sake of protests are a public nuisance," he said. He asked the court to ensure the government put a protocol that a person calling for the protests will identify himself so that he can be held accountable for damages. The court, however, sought to know from Attorney General K K Venugopal if the Union government can say no executive action will be taken under the three laws to facilitate the negotiations. Venugopal sought time to take instructions, though initially expressing difficulty. He also pointed out that the farmers' unions had put a condition for repeal before talks.  "The damage caused by 22 days of the blockade is enormous. People are not able to go for jobs. Ambulances are not permitted to move. Also, there is a risk of coronavirus. When protesters go back to their villages, they will spread coronavirus like wildfire," he said. Venugopal also maintained they cannot say either repeal or will continue their protests indefinitely.  "They have come prepared for six months. This kind of blockades cannot be permitted. This happens only during a war where you cut off supply, etc and block borders," he said. The court, for its part, again suggested forming an independent panel to resolve the matter. It broached up the name of noted journalist P Sainath for the purpose. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed that some persons of eminence could facilitate a talk. The court directed for serving a notice to various farmers' unions and indicated to put the matter for consideration on Saturday before another bench. The court is going for winter vacations from Saturday. Taking up a batch of pleas, the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, clarified that the petitions filed by DMK M P Tiruchi Siva and RJP Manoj K Jha against the validity of laws would be taken up subsequently. The court took up matters which raised the issues of inconvenience to the public caused by the blockade of roads of Delhi. It was also contended before the court that the farmers' leaders had refused to speak when they were contacted after Wednesday's proceedings. The court did not agree to a suggestion for letting the farmers protest at Ramleela Maidan here, saying it was for the police to determine it on the basis of intelligence inputs. During the hearing, Chidambaram, appearing for the Punjab government, expressed serious reservation with Salve's arguments but agreed to a suggestion for a group of people facilitating talks between the Union government and farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/supreme-court-sympathetic-to-cause-but-wants-farmers-to-hold-talks-928352.html

According to an office bearer of the Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust, the foundation stone of the mosque could be laid on the Republic Day next year. "The design of the proposed mosque is ready...all other necessary clearances have been obtained....we expect to start the construction work after the laying of the foundation stone from January 26 next year," he said. A meeting of the Foundation Trust, which would be overseeing the construction work, had been convened on Saturday to discuss the date of laying of foundation stone, he added. It was not clear if some important political dignitary would be invited to lay the foundation stone of the mosque. A Trust spokesman had earlier said that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath would be invited for laying the foundation stone for the hospital, library, research centre to be built inside the mosque complex. Adityanath had earlier said that he neither expected to be invited for the ceremony nor would lay the foundation stone of the mosque. "They (those building the mosque) will not invite me....I know that...I won't go there," the chief minister had said when asked if he would go to the Mosque inauguration ceremony. The Trust spokesman also made it clear that there would be no mention of the name of 'Babar' (the Mughal emperor on whose orders the Ram Temple was allegedly demolished in the 16th century) in the proposed mosque. "It will be known as Dhannipur Masjid," he added. The Trust has appealed to the people to make donations for the mosque construction. The Sunni Central Waqf Board has been allotted five acres of land at Raunahin, about 30 kilometres from Ayodhya for building a mosque as per the supreme court order. The Board has set up an Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust to oversee the construction of the mosque.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ayodhya-mosque-construction-to-begin-next-month-928368.html

According to a police complaint filed by the victim's mother on Wednesday, Kaleem, a madrasa teacher, came to her house when her daughter was alone as she had gone to the market on November 26. He then gave sedatives to the girl and tried to rape her. The complainant alleged that Kaleem also threatened her of dire consequences if she reported the matter to police.

17-12-2020||North and Central||Mahabharata was story of conspiracy, so also north east Delhi riots, police tells court||The Delhi police told a court here on Thursday that just like the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata was a story of conspiracy, the northeast Delhi riots was also an alleged conspiracy whose 'Dhritarashtra', mythological character of the epic, was yet to be identified. The accused, who was seeking bail tried to match the police by saying this case cannot be like a Ramayana "where we are going to wait 14 years to see if we can finally come out." The two major epics of ancient India, Mahabharata and Ramayana, came in for reference by both, the prosecution and accused, to argue their cases, while drawing comparison between the books, the mythological characters and the alleged conspiracy of the riots. They came in for mention during the bail application of JNU student and a Pinjra Tod member, Natasha Narwal who was arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots. Her counsel claimed over the past eight odd hearing a 'Chakravyuh' has been prepared by the prosecution and the accused would attempt to be another mythological character 'Abhimanyu' of Mahabharata and try to break out of it. Referring to the accused's contention that the charge sheet was the second biggest document after the 'Mahabharata', Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, said the WhatsApp group Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) was like the mythological character of 'Sanjaya', who was narrating everything to 'Dhritarashtra'. Prasad told Additional Sessions, Judge Amitabh Rawat, that DPSG allegedly controlled and monitored all the protest sites and the intent was not a protest but a disruptive 'Chakka Jaam', with an end result of violence. “The accused's counsel said the charge sheet was the second biggest document after the 'Mahabharata'. He had argued the Mahabharata was 22,000 pages and the charge sheet was 17,000 pages. I would like to point it out that 'Mahabharata' was a story of a conspiracy and incidentally this case is also that of a conspiracy. In 'Mahabharata', 'Sanjaya' was the one who was able to see everything. "The 'Sanjaya' of this conspiracy was DPSG. 'Sanjaya' was narrating everything to 'Dhritarashtra'. The 'Dhritarashtra' here is yet to be identified," the prosecutor submitted. Advocate Adit Pujari, appearing for Narwal, said “Over the past eight odd hearings a 'Chakravyuh' has been prepared by the prosecution. It is going to be our attempt to be another mythological character 'Abhimanyu' and break out of it. Let's be very clear the reason that this is being done is that the charge sheet does not really contain a prima facie case. “This is not going to be a Ramayana where we are going to wait 14 years to see if we can finally come out. It is happening now and here, we are arguing this now,” Pujari claimed. As his computer system crashed in the middle of the hearing, Pujari again commented on the bulkiness of the charge sheet and said that the charge sheet was so heavy that it often slowed down the computer. Prasad, whose system also crashed during the hearing, said "the accused further argued that protest is not crime. I agree but we have seen that clearly through and through the intent was not a protest, a disruptive chakra jam and with clear indication that the end result was violence. In the submission made through video conferencing, the prosecutor said Narwals' contention that the statements of the witnesses were extorted from them by putting pressure, was a “figment of imagination”. “The accused's counsel had argued that the witnesses despite being aware did not report it at that time. Let me say, this is a case where the witnesses have come forward and said they did not trust the local police at that time. We would not discuss the delay and that is a matter of trial. "The statements recorded under section 164 (recording of statement before the magistrate) Code of Criminal procedure are corroborated with contemporaneous chat records. In any case, the credibility of the witnesses cannot be tested at this stage,” he said. He further said 'Chakka Jaam' started on February 22 and chats, which were part of the charge sheet, showed that till February 23, nothing happened on the site where the protestors supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act were present. “Narwal was brought on to the DPSG group after she was able to set up the protest site at Seelampur. She was part of the DPSG group which was controlling and monitoring all protest sites. She attended the alleged conspiratorial meeting of February 16 and February 17. The chats have clearly revealed that there was a proposal to incite violence. "She was privy to the principal conspirators. She was coordinating with the Jamia Coordination Committee. Detailed elaborations not required on merits at this point. The prima facie case stands established,” the public prosecutor alleged. Pujari alleged that 53 people died in the riots but the charge sheet revolved around the deaths of only three persons- Head Constable Ratan Lal, Rahul Solanki and Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mahabharata-was-story-of-conspiracy-so-also-north-east-delhi-riots-police-tells-court-928454.html

Several places south of the Vindhya mountains are claimed, according to the local lore, as the cradle of one of the most revered Hindu deities. The renewed focus on Hanuman or Anjaneya’s place of birth is evident at a time when a grand temple of Lord Ram is being built on the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya. Janmabhoomi Teerthakshetra Trust was reportedly constituted in Karnataka in February this year with the aim of developing Anjanadri-Kishkinda, at Hampi in Bellary district, as Hanuman's provenance. The trust also announced plans to install the “world's tallest statue” of Hanuman there, on the lines of but a bit shorter than the Ram statue conceived at Ayodhya by the Yogi Adityanath government. Last month, the Uddhav Thackeray government in Maharashtra decided to develop the Anjaneri hills, near Nashik-Trimbakeshwar, as Hanuman’s birthplace. On Wednesday, TTD’s executive officer Dr KS Jawahar Reddy discussed the contestation with scholars including Sri Venkateshwara Vedic University Vice-Chancellor Sudarshana Sharma, National Sanskrit University Vice-Chancellor Muralidhar Sharma. “There is enough information available in various Puranas to prove that Hanuman’s birthplace is Anjanadri in the Seshachalam range,” the pundits claimed. “There are references about the birth of Hanuman in the Skanda, Varaha, Padma, Bhavishyottara, Brahmanda Puranas and the Venkatachala Mahatyam,” the scholars said. The EO then called for extensive research based on Vedic scriptures, mythology, historical evidence, and traditions for concrete proof to ascertain Andhra Pradesh’s Anjanadri as the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, “since there are many places across the country claiming the same.” Anjaneya and Anjanadri (hill) originate from Anjana, Hanuman’s mother.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ttd-forms-panel-to-establish-anjanadri-at-tirupati-as-hanumans-birthplace-928174.html

The CPI(M)-led LDF emerged the main winner in the polls followed by the Congress-led UDF. While the BJP was at third position, its leaders have drawn consolation from the party's improved show in the state where assembly elections are expected to be held in April-May next year.     Nadda said, "I thank the people of Kerala for giving an improved mandate to BJP in Local Body Elections. @BJP4Keralam President @surendranbjp Ji & Karyakartas worked tirelessly & with this mandate, we will continue to expose the corrupt, communal & hypocrite politics of both LDF & UDF fronts."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-civic-polls-j-p-nadda-thanks-voters-for-bjps-improved-show-928306.html
17-12-2020||South||Kerala civic polls: Apolitical 'Twenty20' expands footprint in village panchayats||A charity outfit "Twenty20" won four Gram Panchayats in the Kerala local body polls. Floated by a development initiative of the Anna-Kitex Group seven years ago to rewrite Corporate Social Responsibility, Twenty20 sprang a surprise on mainstream political parties in the latest polls, bettering its performance from 2015. Twenty20 contested the local body polls in the Kizhakkambalam panchayat in 2015 and created history by winning 17 of the 19 Gram Panchayat seats. In the 2020 elections, Twenty20 not only retained Kizhakkambalam panchayat by an impressive margin but also captured power in neighbouring panchayats of Aikkaranad, Kunnathunadu and Mazhuvannur. Besides, it also emerged as a major force in Vengola gram panchayat, winning several wards. "Without our support no one will be able to form the next councils in Vengola panchayat and two block panchayats. We have become the deciding factors there, winning many seats," Sabu Jacob, Chairman and Managing Director of Kitex, who heads Twenty20, said. The outfit also won two district panchayat divisions. Buoyed by the win, Jacob announced that the outfit would field candidates in the Assembly polls in 2021. Jacob said their electoral victory was recognition by the people of the good work it had carried out in Kizhakkambalam panchayat during its five-year rule. "This is a clear warning for all leading fronts in Kerala. If the people get an opportunity to elect a party which fulfils their aspirations, they will certainly change," he said about their win. He promised separate plans for each panchayat as per their needs for overall development. "Our approach is something different. We are not going to replicate the Kizhakkambalam model in all these panchayats. We will prepare separate models for each panchayat as per their requirements after studying the issues there," he told PTI. He, however, said the welfare schemes being implemented in Kizhakkambalam panchayat will be replicated in other panchayats where Twenty20 emerged victorious. Earlier, talking to reporters, Jacob alleged that the Congress-led UDF, CPI(M)-led LDF and other political outfits like PDP, SDPI and Welfare Party had joined hands to "wipe out" Twenty20 from the political landscape in the elections. Jacob claimed that over 1000-odd people could not cast their votes in the elections due to 'threats' by these political outfits. Twenty20, a brainchild of Sabu Jacob, is the development initiative of the Rs 12 billion Anna-Kitex Group founded by his father M C Jacob in 1968.  (With PTI inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-civic-polls-apolitical-twenty20-expands-footprint-in-village-panchayats-928307.html

DMK MP and its Parliamentary Party Leader T R Baalu said that while issues like the ongoing farmers' protest and border row with China had to be discussed in the Parliament, "it is very concerning that the Central BJP government does not want to hold the Winter Session." Baalu alleged the government did not consult opposition parties including the DMK on the matter, which was not acceptable. The government had earlier conveyed to the opposition that the Winter Session of the Parliament will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that the Budget session will be convened in January 2021. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi had said he had contacted floor leaders of various political parties and "they have expressed their concerns about the ongoing pandemic and opined of doing away with Winter Session". In a statement here on Thursday, Baalu said, "on behalf of DMK, I strongly condemn the cancelling of the Winter Session of the Parliament by the BJP government citing corona pandemic." Issues like the Indo-China border row and the protest by farmers against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre were waiting to be discussed, he said, adding even the Supreme Court had come forward to seek a solution to the ryots' agitation, being held outside Delhi for three weeks now. "When the Supreme Court itself is coming forward to seek a solution amid an abnormal situation, it is condemnable that the elected government has cancelled the session," he said, pointing out that the apex court had also noted that the farmers' protest could soon turn into a 'national issue'. Observing that the Centre's talks with the protesting farmers have "not worked apparently" and were bound to fail, the apex court had on Wednesday stepped in and indicated forming a panel to break the deadlock, a move dismissed by the farm leaders as no solution. Baalu further said democracy was the country's "heart" and it was beating due to meaningful debates in Parliament but "Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn't seem to realise it." "The ruling party and the opposition are the two wheels of India's powerful democracy. But democratic ethos are being crushed ever since the BJP came to power," he charged. The Centre should stop its "big brother attitude" of ignoring the opposition and "return" to the path of consensus of views and democracy, Baalu said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-leader-t-r-baalu-slams-centre-over-decision-to-cancel-parliament-winter-session-928314.html

She had passed away a day ahead of the results. Fifty-year-old Sahira Banu of Parasheri West ward in Thalakkad grama panchayat near Tirur, on the suburbs of Malappuram, had met with a road accident on December 10.  The two-wheeler on which she was pillion was knocked down by a car. She was seriously injured and was fighting for her life when the polling in the ward was taking place on December 14. The next day afternoon, she won. When the votes were counted on Wednesday, Sahira had won by securing 484 votes, which was more than double the 236 votes secured by the runner up, Sulikha Beevi, a UDF-backed independent. Now, a bypoll would have to be held in the ward. Sahira was an active member of the CPM and a ward member twice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/a-day-after-her-death-sahira-banu-wins-in-kerala-civic-polls-928331.html

17-12-2020||South||Kerala civic body polls bring cheers and tears for BJP||The BJP in Kerala has braved many odds to make its presence felt in the state's bipolar politics, dominated for decades by the traditional coalitions-CPI(M)-led LDF and Congress-headed UDF. But, once again the saffron party has failed to create magic in electoral politics in the southern state as it couldn't perform according to its expectations when the counting for the crucial local body polls was taken up on Wednesday. Though compared to the 2015 civic body polls the BJP-NDAimproved its tally and added more number of seats to its credit, they could not display a stellar performance as they claimed during the time of campaigning. The failure of some of its major leaders and the loss of many sitting seats also took the sheen off their performance at the local body polls, which was generally considered a pointer to the assembly elections due next year. According to party sources, the saffron party managed to win seats between 1600-1800 in the present civic polls though the Election Commission was yet to release the official figures of the total seats and vote share. They could also reach second position in over 500 wards besides retaining the Palakkad municipality and wresting the Pandalam municipality from the LDF. But, their target to garner 2500-3000 seats and capture the prestigious Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur Corporations remained a distant dream. Throughout the high-voltage campaign, the party leadership had claimed that they would capture the Corporation in the state capital and there would be a BJP mayor to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the airport when he arrives here next time. Not only that the long-drawn dream did shatter but also they had to see the ruling front achieving simple majority in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation by improving their performance compared to the previous time. Though they could successfully make inroads in many parts of the state, once dominated by either LDF or UDF, the saffron front was yet to gain the trust or confidence of the minority communities completely in the state. Their striking performance in Varkala and Attingal and in many wards of Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts shocked even their political rivals. They could also make their performance felt in almost all Corporations including in politically volatile Kannur, a Left bastion. Though the party leadership accused both the traditional coalitions of cross-voting to fail them in many wards, political observers feel that factional feud and disunity among the leaders were also among the reasons for its failure. The rift between BJP state president K Surendran, a close confidant of union minister V Muraleedharan and senior leader and party state vice president Sobha Surendran was very much evident ahead of the election. A group of dissident leaders including Sobha had reportedly sent a mass petition to the central leadership against the state leadership demanding to end neglect towards them. Sobha, who used to be a firebrand campaigner of BJP during elections, had kept herself away from campaigning this time. As it was the first election after he assumed charge as the state president, the improved performance of the party anyway would give some relief for Surendran. BJP national president J P Nadda on Thursday thanked the people of Kerala for giving an "improved mandate" for the saffron party. "I thank the people of Kerala for giving an improved mandate to BJP in Local Body Elections," he tweeted. He also said Surendran and karyakartas worked tirelessly to achieve this result. "..with this mandate, we will continue to expose the corruption, communal & hypocrite politics of both LDF & UDF fronts," Nadda added. The BJP-NDA's vote share had got an impressive increase in the southern state in 2015 local body polls. It had garnered 13.28 per cent votes against LDF's 37.36 per cent and UDF's 37.23 per cent. It showcased a fairer performance in 2016 assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-civic-body-polls-bring-cheers-and-tears-for-bjp-928399.html

The department also seized Rs 21 crore "unaccounted cash" during the searches. The raids were carried out on December 14 at 15 premises in Erode and Chennai against the group which is a "leading civil contractor for government works, specialised in erecting sea wave breakers along the coastlines and is also diversified into bus transport, running marriage halls and food masala business". "It was found that the group indulges in inflation of purchases and other work contract expenses. Such inflated payments made to the suppliers and sub-contractors are received back in cash regularly," the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement. The unaccounted income thus generated comes to around Rs 700 crore, which is "ploughed back" into real estate investments and business expansion, it said.  Out of this, the assessee has admitted to having an undisclosed income of Rs 150 crore, so far, the Board claimed.

The state government plans to inaugurate the memorial on February 24, the birth anniversary of Jayalalithaa. The memorial, which is being built at a cost of Rs 57.96 crore, is coming up behind the MGR memorial, and the project is undertaken by the Tamil Nadu government. Jayalalithaa was buried next to her mentor M G Ramachandran on December 6, 2016, according to Dravidian customs. R Pandiarajan, who retired as a superintending engineer, Public Works Department, in April 2020, has been appointed as the special officer on a contract basis to “monitor and coordinate the works in order to complete the project in a stipulated time,” an order signed by K Manivasan, Principal Secretary (PWD), read. He is being hired for a period of three months, the order added. The move assumes significance in the wake of reports that Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is keen on inaugurating the memorial in February, months before the state Assembly faces its most crucial polls in recent times. Sources in the government told DH that the need for the appointment of a special officer arose due to delay in completing the project. “There were delays due to a variety of factors and we want the project to be completed soon. Covid-19 lockdown also delayed the project considerably,” a senior government official said. The memorial will also have a museum and a knowledge park, while the project also includes sprucing up of MGR memorial.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tn-appoints-special-officer-to-expedite-work-at-jaya-memorial-928442.html

Vijayan urged Modi to take corrective action and also expressed concerns that the central agencies may lose their credibility. "Orchestrated campaigns to defame the political leadership of the Kerala government are being carried out seemingly with the cooperation of some officials of investigation agencies. Even after five months, the agencies were not able to unravel the source and utilisation of the gold smuggled through the diplomatic channel. Instead, the aim of the agencies seems to be tarnishing the image of the state government," Vijayan said in a four-page detailed letter. He said in a federal set up the central agencies would have to follow the contours of the constitutional division of power and any transgression of the same by conducting roving enquiries and proceeding on fishing expeditions to review the state government's projects with the intention of fault-finding was not within the province of the central investigating agencies. The CBI registering a case against the officials of Kerala government's flagship LIFE Mission programme that already provided housing to around 2.5 lakh families and the ED seeking details of various key projects of the state government had irked the Kerala government. The chief minister had even alleged earlier that the central agencies were acting as per the interest of the political bosses. The letter to the prime minister is a sequel to that. Vijayan also said fishing and roving inquiries by central agencies into state government key development projects would hamper development activities and demotivate honest and hardworking officers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/central-agencies-tarnishing-keralas-image-cm-ijayan-writes-to-pm-modi-928445.html

Congress-led United Democratic Front that suffered the major setback by losing to the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and even the BJP-led NDA in many of its strongholds across the state is now witnessing strong resentment from within the party against the leadership. The major criticisms against the party leadership was improper candidate selection by giving priority to favouritisms over winnability factors and massive erosion of minority community votes. Groupism among the state leaders and induction of new entrants to the party leadership by ignoring many dedicated long time workers were also being flayed. Many senior leaders including MPs K Muraleedharan and Rajmohan Unnithan have openly flayed the party leadership. AICC general secretary K C Venugopal told a section of media that at present there was no question of any leadership change. He also said that there were certain lapses and those would be corrected ahead of the Assembly polls which are hardly five months away. BJP state leadership is facing criticisms from within the party. Many senior leaders of like Sobha Surendran came out openly against the present state president K Surendran. But the party leadership failed to sort out the issues. There was also resentment among the party cadres as national leaders did not come for campaign in Kerala even as they came down to Hyderabad for civic polls. The left-front that recorded a significant victory amidst many adverse factors has also started witnessing party worker's reproval over the Pala Assembly seat in Kottayam district. Rajya Sabha MP Jose K Mani led faction of Kerala Congress (M), which is a new entrant to the LDF, has indeed shown its influence by winning a municipality and many wards for the LDF in the local body elections. He has been eyeing the Pala Assembly seat citing emotional connections as his father K M Mani was holding the seat for over 50 years till his death last year. But Mani C Kappan of NCP, which is with LDF in Kerala, has won the seat in the by-polls after K M Mani's death. NCP leadership countered Jose's statement by clearly stating that it would not spare the seat. Meanwhile, the state also witnessed clashes between political parties at various parts of North Kerala on Wednesday night and Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-local-body-poll-results-political-parties-facing-resentment-from-within-928471.html

On Thursday, Naidu addressed a rally “Amaravati Janabheri” organized at Rayapudi to mark the one year of protests to retain the area in Guntur district as the sole capital city of the state. “If the people vote in favour of three capitals, then I will exit from politics permanently,” said Naidu, who made similar announcements in the past year. The former CM has also visited the spot where the foundation of a grand capital, in partnership with Singapore firms, was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2015. Reddy who took over administration in May 2019 has altered Naidu's plan altogether. Reddy unveiled his intention to shift the executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam on 17 December 2019 while speaking in the state assembly, thereby sparking the Amaravati agitation. Reddy alleged the TDP chief as sustaining the agitation to suit his vested interests. “A former ruler had indulged in insider trading and amassed lands from the farmers in the name of his benamis, before the area was declared as the capital. The agitation now is to save the value of those ill-gotten lands,” Reddy said while addressing a programme on BC welfare in Vijayawada, on Thursday. Naidu challenged the CM to prove his allegations while counterattacking that the YSRCP leaders are indulged in insider trading at Visakhapatnam. The Amaravati protests since last year are primarily led by the local farmers of the 29 capital area villages who parted with about 33,000-acre fertile lands for the capital in 2015. They are supported by the TDP, Janasena, Left etc., parties. The state BJP also maintains “a single capital at Amaravati” as its official line. In January 2020, the Reddy government had brought legislation enabling three capitals for the state with the executive in Visakhapatnam, legislature retained at Amaravati and the judiciary moved to Kurnool. Besides showing a capital construction expense of over Rs one lakh crore as an unviable expense, the YSRCP government alleged large scale manipulation over the Amaravati lands prior to the capital notification to benefit the then ruling TDP leaders. Though the legislation was notified in July, the Andhra Pradesh high court, hearing the petitions from Amaravati farmers, politicians, had issued orders barring the Reddy government’s capital shift moves. Reddy, however, appears unperturbed. In his meeting with Amit Shah earlier this week, the CM urged the Home Minister “to issue a notification for the decentralization of administration to have the executive capital at Visakhapatnam, legislative capital at Amaravati, and judicial capital at Kurnool.” Reddy reminded Shah that the BJP's 2019 elections manifesto had supported Kurnool as the seat of AP's judiciary.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/one-year-of-amaravati-agitation-naidu-dares-jagan-for-a-referendum-says-will-quit-politics-if-people-vote-for-three-capitals-928480.html

Raveendran had skipped ED quizzing trice earlier citing Covid-19 and post-Covid ailments. He even approached the Kerala High Court against ED quizzing. Raveendran was learnt to have come under the ED scanner based on statements given by chief minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar and gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh, especially about commissions involved in various government projects. The agency also collected details of investments and other assets of Swapna. The quizzing of Raveendran assumed much significance as he has been a close confidant of Vijayan as well as many other top CPM leaders. The quizzing that began in the morning continued till late in the evening.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-cm-vijayans-additional-secy-appears-before-ed-928483.html

It was during the victory celebration in the local body polls on Wednesday that a 'Jai Sri Ram' banner was displayed by some party workers on the municipality building. Palakkad was the lone municipality under BJP rule and it retained power this time also by winning 28 of the 52 wards. Hence the party workers were in a jubilant mood. Some party workers climbed to the top of the municipality building and hung the 'Jai Sri Ram'  banner over the building. Another banner carrying pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah was also displayed. Perhaps after being alerted by some party leaders the 'Jai Sri Ram' banner was removed immediately. But with the video footage of the 'Jai Sri Ram' banner over the municipality building going viral on social media, the matter became controversial. Congress and CPM alleged that the incident exposed the real face of BJP and sought police action. The municipal authorities also lodged a police petition against displaying religious symbols in a government office. Based on that the local police registered a case under IPC 153 for provocation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/controversy-over-jai-sri-ram-banner-at-kerala-municipality-928508.html

The AIADMK veteran's criticism of Haasan comes in the backdrop of the actor invoking the legacy of the ruling party's founder and former chief minister, the late M G Ramachandran, and the MNM chief lashing out at government over corruption. Palaniswami insisted that only the AIADMK, founded by the late Ramachandran, could lay claim to his legacy and wondered if Haasan "could christen the child of someone else." In response to Palaniswami's criticism, Haasan quipped he was happy the chief minister was also watching the reality show. Pointing out that Haasan has launched a political party "post retirement," Palaniswami asked, "what does he know (about politics)?" ".....He is conducting Bigg Boss. If you see those serials not only children but also good families will get spoiled." "One cannot pin hopes on the actor as he can't do good for the people. His job is only to spoil good families," the chief minister said, perhaps in his most strong criticism of Haasan so far. The CM's comments came in response to a question from a reporter here who sought his reaction to the actor's tweet on corruption. "Ask sensible questions. You are trying to give the impression that the actor is a political leader," Palaniswami chided the scribe. Haasan, highly critical of the AIADMK government over a number of issues including graft, had earlier tweeted, while referring to the seizure of unaccounted money from various government offices by the DVAC, state officials were following the footsteps of the government on corruption. Averring that there are several issues concerning people like the interlinking of rivers, farming or giving good advice to youngsters, Palaniswami said Haasan's films did not give any socially relevant messages to the people as did the films of MGR, as Ramachandran is popularly addressed. "MGR gave good songs with pertinent messages to the people, especially children. Has Kamal given any song that would do good to people?" Palaniswami asked. Children and good families "will get spoiled" if they watch Kamal Haasan's Bigg Boss show, he said. Later, speaking to reporters at Perambalur, the AIADMK co-coordinator said Haasan "himself accepts that votes can be received only by taking MGR's name." "Because, he (Hassan) does not have individual clout. AIADMK was founded by MGR, so it is the only movement qualified to use his name. No one else has the moral right to do so," he said. "Can he christen the child of someone else?" the CM asked. Responding to Palaniswami's tirade, Haasan said in a tweet he was happy "that the chief minister is also watching Bigg Boss," whose Tamil version he anchors on a private TV channel. He also recalled lines from a superhit Tamil song from a film featuring MGR to imply some may compromise with all ideals for their needs but he will put an end to such people. The MNM leader had recently invoked the legacy of Ramachandran, a hugely popular leader, when he had said he was 'continuing' the dream of the former chief Minister to make Madurai the second capital of Tamil Nadu. He had also hinted Ramachandran cannot be confined merely to DMK, from where he started his political journey or his founded AIADMK. He had said he grew up 'on the lap of MGR' while several Tamil Nadu Ministers would not have even seen him personally. On the vigilance raids, Palaniswami said the DVAC comes under the state government and the checks show its intention to prevent malpractices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-cant-do-good-his-job-is-to-spoil-families-says-tn-cm-928520.html

When there is no majority on my side, I am obliged to resign. But it has to be officially made clear that I was acting in conformity with rules and that there was no error of judgement or procedural lapse from my end,” Shetty told DH, adding that either the Governor or the court should provide clarity on this. “We will have to wait and see.” Going by Shetty’s stand, the tussle is likely to drag on with both the ruling BJP and the Congress exploring the next steps, which may include a legal battle. The government might also consider taking a Cabinet decision to re-convene the Council. There is pressure on Shetty to quit, especially after the BJP and JD(S) joined hands to move a no-confidence motion against him, leaving the Congress without numbers to save the chairman’s seat.  Shetty, whom the BJP has accused of arbitrarily rejecting its notice to move the no-confidence motion against him, said his decision was based on legal advice. There was no legal provision for the motion to be taken up for discussion, Shetty pointed out. “The House was convened with the intention of taking up Bills and questions and answers,” he added.  On December 15, the Legislative Council turned into a wrestling ring as BJP, Congress and JD(S) members brawled over the no-trust motion againstShetty. Lamenting the incident, Shetty said it was unusual to see the deputy chairman of the JD(S) take the seat. “I felt it was not right to enter the House when he was sitting in the chair. Hence, I stayed in my chamber. Then, the secretary informed me that the situation was going out of hand. That is when I adjourned the session,”he said.  That the JD(S) would side with the Congress was another unexpected turn. “When I was elected in 2018, the Congress had 37 members (majority). A week later, the deputy chairman was elected with Congress’ support. We naturally assumed that we had their support. I would have 100% resigned had the JD(S) announced its stand earlier. I couldn’t have resigned when only 11 members signed and moved the motion,” Shetty said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ready-to-quit-but-need-to-know-if-i-was-right-shetty-928181.html

Crores of expended vials of the vaccine and used syringes, plus discharged packets of associated drugs such as PCM and Vitamin A tablets and bottles are expected to end up for incineration or burial. Minister for Health Dr K Sudhakar said that a minimum of 9.2 lakh syringes will be required for the vaccination of healthcare workers in the first phase. “These will be allotted by the Centre,” the minister said, adding that the government is planning to use single-use, auto-disable (AD) syringes during the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. The Centre has ordered 60 crore syringes to vaccinate the 30 crore primary recipients in two doses in the country. As per a new vaccination protocol issued by the Centre, expired and discarded vaccines vials, expired drugs and cotton contaminated with blood are either to be autoclaved or boiled with chemicals before being transferred to a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBTWF), of which 27 such centres exist in the state, including two in Bengaluru. Syringes are also supposed to be handed over to privatised CBTWFs mandated by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to incinerate them or bury them deep.  While deep pits are available only in remote areas, the “incineration capacity of Karnataka is 65 tonnes per day,” said Srinivasulu, member secretary of KSPCB. He said this capacity came close to being exceeded several times during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak in the state. According to KSPCB data, 2,401.52 tonnes of Covid-19 waste has been generated in Karnataka since March. Out of this 2,400.83 tonnes have been either incinerated or buried. The balance of 689.65 kg was not disposed of properly.  Daily disposal numbers are better. On Wednesday, 0.6 tonnes of Covid-19 waste was generated in the state, all of which was disposed of, according to the KSPCB. But several independent waste management experts warned that the disposal capacity has already been reached. “The state will not be able to handle the extra capacity imposed by the vaccine because it is not just syringes and vials which need to be disposed of, but also PPEs, gloves and masks adding to the mix,” said Rajesh Babu G M, co-founder of Swaccha. Colonel Dr H S Ratti of Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices (HMD) said India has the means to tackle the excess waste. “But only if the government can plan and streamline the biomedical waste disposal procedures,” he said. However, in Karnataka, the scope for planning is limited because officers do not yet know how much waste will be generated.  “There is no order yet on how many vaccinations are due to be administered in each district. Once these allocations are laid out, we can try to work out how to dispose of the waste,” said Prabhudev, CEO-2 of KSPCB.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/post-vaccination-tackling-mounds-of-biomedical-waste-an-uphill-task-for-karnataka-928292.html

It has so far recorded 9.05 lakh positive cases of Covid-19 cases and nearly 12,000 people have lost their lives so far in the state due to the virus.  In earlier days of the pandemic, the state took drastic measures to mitigate the spread of the disease even before the Centre announced the March 23 lockdown. The state government enforced social distancing and shut down all non-essential services by mid-March. All educational institutes were forced to shut down and examinations were postponed indefinitely.  Karnataka also shut its southern borders with Kerala after the Kasargod district reported a high number of Covid-19 cases. As migrants from other states including Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, returned to Karnataka, the state witnessed a huge influx of cases. To tackle the surge, Karnataka imposed a 14-day quarantine mandatory for people entering from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Kerala. Senior citizens accounted for about 14 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases.  Other districts in the state also saw a surge in Covid-19 cases after lockdowns were eased and inter-state buses and trains services resumed. Mysuru (51,551), Ballari (38,564), Dakshina Kannada (32,444) are other districts with a high number of cases.  Last month, the daily Covid-19 cases dropped below 2,500 consistently. Since the end of the month and through December, the spike in Covid-19 cases has remained below 2,000.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/indias-covid-19-tally-tops-1-crore-how-the-virus-ravaged-karnataka-928386.html

The MoU will facilitate collaborative and mutually beneficial programmes in the state and contribute to increased research and social linkages in the field of Higher Education between the two entities, an official release from the CMO said. It said the MoU between the British Council and Karnataka State Council for Higher Education is aimed at deeper collaboration between the state and the UK to achieve the outcomes envisioned through the New Education Policy of the Centre. The release further said student mobility and faculty exchange across higher education institutions (HEIs) in Karnataka and the UK is a key priority of the MoU to enhance research and support internationalisation of HEIs. The two entities will work closely to strengthen Karnataka's higher education academic landscape through systemic initiatives such as leadership development for faculty and education and research partnerships between institutions of the state and the UK, it added. The MoU was signed in the presence of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, UK Secretary of State for foreign and development affairs Dominic Raab, Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan among others. The two governments are signing a first-of-its-kind three years MoU involving collaboration on leadership development in higher education institutions, Yediyurappa said. Pointing out that Karnataka's Global Innovation Alliance (GIA) initiative for innovation partnerships with countries across the globe has contributed to the state's global image as the leading tech hub, he said UK has been a very important GIA partner for Karnataka and 38 per cent of UK investment into India in 2017-18 came into Karnataka. The government's Urban Development department has collaborated with the UK through the Climate Resilient Cities for Shared Prosperity Urban Development programme, he said. This will deliver a transformational project on design and delivery of Multimodal Transport Hubs in Bengaluru, an Integrated Transport Authority and Transport Observatory in partnership with UK Catapults. Barbara Wickham OBE, Director India of British Council, said the MoU is a further step in realising the mutual vision of a deep, strong India-UK education relationship while supporting the knowledge ambitions laid out in India's National Education Policy 2020. Through this MoU, we look forward to creating more education and employment opportunities for aspiring students of Karnataka as well as supporting the state's vision for stronger higher education systems, she added. Director South India of British Council, Janaka Pushpanathan said employability and upskilling is a focus area for governments across the world and we are confident that the co-developed programmes as part of the MoU will help drive the desired results for both Karnataka and the UK in these areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-govt-partners-with-british-council-to-bolster-bilateral-cooperation-in-higher-education-928393.html

The government on Thursday issued an order prohibiting such programmes between December 30 and January 2 at clubs, pubs, restaurants and other places where people gather for new year celebrations, citing the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Ahead of Christmas and New Year, the government also issued a set of guidelines, including barring public from making hand shakes or hugging during the celebrations. However, there will be no restrictions on pubs, clubs and restaurants in carrying out normal operations in a routine way, the order said. The guidelines, which also mandated use of green crackers alone during the festivities, will be effective from December 20 till January 2 and were aimed at controlling the spread of the pandemic. "Keeping in mind public health, there is a need to celebrate Christmas and New Year in a simple and meaningful way. In the wake of this mass parties have been banned across the state at public places, establishments and places where large crowds gather without maintaining social distancing," the order by Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar said. Organisers and supervisors at Churches must ensure that a large number of people don't gather at a time and social distance was maintained. Also people should not indulge in hand shakes or hugging during the festivities. From December 30 to January 2 parties, special DJ dance programmes and special events at clubs, pubs, restaurants and other places that attract people in large numbers without social distancing have been prohibited. Gathering of people at public places and roads for celebrations stands prohibited, but normal routine activities can be carried out at these places. In the guidelines, the Police Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners have been given the authority to impose more restrictions at certain specific roads or places in their jurisdiction. The order also calls for adhering to Covid related guidelines or restrictions that are already in place to control the spread of virus whose overall count in the state stood at 9.05 lakh as of Thursday with 15,205 active cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-year-parties-dance-programmes-banned-in-pubs-clubs-in-karnataka-due-to-covid-19-928515.html
17-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Compassionate appointment: Karnataka HC strikes down rules that excluded married daughters||The Karnataka High Court has held that the exclusion of married daughters from appointment on compassionate grounds is discriminatory and ultra vires the Constitution. The ruling came on a petition filed by Bhuvaneshwari V Puranik against the Department of Agriculture Marketing, which rejected her request for appointment to her deceased father's job. The department said that as per the rules, a married daughter is not eligible to be appointed on compassionate grounds.  The court held Rule 2(1)(a)(i), Rule 2(1)(b) and Rule 3(2)(i)(c) as unconstitutional and struck down the word "unmarried" from the Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate Grounds) Rules, 1996. The Additional Advocate General argued that compassionate appointment is not a matter of right but a concession. He also submitted that the rule that has stood the test of time cannot be held unconstitutional merely because the petitioner is denied a concession. Justice M Nagaprasanna, while passing the order, said it should be remembered that "nature bestows so much on women; the law cannot bestow too little". The court said that marriages do not determine the continuance of the relationship of a child with the parent, whether a son or a daughter. The court said the interpretation of law has always undergone changes with changing times. If the offending provision is left as it is, it would be putting the clock back from where the law has progressed over the years. "Therefore, the Rules insofar as it creates a division of the same object of appointment on the basis of gender by granting appointment to a son without any qualification and denying the same to a daughter with the qualification of 'marriage' cannot but be held to be discriminatory." The court said the factor of dependency is the key to grant or deny compassionate appointment and the same has not been considered in the case at hand. It directed the state government to reconsider the claim of the petitioner. The government has been further directed to pass appropriate orders, keeping in mind the observations made in the order, within one month from the date of receipt of the order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/compassionate-appointment-karnataka-hc-strikes-down-rules-that-excluded-married-daughters-928180.html

It is the government’s blueprint on how Bengaluru should be in 2022, when India will mark 75th year of Independence.  Speaking at the launch, Yediyurappa said the initiative will focus on four large areas: ease of transport, cleaner city, greener city and connecting citizens to the city's culture through museums and cultural centres. “Budget has been allocated for all the works planned. We will conduct inspections once in six months and make sure that all the works planned are completed within the given timeframe," Yediyurappa said, asserting that the financial distress caused due to the Covid-19 pandemic would not get in the way of the city’s development.  Elaborating on the plans, BBMP administrator Gaurav Gupta said the government would take up development of 12 high-density corridors, adding up to 190 km, in coordination with the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL). An annual maintenance contract would be given for 400 km of arterial roads. In addition, the government will promote shared electric vehicles and ensure operations of suburban rail within the next two years.  To ensure efficient waste management, the government will refurbish the existing waste processing plants, implement GPS-based monitoring of waste collection and rehabilitate legacy dump sites. Citizens will be encouraged to process wet waste in their homes and for this, learning centres will be established in different wards and zones. The government will repurpose lands of public sector undertakings to develop new urban lung spaces, apart from launching two mega tree parks in the city, with each one spanning across a 400-acre area. The existing mini forests in J P Nagar, Turahalli, Kadugodi and Mathikere will also be developed into popular destinations, Gupta added. In an effort to make citizen services easily accessible, the BBMP’s Sahaya portal will be redesigned as a one-stop platform for grievance redressal.  The government will also establish a Bengaluru Culture, Heritage and Crafts Museum at NGEF. “This is an effort to get the huge migrant population residing in the city acquainted with the state's culture,” Gupta said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-unveils-ambitious-bengaluru-mission-2022-plan-928325.html

Tapas Nandlal Ghosh (49), arrested last week, was produced before the sessions court by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the city police for custody extension. Ghosh, his wife and some others are accused of cheating Mukta Bobde (94), the CJI's mother, over a period of time. However, besides Ghosh, who looked after a prime property here owned by Mukta Bobde, no one else has been arrested in the case so far. A police official said searches were conducted at the house of Ghosh, a city resident, after he was arrested on December 8. The police have seized mobile phone and laptop of Ghosh and are also checking his bank accounts, he said. As Ghosh's present police custody ended on Wednesday, the SIT produced him in the court. After hearing arguments of prosecution and defence lawyers, the court extended his police custody till December 21. The case relates to the management of Seasons Lawn, a property owned by the Bobde family. It is located adjacent to their ancestral bungalow in the Civil Lines area. In 2007, Mukta Bobde had appointed Ghosh, a resident of Friends Colony, as the manager of the property, which is rented out for marriages and other functions, the police have said. He was getting a monthly salary of Rs 9,000 and Rs 2,500 for every booking, they said. After lockdown was imposed in March-end following the outbreak of coronavirus, persons who had booked the premises for different functions and wedding receptions, started demanding their money back, the police said. Ghosh was allegedly reluctant to show the receipt book to the Bobdes and reveal transactions made by him with customers, they said. The Rs 2.50 crore fraud came to light when the receipts and details of bank transactions from August 2017 to August 2020 were checked, the police said. In August, when Mukta Bobde was unwell, one Kiran Vishnupant Deopujari (72) lodged a complaint on her behalf against Ghosh and his wife who, used to take bookings in his absence, and some other persons. On the basis of the complaint, the police had registered a case against the accused under IPC sections related to cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery and common intention, among other.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/fraud-with-cjis-mother-police-custody-of-accused-extended-928200.html

Locals say monkeys have been inhabiting the Upla village since long, but their attacks have gone up in the past few months. When contacted, a senior forest department official here told PTI on Thursday that they have not received any complaint about monkeys from the village so far. "If we receive any complaint, we will act on it," the official said. The tiny village, located in Sillod taluka, has around 1,600 residents, but most of them are forced to stay indoors because of the monkey menace. Women and children in the village are scared as the apes enter home kitchens, pick up chapattis (flat flour bread), snatch food from people's hands and when resisted, they attack the villagers. A woman from the village said she received severe injuries when a monkey attacked her a couple of years ago. Another resident said, "Crops of many farmers have been damaged by the gang of monkeys, who move around in large groups. People are scared to even walk in the village." Upla's sarpanch (village head) Meerabai Suradkar said monkeys have been living in the village since several years. "But, their number and nuisance has now gone up. There are nearly 300 monkeys in the village. They have broken roofs of many houses," she said. Asked from where the monkeys come to the village, she said, "There is no forest near our place, but there are some hills around 20-30 km from here." Another local said monkeys have been eating cotton and maize at farms in the village and have damaged several crops. "They have also damaged vehicles. Tin roofs of many houses in the village have also been damaged," he said. A woman from the village said while she carries chapattis for her family members working at their farm, the monkeys snatch the food. "If we try to drive them away, they attack us," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/monkey-menace-not-covid-19-forcing-villagers-in-maharashtra-to-stay-indoors-928270.html

Nearly three years ago, from December 25, 2017, AC local trains were introduced on the Western Railway (WR) route. The CR and WR combined are considered the lifeline of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Out of the 10 AC local services of CR’s main line, two will be operated between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai and Kalyan in neighbouring Thane, four between CSMT and Dombivli in Thane, and four between CSMT and Kurla. The CR was operating AC local train services on its Thane-Vashi/Panvel Trans-Harbour line from February 3 before the Covid-19 lockdown came into force in March this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbais-csmt-kalyan-line-gets-ac-local-trains-928274.html

Talking to reporters, Raut launched a veiled attack on the BJP, accusing the opposition of creating hurdles in the development of Maharashtra as the party is not in power in the state, and said there was a "conspiracy" to not allow the MVA government to work in the interest of people. He, however, said Maharashtra or its people cannot be "troubled" for long. "No politician is going to construct his/her bungalow or farmhouse at the Kanjurmarg land. This is a matter of development of Mumbai, Maharashtra and eventually of the country. It is unfortunate if such a decision has come in this case," the Rajya Sabha member said. The Bombay High Court on Wednesday stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in the Kanjurmarg area for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land. The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car shed depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The previous BJP-led government in the state had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line 3 at Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project. The present Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government -- comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress -- recently took a decision to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. Raut said the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in the state was to construct a housing project for police and weaker sections on the Kanjurmarg site concerned. "That means the land belongs to the (state) government, isn't it?" he asked. "...but what has happened suddenly, it seems there is some conspiracy to see that the Maharashtra government is not allowed to carry out work in the interest of the people or development," the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said. He said there are lakhs of other cases to which the judiciary should pay attention. Referring to reports of a Sikh preacher committing suicide (in connection with farmers' agitation), Raut said the Centre and judiciary should look into such matters. "People now have doubts in their minds whether such decisions (on car shed project) are coming because there is no BJP government in Maharashtra," he alleged. After the HC's decision, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday asked the state government to give up its "ego". When asked about it, Raut quipped that the definition of "ego" needs to be checked now. Where is ego if the Aarey forest and animals there are saved by shifting the car shed project to Kanjurmarg? the Shiv Sena leader asked. "It (to save the forest and wildlife) is a national duty. It is the programme of the Centre to save tigers, jungle, birds and rivers. It is the programme of the Centre, of the Narendra Modi government," he said. Despite the efforts to save the forest, the opposition in Maharashtra is "creating hurdles" in the work, which is not in the interest of Maharashtra and the people, he said. "The court should have understood this," Raut said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/hc-decision-on-metro-car-shed-work-unfortunate-sanjay-raut-928334.html

"I was born in Goa. My father and grandfather were born in Goa too. I will have to find out my ancestral roots before my grandfather though. My kuldaivat (family deity) is Bhagwati and my village deity is at Kothambi," Sawant told reporters at a press conference in Panaji. The Devi Bhagwati temple and Kothambi village are both located in North Goa district. Sawant has been accused by some opposition leaders, including former Deputy Chief Minister and Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai of heading a 'Sawantwadi government', while also questioning Sawant's roots. Sawantwadi is a sub-district in Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district which borders Goa. Last year, the Chief Minister was also caught in the eye of a storm after the opposition accused him of purchasing large tracts of land spread over thousands of square meters in Sindhudurg district.  Sawant had however maintained that the land had been purchased through a bank transaction. While firmly reiterating his Goan roots, Sawant however, at the same time also let out a subtle missive against Sardesai -- who was his cabinet colleague in 2019 -- wondering how criticism about his lineage could come from someone who was born overseas. Vijai Sardesai was born on 14 June, 1970, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The to and fro between Sawant and Sardesai comes against a backdrop of a rising tide of 'regional pride', amid fears of large scale in-migration to the coastal state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/chided-time-and-again-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-clarifies-his-goan-origin-928389.html

Romil Ramgarhia, former COO of the BARC, was arrested in the afternoon by a team of Mumbai crime branch, which is probing the TRP case, he said. This is the 14th arrest in the case. "During the probe, Ramgarhia's alleged involvement in the case came to light, following which he was placed under arrest today," the police official said. Following the arrest, Ramgarhia was produced before a metropolitan magistrate court here, which remanded him in police custody till December 19. Police sought his custody saying they needed to interrogate him in connection with the case. They also said that his custody was required in order to retrieve electronic evidence from him. On Sunday, the police had arrested Republic Media Network's Chief Executive Officer Vikas Khanchandani in connection with the scam. However, he was granted bail by a court on Wednesday. The police began a probe into the alleged scam after ratings agency BARC filed a complaint through Hansa Research Agency about rigging of TRP by some channels. TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. The BARC engaged Hansa to install and maintain barometers which record TV viewership data at sample households. It was alleged that some of these families were being bribed to tune into certain channels to ramp up their TRP. In a charge sheet filed recently, the police alleged that an official of Hansa paid money to sample households to tune into Box Cinema, Fakt Marathi, Maha Movie and Republic TV. The Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/trp-scam-romil-ramgarhia-ex-coo-of-rating-agency-barc-arrested-928421.html

Vincent John goes by several aliases - Thorinathan, Michael Joseph, Dilip Stephen, Michael Fernando, Vijay Kiran, Rajiv Desai, Nirmal Andrews, SP Kumar, Sanjay Machado, Sanjay Rane and Ravi Anand. The Vashi police station of Navi Mumbai satellite township in Thane district has made the arrest after detailed investigations. “Vincent John was in possession of as many as 58 PAN cards and Aadhar cards,” police officials said. The accused has 187 similar fraud cases pan-India, and is wanted in several cases in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and other states and cities. The accused also duped the five-star Hotel Regenza, part of the Tunga Hotels chain in the city. Elaborating on the modus operandi, the Navi Mumbai police said that the accused would approach various five-star, deluxe and high-end hotels all over India, posing as a man with top corporate background. He would impress the staff with his lavish habits and good English, book the most luxurious suites, order the most expensive food and alcoholic drinks. “He attempted a similar strategy even at the Hotel Regenza. He also booked a banquet hall for a dozen guests for a business meet-cum-party for which high-end orders for food and beverages were placed. He even took a laptop from the hotel purportedly for a presentation." police said. Later, the hotel authorities realised that the guest had not arrived at the banquet venue and they started a search for him, only to discover that he had vanished. The hotel lodged a complaint with the police, which immediately launched investigation and nabbed the accused. The elusive Vincent John, who managed to escape for long, has also confessed that he would sell the expensive liquor, cigarettes and other stuff he would pick up without clearing the bills from the deluxe hotels, to finance his lavish lifestyle, which included air travel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/modern-day-mr-natwarlal-who-duped-several-hotels-nabbed-in-mumbai-928513.html
