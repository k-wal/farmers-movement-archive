18-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||GP polls: 'Boycott' a tool to grab attention in Malnad region||The people of Malnad region have made desperate attempts to highlight their problems, by boycotting the upcoming Gram Panchayat elections. The people of Hethuru, Hongadahalla and Heggadde GPs have not filed any nomination and 28 people, who had filed nominations in Devaladakere GP limits have withdrawn the nominations. Similarly, five people who had filed papers from Agani village too have withdrawn. The efforts of the Police and Revenue department officials and also Assistant Commissioner to convince the people to participate in the election process did not help. The people of the Malnad region are facing a lot of problems. The government has neither found a solution to the wild jumbo menace, that has claimed several lives, nor have taken any steps to provide compensation to the affected. Monsoon season is the worst, with the roads turning slushy and frequent power outages. Besides, they fear that the Kasturirangan Committee report on Western Ghats would restrict them further. Hence, opposing its implementation, some villages have boycotted the polls. With the National Green Tribunal giving directions, the Union government has been taking all steps for the report's implementation. As many areas would come under the Eco sensitive zone, the people are worried. They have decided to boycott the polls to draw the attention of the governments to their problems. Moreover, the locals residents claim that most of them are not clear about the Kasturirangan report, and demand that the report be published in Kannada language, to enable them to understand it better. Only after this, the government should decide about its implementation, they demanded. The villagers claimed that the report is based on satellite survey, and all the green areas like paddy fields have been notified as Eco sensitive zones, affecting many villages. There are rumours that the houses should be painted green, electric lights should be put off after 7 pm and no permission will be given for road asphaltation, if the report is implemented. Hence, the report should be available in Kannada, to clear the confusion, the residents said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/gp-polls-boycott-a-tool-to-grab-attention-in-malnad-region-928963.html

Speaking to media persons here, on Friday, he said that the blocking of the entry of the Chairman Prathapachandra Shetty, into the Council is unconstitutional, when he is the chief . “The Deputy Chairman, S L Dharmegowda or whoever, is only a deputy to the chairman. The Deputy Chairman can preside over the proceedings of the Council, only when the chairman delegates the responsibility. After the Chairman occupied his seat, the opposing MLCs could have told him that they do not have faith in him,” he said. “There is a procedure to change the chairman. A notice should be served 14 days in advance. Even then, if the chairman feels that the notice is not either proper or in order, he could reject it. The chairman does not lose authority as soon as a notice is served,” Siddaramaiah said. “The BJP is good at telling lies.

How can the encroachment of the Chairman’s seat by the Deputy Chairman described? What rights do they have? Who are the villains?” he asked. To a query on the rumours about former minister C M Ibrahim joining the JD(S), he said, Ibrahim will not go to the JD(S).

Going by the visuals captured of the proceedings that day, it appears that the secretary was facilitating the ruling party's attempt to take over the Chairperson's seat, Shetty has said. "Bringing shame to the House, some legislators stopped me from entering the House and later allowed the deputy chairperson to occupy my chair. I direct you to submit a detailed report on everything that transpired in the House before I was able to enter and even after I left the premises," the notice stated. That apart, the recorded visuals show that the secretary, who is supposed to be in-charge of the House in the chairperson's absence, did not intervene when the deputy chairperson occupied the seat "illegally". It appeared that the secretary had failed in her duty by handing out files to the deputy chairperson, facilitating him to continue the session without the Chairperson, Shetty has said. "You have acted in violation of the rules and beyond the scope of your position as the secretary," Shetty stated, asking Mahalakshmi why action should not be initiated against her under Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. Mahalakshmi has been asked to respond to the notice within 48 hours. On December 15, Congress, JD(S) and BJP legislators brawled over the Council Chairperson's seat, leading to a ruckus in the House. The Council was adjourned sine die following the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-legislative-council-pandemonium-show-cause-notice-to-council-secretary-928665.html

He completed the undertaking in 25 minutes sixteen seconds (25:16:63). Kharvi started swimming at 8.55 am and completed it at 9.20 am. He used the breaststroke style in the Padmasana posture to swim. Elated over the achievement, Kharvi told DH that noone so far had created this record in the Padmasana posture. “The DVD of the video of the feat which is signed by two gazetted officers will be sent to India Book of Records. I am planning to send a copy to the Limca Book of Records as well.” Stating that it’s a rare achievement, he said “sitting with Padmasana posture on the floor itself is difficult. I swam with legs tied in chains in the posture. I am happy that I could complete it. Now I am feeling relaxed.” “It was my Guru B K Naik, who motivated me throughout. Though I had learnt the art of swimming in the sea when I was in the third standard, it was B K Naik who fine-tuned my swimming skills.” “As I hail from the fishermen community, I learnt swimming early in life. When I was in class 9, I used to go fishing in boats along with elders. After I joined work, I used to take part in swimming competitions organised for teachers in the taluk and district level, where my skill was noticed by my teacher B K Naik,” he explained. “I had planned this a few months ago. Due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown, I could not take it up,” he said. Hailing from Kanchugodu in Kundapura in Udupi district, Kharvi has been working as a teacher at Kalmanja Government Higher Primary School, in Bantwal taluk. Kharvi said that he had won two gold medals and one bronze medal at the national-level swimming competition held during the Master Games Federation of India at Vadodara in Gujarat in January 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/mangaluru-teacher-kharvi-sets-record-by-swimming-in-padmasana-posture-with-legs-tied-928745.html

18-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka Council ruckus: Chairman issues show cause notice to House Secretary||Karnataka Legislative Council Chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty has issued a show cause notice to the Council Secretary for her alleged dereliction of duty and exceeding jurisdictional limits during the proceedings of the House on December 15 when it witnessed a ruckus over a no-confidence motion against him. Asking the official to explain why action should not be initiated against her, he also issued an order to the secretary, K R Mahalakshmi, seeking a report on what all happened in the House from the beginning till he came and adjourned it and after his exit. In the December 16 show cause notice, Shetty raised questions regarding her conduct being an officer holding administrative responsibilities of the proceedings and accused her of irresponsibility, dereliction of duty, and functioning by exceeding her jurisdictional limits. The Council had witnessed a high drama on Tuesday with BJP-JDS and Congress members hurling abuses and pushing each other and Deputy Chairman being pulled down from the Chairman's seat, over a row pertaining to the no-confidence motion sought to be moved against Shetty. Amid the pandemonium and chaos which many senior members termed as "black mark" and "unprecedented" in the Council's over a century old history, it was adjourned sine-die within minutes after it met for the day. "The happenings on December 15 including- ruling party members restricting my entry to the House as its Chairman and their conduct against the rules has come under intense criticism in the media, and this has brought disrespect to the legislative council and its traditions which has over a century old history," Shetty said. He sought a report on the happenings in the Council in order to provide an authentic explanation as the head of the house in response to the criticisms about the ruckus. The Chairman said on viewing the video recording of the house proceedings of that day, he came across several instances of "dereliction of duty" by the secretary she aided the Deputy Chairman, who had occupied the chair "against rules", by providing him some documents. This was an evidence of dereliction of duty by the Secretary as an officer holding administrative responsibilities of the proceedings, he contended. He asked the Secretary to provide an explanation within 48 hours as to why action should not be initiated against her under the Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. The ruckus in the council followed the attempt by the ruling BJP and JD(S) to take up the no-confidence motion against Shetty, despite it not finding mention in the day's agenda. Shetty had rejected the notice for the motion citing procedural lapses and pointing out that no specific charges were made against him. However, insisting on going ahead with it, BJP and JD(S) had attempted to take up the motion by having the Deputy Chairman on the chair. In their defence both parties had said Shetty cannot hold the proceedings as Chairman, as the no-confidence was against him and that he did not enjoy the support of majority members of the House. This was resisted strongly by the Congress, resulting in unruly scenes with members from both sides hurling abuses and pushing each other and Deputy Chairman being pulled down from the Chairman's seat. Shetty was elected as the Chairman of the council during the Congress-JD(S) coalition government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-council-ruckus-chairman-issues-show-cause-notice-to-house-secretary-928847.html

However, all missions and posts ensure due security precautions in this regard,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said, reacting to the reports that the CPC members had got employment by the consulates of India and several other nations in Shanghai in eastern China. Srivastava said that the MEA was not in a position to independently verify the reports. The Embassy of China in New Delhi stated that the allegation hyping up the "CPC infiltration" was groundless and reflected “ideological prejudice”. “The members of the CPC are not monsters or scourges. They are all ordinary human beings who serve the people with their hearts and souls, Ji Rong, a spokesperson of the embassy, said in a statement. “Is there really anything to be afraid of?” It is absolutely “ridiculous” and “wantonly smearing” to maliciously label CPC members as spies, added the spokesperson of the embassy of the communist country in New Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/coronavirus-embassies-take-precautions-while-recruiting-local-staff-says-mea-928577.html

18-12-2020||National||India may need to spend $1.8 billion on Covid-19 vaccines in first phase, documents show||India will have to spend $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion in the first phase of a coronavirus vaccination programme, even after getting support under the COVAX global vaccine-sharing scheme, according to estimates by the GAVI vaccines alliance. India, which has the world's second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, plans to inoculate 300 million people over the next six to eight months, likely with vaccines from AstraZeneca, Russia's Sputnik, Zydus Cadila and India's own Bharat Biotech. Documents reviewed by Reuters underline the scale of the funding challenge India faces to immunise its vast population, with 600 million shots required in the first wave alone for critical workers and people most at risk from Covid-19. If India got 190-250 million shots of the vaccine under the COVAX facility - a best case scenario - then the government would need to line up about $1.4 billion to make up for the shortfall, according to an unpublished report prepared for GAVI's three-day board meeting that began on Tuesday. On the other hand, if India received a lower allocation of 95-125 million doses, then the cost to the government of procuring additional shots would go up to $1.8 billion. By comparison, India's 2020/21 federal budget allocated just under $10 billion to healthcare. India's health and finance ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters e-mail seeking comments. Support Package The COVAX plan, co-led by the World Health Organization and GAVI, aims to provide poor and middle-income countries with diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines through a fund known as the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, set up last April. The Indian government has not provided any estimate of the cost of its vaccine programme, though it has said all resources will be provided to protect the population. GAVI, an alliance of governments, drug companies, charities and international organisations, said it was in discussions with the Indian government over a support package. "Providing a low range of support would exacerbate the country's ability to allocate enough resources to mitigate the risks of continued transmission of Covid-19," the GAVI report said. The GAVI report identified India's economic burden due to the pandemic as "disproportionate" and suggested a donor-funded plan of $1.3 billion to secure 190-250 million doses. The plan needs to be approved by the GAVI alliance board. According to a vaccination plan shared with international donors, India aims to inoculate 10 million frontline health workers by February, 20 million essential workers by the following month and then 270 million people by August, mostly people above the age of 50 and those with other health issues that make them more vulnerable. India also needed $30 million to $80 million for the insfrastructure to transport and store vaccines that must be kept at very low temperatures, the GAVI report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-may-need-to-spend-18-billion-on-covid-19-vaccines-in-first-phase-documents-show-928611.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah sought a reply from both the artists within six weeks. The court clarified that both the artists were not required to be present personally before it. In its written order, the court noted that the Attorney General has given consent for initiating contempt on a request made by petitioners law students and advocate Abhyudaya Mishra, Shrirang Katneshwarkar, Skand Bajpai filed contempt petitions against Kamra. Similarly a law student, Aditya Kashyap took a nod from the Attorney General on December 1 before filing his contempt petition against Taneja. A consent from the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is statutory requirement for contempt proceedings in the top court.  On Thursday, the court had reserved its order after hearing the counsel from the petitioners. Kamra had posted "objectionable tweets" against the Supreme Court and its judges, including Justice D Y Chandrachud for taking up bail plea by Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami on November 11. Likewise, following the top court's order granting bail to Goswami, Taneja through a Twitter handle @sanitarypanels posted a number of tweets including one in which she described the Supreme Court in an apparently derogatory manner. Another tweet posted by her in August alleged to quid pro quo due to nomination of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha and the Ayodhya case judgement by a five-judge bench in November, 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-sends-notice-to-kumal-kamra-rachita-taneja-in-contempt-case-928643.html

Russia is already testing the first samples of Sputnik V that were produced in India, its embassy in New Delhi said on Twitter on Friday, sharing a news story in which their vaccine czar Kirill Dmitriev was quoted. "In India, we have agreements with four large manufacturers," Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) told Rossiya 24 TV, according to news agency TASS. "India will produce about 300 million doses or more of the vaccine for us next year." India is the world's biggest vaccine maker and its pharmaceutical industry is freeing up capacity and accelerating investments ahead of the global rush for COVID-19 shots. India's Hetero Biopharma has already announced a deal with the RDIF to make more than 100 million doses of Sputnik V, whose efficacy has been found to be more than 91% in trials done outside India. It was not immediately clear which other Indian companies would make the vaccine, though Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd is conducting clinical trials of it in India and will also distribute the finished vaccine. Indian officials have said they may approve some vaccines for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks. So far only three vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer /BioNTech and Indian company Bharat Biotech have applied for urgent approval. India's health ministry on Friday reported 22,890 new coronavirus infections, taking its total to just shy of 10 million. It is the world's second-worst affected country after the United States, which has recorded 16.9 million cases. India's deaths rose by 338, taking the total to 144,789.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-make-30-crore-sputnik-v-doses-in-2021-says-rdif-ceo-928657.html

The apex court also directed dedicated Covid-19 hospitals to take a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department within four weeks and said that failure to do so will invite punitive action. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said that those hospitals, whose fire NOC has expired, will have to get it renewed within four weeks. The bench, also comprising justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, said that issue of political rallies and observance of Covid-19 guidelines will be looked into by the Election Commission. The apex court had earlier taken cognisance of a fire incident in a designated Covid-19 hospital in Gujarat's Rajkot in which several patients had died.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-directs-states-to-carry-out-fire-safety-audit-of-dedicated-covid-19-hospitals-928658.html

The ministry further stated that it was advisable to receive a complete schedule of the anti-coronavirus vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with Covid-19 as this will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. It also said that protective level of antibodies generally develop two weeks after receiving the second dose. The ministry listed a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday night and responded to questions like if taking a vaccine was mandatory, how long does it take for the antibodies to develop and if it was necessary for a Covid recovered person to take the vaccine. "Vaccination for Covid-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of the vaccine for protecting one-self against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers," the ministry said in response to a question on if it is mandatory to take the shot. The ministry said that vaccine trials are under different stages of finalisation. The government is geared to launch a vaccine for Covid-19 soon, it said. Six vaccines -- one developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR, second one developed by Zydus Cadila, third one by Gennova, Oxford vaccine, trial of which is conducted by Serum Institute of India, Sputnik V vaccine which is being manufactured by Dr Reddy's Lab, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Russia's Gamaleya National Centre and the sixth one manufactured by Biological E Ltd, Hyderabad, in collaboration with MIT, USA -- are undergoing clinical trials in India. On whether a vaccine will be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time and what can be the possible side-effects, the ministry said vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy. "Covid-19 vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection," the ministry said in the FAQs. It said states have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any vaccine-related side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery. Two doses of vaccine, 28 days apart, need to be taken by an individual to complete the vaccination schedule, it stated. The ministry said anyone taking medicines for illnesses like cancer, diabetes, hypertension etc, can take the Covid-19 vaccine as persons with one or more of these comorbid conditions are considered high-risk category and they need to get the vaccination. In response to a question on whether the vaccine will be given to everyone simultaneously, the ministry said that based on the potential availability of vaccines, the government has selected priority groups to be vaccinated as they are at higher risk. In the initial phase, Covid 19 vaccine will be provided to the priority group- health care and front-line workers. The 50 plus age group may also begin early based on vaccine availability. The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through their registered mobile number regarding the health facility where the vaccination will be provided and the scheduled time. This will be done to avoid any inconvenience in registration and vaccination of beneficiaries, the ministry said in the FAQs. On why healthcare providers and frontline workers are being chosen for receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the ministry said the government has prioritised the most at risk/high risk groups which will get the vaccine first. Healthcare providers have led the battle against Covid-19 from the front. The government wants them to be able to continue your work, without the fear of risk associated with the virus. "Therefore, healthcare and frontline workers are among the first group of people to be vaccinated,"' it said. The ministry said registration of a beneficiary is mandatory for vaccination for Covid-19. Only after registration the information on the session site to visit and time will be shared. Following online registration, beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number on the due date, place and time of vaccination. ID with Photo such as driving license, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card, PAN Card, passbooks issued by Bank/Post Office, passport • Pension Document , service identity card issued to employees by Central/ State Govt./ Public Limited Companies and voter ID may be produced at the time of registration. On getting due dose of vaccine, the beneficiary will receive SMS on their registered mobile number. After all doses of vaccine are administered, a QR code based certificate will also be sent to the registered mobile number of the beneficiary, the ministry said. On preventive measures and precautions, the ministry said, "We request you to rest at the vaccination centre for at least half an hour after taking the Covid-19 vaccine. "Inform the nearest health authorities/ANM/ASHA in case you feel any discomfort or uneasiness subsequently. Remember to continue following key Covid Appropriate Behaviours like wearing of mask, maintaining hand sanitization and physical distance," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-vaccination-will-be-voluntary-in-india-928663.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said it was only "a question of accommodation" and the government ought to keep in mind that businesses should not be hampered in the prevailing pandemic situation. "Where there is a will, there is a way. Tell your officials that," the bench said to the counsel representing the government. The observations came during hearing of a plea moved by an association representing traders of fresh fruits, flowers and vegetables challenging a July 9 notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) permitting import of flowers from the Chennai airport only. They said they had made representations to the government before approaching the court, but no decision was taken. The bench directed the Centre to decide the representations moved by the association within 8 weeks of receiving the order copy from the court and disposed of the plea. The court said the government will keep in mind the plight of the association members and that there should be a rationale basis for issuing such a notification, when it is taking a decision on the representation. "In the prevalent situation, ensure that no one's business is hampered," the bench said to the government. Earlier there were no such restrictions on import of flowers which include roses, carnations, orchids, chrysanthemums and lilies, the association's petition had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/one-airport-could-have-been-designated-in-north-india-for-import-of-flowers-hc-928679.html

The flames were spotted around 3 am at the Dhupguri market by a shopkeeper, they said. Six fire tenders were rushed to the spot but the firefighting operations could not be started for some time as there were no water bodies nearby, officials said. Finally, water was fetched from the Kumlai nullah, while several shops were gutted in the meantime. "It was very difficult to get water to fight the fire as there are no water bodies near the market," District Fire Officer Pradip Sarkar said. Four more fire tenders were brought in from Dinhata in Coochbehar district, Toofanganj and other areas to douse the flames, officials said. The blaze was brought under control around 6 am, they said. No one was injured in the incident, they said, adding that the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh visited the area and spoke to officials. Local MLA Mitali Roy of the Trinamool Congress was also at the spot. "I have come here on the instructions of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee," Ghosh said. He also briefed Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim about the situation and urged him to take steps to hand over the market to Dhupguri Municipality. At present, it is in the jurisdiction of the zilla parishad. "Around 150 shops were gutted in the fire," the minister said. The state government will extend all possible help to the shopkeepers at this time of crisis, he said, adding that the gutted shops will be reconstructed. Environmentalists alleged rampant filling up of water bodies in the area, leading to the crisis for water. Water bodies have been filled up in the area, causing the water crisis at the time of need, as a result of which so many shops were gutted, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/major-fire-in-north-bengal-market-150-shops-gutted-928684.html
18-12-2020||National||'Don't want credit': PM Modi slams Opposition over politics on farm laws||A combative Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hit out at the Opposition for "creating hurdles" in the farm sector reforms initiated during the UPA regime, out of sheer apprehension of BJP getting credit for bringing long-awaited changes to agriculture in the country. "Their problem is how Modi has done it. Why Modi should get credit for it. Give credit to your manifesto and not to me. I just want the progress of farmers, but stop misleading them on the issue," Modi said, addressing a virtual farmers' meeting organised across Madhya Pradesh. BJP's all-out efforts to woo farmers, at a time when thousands were demonstrating on the borders of the national capital, was apparent as Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was seen showering petals on the gathering of farmers in Raisen in Madhya Pradesh. Modi said farm sector reforms were long overdue and introduced after widespread consultations with a cross-section of experts and farmers' representatives. "The new agriculture laws have not come overnight but political parties, agriculture experts and progressive farmers have demanded it for a long time. "In the last 20-22 years, the Centre and the state governments have deliberated on these agriculture reforms in detail. Farmer bodies, agriculture scientists and farmers too were continuously demanding them," he said. The Prime Minister sought to dispel apprehension over scrapping of the minimum support price and APMC system. "Not a single mandi was closed in the last six months. In fact, the government is spending Rs 500 crore on their modernisation," Modi said. Seeking to reassure farmers on MSP, he said the NDA government had procured more food grains at MSP than previous governments. "Over six months have passed since the implementation of the new agriculture laws, and crops were purchased at MSP even during the coronavirus pandemic and in the same mandis (APMC markets) where farmers used to sell (earlier). No sane person will accept that MSP will be scrapped. Nothing will be a bigger lie and conspiracy than this," Modi said, assuring that MSP for crops will continue. The prime minister accused the Opposition parties of "sitting on the Swaminathan Committee report for eight years" during the UPA rule. "Our government treated farmers as "annadata" and implemented the Swaminathan Committee report. We have given 1.5 times more MSP than the cost of production," the Prime Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-want-credit-pm-modi-slams-opposition-over-politics-on-farm-laws-928697.html
18-12-2020||National||Farmers' protest: Narendra Singh Tomar 'hopeful' to reach solution before year-end||As formal talks to end farmers' agitation against three farm laws remain deadlocked, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has said the government is continuing informal discussions with various groups to end the stalemate but there was no point talking to those "shooting from peasants' shoulders". The minister also hoped that a resolution should be reached before the year ends and asserted that the Modi government is committed to address all genuine concerns of the farming community. He put the blame on opposition parties for misleading the farmers and accused them of changing their stance on the reform process and politicising the issue. In an interview with PTI, Tomar -- who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash -- asserted that the three new farm laws are beneficial for farmers and the government is ready to give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) and mandi system will continue. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders for more than three weeks. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock, but the unions are demanding complete rollback of the central laws. "We have constantly been holding discussions with farmers' unions... Overall, our effort is to reach a solution through dialogue with them. We are still open for talks. We are holding discussions with unions. I hope through dialogue we can move towards reaching a solution," Tomar said while replying to a query about the stalemate and way forward. "Informal talks are going on. I am hopeful of some way out," he added. Whether the Supreme Court constituted committee will take over talks and find a solution or the government will continue its efforts, Tomar said the government has kept its door open for negotiations with farm leaders and would wait for the Supreme Court's order for the next course of action. "The matter is sub judice. After the court's order, we will study and take a call... We will wait for the court's direction." Farmer unions, who are concerned about peasants, should raise problems of the farming community so that the government can find a solution, the minister said, and asked Unions not to stress upon repealing these legislations which have been enacted for the benefit of farmers. On farmers' unions asking the government not to hold "parallel talks" with other groups and "malign" the protesting farmers, he said, "Farm leaders, who are concerned about welfare of farmers, should discuss peasants' problems. Why should it matter if the acts are repealed or not?" The government can consider changes to the laws if they convince successfully the clause by clause objections, he said. When asked on his recent remark that he would engage with "genuine" farm leaders, the minister said, "When I say genuine, I mean those who are really concerned about farmers. There is no point to talking with those who want to shoot from the shoulders of farmers." The government is there to resolve the farmers' problems but unless the specific problems are not told, how can the government offer solutions, he said. Asked how the government plans to give minimum support price assurance, Tomar said: "We will give in writing that till date the way MSP was continuing will continue in future as well. No one should have doubt on this." The MSP system is an administrative decision and there cannot be a law for everything, he said. "To run the entire country, there are laws. Under laws, there are rules. There are also administrative decisions. Can there be doubt on the government's decisions? Till date, MSP was in operation. Was it under any law?" he added. Noting that when intentions are right, solutions will definitely emerge, Tomar said the Modi government has enacted the three farm laws with clear intention and the outcome will also be good. Asked if the farmers issue will be resolved before 2020, he said, "Yes. I have full hope... Everyone has their own agenda. My agenda is 'kisan'. Tell me which provision of the farm laws are hurting farmers and convince me. We are ready for discussion." On Akali Dal's charge that BJP was real 'Tukde-Tukde gang' and wanted to divide Hindu-Muslim and now Hindu-Sikh, he said: "The political parties should not do politics in the name of farmers. These are the same parties which supported these reforms during elections. The party which you are mentioning is opposing after the laws were passed and till this protest." "In the Congress election manifesto for the 2019 general election, in Punjab's assembly poll manifesto, be it Congress, Akali Dal or AAP, all have talked about reforms. Now they are changing their stand," he said. Asked if the protest is anti-Modi or there are genuine concerns of farmers with the laws, Tomar said: "In the protest, there are farmers. As agriculture minister, I am looking at them as farmers. We are holding discussions from an agricultural point of view. My effort is to speak to farmers' leaders so that we are able to resolve their problems." In the previous five rounds of talks, the minister said the government asked the unions' leaders to share their objections on provisions of the acts but they could not share clause by clause concerns and therefore the Centre sent a draft proposal suggesting few amendments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-narendra-singh-tomar-hopeful-to-reach-solution-before-year-end-928709.html

The court passed its order, acting on a petition filed by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government. The top court put the matter for consideration in January. The state government submitted that the HC has framed the question, to examine "breakdown of constitutional machinery" in the state, in "an unprecedented manner and without any basis or pleadings by any of the parties to that effect". In its plea, the state government contended the order passed in one habeas corpus petition was replicated in as many as 14 cases. "Under the scheme of the Constitution, it is Article 356 that deals with the failure of constitutional machinery in a State. Under this Article, if the president, on receipt of a report from the Governor of a State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the President can impose presidents Rule. This is a power exclusively vested in the Executive," it said. The state government also submitted that the order was not only unprecedented but is also "uncalled for, violative of the basic structure of the Constitution and grossly misconceived". It asked the top court to set aside the HC's order saying it was completely unsustainable. "The High Court has completely ignored the warning that the Supreme Court has, time and again, sounded advising the courts to respect the other co-equal organs of the State and to refrain from assuming executive powers to itself," it said. It is to be noted that CM Reddy, through his office, had gone public on October 10 with his October 6 letter to the Chief Justice of India, alleging the top court and HC judges of unfair dealing with cases concerning the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-andhra-pradesh-hcs-order-on-breakdown-of-constitutional-machinery-in-state-928748.html

Justice Navin Chawla issued notices to the Delhi government and police, and sought their stand on the petitions by the two AAP leaders by January 14. The Delhi Police, represented by Additional Standing Counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that permissions were denied to the two AAP MLAs on the basis of orders passed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibiting large gatherings in the city in view of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. The police also told the court that in accordance with a Supreme Court order, it has issued a standing order prohibiting protests and dharnas in residential areas in the national capital. The court asked the police to indicate its stand on the affidavits. Both AAP MLAs wanted to stage 'dharnas' outside the residences of the home minister and the L-G on December 13 to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, but they were denied permission. Both were detained by police on December 13, along with some other AAP leaders, for attempting to protest at the two sites without the necessary permission. During the hearing of the two matters on Thursday, the Delhi Police had told the court that protests or dharnas are prohibited in residential areas of the national capital in accordance with the Supreme Court's direction and areas designated for demonstrations were Ramlila Maidan and Jantar Mantar. The court had suggested to police that the AAP leaders could be allowed to hold the protest subject to whatever restrictions the agency wants to impose on them as only four persons would be staging the dharna at each of the two sites. "They will give an undertaking to abide by the restrictions," the court had said on Thursday. The two AAP MLAs have contended that while they were denied permission to protest outside the residences of the Home Minister and the LG on the ground of Covid-19 restrictions and law and order concerns, MCD councillors of BJP have been permitted to continue staging a 'dharna' outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence. They have also contended that while they sought permission for only four persons to protest at each of the two sites, un-numbered persons are staging a demonstration outside Kejriwal's residence. They have alleged that this indicates the arbitrariness in the decision taken by the Delhi police and have sought quashing of its December 12 communication rejecting their request to hold a protest outside the residences of Shah and Baijal. The Delhi police had rejected their request by citing a November 28 order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) which prohibits till December 31 all social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions or other gatherings throughout the national capital to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Additionally, the police in Atishi's case had denied the request on "law and order point of view" and in Chadha's case, on the ground that section 144 IPC is already in force in the area of New Delhi district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-seeks-police-stand-on-pleas-of-raghav-atishi-to-protest-outside-homes-of-amit-shah-delhi-l-g-928753.html

Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav said the railways has suffered massive losses in passenger revenue due to the suspension of train services because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yadav also said the railways saw an 87-per cent drop in the earnings from the passenger segment so far this year, compared to the last year due to suspension of train services. However, he said the earnings from freight loading has been encouraging. By December, the national transporter had already achieved 97 per cent of last year's loading. "It is not possible to give a definite date for the resumption of normal train services. The general managers have been in discussion with the state governments and we will resume the services when and where we get the go-ahead. Even now, the situation is not normal," he said. Addressing a press conference, he said so far in the current fiscal, the railways' earnings from passenger revenue have been Rs 4,600 crore and estimates show that by March 2021, the figure is expected to rise to Rs 15,000 crore. "So far, our earnings from passenger revenue are Rs 4,600 crore and by the year-end, our aim is to take our total earnings from the passenger segment to Rs 15,000 crore. In the last fiscal, our earnings from this segment were Rs 53,000 crore. This makes our earnings 87% less than last year," Mr Yadav said. He pointed out that even the trains that are currently in operation are witnessing around 30-40% occupancy on an average, reflecting that the fear of the pandemic is still there. At present, Railways is operating 1,089 special trains, while the Kolkata Metro is running 60 per cent of its services, the Mumbai suburban is running 88% trains and 50% of the Chennai suburban services are in operation. Senior railway officials are closely monitoring the situation and normal train services will be resumed in a slow but phased manner, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-possible-to-give-definite-date-for-resumption-of-normal-train-services-railway-board-chairman-928758.html

She said the new Textile Policy is on the anvil, observing that the previous national Textile Policy was unveiled two decades ago. "We are currently on the anvil of also bringing to the fore the new Indian textile policy, the last time India had a textile policy was two decades ago," Irani, Minister for Textiles and Women & Child Development, said while virtually addressing Assocham Foundation Week 2020. Highlighting the impact of agricultural reforms on Indian industry, Irani said, "the Government of India in a determined effort has ensured that the MSP operations undergo with the help of technology and those who participate in the MSP operation receive direct benefit transfer of their funds in to their bank accounts.” "In 2013-14, in the cotton segment, the MSP operations were only worth Rs 90 crore while last year, the MSP operations in the cotton segment alone reached a value in total of Rs 28,500 crore. This season, in the cotton segment MSP operations worth Rs 14,659 crore have already been undertaken and 9.63 lakh farmers producing cotton in the country have directly received into their bank accounts an amount of Rs 11,799 crore, this is done in only two months, said the minister. She said this means when we look at the policy reforms, the idea called Aatmanirbhar Bharat cannot come to a fruition when we work in silos. "So while on one hand the Government of India undertakes agricultural reforms, on the other hand we leverage technology to provide farm support and undertake MSP operations," said the minister. Besides, Irani said, if you look at extra-long staple cotton, we currently produce only four lakh bales. Looking at the agricultural reforms, if the industry conjoins its efforts with farming community and "we raise the potential growth of production of ELS cotton from four lakh bales to 50 lakh bales, then the impact on the Indian cotton textiles industry will be such that we will increase our businesses from the current USD 18 billion to USD 80 billion, that is the potential that needs to be leveraged and explored", the minister stated. Talking about agricultural reforms she underlined that when reform takes place in one segment, its impact is determined across the value chain of Indian economy. "When agricultural reforms came into being, it was not a happenstance. It was a contribution of dialogues and deliberations that have been undertaken for 19 years across industries, agriculture sector, farmer organisations and specialists who want to leverage technology in the field of agriculture so that potential benefit is accrued not only by farmers but also industry and citizens at large," Irani said. The minister also noted that India has become the second largest manufacturer and exporter of personal protective equipment (PPE). "When Covid-19 pandemic hit Indian shores, not many across the globe were confident of India's response, today as Minister of Textiles I can say that one of the greatest examples of Indian resilience was given by the Indian textiles industry in the manufacturing of PPE suits, provision for which was among the consistent demands of frontline workers and the medical community was across the world.” She said that while the textiles industry was not prepared for, but it rose to this challenge. “It was an effort which involved almost all ministries and industry segments in support of Indian textiles industry.” Assocham President Niranjan Hiranandani assured the industry's support to the government to reach the goals of Atmanirbhar Bharat and a USD 5 trillion economy. The Centre has launched a Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) worth Rs 1.46 lakh crore for 10 sectors to boost domestic manufacturing, create jobs and reduce dependence on imports. Under the scheme, Rs 10,683 crore have been allocated for textile products - man-made Fibre (MMF) segment and technical textiles segments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-working-on-structure-to-roll-out-pli-scheme-for-technical-textiles-mmf-smriti-irani-928775.html
18-12-2020||National||New farm laws have not come overnight, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asserted that the farm laws were not brought overnight and even opposition parties advocated such laws but are criticising these reforms now as they are upset because Modi has done it, and said the government was ready "with our heads bowed, our hands folded, with humility" to allay any concerns over the issue. The Prime Minister's fresh overtures came during an address to farmers of Madhya Pradesh even as Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar expressed hope of resolving the issue of protesting farmers before the new year. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, continued to protest at Delhi borders for more than three weeks as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers' unions remained deadlocked with protesting agriculturalists refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the newly enacted laws. "In the last 20-22 years, the Center and the state governments have deliberated on these agriculture reforms in detail. The new agriculture laws have not been drafted overnight but political parties, agriculture experts and progressive farmers have demanded it for a long time," Modi said in his nearly an hour-long address through video conferencing. He stepped up his attack against the opposition parties, saying "their problem is how Modi has done it and why Modi should get credit for it...I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep all the credit. I'm giving credit to all your old election manifestos. I just want ease in the life of farmers, I want their progress and want modernity in agriculture." During his address, Modi also talked in detail about various provisions of the new farm laws, including minimum support price (MSP), and said the talk that the new laws will lead to the its scrapping is the "biggest lie ever". "No sane person will accept that MSP will be scrapped. Nothing will be a bigger lie and conspiracy than this", he said and assured that MSP for crops will continue. "Even after all these government's efforts....If anyone has any concerns, then with our heads bowed, our hands folded, with humility, we are willing to allay their fears," Modi added. Farming in India should get modernized in the changed global situation and should not lag behind now as "time cannot wait", Modi said. Asserting that the Modi government is committed to addressing all genuine concerns of the farming community, Tomar said it is willing to resume formal talks anytime, but added that there was no point talking to those "shooting from peasants' shoulders". In an interview with PTI, Tomar -- who is leading the negotiation with about 40 farmer unions along with Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash -- asserted that the three new farm laws are beneficial for farmers and the government is ready to give a written assurance that the MSP and mandi system will continue. He put the blame on opposition parties for misleading the farmers and accused them of changing their stance on the reform process and politicising the issue. As the farmers' protest continued for the fourth week, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) said the issue of the ongoing farmers' protests against three new farm laws needs to be resolved by the government and not the Supreme Court. The AIKS, a key member of the "Samyukta Kisan Morcha" that is spearheading the "Dilli Chalo" agitation against the three farm laws, asserted that no farmer organisation approached the court in the first place and asked for its intervention in the matter. Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal sought President Ram Nath Kovind's intervention in convening the Winter Session of Parliament at the earliest, saying its cancellation on the excuse of COVID-19 was "indigestible" as the three farm laws were passed when the pandemic was at its peak. In his letter to the President, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said Parliament must meet immediately as "a national priority". Describing the government's attitude as a case of "historic blunder", Badal said "the ruling party's stubbornness to listen to the country's 'annadata' and to let them die within a few hundred yards of Parliament would be remembered in history as a case of a heartless and conscience-less government at war with its own people." While on one hand the Centre continued to maintain that it was ready to hold talks with farmers on any issue, on the other hand the Union ministers stepped up their attack against the opposition parties for their stance with Hardeep Singh Puri accusing the Congress of spreading "canards" over the recent farm laws and "instigating" protests. "Even their senior leader, Rahul Gandhi, was vacationing abroad when the voting took place. The party is clearly imploding. It should rather bother about holding its remnants together than stoking fire in the country," Puri said in tweets. Citing a Hindi idiom, the Union civil aviation minister alleged that the Congress is warming its hands while setting the houses of others on fire. Slamming opposition parties, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi alleged that "failed political players" who have been rejected repeatedly by the people are acting under their "depression of defeat" and "misleading" the farmers. The Minority Affairs Minister also lashed out at opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, alleging that the Congress leader was "posing" as a farmers' leader despite knowing little about farming, while the Delhi chief minister was "karne mein zero, dharne mein hero (zero in work, but hero in sit-ins)". Farmers throughout the country are satisfied that Prime Minister Modi has worked for their empowerment and interests after coming to power, Naqvi told PTI in an interview. Hitting back, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot asked the central government to focus on resolving its standoff with farmers over three farm laws and keep other issues on hold. He also claimed that whether it was judiciary or bureaucracy, all are functioning under pressure from the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-farm-laws-have-not-come-overnight-says-pm-modi-928782.html

Adnan Ali, who holds a masters degree in business administration and is currently pursuing a PhD from Lovely Professional University, says the idea to start selling apples online came to him when he was pursuing engineering degree in Pune. He is currently selling around 15 varieties of apples and on average and is receiving around 50 orders in a day through dukaan.com, popshop and WhatsApp. Ali, a resident of Pinjoora village of Shopian, which produces some of the best apples in Kashmir, says he wasn’t happy with the existing system of apple business in the Valley. “The rates are decided by the trader and not growers. I wanted to bridge the gap between the grower and the buyer,” he said. Though he is in the initial stage of the new business, Ali said, he is getting a lot of appreciation and orders for delivery of apples. Despite the Covid-19 lockdown, he has sold thousands of apple packs both online and offline with a turnover of around Rs six lakh. And Ali is selling packs of just six apples instead of full boxes of 15-18 kg. “So far the feedback is positive. I also use biodegradable packs coming from Gujarat, which has been a plus point,” he said. In recent years Ali has also participated in all fruit exhibitions that were conducted across the country by the Horticulture Department, Kashmir. He was recently awarded by J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha for an innovative idea and his product was officially launched by the Principal Secretary, Horticulture Department. “I am working on a few more projects so that our apples can reach every corner of the world. Apples which we usually leave to rot or give it to local vendors due to scab and some other issues can be converted into jam, dry apple, jelly, pulp and apple powder so that even a little piece of apple won't get wasted,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/scholar-from-militancy-affected-shopian-sells-apples-online-928787.html

Addressing the annual Military Literature Festival here, Singh warned that different kinds of security threats may emerge in the future “This event is important from another point of view,” he said through video conference. "As times change, the nature of threats and wars is also changing. In the future, other security-related issues may come before us.” He added that conflicts are gradually becoming “comprehensive” in the manner never imagined earlier. Possibly alluding to the power of social media and mobile apps, he said, “Today the range (marak Kshamta) of a mobile has crossed even the reach of a missile,” he said. He added that the enemy can now reach people even without crossing any borders, and urged everyone to play the role of a soldier. “We should remain alive to these dangers and save ourselves from wrong and misleading information and save others too, and festivals like this can play a key role in this,” he said, urging literary figures to make use of their talent to the full for this. The defence minister did not specifically refer to China. But in recent months, since the standoff between the two sides began at the Line of Actual Control, India has banned several Chinese mobile apps, citing concerns related to national security and privacy. These included popular TikTok and WeChat apps. Singh said this year's edition of the festival was special as the country is observing the 50th year of 1971 India-Pakistan War. He also said there are many veterans around who fought that war and urged the youth to learn from them. The defence minister said war games played on mobile phones were no match to their real-life experiences. Singh said he was scheduled to participate in last year's edition of MLF but could not come to Chandigarh due to a Parliament session. But he had kept myself regularly updated on the festival events, including book releases and panel discussions, the minister said. “All these events give a close insight to the people, especially the youth, into military life,” he said. He said the festival also gave common people a better understanding of the functioning of the armed forces and instilled patriotic spirit in the youth. “Punjab for decades has been the land of the brave and it is only natural that such festivals started from here. The festival is also a tribute to those warriors who gave up everything for the nation's sake,” he said. Earlier, Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore and former Jammu and Kashmir governor N N Vohra also spoke. The annual event is a joint initiative of the Punjab Government and the armed forces. It ends Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mobile-phones-have-longer-reach-than-missiles-rajnath-says-games-no-match-to-veterans-real-life-experiences-928795.html

He claimed that be it the judiciary or bureaucracy, all are functioning under pressure from the Centre. Addressing a state-level function to mark the second anniversary of his dispensation, Gehlot alleged that government agencies like the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax department were being misused. "A list is sent from the PMO where a raid has to be conducted. The situation is serious and democracy is under threat," the senior Congress leader claimed. "The home minister (Amit Shah) is becoming Sardar Patel," he said, referring to the powerful home minister in the Jawaharlal Nehru government. Gehlot pointed out that three bills passed by the Rajasthan Assembly to counter the Centre's farm laws were still pending with the governor. Stressing that the Union government should leave all other work and focus only on resolving its standoff with the farmers, he said, "If we withdraw a decision, it shows large-heartedness. This is democracy, not monarchy." "We care for farmers and have passed three bills in the assembly which are still pending with the governor. I do not know what his compulsions are that he is not forwarding the bills to the president," Gehlot added. Highlighting the achievements of his government in the last two years, the chief minister said almost 50 per cent of promises made in the election manifesto have been fulfilled despite the unprecedented challenges thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gehlot said since the Union government has more power than the states, it should help them in every possible way. The chief minister laid foundation stones and inaugurated development work of various departments virtually. He also announced that Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) for the recruitment of teachers on 31,000 posts in the state will be held on April 25. During the function, Gehlot inaugurated a 50-bedded advanced medical ICU in SMS hospital Jaipur, an oxygen generation plant at 20 different places across the state, an auditorium at RNT medical college in Udaipur, 17 community health centres, 54 primary health centres and 15 sub health centres, among others.

He was alluding to naval operations by the US and China in the South China Sea, which is an arm of the western Pacific Ocean. "There is considerable churn in the geopolitical situation in the IOR and broader Indo-Pacific. As great power rivalry intensifies in western Pacific, the IOR will feel its ripple effects. No doubt," Tripathi said at a webinar. This will be a true test for our "military diplomatic outreach as we face the consequential opportunities and challenges", he added. "We therefore have to continue playing an increasingly important role, not only for the security and prosperity of our nation, but also the larger Indian Ocean region," he said. The US has been regularly sending warships to South China region in the wake of China's growing military assertiveness in the region. The latest incident between the two countries' navies took place in South China Sea in August when China claimed it drove out an American warship from the disputed Paracel archipelago. On Thursday, the US military released a document warning that it would be more assertive in countering Chinese violations of the international law in the South China Sea. The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks. However, no breakthrough has been achieved yet. Tripathi said: "India's outlook towards the IOR is shaped by the civilisational ethos which stresses upon the greater good of humanity at large. The ancient Indian concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, meaning the entire world is one family, is well ingrained in our polity and people and is also enshrined at the entrance of our Parliament." "The navy engages in military diplomacy on four pillars, namely, capacity building, capability enhancement, cooperative engagements and collaborative efforts," he stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-ocean-region-will-feel-ripple-effects-of-power-rivalry-in-western-pacific-vice-admiral-tripathi-928802.html

In 2020, the number of people displaced in India is 1.4 crore, it said. The report  'Costs of climate inaction: displacement and distress migration' assessed climate-fuelled displacement and migration across five South Asian countries -- Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- and calculates a devastating likelihood of over 6 crore people being homeless and displaced by 2050 in South Asia alone. It is based on a study conducted by International agencies ActionAid International and Climate Action Network South Asia. Quoting figures, the report claimed that 4.5 crore from India will be forced to migrate from their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters. "Political failure to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius as per the Paris agreement goal is already driving 18 million climate migrants from their homes in 2020," the report said. The report released on Friday, estimates that climate migration will treble in South Asia alone, a region badly affected by climate disasters, including floods, droughts, typhoons and cyclones. The research was undertaken by Bryan Jones, one of the authors of the inaugural Groundswell Report on internal climate migration in 2018. The report called for strong leadership and ambition from developed countries to cut emissions and support for developing countries to adapt to climate change and recover from climate disasters.  It recommended a holistic approach that places the onus on rich countries to provide support and urges developing countries to scale up efforts to protect people from climate impacts. Harjeet Singh, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid, said, "We are facing melting glaciers in Nepal, rising seas in India and Bangladesh, cyclones and inhospitable temperatures. Climate change is increasingly forcing people to flee their homes in search of safety and new means to provide for their families. "Rich countries need to take greater responsibility to reduce their emissions and support South Asian countries in cutting emissions and dealing with climate impacts. The human cost of inaction is too high," he said. The research reveals that in all five countries, women are left dealing with the negative fallout from climate migration.  "They are left behind to take care of household chores, agricultural activities, look after children and elderly and manage livestock. Women who migrate to urban settlements are often then forced to take up work in precarious settings where workers' rights violations are rife," it said. Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia said, "South Asia is geographically vulnerable to climate disasters and is regularly lashed with floods and cyclones, but poverty and environmental injustice are also determining factors in this climate migration crisis. "South Asian leaders must join forces and prepare plans for the protection of displaced people. They must step up and invest in universal and effective social protection measures, resilience plans and green infrastructure to respond to the climate crisis and help those who have been forced to move," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/over-45-crore-people-in-india-will-be-forced-to-migrate-from-homes-by-2050-due-to-climate-disasters-928804.html

With the post going viral, the Kochi city police launched a probe without waiting for a formal complaint from the actress as it was a case of sexual assault. Police sources said that from the CCTV footage it is quite evident that two youths came near her and one of them touched her inappropriately. Hence a case would be registered. The two are learnt to be held and quizzed by the police. The young actress said in the post that, "Being a woman has been very tiring, to be on guard every minute as you step out of your house. To watch my clothes when I bend and turn. To guard my chest with my arms in a crowd… And on the days I’m home, I worry about my mother, my sister, my friends who have to do the same things. It is all because of these sick men. You take away our safety. You take away our comfort and the joy of our womanhood. I despise you,” the actor wrote.

The book titled ‘Covid-19: Sabhyata ka Sankat aur Samadhan’ (Covid-19: Crisis of Civilisation and Solutions) was launched online on Thursday by former Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra and Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh. The Hindi book, published by Prabhat Prakashan, discusses how the pandemic has influenced the education system, business, politics, public safety, foreign policy, law, medicine, economy and development of countries. "The words written in the book are not merely empty words but an important lesson for the present generation. The nuances and the attitudinal concepts shall be a treat to all the readers who relate to the idea of humanity," Misra said in a statement. Calling upon “globalisation of compassion” and a “supply chain of gratitude”, Satyarthi said he believes that during this period ordinary people, industrialists, healthcare providers, government machinery and social workers have done extraordinary humanitarian work. He also pointed out the need to focus on children who are the "worst sufferers of economic, social and political violence". "The ongoing crisis is not only a health, economic or social crisis, but also a crisis of morality, justice and the entire civilisation. We must act with urgency and compassion, or we risk losing an entire generation of children. "Around 1.5 billion children across the globe are affected by school closure and almost half of them do not have the access to online education. It is unfortunate that only 0.13 per cent of the USD 8 trillion global COVID response has been allocated to the most vulnerable," the child rights activist underlined.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kailash-satyarthi-suggests-solutions-to-covid-19-crisis-in-new-book-928820.html
18-12-2020||National||Allahabad HC seeks UP government's reply on plea against 'love jihad' law||The Allahabad High Court asked the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday to respond to a petition challenging its recent ordinance on religious conversions. The bench, comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Piyush Agrawal, passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Saurabh Kumar, who challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance against "forcible" and "fraudulent" religious conversions, including for the sake of marriage. According to the petition, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced on October 31 that his dispensation would bring a law against "love jihad". The state government had on November 24 approved the draft ordinance, which provided for a jail term of up to 10 years for violators. "Love jihad" is a term used by right-wing activists to discredit interfaith marriages by describing it as part of an alleged conspiracy by Muslim men to convert Hindu women in the guise of love. The primary contention raised in the PIL was that the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance impinges upon the fundamental right to choice and the right to change of faith. During the hearing, the high court refused to grant any interim relief and directed the state government to file a counter affidavit by January 4. The petitioner said the ordinance was morally and constitutionally invalid. He requested the court to declare it as ultra vires of the Constitution and direct the authorities not to take any action under the law during pendency of the petition. The PIL contended that the provisions of the ordinance gave policing powers over a citizen's choice of life partner or religion and, therefore, militate against the fundamental rights to individual autonomy, privacy, human dignity and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. The plea also took exception the requirement of every religious conversion to be scrutinised and certified by the state. The petitioner said the very concept of forcing an individual to explain and justify a personal decision before an officer of the state was contrary to the Constitution, which ensures such rights.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/allahabad-hc-seeks-up-governments-reply-on-plea-against-love-jihad-law-928824.html

"The Shiv Sena has given Rs one crore and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has given Rs 11 lakh in his personal capacity for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya," he told a press conference here to elaborate on the "Shri Ram Mandir Nidhi Samarpan" drive that will be run in the country from January 15 to February 27 next year. The support of every Ram devotee from all over the country will be solicited for the grand temple to be built at the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya, Rai said, adding that for this, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) activists will go from door to door, accompanied by venerated seers and others. Rai had earlier said in New Delhi that the temple will be built using domestic funds collected from the general public through a mass-contact programme as the trust does not have the required approvals for accepting donations from abroad. He reiterated that photographs of the proposed new model of the temple will reach crores of households through this campaign. "Voluntary donations from Ram bhakts will be accepted for which coupons of Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 1,000 will be made available," he said. In order to maintain transparency in the financial dealings and transactions, the trust has printed four crore coupons of Rs 10 denomination, eight crore coupons of Rs 100 and 12 lakh coupons of Rs 1,000 denomination, Rai said. He further said no target has been fixed for collecting funds and no estimate has been made of the expenditure for the construction of the temple. Rai said through this campaign, people will be made aware of the historical significance of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sena-has-given-rs-1-crore-yogi-adityanath-rs-11-lakh-for-ram-temples-construction-temple-trust-official-928826.html

They, however, agreed that the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would hold the ninth meeting again soon to end the impasse in the process of withdrawal of front-line troops from the LAC – the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector. The military commanders had held the eighth meeting on November 6. “Both sides agreed to maintain close consultations at the diplomatic and military level,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said in a statement issued in New Delhi. “They agreed that the next (9th) round of senior commanders meeting should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, and fully restore peace and tranquillity.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the communist country’s government issued a separate statement in Beijing stating that the two sides had positively appraised the results of the eighth round of talks between the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA and agreed to continue to maintain dialogue and consultation through diplomatic and military channels. The video conference was the 20th round of talks under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC), which was established in 2012 as an institutional mechanism for consultation and coordination for management of flashpoints along the disputed boundary between the two neighbours. Naveen Srivastava, who heads the East Asia division at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), led the delegation of the Government of India in the video conference. The delegation of the Chinese Government was led by Hong Liang, the Director General of the Department of Boundary and Oceanic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Srivastava and Hong earlier had as many as five video conferences within the framework of WMCC on June 24, July 10, July 24, August 20 and September 30 to resolve the current military stand-off along the disputed boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh. The MEA stated in New Delhi that the Indian and Chinese diplomats had reviewed the developments along the LAC and agreed that based on the guidance provided by senior leaders and the agreements reached between the two Foreign Ministers and Special Representatives, they would continue to work towards ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector at the earliest. The two sides noted that the seventh and eighth rounds of Senior Commanders meetings held on October 12 and November 6 respectively had in-depth discussions in this regard and that the discussions had also contributed to ensuring stability on the ground. Though India and China had agreed upon a roadmap for a mutual withdrawal of front-line troops from the face-off scenes along the LAC in early July, the process had come to a halt within a fortnight, with the Chinese PLA declining to completely pull back soldiers from several “points of friction” along the LAC – like Depsang Y junction, Gogra Post and the northern bank of Pangong Tso. The senior military commanders of the two sides had held the fifth round of talks on August 2, but they had failed to end the stalemate. After External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a meeting in Moscow on September 10, the military commanders of the two nations had again met on the LAC on September 21 – ending an almost six-week-long hiatus. They had agreed to stop further deployment of soldiers on the face-off points, but had not been able to reach an agreement to restart the stalled process of pulling back troops already deployed on the LAC. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had discussed during the seventh and eighth rounds of talks in October and November a plan for restarting the mutual disengagement of troops from the face-off scenes, beginning with the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso. The plan, however, could not be implemented yet as the Indian Army turned down the Chinese PLA’s proposal for creating a moratorium on patrolling between Finger 3 and Finger 8 on the northern bank of the lake.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lac-stand-off-no-breakthrough-in-talks-between-indian-chinese-diplomats-928828.html

Almost a year ago, reports emerged that he has created a Hindu nation, Kailaasa, with its own flag and political setup, on an island near Ecuador. In a video of a 'special satsang' posted on his verified Facebook account on December 14, he said, "Today, you can start applying for Kailaasa visa. You have to reach Australia on your own. From Australia, Kailaasa has its own chartered flight services." “Please do not ask for more than a 3-day visa. Kailaasa can accommodate anyone only for three days for now," he added. The organisation run by Nithyananda is set to cover the airfare to and from Kailaasa, and also provide free food and accommodation to the travellers during the course of their stay. The video, also posted the website, asks the followers to log in to avail the free e-passport.    What is Kailaasa? The official website states that Kailaasa is a “nation without borders created by dispossessed Hindus from around the world who lost the right to practice Hinduism authentically in their own countries”. Some news reports claim that Kailaasa is an actual place, with physical boundaries. The ‘nation’ has its own flag and passport. Nityananda is the ‘Supreme Pontiff’ of Kailaasa, and one can become a citizen by being a “practising Hindu” or “Hindu who would like to deepen their practice”. The website also adds that Kailaasa offers a “safe haven to all the world’s practising, aspiring or persecuted Hindus…where they can peacefully live and express their spirituality, arts, and culture free from denigration, interference and violence”. Interpol issues Blue Corner Notice against Nithyananda Nithyananda reportedly absconded after a case was registered for wrongful confinement and abduction of three children living in his ashram near Ahmedabad, police said in January 2020. The details about the Blue Corner Notice were mentioned in the chargesheet filed by the Ahmedabad Rural Police in a local court. A Blue Corner Notice is issued by the international police cooperation body to collect additional information from its member countries about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a crime. Police are now trying to get a Red Corner Notice issued against the godman by the Interpol, a senior police officer said.

Sharply criticising the Opposition for trying to sway 'innocent farmers' and using the issue for political gains, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the farm laws were always part of opposition parties' manifesto and the government merely turned those promises into a reality. Speaking to farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Modi said: "I request all political parties with folded hands, please keep all the credit, I don't want any credit for these reforms, I just want to improve farmers' lives." Karnataka Government has instructed the removal of contents from the class 6 social science textbooks after the Brahmin Development Board complained it was "insulting" to the Brahmin community. The Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar in a note to top officials of his department has also directed that a committee be constituted including teachers and experts to examine such contents in the social science and language textbooks from class 1 to 10, and submit a report in 15 days to take necessary action. The CBI on Friday filed its charge sheet against four accused in the alleged gangrape and murder case of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, officials said. The agency invoked charges of gangrape and murder against 4 men and the local court in Hathras has taken cognizance, a lawyer for the accused told reporters outside the court. A citizen journalist detained in China after reporting from the Covid-19 ground zero of Wuhan will face trial later this month, her lawyer said Friday, as fears grow for her health. Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, travelled to Wuhan in February and live-streamed her experiences on social media. She also wrote essays critical of the government's response Zhang was detained in May. Zhang began a hunger strike in June, her lawyers said and has been force-fed via a nasal tube. British and EU negotiators plunged into the "final hours" of their scramble for a post-Brexit trade deal Friday, deeply divided on the highly-charged issue of fishing rights. The UK will leave the EU single market in less than two weeks and time has all but run out for any agreement to be approved in time to head off a severe economic shock. The European Parliament has demanded that it see the text of any accord by Sunday at the latest, and the UK government says it will not allow talks to go beyond December 31. Brussels' chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told the MEPs before heading to talks with his UK counterpart David Frost that Friday marked a "moment of truth".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-cbi-files-charge-sheet-in-hathras-case-pm-modi-slams-opposition-for-misleading-farmers-928830.html

Sindri Deputy Superintendent of Police Ajit Kumar told PTI that the charred body of the woman was brought out from the fire hole, under Bastakola Industry Colliery, after a five-hour rescue operation. Underground fires have been burning under the country's largest coalfield for over a century. The incident occurred at 7.30 am after the woman, a mother of three children, was defecating in the open, police said. The victim's husband is a labourer. When she reached the spot, the land under her feet subsided and she slipped into the hole created due to the subsidence. Smoke was seen billowing from the hole, police said. Slum dwellers rushed to the area and attempted to bring her out with a rope but failed to do so, police said. BCCL Bastakola Colliery Area project officer Shailendra Singh, Jharia police station officer-in- charge Pramod Kumar Singh reached the spot and ordered rescue operations. Two shovel machines were pressed into service and the body was brought out at 11.56 am. Rattled by the delay in rescue operations, locals had blocked Dhanbad-Jharia Main Road. The people were also demanding a compensation of Rs 10 lakh, and a job for the victim's family. The DSP said, the police is trying to pacify the people and negotiations would be held with the general manager of Bastakola Colliery B K Goel for providing a compensation to the victim's family. However, the general manager of the colliery could not arrive due to the agitation. Authorities of the BCCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Coal India Ltd, said that the slum is situated in a dangerous fire zone and the residents had been asked to vacate the place several times but they did not do so. This is the second such incident in Jharia in the last couple of years. On May 23, 2017 a father and son were buried alive in front of a garage near Indra Chowk in Jharia town. The first fire in Jharia mines was reported in 1916. BCCL officials claimed that coal fires may have been caused by shutting down of old mines.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/woman-buried-alive-in-jharia-fire-zone-928832.html

The chairman emeritus of the Tata group will be honoured with 'Global Visionary of Sustainable Business and Peace' award during the launch of the Federation of Indo-Israel Chamber of Commerce's international chapter in Dubai on December 21. The virtual ceremony will be attended by senior officials from Israel, India and UAE. "Tata has done a lot for India-Israel ties. He has generously contributed towards promoting innovation that supports sustainability and has been a promoter of peace in the region, including with the Palestinians. He has visited Israel a few times which has been extremely beneficial in promoting ties between the two countries. He very well deserves this honour," Raviv Byron, President of Israel-India Chamber of Commerce, told PTI. The 82-year-old industrialist and philanthropist is the recipient of two of India's highest civilian awards - Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan . The opening of the Federation of Indo-Israel Chamber of Commerce's international chapter in Dubai is the first such initiative aiming at tapping business opportunities together in other countries, and developing trilateral collaborations. This is expected to pave the way for several other such international chapters for the bilateral Chamber in other parts of the world, Byron noted. "There is a large presence of Indian diaspora in the UAE and Bahrain which includes top professionals who are well established and respected. Given the close ties between Israel and India, we can definitely work together to develop a framework for trilateral cooperation in the Gulf", he added. The Tata Group has invested millions of dollars in Tel Aviv University’s (TAU) Technology Innovation Momentum Fund. As the lead investor in the fund, Tatas have the right of first opportunity to negotiate licence agreement on areas that have been defined as start-up fields like automotive, point of care for medical devices, cleantech, etc. In 2018, TAU and Tata Trusts announced the launching of the Indian Centre for Agri & Allied Tech (I-CAT) that would facilitate bringing Israeli know-how and innovation to the farmers of the state of Andhra Pradesh, initially, and was to be later extended to all the other parts of India. The initiative, supported by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, includes creating an advanced R&D centre, as well as promoting activities of agricultural experts in villages and farms — aiming to overcome various technological, agronomic and economic barriers, and promote sustainable agriculture and food security. During his visit to Israel in 2013, Tata had signed an agreement with Israel Aerospace Industry (IAI) to jointly develop, manufacture and support a wide range of defence and aerospace products including missiles, UAVs, radars, electronic warfare systems and homeland security systems.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ratan-tata-to-be-honoured-with-global-visionary-of-sustainable-business-and-peace-award-928834.html
18-12-2020||National||Amid farmer protests, KPMG says 'lot of mis-communication' on farm reforms||Amid protests by farmers on the outskirts of Delhi, a global consultancy firm on Friday said there is “lot of miscommunication” on the recently introduced agricultural reforms. There is a need to club the reform measures with existing schemes like PM Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) and Farmer Producer Organisation to create a "new perspective", KPMG said. Irked with the passage of three laws related to the farm sector, agriculturists have been protesting at the Delhi border for weeks now, seeking complete repeal of the laws. Specific concerns include the non-inclusion of minimum support price (MSP) in the laws and also the likelihood of deep-pocketed corporate houses entering the sector. The government has been holding parleys with the organisation but has not been able to achieve any success. "There is a lot of miscommunication on the impact of recent agricultural reforms,” the consultancy firm said in a report on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on potential income and employment. It said the three reforms should be clubbed with other reform measures like the PMFME and FPO schemes to “create a new perspective on the benefits that can accrue to the farmer groups”. Seeking details on the Rs 1.5 lakh crore investment, it said clarity on the same can help attract additional funds in the farm sector from the private sector and FPOs and added that a Rs 1 lakh crore investment can result in a Rs 2.53 lakh crore expansion in output and create 10.5 million-person year employment across sectors. Meanwhile, it said the pandemic will result in a 9.8 per cent contraction in the economy under the baseline scenario, and there is a need for the government to up its expenditure to give a push to the demand process. Even with a V-shaped recovery, the economy will likely contract by 1.1 per cent during the ongoing fiscal year, which can widen to 13.6 per cent in case of a L-shaped recovery. It can be noted that the government and the RBI have introduced a slew of measures to aid the economy in the pandemic and the actual additional spends by the exchequer is under 3 per cent of GDP. In its report, KPMG, a consultancy firm, said the existing Rs 20.9 lakh crore stimulus package focuses on improving liquidity, providing collateral free loans to small businesses and has introduced some reforms. "While these measures to an extent address the supply side problems, the coronavirus pandemic requires higher government expenditure and investment to push the economy back on growth trajectory by directly increasing final demand and boosting both consumer and business sentiments," the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amid-farmer-protests-kpmg-says-lot-of-mis-communication-on-farm-reforms-928835.html

A large number of his followers from various walks of life, including politicians, religious gurus and farmer leaders, reached Singhra village here to attend the last rites. Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, his son and Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Bibi Jagir Kaur and Bhartaiya Kisan Union Haryana chief Gurnam Singh were among them. On Thursday, Akali leaders and a large number of followers of the Sikh preacher paid their last respects to him at his gurdwara in Karnal. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar termed the 65-year-old preacher's death "an irreparable loss". Khattar's Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh also expressed grief over his demise. Sant Ram Singh's body was on Wednesday night taken to the Nanaksar Gurdwara in Singhra village, where a large number of his followers had gathered. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief and SAD leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja visited the gurdwara on Thursday to pay their last respects. According to the police, Sant Ram Singh allegedly died by suicide near Delhi's Singhu border on Wednesday. A handwritten note in Punjabi, purportedly left behind by the deceased, said he was unable to bear the "pain of farmers" who have been protesting against the Centre's agriculture reform laws. The police had earlier said they were verifying the note. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been protesting near Delhi's borders for over three weeks, demanding that the Centre's new farm laws be repealed. Many recalled that Sant Ram Singh dedicated his life to serving humanity and used to organise "satsangs (prayer meetings)" and "langars (community kitchen)" for thousands of people. The Haryana BKU chief said Sant Ram Singh was deeply hurt to see the pain and sufferings of thousands of farmers, who are braving the cold on the roads for the past several days to demand the withdrawal of the "anti-farmer laws". Talking to reporters after attending the preacher's cremation, Hooda reiterated that the Centre should immediately accept the demands of the farmers. Earlier, Congress leader Selja alleged the Centre is "insensitive" towards the plight of the farmers. "The government should accept the demands of the farmers, who have been sitting on roads for several days," she said. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure income, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sikh-preacher-who-died-by-suicide-near-singhu-border-cremated-hooda-sgpc-chief-pay-last-respects-928836.html

Terming it as a 'world war' against Covid-19, the apex court said that due to the 'unprecedented pandemic' everybody in the world is suffering one way or the other. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said that any decision to impose curfew or lockdown must be announced long in advance so that people may know and make provisions for their livelihood. The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, said that frontline health care workers including doctors and nurses are already “exhausted physically and mentally due to tireless work for eight months” and some mechanism may be needed to give them intermittent rest. It said every state must act vigilantly and work with the Centre harmoniously in this pandemic time. “It is the time to rise to the occasion. Safety and health of the citizens must be the first priority, rather than any other considerations,” the bench said.

Addressing the ASSOCHAM Foundation Week 2020, AYUSH Ministry Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said through the Ayush Sanjeevani mobile application, the ministry has received a data set of 1.47 crore people. "We found 86 per cent people are following one or the other AYUSH guideline whether it is kada or haldi milk...homeopathy. Of this data set, about 15,000 people reported that they contracted Covid-19, one-third said they were not using the Ayush modalities while two-thirds reported that they used the Ayush modalities," he said. Kotecha said a further evaluation revealed that most of those who had contracted the disease and were using the Ayush modalities did not have severe implications. They were either asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19. "People who have not used these modalities have reported that they had to suffer a lot. It (the AYUSH analysis) was a large-scale assessment, a social study and not a clinical study, which showed that there is a large-scale acceptance of the Ayush modalities," he added. In May, the Ministry of AYUSH had issued self-care guidelines as preventive health measures for boosting immunity, with a special reference to respiratory health amid the coronavirus outbreak. Kotecha further said over 104 studies have been conducted by the ministry at 135 locations across the country. "A lot of these studies are finished, we have a lot of leads and we will be publishing those in reputed journals," he said. Speaking at the event, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Tribal Affairs Naval Jit Kapoor said tribal areas and tribals were not much affected by Covid-19. "We were very worried that if Covid-19 spreads to tribal areas, what will we do, because firstly these are remote areas and medical facilities are also not that good there. Through the website, Prakriti, developed by IIT Delhi, we found that in 177 tribal-dominated districts, the percentage of Covid-19 cases vis-a-vis other population was three. "We had discussions with various states and all of them said the tribal areas and tribals were not much affected by Covid-19, only those who had gone to cities had carried the infection back with them, but the tribal way of life is such that they were not affected by Covid-19," he said. Kapoor said the ministry is validating the knowledge of tribal healers. "The indigenous knowledge of tribals was earlier ignored. Unfortunately, neither in allopathy nor in ayurveda have they become a part. We are now validating these tribal healers with the QCI (Quality Council of India) and other organisations so that their knowledge is brought into the mainstream," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/86-people-in-india-following-ayush-guidelines-official-928843.html

He said the party does not believe in dynastic politics. He said the Apni party is against dynastic politics espoused by the Peoples democratic Party, which is dominated by the Sayeed family, the National Conference, which is dominated by the Abdullah family and the Indian National Congress, which is dominated by the Nehru–Gandhi family. "We are often accused by opponents of being the B-team of the BJP. But let me ask her (Mehbooba Mufti). When she was enjoying the chair of chief minister being in coalition with BJP, wasn't she then the B-team of the saffron party," Bukhari told PTI. "Did the NC not ally with the BJP for a ministerial berth in the government. So, how is our party, which talks about protecting the rights of the people and blames the NC, the PDP and the Congress equally for the loss of our special status, a B-team of BJP?" Bukhari asked. He was responding to J-K Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir and NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar who accused the Apni Party of being the B-team of the BJP. Mir said the real motive of the Apni Party would be exposed soon. "This party is an offshoot of the saffron party aimed at creating chaos and divisions in the political system of J-K. People would soon give a befitting reply to this new formation," he said. Dar said "They (Apni Party) want to fill the political vacuum of Kashmir with those who parrot what New Delhi wants them to. It is therefore safe to call this new formation as Delhi's party and nothing else." Bukhari asserted that the people of J-K will support Apni Party and we will emerge victorious in the District Development Council (DDC) polls, saying the aim of his party was to do politics of truth. "We're not here to sell dreams and fantasies but will always be pragmatic, honest and fair in our approach. We have resolved to create a political platform where people are real stakeholders of the political process. "Restoration of statehood, domicile rights on land jobs form our core agenda. We are a regional party with a national outlook," Bukhari said. He said, "The agenda is simple. We want to remove the miseries of people that they have been facing since August 5. We want restoration of statehood, rights on domicile and land. We want jobs, education institutions, economic activities, tourism, and business to have suffered, we want them to compensate".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/apna-party-not-b-team-of-bjp-says-its-chief-altaf-bukhari-928854.html

Addressing the valedictory function of 95th foundation course at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for good governance is reflected in new initiatives such as Mission Karmayogi and Aarambh for civil services in the country. "Singh said that officers have an opportunity to become the architect of New India, the foundation of which was laid down by Prime Minister Narendra Modi," according to a statement issued by the personnel ministry. Noting that out of a total of 428 officer trainees in this foundation course, 136, or roughly 32 per cent, are women, the minister said the trend of women empowerment has gained momentum in the last six-seven years after the assumption of office by Prime Minister Modi. He also underlined that the presence of a large number (245) of officers from engineering background will go a long way in good governance practices as this government had launched various specialised flagship schemes that need special expertise such as the Ayushman Bharat, Soil Health Card or the promotion of Inland Waterways. Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, said that in the last five to six years, a series of new beginnings and innovations were undertaken by the prime minister to provide a new orientation and direction to bureaucracy in India. He particularly mentioned that a three-month central government stint as Assistant Secretaries for IAS officers in the beginning of their career started couple of years back added tremendously in their capacity building. Singh recalled that in line with the objectives of the Mission Karmayogi, online pre-foundation course was started with 95th foundation course and he also appreciated the new modules in the foundation course on social inclusion which covered aspects such as gender, children, disability, urban labour force, and experiential activities such as breaking the barriers, power walk and visit to nearby worksites and places where people at margins were staying. He said that with a vision to make the civil servants capable of leading the transformation and work seamlessly across departments and fields, a common foundation course (CFC), named Aarambh, was started as part of the 94th foundation course in 2019, the statement said. For the 95th foundation course 428 participants from various services started the foundation course from October 12, it said. “Because of COVID pandemic, the thematic exercise this year -- 'Aarambh-2020' -- was organised from 14th October to 31st October, 2020, with experts and global thought leaders sharing their knowledge and experience on the theme chosen for this year, ‘Governance in India @100’,” he said. In his address, LBSNAA Director Sanjeev Chopra said that for conducting the online sessions, the learning management system known as GYAN is used at the academy. He said that the prime minister's Vocal for Local campaign was well imbibed in the course and new things like co-learning in history projects and in other streams were encouraged. Chopra said that this batch has the ability and agility to overcome adversities like the novel coronavirus pandemic and wished them all success in their future endeavours. “Jitendra Singh also distributed the President of India Gold Medal and certificate for the Best Officer Trainee,” it said. He also laid the foundation stone of a government primary school at Charleville in Mussoorie in Uttarakhand. A short movie made by the officers was also shown on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/civil-services-officers-have-an-opportunity-to-become-the-architect-of-new-india-jitendra-singh-928859.html

"It cannot be disputed that for whatever reasons, treatment has become costlier and costlier and it is not affordable to the common people at all. Even if one survives from Covid-19, many times he is finished financially and economically," a bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan noted. The court said it was the duty of the State to make provisions for affordable treatment. "Due to the unprecedented pandemic, everybody in the world is suffering in one way or the other. It is a world war against Covid-19. Therefore, there should be a government-public partnership to end the world war against Covid-19," the court said. It said that either more provisions were to be made by the state government and the local administration or there should be a cap on the fees charged by the private hospitals, under the Disaster Management Act. The suggestion was made when the court was dealing with a suo moto case for proper treatment of Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of corpses at hospitals. The court also noted that despite guidelines and SOPs, the pandemic has spread like wildfire, so every state must act vigilantly and work with the Centre harmoniously.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-calls-for-capping-covid-19-treatment-prices-at-private-hospitals-928874.html

Gandhi has fixed a series of meetings on December 19 and 20 with Congress leaders to decide on key issues concerning the party. During these deliberations over the weekend, she will also meet some of the prominent members of the "letter-writers' group". Among them are Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and the deputy leader of the party in the Upper House, Anand Sharma. Gehlot left Jaipur for Delhi on Friday evening, the sources said. "The chief minister is scheduled to attend a meeting with the (Congress) party president and other leaders in which discussions on organisational issues will be held on Saturday," they said. Twenty-three senior leaders of the party had written to Gandhi in August. This is the first time that Gandhi will be meeting Congress leaders face-to-face, months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. She has been holding virtual meetings ever since, including the crucial Congress Working Committee meet in which party leaders discussed the letter which demanded a change in the leadership and an overhaul of the party's organisational structure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ashok-gehlot-heads-to-delhi-for-saturdays-meeting-between-sonia-gandhi-congress-leaders-928875.html

Official sources said that there is "no question of dropping" the proposed new Prime Minister's Office (PMO) from the Central Vista Redevelopment project, after the CPWD did not mention the same in its new proposal before an expert panel of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore. The prime minister's new residence will be built on a 15-acre plot and it will have 10 buildings and they will have ground plus three floors, the CPWD said in its proposal. Permissible ground coverage at the prime minister's new residence would be 30,351 square metre, it stated, adding that a building for the Special Protection Group will come up on a 2.50-acre plot. The Central Vista Redevelopment project also includes the new Vice President's Enclave which will be built on 15-acre land and will have five-storey buildings with a maximum height of 15 metres, the CPWD said in its proposal. The VP Enclave will have 32 buildings. Reacting to the CPWD's move to drop the proposed new Prime Minister's Office in its latest proposal, Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said that the documents submitted to the Environment Ministry do not give any justification on why some plots or offices have been excluded or why the costs have increased despite such exclusions. "But equally important is the CPWD's answer to whether any alternatives to the present proposal were considered is a “No”. The study of such alternatives is required to be done before seeking environment clearance," Kohli said. The CPWD's proposal for terms of reference, which is a step before the environment clearance, was discussed by the Environment Ministry expert appraisal committee (EAC) on Thursday. The EAC had approved the CPWD's proposal to construct a new Parliament Building earlier this year. The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/central-vista-pm-residence-to-have-10-buildings-sources-say-no-question-of-dropping-proposed-pmo-928891.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said in a micro containment zone or in an area where number of cases are on higher side, to cut the chain, they should be sealed and there should be complete lockdown so far as such areas are concerned. The court said more and more police personnel should be deployed at the places where there is likelihood of gathering by the people, such as, food courts, eateries, vegetable markets, bus stations, railway stations, street vendors, etc. "Curfew on weekends/night be considered by states where it is not in place. Any decision to impose curfew and/or lockdown must be announced long in advance so that the people may know and make provisions for their livelihood, like ration etc," the bench said, issuing a slew of directions in a Suo Motu matter. In order to contain the spread of pandemic, the bench said that there should be a mechanism to check the number of people attending functions. The bench said unless must, no permission shall be granted by the local administration for gathering even during the day hours. In case the permissions were granted, the local should ensure strict compliance of the guidelines, the bench added. The court directed for making a mechanism to provide intermittent rest to doctors and healthcare professional involved in the fight against Covid-19. It said all states must issue necessary directions to ensure compliance of Election commission guidelines for political rallies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/any-decision-on-lockdown-should-be-taken-well-in-advance-supreme-court-928900.html

While investment in health, medical Research & Development (R&D) and developing greater skills to handle telemedicine is going to be critical, livelihood challenges would have to be seen in a newer canvas with a newer perspective on vocational training and skill development. "Send me your inputs so that we can see a Budget which is a Budget like never before, in a way. 100 years of India wouldn't have seen a Budget being made post pandemic like this. "And that is not going to be possible unless I get your inputs and wish list, clear observation of what has put you through the challenge... Without that, it is impossible for me to draft something which is going to be that Budget like never before, a Budget which is being made after a pandemic," Sitharaman said while addressing the CII Partnership Summit 2020. The Union Budget for 2021-22 is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2021. The minister said that to revive growth, support has to be extended to those areas which have been disrupted badly due to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as to those areas which are now going to be the centres for newer demand and newer engines of growth. "Considering our size, population and potential that India hold for good growth and building of economy, I wouldn't hesitate here to say that we shall be the engine of global growth along with a few other countries. We will be a significant contributor to global economic revival," she said. Further, Sitharaman said that while providing more funding for infrastructure, it would be important to bring in private partnerships for not just providing buildings and hospitals, but also for providing the capacities to run these hospitals. Telemedicine will also need greater level of understanding and greater skills to handle, she noted. "... many economies are wondering where to procure the vaccine from after they are formulated or after they are certified, those which are getting manufactured somewhere, will have to be obtained. "Whereas we in India are actually very fortunate to have such capacities to produce the formulation, then to get it certified and we in India have the capacity to be able to produce as much as we (need)... and more for exports...," she said. Sitharaman also said that the need of the time is more investments towards medical R&D, biotechnology R&D and pharma R&D. India has to look at both public and private partnership and also engagement and investment in the areas of research for medicine, she added. "We will probably be taking all the inputs that health sector has given us for a good consideration in the Budget," the minister said. "A good example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat is the capacity that we have shown to produce vaccines, to manufacture formulations that the vaccine developers have given and be in a position not just to manufacture those vaccines which we are formulating in India but also to receive the rights to produce vaccines which are developed elsewhere not just for Indian markets but also to export," she said. According to the minister, job creation would undergo massive change post pandemic and hence newer skills would have to be imparted. "Livelihood is also going to be a newer canvas in the post pandemic era. Whether it is small businesses or large industries, the way in which jobs are going to be created will go through a massive change... So vocational training and skills have to be brought in with newer perspective, some of the trainings and skills given earlier may probably be not even required now but something totally new may be required," she said. Livelihood is going to be a basketful of challenges where industry would have to put in their views, she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-promises-never-before-like-union-budget-928917.html

The CBI on Friday filed a charge sheet against the four men accused of the gangrape and murder of the woman in a village in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, officials said. After nearly two months of probe, the agency concluded in its final report that the accused -- Sandeep, Ravi, Luv Kush and Ramu -- allegedly gangraped and murdered the woman when she had gone to the fields to collect fodder on September 14, they said. Reacting to the development, Priyanka Gandhi said the truth has prevailed once again. "The CBI charge sheet filed today against four accused in the Hathras case has stated that the 19-year old victim was brutally gangraped and murdered," the Congress general secretary in-charge UP said in a statement. This development raises serious questions on the Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, UP police, ADG Law and Order, District Magistrate of Hathras and Senior functionaries of the state administration, Priyanka Gandhi alleged. "The state left no stone unturned to deny the victim dignity -- in life and death. She was cremated without her family's consent in the middle of the night. Senior police officers and bureaucrats outrightly denied any rape, intimidated her family and indulged in blatant shaming of the victim. Sections of media that dared to report the truth were manhandled," she alleged. However, the entire might of the Uttar Pradesh government and police could not suppress the truth, Priyanka Gandhi asserted. "I cannot forget the anguish of the 19-year-old's mother, who couldn't even bid her daughter goodbye. All that her family sought was justice for their child," she said. "I am heartened to see that an important step towards providing that justice has been taken by the CBI and hope that it will bring the victim's family some comfort amidst the immense suffering that they have so courageously endured," Priyanka Gandhi said. Earlier in a tweet in Hindi, she said, "On one side was government-protected injustice. On the other side was the family's hope for justice." "The victim's body was burnt forcibly. Attempts were made to tarnish her image. Her family was threatened. But in the end, truth won," she said. The Dalit woman, allegedly raped by four upper-caste men on September 14, died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her body was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/truth-has-prevailed-in-hathras-case-chargesheet-raises-serious-questions-on-up-govt-priyanka-gandhi-928919.html

"It is advisable for persons recovered from Covid-19 to receive a complete schedule of vaccine irrespective of past history of infection with the pandemic virus," the ministry said in a FAQ on Covid-19 vaccination released on Friday. Two doses of vaccine, 28 days apart, need to be taken by an individual to complete the vaccination schedule. Protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. The issue was under the consideration of a national up level expert panel on vaccination headed by NITI Ayog member Vinod Paul, a former professor at AIIMS. The decision comes days after US researchers showed that preferentially vaccinating seronegative individuals -who were not exposed to the virus and tested negative in antibody tests - yielded large additional reductions in cumulative incidence and mortality.  But at the same time, they admitted that there would be implementation challenges for such a strategy. Doctors said while the government was right in its decision because of the implementation challenges, antibody tests can be used as a tool to overcome vaccine hesitancy. "Those who are hesitant to take the vaccine can be advies to undergo the antibody test. If they are found negative, they should be persuaded to take the vaccine since they don't have any protection at all," Abdul Ghafur, a consultant on infectious disease at Apollo Hospital, Chennai told DH. "But it's difficult for the government to carry out antibody tests before vaccination. Also, it would add to the cost." According to the Health Ministry document, those willing to take the vaccine would have to register themselves with the authorities. If they are found eligible, they would receive an SMS with information about the site and time. No one will get the vaccine without registration. While healthcare and front line workers will get the shots on the priority basis, the third group of 27 crore people of 50 years of age and above would be subdivided - those above 60 years will receive the vaccine first whereas those between 50-60 years will get the vaccine after the first group is covered. Currently, eight vaccines are under different stages of clinical evaluation in India while three companies have approached the Drugs Controller General of India for meer use authorisation license.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-those-who-have-recovered-should-also-take-the-vaccine-advises-health-ministry-928925.html
18-12-2020||National||Sonia Gandhi writes to Uddhav Thackeray on SC/ST welfare schemes||Congress President Sonia Gandhi has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, reminding him of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government vis-à-vis welfare programme related to Dalits and Adivasis. Writing about the suggestions that she has received, Gandhi said that the budget allocation for development of SC/ST communities needs to be proportionate to their share in population. “Focus may be on the schemes that benefit SC/ST communities to bring them on par with the rest of the society at the earliest. There should be legislative backing to utilize the funds allocated during the same financial year,” she said, referring to how previous Congress governments have done in Karnataka and undivided Andhra Pradesh.  “I am confident that under your leadership the MVA government in the state will continue to implement our MVA in letter and spirit,” she said in the two-page letter signed on 14 December.  The letter gains importance as this is the first time that Gandhi has written such a letter to Thackeray in nearly a year’s time since the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government came to power in Maharashtra. Besides, as far as the timing is concerned, that too is significant as nearly 50 per cent of the Gram Panchayats in the states go to polls mid-January – which will be a sort of acid test for the MVA dispensation and its penetration at the hinterland. Gandhi wrote that to stimulate entrepreneurship in SC/ST communities, reservation in government contracts and projects for enterprises promoted by SC/ST professionals should be introduced. According to her, this has been done by the Congress-led UPA government headed by Dr Manmohan Singh at the Centre and previous Congress-led dispensation in Karnataka. She asked rapid recruitment drives to be mounted for filling up backlog vacancies in a time-bound manner for posts already reserved for SC/ST in different departments. “Education, technical training and skill development for SC/ST youth is crucial. This should receive the highest priority and scholarship schemes, hostel facilities, particularly residential schools must be expanded,” she wrote.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sonia-gandhi-writes-to-uddhav-thackeray-on-sc/st-welfare-schemes-928927.html

Indian Railways' mega National Rail Plan (NRP) 2030 aims to provide confirmed tickets to every passenger, implying that there will be no waitlisted tickets. The Railways on Friday put a draft NRP for public consultations and feedback from stakeholders and various ministries. The next month, it aims to unveil the NRP. The Railways aims to build more dedicated freight corridor in the years to come, and it also plans to shift all freight trains on the dedicated corridor and run more passenger trains and semi high-speed trains on existing tracks. Among other things, the NRP 2030 will also focus on building infrastructure and generating more revenues for the Indian Railways- such that capacity is beyond the demand. "The Railways is hoping to increase its share in freight transportation from the present 27% to 45% by 2030 through better infrastructure and business development plans," Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav said. The Railways transported only 1,210 MT of the total freight basket of 4,700 MT till the end of 2019, but by 2024, it is planning to load 2,024 MT of the estimated 6,400 MT of the total freight, keeping it on track to achieve its target by 2030. The Railway Board chairman said that the national transporter will complete 20 additional coal connectivity projects and by December 2023, will conclude 146 railway electrification projects. It will also complete northeast connectivity projects of 288 km by March 2023 and the balance of 111 km of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla project by December 2022. The Vision 2024 plans will also include the speed raising of the New Delhi-Howrah and New Delhi-Mumbai routes to 160 Kmph and that of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) and Golden Diagonals (GD) routes to 130 kmph. "All these projects will include a total capital expenditure of Rs 2.9 lakh crore," Yadav said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-plan-to-give-confirmed-ticket-to-all-passengers-by-2030-928945.html

Till today, cultivators of Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh are not getting the minimum support price (MSP) of pulses and are committing suicide, he said in a message to the PTI. The claim of the implementation of the commission report is totally false, he said. The Union government has not assured farmers that they will get the MSP of their produce and there is no provision for it in the agricultural laws passed by the Centre recently, he said in a WhatsApp message. He said farmers do not want an aid of Rs 500 per month being given by the Centre but demand the minimum support price for their produce. Farmers are not beggars, Tikait added. He also alleged that the government is helping sugar mill owners by giving them export subsidy by which arrears of sugarcane growers will be paid. They are helping sugar mills owners and farmers will not benefit by it as they will only get their dues, Tikat added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday defended the new farm laws, saying accusations such as the new laws will lead to the scrapping of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops were blatant lies.

Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told a press conference that the prime minister is deceiving the farmers by meeting those in Madhya Pradesh through video-conferencing, instead of meeting those protesting in the cold at the doorstep of Delhi. He said the government should shed arrogance and repeal the three farm laws at the earliest. The Congress leader's remarks came on a day the prime minister interacted with the farmers of Madhya Pradesh virtually, while stoutly defending the new farm laws and saying those were in the works for decades and the people opposing the legislations now for gaining lost political ground were once votaries to the same reforms. Modi said the opposition parties were against the new laws as they were upset that he would get the credit, even as he dubbed as blatant lies and accusations that the new laws will lead to the scrapping of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the prime minister should stop spreading falsehood and take back the farm laws. "Being habitual, Modiji again spread falsehood today. Listen to the farmers and withdraw the anti-agricultural laws," he said in a tweet in Hindi. Gandhi asked how many more farmers will have to give their sacrifice and when will the farm laws be repealed. "How many more 'annadatas' (food givers) will have to give their sacrifice? When will the anti-agriculture laws be abolished?" he asked on Twitter. Surjewala said "Prime Minister Modi should listen to Chief Minister Modi" as he himself had recommended to then prime minister Manmohan Singh for making the MSP legally binding as the head of a working group. "Stop insulting the farmers by dubbing them as anti-nationals and apologise to them. It is shameful that the ministers of this government are dubbing the protesting farmers as terrorists, khalistanis, tukde-tukde gang members. Shed this shameful behaviour and the prime minister should instead apologise to the farmers for insulting them and take back the black laws," he said. "While ignoring the farmers protesting in the cold at the borders of Delhi, the prime minister is deceiving and betraying them by talking virtually to those in Madhya Pradesh. The truth is that the arrogance of the Modi government is responsible for the death of 24 farmers, who died during the protests while demanding justice," the Congress leader said. He said that the prime minister was being "farcical" with the farmers of Madhya Pradesh as a number of "mandis" (wholesale markets) have been shut down in the country after the new farm laws were enacted. Surjewala accused the government of trying to spread disinformation about the three farm laws and alleged that it was becoming a bigger trading company than even the East India Company of the British. "Why does Prime Minister Modi not listen to Chief Minister Modi on giving a legal guarantee to MSP? As a chief minister and while heading a working group, he had recommended to then prime minister Manmohan Singh to make MSP legally binding. Why is he denying his own statement today?" he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-should-stop-deceiving-and-betraying-farmers-congress-928973.html
18-12-2020||National||India well positioned to play vital role in Indian Ocean Region: Army Vice Chief||India's dominant position at the geographical centre of the Indian Ocean, as well as its robust economy and global standing as an upholder of law and democratic values, placed it in a firm position to play a vital role in the quest for peace and stability in the region, Vice Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen SK Saini said on Friday. In an address at a military think-tank, he said India believes that adherence to rule of law, transparency, respect for all nations and peaceful resolution of disputes are non-negotiable aspects to harness the vast potential of Indian Ocean. His comments came amid growing global concerns over China's increasing military muscle-flexing in the Indian Ocean, a region that is critical for India's strategic interests. The Vice Chief of Army staff cautioned that the increasing interest of "extra regional forces" and the existing challenges of piracy, human trafficking, illegal fishing have all made the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) volatile and a potential "global battlefield". India has significantly expanded its deployment of warships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region in the last few months following its border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, ostensibly to send across a message to Beijing. Lt Gen Saini identified preserving and facilitating the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) as among key challenges, adding inadequate arrangements for equitable and peaceful harnessing of natural resources were also important aspect of the overall scenario. "These concerns have been further accentuated by unilateral actions by some of the nations which have not only questioned the rights of the IOR nations to utilise their exclusive economic zones but have also challenged their sovereignty over some of the strategically located Islands itself," he said. In his address at the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS), the Vice Chief of Army Staff said such actions to change the "well-established equilibrium" has resulted in "immense turbulence and an intense superpower rivalry" in the region. "India's dominant position at the geographical centre of the IOR, a robust economy and a global standing as an upholder of law and democratic values, places it well to play a vital role in the quest for peace and stability in the region," he said. Lt Gen Saini said India has been increasingly engaging with all nations of the IOR and its outreach towards the East through the doctrine of SAGAR or 'Security and Growth for All' has been a pillar of its overarching foreign policy. "India recognises and believes that to harness the vast potential of the Indian Ocean for economic development, adherence to rule of law, transparency, respect for all nations and peaceful resolution of disputes will be inviolate and non-negotiable aspects," he said. "It would be appropriate to say that our role as a net security provider in the region is now a strategic obligation and no longer a matter of choice. India, therefore, requires to formulate a well defined IOR strategy and follow a robust capability development road map to live up to its potential in this region," he said. Lt Gen Saini said the unfolding diplomacy in the IOR is a clear indicator that the world powers want to forge partnerships with India to ensure peace and development in the region. The Vice Chief of Army Staff reiterated that the geographical factors coupled with the slow and steady shift of power from the West to the East, have resulted in the IOR becoming a hub of global geopolitical rivalry. The discussion was organised to get the defence forces, Indian industry, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders into a common platform in order to understand the complexities of changing dynamics in the Indian Ocean Region and to evolve coherent policies to address the future challenges.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-well-positioned-to-play-vital-role-in-indian-ocean-region-army-vice-chief-928983.html

"Outlining the role of SAIL plants which are based in the eastern region of the country in Mission Purvodaya, Pradhan has said both plants have an important role to play in the development of the eastern region as well as the nation," the ministry said. The Mission, which aims at accelerated development of eastern India through an integrated steel hub, was launched by Pradhan in January 2020. While launching the Mission in Kolkata, he had said it is expected that out of the 300 million tonnes (MT) steel capacity by 2030-31 in India, over 200 MT can come from eastern region alone. The Mission will also drive India's march towards USD 5 trillion economy target set by the government. According to the statement, the minister also directed the plants to work towards creating a sustainable production model which facilitates growth of downstream industries in and around the region. "These are important players not only for the region but for the nation as a whole. Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Mission Purvodaya will facilitate unleashing the true potential of the eastern region in the development of the nation," the statement quoted Pradhan as saying. As part of the review, the minister visited the important functioning areas of the plants.       Under the Mission, the country's steel making capacity would be enhanced through easing setting up of greenfield plants, developing steel clusters near integrated steel plants as well as demand centres. Besides, it aims to transform logistics and utilities infrastructure which would change the socio-economic landscape in eastern India. The steps under the Mission also include growth of steel industry along with employment opportunities across the entire value chain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sails-iisco-durgapur-plants-to-play-important-role-in-mission-purvodaya-dharmendra-pradhan-928987.html

The virtual meeting took place in the midst of growing global concern over China's expansionist behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad or Quadrilateral coalition comprises India, the US, Japan and Australia. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the officials reaffirmed their commitment towards a free, open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on shared values and principles and respect for international law especially the UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). The meeting of the senior officials came over two months after foreign ministers of the Quad countries held crucial talks in Tokyo. In November 2017, the four countries gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the 'Quad' to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence. The MEA said the officials exchanged views on regional and global issues of common interest. "They also reviewed ongoing and proposed practical cooperation in the areas of connectivity and infrastructure development, and security issues, including counter-terrorism, cyber security, maritime security, humanitarian and disaster relief, with the objective of promoting peace, security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region," it said. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the officials underscored the importance of enhancing the resilience of supply chains for an expeditious and sustainable global economic recovery. "They also highlighted the need to ensure safe, effective and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines," the MEA said. It said the officials reiterated their firm support for ASEAN-centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms, particularly the leaders-led East Asia Summit, in the regional architecture for the Indo-Pacific. They also expressed readiness to work with ASEAN and all other countries towards realising a "common and promising" vision for the Indo-Pacific. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprising 10 countries is a key stakeholder in the Indo-Pacific region. The MEA said the meeting provided an opportunity to follow up on the last such official level discussions in September, and the ministerial meeting of October 6 in Tokyo. "They appreciated the Vietnamese chairmanship of the ASEAN and expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the 15th East Asia Summit held in November this year," the MEA said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/quad-senior-officials-discuss-efforts-to-ensure-peace-stability-in-indo-pacific-928993.html

As winter chill gripped the plains, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said night temperatures would continue to be below normal in north India over the next week. In its forecast from December 17-24 and from December 24-30, the IMD said the minimum temperatures would be below normal by 2-6 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest, central and east India. Near normal or slightly above normal temperatures are likely over remaining parts of the country during the first week. “Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions would occur in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, west Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during the first half of the first week and decrease thereafter,” the IMD said. The minimum temperature dropped below the three degrees Celsius mark in parts of the national capital as frosty winds from snow-covered Western Himalayas continued to sweep the city. The mercury plunged to 2.7 degrees Celsius at Jafarpur. It settled at 3.5 degrees and 3.8 degrees Celsius at Ayanagar and Lodhi Road weather stations, respectively, the IMD said. Cold wave conditions are predicted in Delhi on Saturday and the same is likely to continue till Monday, it said. Kashmir continued to reel under freezing night temperature on Friday even as there was a marginal increase in the minimum temperature in Srinagar city and Gulmarg tourist resort, the meteorological department said. Srinagar - the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir - and the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir were the only places in the Valley where the night temperature improved Thursday night, it said. According to MeT, all the other weather stations across the Valley registered a further decrease in the minimum temperature. Srinagar recorded a low of minus 6.0 degrees Celsius, up from the previous night's minus 6.4 degrees Celsius which was the coldest night of the season. The mercury in Gulmarg settled at a low of minus 10.6 degrees Celsius, up from minus 11.0 degrees Celsius. The resort continued to be the coldest recorded place in the Union territory. The MeT office said while no major snowfall is expected till the end of this month in the UT, there is a possibility of light to moderate snowfall during December 21-22 at isolated places of Kashmir. The cold wave sweeping Punjab and Haryana also intensified, with Amritsar reeling at 0.4 degrees Celsius, the meteorological department said. The minimum temperature in Amritsar was recorded three notches below the normal, it said. Ludhiana and Patiala, also in Punjab, recorded their respective minimums at 3.2 degrees Celsius and 4.1 degrees Celsius, both down by three notches. Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recorded a low of 4.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal. In Haryana, Narnaul was the coldest at 1.5 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal limits. Intense cold wave conditions threw normal life out of gear in Rajasthan where the mercury dipped to minus 2.5 degrees Celsius in Mount Abu. Churu was the coldest place in the plains with a minimum temperature of minus 0.3 degrees, according to the meteorological department. The night temperature at other places in the state was below 7 degrees Celsius as many areas reeled under 'cold wave' to 'severe cold wave' in the night. Sikar, Pilani, Bhilwara, Vanasthali, Chittorgarh and Bikaner recorded a minimum of 1 degree, 1.5 degrees, 2.1 degrees, 2.7 degrees, 3.5 degrees and 4.3 degrees Celsius, respectively, it said. Cold to severe cold conditions occurred at a few places in western Uttar Pradesh and at isolated pockets in eastern part of the state in the last 24 hours. Dense fog and cold to severe cold condition occurred at isolated places in west and east UP, the MeT department said. At 3 degrees Celsius, Fursatganj (Raebareilly) emerged as the coldest place in the northern state, while Jhansi registered the highest temperature at 23.1 degrees Celsius. Keylong, Kalpa and Manali continued to shiver at sub zero temperatures in Himachal Pradesh in the last 24 hours, it said. The tribal district Lahaul-Spiti's administrative centre Keylong continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 10 degrees Celsius, Meteorological Centre Shimla Director Manmohan Singh said. Several parts of Madhya Pradesh in central India also experienced biting cold following a dip in mercury. The IMD's six out of 30 stations in Madhya Pradesh recorded a drop in mercury ranging between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius in the last 24 hours, senior meteorologist GD Mishra told PTI. In areas covered by IMD's 23 stations, minimum temperatures hovered between 3 and 10 degrees Celsius during the same period. Mishra said the lowest minimum temperature of 3 degrees Celsius was recorded at Datia, while the same in the state capital Bhopal was 7.4 degrees Celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-india-under-cold-grip-imd-says-slight-relief-expected-later-928999.html

The alleged swindling is said to be one of the biggest banking scams in the country, compared to the embezzlement by diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The CBI case was registered against Transstroy's CMD Cherukuri Sridhar, and additional directors Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, Akkineni Satish based on a complaint from the Canara Bank. Rayapati, hailing from Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, is a former Lok Sabha MP. Transstroy was earlier involved in the execution of the Polavaram project on river Godavari. The allegation against the infra firm and its directors is that they availed credit facilities on multiple banking arrangements. “The consortium was formed with other banks, led by Canara Bank. It was further alleged that the accused had been involved in falsification/fabrication of books of accounts, fudging of stock statements, tampering of balance sheets, round-tripping of funds etc,” the CBI said in a statement on Friday. The CBI has conducted searches at the premises of the private company and the accused persons in Hyderabad and Guntur, “which led to recovery of incriminating documents.” “It was also alleged that the accused have misappropriated bank’s funds and diverted the loan amount sanctioned by the banks and caused a loss of Rs 7926.01 crore approximately to Canara Bank and other member banks,” the central investigative agency said. CBI stated that the account had become an NPA and the fraud was reported. “Investigation in the case is going on,” CBI officials said. According to the Transstroy website, the National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad bench had ordered the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process against the company from October 2018. Transstroy states Cherukuri as the “overall in charge of corporate affairs and finance” and that his “competent leadership and industry network have transformed the company from a small proprietary business into a professionally managed entity with a brand value in the infrastructure sector in India.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-books-transstroy-for-rs-7926-crore-bank-fraud-929000.html

The Pakistan Army alleged that Indian Army personnel guarding the LoC resorted to “unprovoked firing” and “deliberately targetted” a UN vehicle. The incident took place at Chirikot Sector of the LoC. Two officials of the United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) were in the vehicle when it came under fire from Indian Army posts across the LoC, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, the spokesperson of the Pakistan Army, stated. He added that the officials had luckily remained unhurt and had been evacuated from the scene later. India dismissed the allegation by the Pakistan Army, with a source in New Delhi terming it “completely false and factually incorrect”. There was no firing from the Indian Army or the border guarding personnel on Friday in the place the Pakistan Army mentioned as the scene of the incident. “Since movements of UN vehicles are known in advance, the question does not arise of any such firing. The allegations are baseless,” said the source in New Delhi. Islamabad alleged that the UNMOGIP officials had been on their way to Polas, a village in Pakistan close to the LoC with India. They had been going to the village to meet the victims of the firing by the Indian Army personnel, who violated the ceasefire along the LoC and showered bullets on the border hamlet, alleged Maj Iftikhar of the Pakistan Army. “It must be noted that the UN vehicles are clearly recognisable even from long distances due to their distinct make and type and clearly visible markings,” the Pakistan Army spokesperson stated, apparently in support of his claim that the Indian Army personnel deliberately targetted it. Major Iftikhar also posted on Twitter pictures of the UN vehicle, marked with ‘UN’ and several bullet marks on it. “The reprehensible act of unprovoked firing by India on the UNMOGIP officers is indicative of a new low in the conduct of Indian occupation troops,” Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, the spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Pakistani Government, said in Islamabad. New Delhi does not recognize the UNMOGIP as it maintains that the mandate of the group had lapsed after India and Pakistan in 1972 signed the Simla Agreement, which left it to the two neighbouring nations to resolve disputes bilaterally with no scope for interference by any third party, not even the UN. India restricted access to its side of the LoC for UNMOGIP. Pakistan, however, grants access to UN observers to its side of the de facto border with India. Islamabad also often lodges complaints with the UNMOGIP about the alleged violation of ceasefire by the Indian Army along the LoC and its firing on Pakistan Army posts as well as civilians living in border villages in Pakistan. UN sources said that the UNMOGIP had reported that its vehicle had been impacted by an “unidentified object” and “sustained some damage”, although its officials and the driver had not been harmed. The UNMOGIP was currently investigating the incident, said the sources in the international organisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-claims-indian-army-fired-upon-un-vehicle-across-loc-new-delhi-dismisses-allegation-929001.html

Thousands of farmers from Haryana, Punjab, and other states have been holding demonstrations at Delhi's border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The actor, who was lauded earlier this year for his efforts in helping the migrant workers during the coronavirus pandemic, said he doesn't want to get into a debate as to who is right or wrong but only wants a timely solution to the problems of the farmers. "It feels very sad. I do know there is a solution to every problem. I was born and brought up in Punjab, I have spent time with farmers and I believe Punjabi community can be convinced with love if we give them time. (Punjabi kaum badi aasani se manai jaa sakti hai pyaar se agar hum inne samay de toh)," Sood said during a virtual session of "We The Women", where he was in conversation with journalist Barkha Dutt. "They are sitting at the highway, shivering, with little kids, some people have lost their lives, how long will we keep watching this?" he said. "When our family members are upset we try to cajole them, we don't ignore them. I think we will have to go back to them, cajole them, listen to what they have to say and listen to each other. I believe everyone is trying to get a solution. A solution will definitely come out of this." The 47-year-old actor further said that his heart goes out to the farmers who are on the roads and he gets saddened by the visuals from the agitation. "Farmers, who usually at this time would be in their farms planting seeds, are now on the roads with their children... These visuals are something we will never be able to forget," he added. Also part of the panel discussion was celebrated chef and filmmaker Vikas Khanna, who said that the protesting farmers need "guidance and solution". "It hurts. My whole life is based on food. My voice comes from food. We know these people, we know their faces, when they talk we understand where they come from. "The pain they must be enduring right now…I think they all are looking for guidance and better solutions or leadership," Khanna said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-never-be-able-to-forget-visuals-of-farmers-protest-says-sonu-sood-929008.html

The TMC government in Bengal led by Mamata Banerjee is strongly opposing the Centre's move to send three IPS officers, who were involved in the security of BJP chief J P Nadda during his recent visit to West Bengal, on central deputation. "I condemn the Centre's blatant interference in the Bengal administration. Encroaching on the rights of states by attempting to transfer police officers to Centre just before elections, is an assault on federalism and an attempt to destabilize," Kejriwal tweeted. The three IPS officers were responsible for the security of Nadda whose convoy was attacked during his recent visit to the state scheduled for Assembly polls in 2021. The Centre wants them shifted on account of alleged dereliction of duty that led to the attack on Nadda's convoy in Diamond Harbour constituency of TMC MP and Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee.  The West Bengal Chief Minister has slammed the Centre saying the move, particularly before the elections is against the basic tenets of the federal structure. It's "unconstitutional" and completely unacceptable, she has said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-encroaching-on-rights-of-states-arvind-kejriwal-on-transfer-of-ips-officers-from-west-bengal-928628.html

18-12-2020||National Politics||Protest not for farmers, it's meant to oppose Centre: Rupala||Union minister Parshottam Rupala on Friday alleged that the only purpose of the protest going on at Delhi borders against three farm laws is to oppose the central government and it is not meant for the welfare of farmers. He also urged the farmers to let these agriculture laws get implemented first and then approach the government for any modifications. "This agitation is not at all for the benefit of farmers. It is going on just to oppose the central government. There is always a scope for making amendments in the future if farmers feel that some provision is not right. So the upfront demand to scrap the entire law at this juncture is improper," the Minister of State for Agriculture said. The BJP leader from Gujarat was addressing a Kisan Sammelan (farmers' convention) in Vijapur town of Mehsana district as part of the ruling BJP's campaign in the state to make people aware of the three farm laws being opposed by a section of farmers and their organisations. "If you like the old system, then no one will stop you from selling your farm produce in the APMC. But, why do you want to stop others who want to earn more by selling outside the APMCs? "Similarly, no one is forcing farmers to enter into a contract, let alone the misplaced apprehension that traders will grab your land after inking the contract," Rupala added. He urged the farmers to have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and let the farm laws get implemented first. "Let the farm laws be there for some years. The government would make amendments if needed afterward. We do not have any problem with it. But asking the government to respond in just yes or no is not acceptable. What is the need of Parliament if laws are scrapped just because some people do not like it," he asked. Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/protest-not-for-farmers-its-meant-to-oppose-centre-rupala-928742.html

The Minority Affairs Minister also lashed out at Opposition leaders Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, alleging that the Congress leader was "posing" as a farmers' leader despite knowing little about farming, while the Delhi chief minister was "karne mein zero, dharne mein hero (zero in work, but hero in sit-ins)". Farmers throughout the country are satisfied that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked for their empowerment and interests after coming to power, Naqvi told PTI in an interview. The farmers' issue involves Minimum Support Price (MSP), kisaan mandis and protection of farmers' land and the government has given a 100 per cent guarantee on the three fronts, he said. Naqvi asserted that neither the MSP will go, nor the mandis and there was no threat to farmers' lands. The "Modi bashing brigade" instead of talking about issues of farmers, has started abusing Modi, he said, adding that questions arose with the entry of these "traditional Modi bashers". On farmers' issues, the government has always believed in talks not 'takraav' (confrontation), Naqvi asserted. "The government moved forward to resolve the issue through talks. When farmers were also satisfied that what the government was saying was logical and genuine, those people who were indulging in criminal conspiracy thought their game was going awry and they started misleading people," he said. The whole matter is one of "criminal conspiracy ka sandook aur kisano ke kandhe par bandook (a box of criminal conspiracy and firing from farmers' shoulders)", Naqvi said, hitting out at the Opposition parties demanding a repeal of the farm laws. Farmers have also understood that the issues have been solved and neither the farmers nor the country has any doubts about the honesty of Modi, Naqvi claimed. Attacking the Congress-led Opposition, the minister alleged that "failed political players" are "misleading" farmers. "These failed political players who have been rejected repeatedly by the people are acting under their depression of defeat. Farmers are genuine people, we respect them, there is no problem," Naqvi said. "This (farmers) movement has been going on for long and the BJP was born out of a movement, so we respect it. That is why no force was used and the farmers were facilitated here. Rahul Gandhi does not know much about farming, but is posing as a leader of the farmers," he said. The Opposition has been accusing the government of working for the interests of corporates by bringing the legislations, a charge denied by the government that has maintained that the laws will be beneficial for farmers in every way. A delegation of opposition parties including Rahul Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and Left leaders had last week met President Ram Nath Kovind seeking repeal of the three farm laws against which thousands of farmers have been protesting on various borders of the national capital. Naqvi also listed the Modi government's steps in the farmers' interest, saying in 2014 when his government came, the agriculture budget was increased to Rs 1,34,000 crore over the years, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sammann Nidhi was introduced along with pension for farmers, soil health cards and announcement of 'Aatmanirbhar package' of 1 lakh crore was made for them. To the Opposition's charge that the government dubs all those opposing it as Khalistanis or anti-nationals, Naqvi said the government never said "farmers are Khalistanis or urban Naxals and their movement is respected". "But, when undesirable elements, anti-social and anti-national elements make an entry, which is visible, then questions are raised, but that has nothing to do with the farmers," he said. "Everyone knows that Modi ji has reached here by working his way up after toiling on the ground and he knows about the pain of farmers and their problems," Naqvi said. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. At least five rounds of formal talks have been held between the three Union Ministers and 40 farmer unions to break the deadlock. The unions, however, are demanding complete roll back of the central laws. Last week, the Centre had sent a proposal to these unions, stating that it would give a written assurance that the minimum support price (MSP) system will remain and also redress their other key concerns.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/failed-political-players-acting-under-depression-of-defeat-misleading-farmers-naqvi-928792.html
18-12-2020||National Politics||On eve of Sonia's meeting with 'letter writers', Congress again asserts Rahul best suited to lead party||Ahead of a crucial meeting of Sonia Gandhi with a section of senior leaders who had written to her in August demanding an overhaul of the organisation, the Congress on Friday downplayed any internal dissensions and said Rahul Gandhi was the "right person" to lead the party. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the party stood united and together as a family and there are no dissensions pending after the announcement of elections to the party chief's post. The assertion comes ahead of Saturday's meeting between Sonia Gandhi and many of the 23 leaders who wrote to her in August. They had also demanded an active leadership and maintained that Gandhis will always be a "guiding force". Sources said among those slated to meet Gandhi are Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, the party's deputy leader in the upper house Anand Sharma, former chief ministers Bhupinder Hooda and Prithviraj Chavan, Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha and Shashi Tharoor. Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and senior leader P Chidambaram will also be part of the meeting, the sources added. Rahul Gandhi is also set to attend the meeting, the sources confirmed. Even as the party downplayed any internal frictions, the "letter writers" maintain that the issues they raised remain relevant and are "far from over". Azad had recently slammed "five-star culture" in the party and said elections must be held at all organisational levels starting from the block. Surjewala, however, said all issues raised by the "letter writers" stood resolved after Sonia Gandhi announced elections for the Congress president. "This is not a meet of any special group of leaders. This is not a meet of any dissenters or rebels. Because we consider each leader and each worker as part of the family," he said while seeking to downplay the meet. "Congress workers and the electoral college including the AICC members of the party will choose a person best suited for the post. "It is my belief and the belief of overwhelming majority of 99.9 per cent leaders and workers that Rahul Gandhi is the right person to lead the party and to take on the Modi government," Surjewala said. He said Rahul Gandhi is perhaps that "rare breed" of leaders who has fearlessly questioned the anti-people policies of Modi government and endearing himself not only to congress workers but also to ordinary Indians. "We feel Rahul Gandhi should lead the party from the front," he said. Asked about Saturday's meeting, he said the Congress president was unable to meet people on many issues for a considerable amount of time on account of COVID protocol. Starting Saturday and over a period of the next fortnight, Sonia Gandhi is going to meet and decide on various organisational issues besides those like winter session of Parliament not held, the farmers agitation and finalising alliances in key states, he said. Surjewala said addressing issues raised by some of the senior leaders, Sonia Gandhi has already decided to hold elections to the post of president of Congress and that the process is currently underway. "All matters stand resolved with the announcement of the election of the next Congress president so there are no internal issues of dissensions of any nature that are pending in the party. "BJP continues to sometimes propagate such insinuations which our leaders do not believe including those who had written letters. We are one family. We will stay united and work together," he said. The president of Congress will be chosen by the electoral college of the party, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/on-eve-of-sonias-meeting-with-letter-writers-congress-again-asserts-rahul-best-suited-to-lead-party-928913.html

In his letter to the President, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said Parliament must meet immediately as "a national priority" as the ongoing farmers' movement affects nearly 100 crore of our people directly and the rest indirectly going by the percentage of the country's population dependent on agriculture. Describing the government's attitude as a case of "historic blunder", Badal said, "the ruling party's stubbornness to listen to the country's 'annadata' and to let them die within a few hundred yards of Parliament would be remembered in history as a case of a heartless and conscience-less government at war with its own people." "The SAD president who, as Member of the Parliament, had voted against the three controversial farm Bills, on Friday wrote to the President," a party statement said here. Sukhbir wrote, "The government's excuse of the Covid-19 argument to justify the cancellation of Parliament's  Winter Session is indigestible". How do you convince the people that Parliament could meet to pass the three controversial Bills at a time when the pandemic was at its peak which required the prime minister to start the nation's fight against it with a long, countrywide lockdown. "Now, by the government's own admission, the intensity of the pandemic no longer requires a lockdown. Then, how does one justify the cancellation of the Winter Session? What was right then cannot be wrong now." In his letter to the President, copies of which have been marked to the Speaker, Lok Sabha and to the Vice President of India in his capacity as the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Akali leader said it is "absurd and ironical" that the ruling party sees no danger to public health during gatherings of thousands of people in its election rallies in Bihar and now in West Bengal. "But the government wants the countrymen to believe that even a limited meeting of Members of Parliament under strict SOPs would result in a pandemic flare-up? There is no lockdown on BJP rallies but there is a lockdown on Parliament comprising just a few hundred members, and that too under controlled circumstances. The COVID excuse is patently fake and even ridiculous," he wrote. Badal said the government "is making a laughing stock of itself. But the tragedy is ultimately the joke is on our poor people and on our sacred democratic traditions". Badal said even if the pandemic excuse were to be accepted, the obvious question still remains. "Are our lives more important than the lives of the millions and millions of people whom we represent and who trusted their destiny and lives in our hands at the elections? Are we going to betray that innocent trust because we are scared of meeting to help these patriotic 'annadatas' (farmer) to go back to their homes feeling secure about their future?"  Badal said Parliament must meet immediately as "a national priority" as the ongoing farmers' movement affects nearly 100 crores of our people directly and the rest indirectly going by the percentage of the country's population dependent on agriculture.  Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere are protesting near Delhi's borders for over three weeks now demanding repeal of the Centre's new farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-seeks-presidents-intervention-in-convening-winter-session-of-parliament-928918.html

Roy told reporters here that when he or Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh were in the TMC, there were no cases against them. "But ever since Arjun and I joined BJP, 55 cases were slapped against me and over 65 against him (Singh). Arjun's son too has been charged with false cases," Roy alleged. "This is a vindictive government which will be defeated in the next assembly election," he asserted at the press conference where Singh was also present. Roy welcomed the Supreme Court's Friday order granting interim protection from coercive action to five BJP leaders, including himself, Singh, and party general secretary in-charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya in allegedly false criminal cases. "We welcome the Supreme Court order. We know the truth will prevail," he said. Welcoming several panchayat members from Paschim Medinipur district who switched over from the TMC to BJP, Roy said many of them were from the minority community. "It shows people of different communities and religious faiths are uniting in Bengal under the BJP to remove the undemocratic TMC government." He claimed the ruling TMC will not be able to secure more than 100 out of the total 294 seats in the 2021 state assembly polls with its leaders and ordinary workers quitting the party in droves. He, however, did not want to comment on whether Barrackpore MLA Silbhadra Dutta, who quit TMC on Friday, will join BJP. Asked to comment on reservations expressed by Asansol MP and Union Minister Babul Supriyo about the possibility of Dutta joining the BJP, Roy wondered why the media was highlighting such issues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mukul-roy-hails-sc-relief-to-bjp-leaders-calls-tmc-govt-vindictive-929006.html
18-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi call centre plot fooled over 4,500 Americans into paying more than $14 million; Police arrest 50 persons||Police in New Delhi say they have arrested more than 50 people over a call center scheme that lured victims into thinking their assets were being frozen as part of an elaborate drug investigation and would then transfer money to avoid going to jail. According to authorities, scammers in the plot would telephone people and tell them that their assets and bank accounts were being seized after officers from multiple US law enforcement agencies found their bank account details at crime scenes involving drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia. More than 4,500 Americans fell for it, New Delhi police said Wednesday, and officials estimate that more than $14 million was transferred over two years. Investigators said the victims would be given a choice: Either face arrest or choose an “alternative dispute resolution” option that would allow them to avoid facing the law. “They were asked to buy Bitcoins or Google gift cards worth all the money in their accounts,” said Anyesh Roy, a police officer in New Delhi. The money was then transferred to what the victims were told was “a safe government wallet” but that actually belonged to the scammers. Call centers are part of India’s expansive outsourcing industry, which generates about $28 billion in annual revenue and employs roughly 1.2 million people. At the same time, the country has emerged as a hot spot for online fraud in which perpetrators are rarely punished. Cases have become so common in recent years that Indian authorities have dedicated special units to dealing with the problem. In August, police in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon raided a call center and arrested more than two dozen people suspected of being involved in cheating more than 30,000 Americans by positing malware onto their computers and then offering to fix them for a price. The call center employees sent countless links to pornographic websites to people across the United States, police said. When the links were clicked, the users’ computer systems would be bugged. The scammers would then direct the users to buy iTunes gift cards or charge them up to $700 each to debug the computers, according to police. Authorities have carried out raids across India and arrested hundreds of people, from boiler rooms in New Delhi, a hub of the global call center industry, to the suburbs of Mumbai, where cons impersonating IRS officials have demanded payments to cover back taxes. When police arrived at the call center in West Delhi on Wednesday, they said, they soon realized that it was one of the biggest operations they had seen in recent months. The scammers were trained to speak with American accents and told to read from a vetted script, police said. One officer investigating the case said that those involved were adept at making people quickly succumb to their demands and were rewarded with extra cash. Investigators said that the leader of the call center, an Indian man based in Dubai had also been involved in a similar previous case but had fled the United Arab Emirates before he could be detained. They said that he had paid those working at the call center $400 to $500 a month and that many of his employees were teenagers. Rakshit Tandon, a cybersecurity expert, said that Indian scammers hardly worked in isolation and that in each case investigators typically found a sleeper partner, either in the country where the victims live or in places where data can be leaked from other parts of the world. As India plunges into an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Tandon said it was likely that more call center crimes will be reported in the coming months, with a huge surge in unemployment and few jobs for educated young people. “We have trained and cheap manpower available,” he said. “Employees know they are cheating, but they still do it for extra money.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-call-centre-plot-fooled-over-4500-americans-into-paying-more-than-14-million-police-arrest-50-persons-928537.html

18-12-2020||North and Central||UP farmer leaders get R 50 lakh notices for 'inciting' farmers||In an apparent bid to prevent farmers from Uttar Pradesh joining ongoing protests by farmers from Punjab and Haryana against the new farm laws, the Uttar Pradesh government has slapped notices on six farmer leaders asking them to deposit a personal bond of Rs 50 lakh each to stop them from 'inciting' the other farmers. Notices were issued to the six leaders of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) in Sambhal district, about 450 kilometres from here, by the sub divisional magistrate (SDM), according to the sources. The official, however, said that there was a ''clerical error' in the notices and that the amount of the personal bond would be reduced to Rs 5 lakh instead of Rs 50 lakh. ''The clerk, who prepared the notices, mistakenly put the figure of Rs 50 lakh...it will be corrected and fresh notices will be sent to them,'' said the official here on Friday. Sources said that similar notices had been sent to six other farmer leaders though the amount in those notices was Rs 5 lakh. The official said that the SDM had the power to issue such a notice under section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The section states that ''when a magistrate deems it necessary to require any person to show cause under such section, he shall make an order in writing, setting forth the substance of the information received, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term for which it is to be in force''.

''To protest is our democratic right....no one can snatch it,'' said a farmer leader in Sambhal. The opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders accused the state government of trying to intimidate the farmers.

18-12-2020||North and Central||SC rejects BJP leader's challenge to election of Congress MP Dheeraj Prasad Sahu from Jharkhand||The Supreme Court on Friday answered in negative to an interesting legal question whether the vote cast by an MLA in Rajya Sabha election, in the forenoon would become invalid, due to disqualification, arising out of a conviction and sentence, in the afternoon of the very same day.   "In our view to hold that an MLA stood disqualified even before he was convicted would grossly violate his substantive right to be treated as innocent until proved guilty," a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said. The court ruled it is not possible to hold that the vote cast by Jharkhand MLA Amit Kumar Mahto at 9:15 am on March 23, 2018, should be treated as invalid on account of the conviction and sentence passed by the criminal court at 2:30 pm on the same day. "We hold the vote by Mahto was rightly treated as a valid. To hold otherwise would result either in an expectation that the Returning Officer should have had foresight at 9:15 am about the outcome of the criminal case in the afternoon or in vesting with the Election Commission, a power to do an act that will create endless confusion and needless chaos,"(sic) the bench said. The court said the position would have been different if JMM party MLA Mahto had been convicted and sentenced in the forenoon and yet he voted in the election to the Rajya Sabha in the afternoon with full knowledge. The court rejected the contention by BJP candidate, Pradeep Kumar Sonthalia against election of Congress candidate Dheeraj Prasad Sahu in 2018 Rajya Sabha poll.  The defeated candidate claimed Mahto's vote was wrongly accepted, as disqualification was to start from the date of conviction. He claimed the conviction was deemed in law to have commenced at about 00.01 am when the date of March 22 lapsed and the date of March 23 began. Trashing the argument, the court said, "To say that this presumption of innocence would evaporate from 00.01 am, though the conviction was handed over at 14.30 pm would strike at the very root of the most fundamental principle of Criminal Jurisprudence." A legislator stood disqualified as per Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 "from the date" of conviction. "In the present case, it would be significant to add that it is not necessary to make a declaration incompatible in the use of the word “date” with the general rule of law since the word “date” is quite capable of meaning the point of time when the event took place rather than the whole day," the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-rejects-bjp-leaders-challenge-to-election-of-congress-mp-dheeraj-prasad-sahu-from-jharkhand-928670.html

AAP MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj initiated a discussion on the issue following which the resolution was passed. "Scams come up regularly in BJP-ruled corporations. The new councillors have broken the record of their predecessors in corruption," he claimed. "The MCD is like a daughter of Delhi which was given to the BJP that has acted as a mother-in-law. The BJP is acting the same by demanding Rs 13,000 crore from the AAP. In the 2017 municipal polls, the BJP changed all its sitting councillors because people were unhappy with them," Bhardwaj said. The AAP MLA alleged that the scam runs into thousands of crores of rupees. "The building department of corporations is known for corruption and demanding bribes. A BJP councillor was caught red-handed by the CBI for taking Rs 10 lakh for construction of a building," he added. However, Leader of Opposition in the assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri termed the allegations of misappropriation of funds worth Rs 2,500 crore "baseless". BJP MLA OP Sharma boycotted the House when he was not allowed to speak in the debate. Party legislators displayed placards at their seats, demanding the release of financial dues of Rs 13000 crore to the civic bodies. Earlier in the day, AAP MLAs trooped into the well of the House raising slogans against the BJP-ruled MCDs as soon as the session started. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had adjourned the house for 15 minutes as the party MLAs continued to wave placards and raise slogans despite his attempt to bring order and continue the proceedings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-assembly-passes-resolution-demanding-cbi-probe-into-rs-2500-crore-scam-928695.html

Mayawati's comments came a day after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath approved the design, name and logo of the Noida international airport, which will be constructed in Jewar. "In UP, be it Ganga Expressway or other development projects or the new airport to be built in Jewar, the whole world knows that these are the eminent models of development formulated in the BSP government," Mayawati said. "First, the SP and now the present BJP government keeps patting itself on its back over these." The Noida International Greenfield Airport will have a picture of stork — the state bird — as its logo. It will be designed on the lines of world-famous airports in London, Moscow and Milan. "Metro and new schemes of basic public facilities in the state's major and ancient cities, including Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura, Kannauj, and the completion of them in record time are also the development model of the BSP. It was on priority with the rule of law that gave benefit to all sections," she said. "After the BSP government in 2012, whatever little development has been possible in UP, they are the result of the thinking of the BSP regime. In my government, this work would have been with more rapid pace if the Congress government at Centre did not obstruct them due to political interests and in the name of the environment," Mayawati said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-airport-is-a-result-of-past-bsp-govts-policies-mayawati-928700.html
18-12-2020||North and Central||SC gives notice to Karnataka SEC on BBMP polls||The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to the Karnataka's State Election Commission on a plea by the B S Yeddiyurappa government against the High Court's order for BBMP polls in 198 wards, in contrast to 243 seats as mandated under 2020 amendment into law. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian sought a reply from the SEC and M Shivaraju and others whose plea had prompted the HC to deliver its judgement on December 4. Besides the Karnataka government, Baskar and Dr B R Ambedkar Dalita Sangharsha Samiti also filed separate petitions against the High Court's judgement. The HC had also directed to hold the BBMP polls in 198 wards as expeditiously as possible by publishing the election programme within the maximum period of six weeks. The petitioners, for their part, questioned the validity of the HC's directions, saying the state legislature has already passed the Karnataka Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2020 to increase the seats for Councillors from 198 to 243 by a notification on January 14, 2020. This was done to give due representation to Scheduled Castes and other marginalised communities in the municipal council of a large and growing city like Bengaluru, they pleaded. The petitioners also contended the HC passed "erroneous" judgement on a writ petition filed by State Election Commission and others. The SEC neither had any locus standi nor authority to file a writ petition against validly enacted legislation. It had rather no choice but to give effect to the amendment, they said. The SEC, for its part, claim the Delimitation Commission had yet not submitted its recommendation for dividing the corporation into 243 wards and the exercise would take considerable time to complete. The term of BBMP corporation expired on September 10, 2020 not due to inactivity of the state but in view of prevalent pandemic, the petitioners claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-gives-notice-to-karnataka-sec-on-bbmp-polls-928710.html

The CBI has also charged the four youths, who were in jail, under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. According to the sources, the central investigating agency has relied on the ''dying declaration'' of the victim, who had breathed her last after battling for her life for several days at a Delhi hospital in September this year. The woman was allegedly gangraped and then brutally beaten by four youths of her village. She was found lying in a pool of blood in the fields later. The victim had suffered serious injuries on her neck, face, back and stomach and was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi after her condition worsened. She was paralysed in all four limbs and had to be put on a ventilator. She died a few days later. The police cremated her body in the dead of night in the absence of her family members. UP government had formed an SIT to probe the matter and suspended the district police chief and some other cops. The incident triggered a massive outrage with the opposition leaders targeting chief minister Yogi Adityanath for failing to ensure safety of the womenfolk in the state.

Addressing a special session of the Delhi Assembly, he claimed that scams of Rs 5,000-10,000 crore happen every year in municipal corporations while giving required permissions for buildings. "It's a very painful day as we are discussing the biggest scam in MCD. Rs 2,500 crore scam is bigger than the Commonwealth Games scam.

It could have been used to make 12,500 hospital beds or 7,500 Mohalla Clinics," Kejriwal added. The AAP national convenor asked Leader of Opposition in the assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri to push for a CBI probe into the alleged scam.

In reply to an RTI application, the government has stated that as many as 219 corruption cases - all against government servants - stand registered since October 2018 when the Vigilance Organization was rechristened as ACB by virtue of SRO 486 of 2018. As per the reply, of the 219 cases registered in the last two years, including Rs 223 crore loan scam in State Cooperative Bank, cases against former J&K Bank chairman, its executives, some chief engineers, superintendent and executive engineers, a few Kashmir Administrative Service (KAS) officers, deputy excise commissioner and senior officers of forest, health, rural development and other departments. The ACB has registered three cases against J&K Bank officials and the investigation is presently going on in these cases.  At present, the ACB has eight police stations - three in Kashmir, four in Jammu and one central police station with jurisdiction over the UT. Under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 54 cases had been registered in J&K in 2016 while the number grew to 79 in 2017. With Central Prevention of Corruption Act, which has stringent provisions becoming applicable in J&K UT from October 31 last year, more corrupt officers are falling in the ACB net now, an officer of the ACB told DH. He said two officers, including a SP from Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) and Deputy Director Enforcement Directorate (ED), have been deputed to the ACB to probe graft cases. “The fresh cases are registered against those officers, who were of the opinion that they will never be touched after committing huge frauds, due to their close proximity with the then ruling class of the erstwhile state,” the officer revealed. The allegations against officials, which formed the basis for registration of FIRs, include misuse of official position, demand and acceptance of bribe, illegal appointments, embezzlement of funds, allowing of illegal constructions by obtaining pecuniary benefits, possessing disproportionate assets, tampering of official records, facilitating encroachment of government land, use of sub-standard construction material, vesting of ownership rights of land illegally and forgery etc.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/in-two-years-acb-registers-219-cases-against-corrupt-officials-in-jk-928757.html

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that the court expects the police to take appropriate steps to implement the direction of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and also the provisions of section 144 IPC which has been imposed in the area where the chief minister's residence is located. The court said that if no action is taken for violation of the DDMA direction, then it will send out an "incorrect signal". With the direction, the court listed the matter for hearing on December 21. The court was hearing a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association, represented by advocate Rohit Bhagat, against the ongoing protest outside the CM's residence there on grounds that it was blocking the road and causing inconvenience to residents there.

The trade advances availed by the alleged company had to be returned within 90 days. Till March 2018, the alleged company had been performing as per the terms and conditions but defaulted later. In June 2018, during an inspection at the showroom of the alleged company, only 29 cars were found against 200 cars, said O P Mishra, Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW). "During the investigation, it further emerged that the accused persons had submitted that their company had availed the financial assistance of Rs 130 crore from other financial institutions including the complainant bank. Vaibhav Sharma had submitted a forged bank statement of J-K Bank for the period between June 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, wherein the alleged company had availed the OD of Rs 11.64 crore. During investigation of the bank records, it was found that the alleged company had actually availed the OD of Rs 49.51 crore," he said. The officials of the alleged company have misappropriated the amount to the tune of Rs about 102 crore and accused Sharma had told the complainant bank that the company was in losses during the past four years while the balance sheet of the company showed profits, Mishra said. During further investigation, it emerged that the alleged company has duped other banks and financial institutions to the tune of Rs 300 crore and obtained the credit facilities, trade advances and loans for demo cars, he said, adding the cars were sold without NOCs and the loan amount was misappropriated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-man-held-for-misappropriating-rs-300-crore-loan-amount-928818.html

18-12-2020||North and Central||Akhilesh Yadav attacks UP govt over notices to farmers seeking personal bonds||Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav on Friday attacked the Uttar Pradesh government for sending notices to farmers asking them to submit personal bonds assuring there will be no breach of peace during protests against farm laws in Sambhal. The district administration, however, cancelled the notices later. "Even though the Supreme Court has given legal acknowledgement to peaceful protests by farmers, the BJP government in UP is lodging FIRs to realise Rs 50 lakh from them. There has never been an anti-people government like the BJP," the SP leader said in tweet in Hindi with the hashtag "#Nahi_Chahiye_Bhajapa (No more BJP)". The Sambhal district administration on Friday cancelled the notices it earlier issued to 20 farmer leaders asking them to submit personal bonds of Rs 50,000 each over a police report that had warned of breach of peace during protests against the new farm laws. "Notices served to all the 20 farmers to submit personal bonds of Rs 50,000 have been cancelled on police report," Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Deependra Yadav told PTI. Those issued notices include Bharatiya Kisan Union (Asli) district president Rajpal Singh Yadav and farmer leaders Jaiveer Singh, Brahmachari Yadav, Satendra Yadav, Raudas and Veer Singh. They have been organising protests in the district over the Centre's three contentious farm legislations. On Thursday, the SDM had said, "We've got a report from the Hayatnagar police station that some persons are inciting farmers and there can be breach of peace, and they should be asked to fill personal bonds of Rs 50 lakh each." The farmers said the amount was too much, following which the police station in-charge gave another report and they were asked to submit personal bonds of Rs 50,000 each, the magistrate had said. The notices had been issued under Section 111 (magistrate order against any person who is likely to commit breach of peace) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition and SP leader Ram Govind Chowdhury issued a statement alleging that Prime Minister Narenda Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were playing into the hands of corporates "Adani and Ambani". "The PM and the CM are speaking the language of a worker of Adani and Ambani groups," it said. "If the farm laws are implemented, agriculture will be in the hands of corporates. Over 20 farmers have died during the agitation. These farmers should be declared martyrs," Chowdhury said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/akhilesh-yadav-attacks-up-govt-over-notices-to-farmers-seeking-personal-bonds-928855.html
18-12-2020||North and Central||Court grants bail to man accused in anti-CAA riots in Delhi||A Delhi court Friday granted bail to a man in a north east Delhi riots case, saying he was arrested 55 days after the incident, though he was already in jail in another riots case. It was alleged that he made a disclosure statement about his involvement in the incident while he was in jail. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted bail to Rashid on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in a case related to alleged vandalism and burning of a shop by the rioters during the communal violence in Gokalpuri in February. The court said the police opposed the bail application on the strength of categorical identification of two public witnesses but a perusal of their statements revealed that they have specifically named co-accused Shahnawaz and were silent about the role of Rashid. It further noted that the CCTV footage relied upon by the police in the case was of February 24 but the incident was of February 25. It said there was serious doubt about the credibility of the two police witnesses in the case as they waited till April 7 to name the accused when they had allegedly seen him indulging in riots. “Admittedly, the applicant (Rashid) has neither been named in the FIR nor there are any specific allegations against him. The prosecution in this case is opposing the bail application of applicant on the strength of his categorical identification by public witnesses Atul and Himanshu as also by Beat Officers namely Constable Vipin and HC Hari Babu. A perusal of the statements of public witnesses Atul and Himanshu reveals that they have specifically named co-accused Shahnawaz and are silent about the role of applicant. “The applicant was not arrested from the spot, instead his arrest has been formally effected in the present case on April 15, 2020 (that is after lapse of about 55 days of the date of incident) in Mandoli Jail, where the applicant was already lying lodged in case…, wherein he made disclosure statement qua his involvement in the case in hand,” the court said in its order. It directed Rashid not to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses in the case. It also directed him to install “Aarogya Setu” app on his mobile phone. It said the investigation in the matter was complete, the charge sheet has been filed and the trial was likely to take a long time. “Applicant (Rashid) cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the court said. During the hearing, advocate Salim Malik, appearing for Rashid, claimed he was falsely implicated in the matter and was merely present in his shop in the area in order to protect it from the rioters. Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for the police, said Rashid was allegedly present at the spot with an unlawful assembly which was armed with stones, sticks, petrol bombs, acid bottles, and which had indulged in vandalism, chanting of slogans against a particular community, stone pelting, putting on fire the shops and houses of a particular community. The court had on Thursday also granted bail to Riyasat Ali and suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain's brother Shah Alam in another riots case, saying the the statements of witnesses prima facie appeared to be an “omnibus one” as they were recorded on December 15, almost after 10 months from the date of incident. They were granted bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to gunshot injury received by Ajay Goswami during the riots in Dayalpur area. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/court-grants-bail-to-man-accused-in-anti-caa-riots-in-delhi-928858.html

The Lucknow bench of the high court directed executive magistrates and assistant commissioners of police concerned not to insist upon the detenues filing sureties.  The court directed the state government to file counter affidavit in the matter within four weeks, after which it would consider granting compensation to the detenues. A bench of justices D K Upadhyay and Saroj Yadav passed the order on a writ petition moved by the state president of UP Samajwadi Party Adhivakta Sabha. The petitioner's lawyers B M Sahai and Santosh Yadav Warsi contended that on December 14, the detenues were protesting in support of farmers' agitation at Qaiserbagh Baradari here. The police arrested them from the site and took them to Eco Garden Park, Alambagh, and later confined them in Lucknow district jail. "The 69 detenues have not been presented before the judicial magistrate till date while the police could not detain them for more than 24 hours without presenting them in the court and as such the detention is wholly illegal and they must be released immediately," the petitioner's lawyers argued. "Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that all the detenues shall be permitted to furnish personal bond as required by the executive magistrate by tomorrow itself before the authority concerned and they shall accordingly be released unless wanted in some other case," the bench directed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/allahabad-high-court-directs-immediate-release-of-69-samajwadi-party-workers-928881.html

18-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' stir: Protestor enacts 'symbolic suicide' in Noida||With a noose tied around his neck, a 40-year-old farmer enacted a “symbolic suicide” on Friday as peasants from various districts of western Uttar Pradesh protesting the Centre's new farm laws continued their demonstrations in Noida. Bir Singh Yadav, from Bahlolpur village in Noida, enacted the “symbolic suicide” at the Dalit Prerna Sthal where he has been camping along with scores of protestors belonging to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti). Separately, scores of protestors under BKU (Bhanu) continued their sit-in protest at the Chilla border, leading to partial closure of the Noida-Delhi Link Road, according to Noida Traffic Police officials. “The road is closed for Noida to Delhi movement but open for Delhi to Noida movement. Other key routes like DND and Kalindi Kunj which connect Delhi and Noida are open,” an official said. BKU (Lok Shakti) spokesperson Shailesh Kumar Giri said with the “symbolic suicide” the farmers' union has once again appealed to the central government to repeal the three new farm laws. “These are anti-farmer, black laws,” Giri said. Scores of protestors hailing chiefly from Noida, Greater Noida, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Muzaffarnagar are staying put at the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 2. Similarly, several protestors belonging to various districts in western UP are camping at the Chilla border since December 1. The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. In an interview to PTI, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said the government was hopeful of resolving farmers' agitation against three new farm laws before the new year and was continuing its informal dialogue with various groups to defuse the crisis, amid formal talks remaining deadlocked with the protesting unions refusing to accept anything less than the repeal of the Acts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-stir-protestor-enacts-symbolic-suicide-in-noida-928997.html
18-12-2020||South||Kerala: Rift in UDF out in open after setback in local body polls||The rift in the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) came out in the open a day after it faced a major setback in the local body polls in Kerala despiteperforming well in the Lok Sabha elections last year. Posters appeared in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office here, seeking to dissolve the district Congress committee. Also, boards were erected in Kozhikode district by Congress sympathisers criticising the party's state leadership. Though the State Election Commission (SEC) is expected to announce the final results only by Thursday evening, the latest trends issued by the poll body shows that the UDF was leading in 375 grama panchayats, 44 block panchayats, 45 municipalities and three district panchayats. The three-phase polling, conducted as per strict COVID-19 protocols, was held in a total of 21,893 wards in 1,200 local self governing bodies--including six corporations, 941 village panchayats, 14 district panchayats and 87 municipalities on December 8, 10 and 14. The counting was taken up on Wednesday. Senior leaders including former union minister P J Kurien, Vadakara MP K Muraleedharan and Kasaragod MP Rajmohan Unnithan, hit out against the party leadership headed by Mullappally Ramachandran and said the organisationalset-up of the Congress party was weak. "It's not right to say that our party lost its base in the state. But it seems like when our political rivals are expanding their voter base, we were unable to do so. That seems like the reason behind our defeat," Unnithan told the media. Senior Congress MP K Sudhakaran also lashed out at the state Congress leadership and said democracy needs to be reinstated in the party. "We need to reinstate democracy inside the party. The party should bring in leaders who can instill confidence in the minds of party workers and the civil society. Then we can save the party," Sudhakaran told the media. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a major ally of the UDF, had on Wednesday itself said that the Congress and the Front had to introspect the matters that led to the debacle. "There are many things which the UDF needs to introspect with regard to the various political changes in the state," IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty told the media on Thursday. On Wednesday, Kerala Congress leader P J Joseph had alleged that the Congress had cheated his party at Thodupuzha. Shibu Baby John, leader of Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), an ally of the UDF, said "the Front failed to use the anti-government sentiment". The Left front appeared to make a sweep of the local body polls by leading in 514 grama panchayats, five corporations and 11 district panchayats, as per the latest update on the SEC website. Ramachandran, along with Leader of Opposition, Ramesh Chennithala and former chief minister Oommen Chandy met the media on Wednesday and said the party will address the matters that led to the defeat. "When compared with the 2015 local body polls, the UDF did better this time. It's true that the anti-government sentiments were not seen this time. We will address the failure in each panchayat and move forward after correcting the mistakes," Chennithala had said. The ruling CPI(M) which won the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has alleged that there were incidents of cross- voting in the district saying the Congress helped the BJP. Chennithala had also said that the BJP has proved to be a total failure in the state and the Congress party would continue its fight against the 'anti-people' policies of the central and state governments. The Congress won 19 out of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala during the 2019 elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-rift-in-udf-out-in-open-after-setback-in-local-body-polls-928585.html

While DMK President M K Stalin led the fast at Valluvar Kottam here, Puducherry Chief Minister and Congress veteran V Narayanasamy headed the agitation in the neighbouring union territory. Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting outside Delhi for over three weeks against the central legislations, demanding that they be repealed. Stalin said the opposition bloc was extending solidarity to farmers who were taking forward the protests to "protect their life", even as he questioned the 'haste' with which the laws were enacted. He termed the farm laws as "anti-people" and against the ryots. "Farmers have been protesting (outside Delhi) for 23 days as of today. We have been extending our support to them through various protests but today's hunger strike has been undertaken to express solidarity on behalf of the Secular Progressive Alliance," Stalin, also Tamil Nadu Leader of Opposition, said in his address. The DMK-led coalition in the state is known as the Secular Progressive Alliance and had faced the 2019 Lok Sabha polls under this banner. Lashing out at the BJP-led Centre, Stalin questioned the 'haste' in enacting the laws during the COVID-19 pandemic and also hit out at the union government over its labour reforms and the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) among others. The government was not standing by the people but corporates, he alleged, and charged the Centre with offering a slew of sops to big private firms. "Today, the entire country is in a boil against these three (farm) laws...farmers are staying put in Delhi with their families despite the harsh winter and are opposing the legislations as the legislations are totally against agriculture," he said. The government should have consulted stakeholders including farmers before enacting the laws or had discussions in the Parliament to 'safeguard democracy.' "The Central government did not do any of these. What is the haste. To protect whom have they brought these laws. They should clarify these before people," the DMK chief demanded. Stalin termed as "a drama" the Centre's talks with representatives of the protesting farmers and pointed out that the farmers wanted nothing less than a repeal of the laws and not any amendments to the acts. He also took objection to the protesters being "branded by the government as anti-nationals, foreign agents, Maoists..." DMK and its allies support the farmers' demand for repealing of the laws, he said and asserted "our protests will continue till then." Besides Stalin, party MP Kanimozhi, alliance party leaders-- Vaiko of MDMK, former TNCC president K V Thangkabalu and those from the CPI, CPI (M) and VCK participated in the protest here. A two-minute silence was observed at the protest site for farmers who have died so far during the protests near Delhi. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Puducherry, chief minister Naryanasamy, leaders from Congress, the Left parties and VCK observed a fast at Odiansalai. The chief minister told reporters that the Centre had brought in the controversial laws which would "harm farmers and help corporates." He appealed to the Centre to immediately repeal the laws and protect agriculture. Separately, DMK legislators R Siva, K Venkatesan and former Education Minister S P Sivakumar and members of different wings of the party went on the hunger strike in Tirukanoor village.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-allies-stage-hunger-strike-in-tamil-nadu-and-puducherry-in-support-of-protesting-farmers-928630.html

With this, AIADMK joins the DMK and Makkal Needhi Maiam that are already on the campaign trail for the elections due in the first half of 2021. Palaniswami, who is the Chief Ministerial candidate of the AIADMK, will launch his campaign on Saturday after offering prayers at the Senrayar Perumal Temple in Periyasoragai village in Edappadi constituency. “Since I do not come to my constituency regularly due to my travel schedule, several programmes have been arranged in my assembly constituency. I will launch my campaign for the elections on Saturday,” Palaniswami told reporters on Friday. AIADMK is the third party to begin its campaign for the assembly elections after DMK and MNM of actor Kamal Haasan. DMK's youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin, Lok Sabha MP Kanimozhi, and 13 other senior leaders of the party have been meeting people in various districts since November as part of the campaign. Kamal Haasan launched his campaign last week from Madurai, during which he promised to make the ancient city second capital of Tamil Nadu when his party comes to power. The 2021 elections is likely to be a crowded affair with too many players vying for the hot seat at Fort St. George, the seat of power of Tamil Nadu government. Tamil superstar Rajinikanth has also promised to launch a political party in January.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-cm-to-launch-assembly-election-campaign-in-salem-district-on-saturday-928864.html

The victim was working in the Kancheepuram Agriculture Development office when the incident happened on December 7, the rights panel said on Friday. "The National Human Rights Commission has taken cognizance of a complaint that due to lack of toilet facility in her office, a warehouse manager of Tamil Nadu government went outside to relieve herself in an under-constructional building and died, after she fell down in a septic tank there," the rights panel said in a statement. The Commission has issued a notice to the government of Tamil Nadu through its chief secretary, seeking a detailed report. "It should include action taken against the delinquent public servants, who have failed to provide basic facility in a government office. The response is expected within six weeks," it said. Issuing the notice, the Commission has observed that it appears that the state government has "prima facie failed to cater the basic needs for its employees", who discharge their duties for the welfare and well-being of the people. "It seems to have shown remissness to protect and secure the life and dignity of a woman employee," the rights panel said. The Commission has also noted that the "central government has initiated various schemes under Swachh Bharat Mission to construct toilets as a basic amenity, mainly for girls and women specifically, but unfortunately, it has shown no improvement in the condition of state government departments, much less, a good and conducive working environment, which is the paramount consideration for any employer to offer to its employees". Article 42 of the Constitution of India, which is under the Directive Principles of State Policy, makes it mandatory for the State to ensure that it is the duty of the administrative authority to secure just and human conditions at the work place, the statement said. According to the complaint, "since there is no toilet in her office, the 24-year-old victim had gone to relieve herself in a nearby building that was being constructed under a state government scheme. A tin sheet was used to cover the septic tank, nearby which she went to relieve herself, when she somehow got slipped and fell into the tank," it said. "When she did not return for half-an-hour, her colleagues got worried and went in search for her. They were shocked to find her footwear floating in the septic tank and then tried to rescue her. They rushed her to the Kancheepuram Government Hospital with the help of local residents but she was declared brought dead," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/lack-of-toilet-nhrc-notice-to-tamil-nadu-govt-over-womans-death-928902.html

The Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee (GDMC) has decided to give Rs 10 crore to the Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund in view of floods and calamities in Kerala in 2018 and 2019. A full bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday overruled an order of the division bench last year rejecting a batch of petitions for seeking a refund of the amount to the GDMC. The full bench maintained that all properties of Guruvayur Devaswom vest will the idol of Lord Guruvayurappan, consecrated in Sri Krishna Temple. There was no provision in Guruvayur Devaswom Act to contribute or part with or give away in any manner any amount from the funds belonging to Guruvayur Devaswom either to CMDRF or to any other government agency. The decision of GDMC to donate to CMDRF had earlier triggered a row with the BJP and many Hindu outfits alleging that it amounted to misappropriation of funds. But Guruvayur Devaswom chairman K B Mohandas justified the decision citing that it was part of the Devaswom's social responsibility and similar donations were made during flood also.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/guruvayur-temples-contribution-to-kerala-cmdrf-found-void-928904.html

A large posse of policemen was posted in the area to prevent the protestors from resorting to any violence. Police swung into action and dispersed protestors after some of them tried to gatecrash into the Divis facility. Divis manufactures and exports active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediaries to several countries and is now on an expansion mode. Police said five people were taken into custody in connection with the agitation. There had been an agitation for the past few days as Divis commenced work on its third unit near Kakinada with a proposed investment of Rs 1,500 crore. The locals have been demanding that the company stop the establishment of the new unit as it would adversely affect the local environment and the livelihood of fishermen. The opposition Telugu Desam Party condemned the police action on the protestors and demanded that the state government look into their demands. Peddapuram TDP legislator N China Rajappa wanted the police force withdrawn from the village to placate the locals. Police picket, however, is continuing near Divis to prevent untoward incidents, a senior official said over phone from Kakinada.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tension-after-police-remove-tent-erected-by-anti-divis-protestors-928941.html

18-12-2020||South||Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami lashes out at DMK, calls it 'opportunistic'||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami on Friday accused the opposition DMK of being "opportunistic" and claimed it wanted only one family to prosper. While AIADMK stalwarts, the late chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa had no heirs, it was the people of the state and the party supporters who were the heirs, he said at the inauguration of Amma Mini Clinic in the district. Targeting his party's archrival DMK, the AIADMK Co-coordinator alleged that "right from the leadership to the last person in the opposition party, they all want only one family to prosper," and said it was not the case with the AIADMK whose functionaries were keen on people's welfare. "Unlike the DMK, the state government and the AIADMK (party) have concern for the people. I am the only chief minister in the state to visit each and every district, meeting officials and people and solving their problems, besides reviewing the implementation of government welfare schemes," he said. However, the DMK was "opportunistic," he said. In the AIADMK, those who work hard can come up and loyalty will be rewarded with high positions, he said. This dedication enabled the AIADMK to grow strong enough to defeat the DMK's attempts to dislodge the government and break the party, he said. On Stalin's repeated criticism on many issues, he claimed the DMK leader was 'intentionally' targeting the state government and even the officials who despite the coronavirus crisis, went to the nook and corners of Tamil Nadu to solve people's problems. While he, ministers and government representatives were meeting people in person despite the covid pandemic, Stalin was addressing his party workers through video conference meetings, the chief minister said. "Is it good to meet people or to sit at home addressing videoconference meetings with party workers?" he asked. Only when one is active on the field, one can understand what is affecting the people and accordingly take steps to resolve the problems. "This is what we are doing. I, my ministers, government officials and even the AIADMK elected representatives are striving for the well-being of the people," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-cm-palaniswami-lashes-out-at-dmk-calls-it-opportunistic-928982.html

Some 13 people who wished to be elected unopposed as gram panchayat members had assured to pay Rs 51.2 lakh in the name of the village deity, provided no villager voted or contested. Auctioning of seats has become a headache for authorities ahead of elections to 5,762 gram panchayats. The first phase of polling for 3,019 gram panchayats is scheduled on December 22. The second phase polling will be on December 27. In all, there are 2.97 lakh voters who will elect members for 92,121 seats. But even before the first phase of polls, 4,377 candidates have been elected unopposed and 40,352 candidates have withdrawn their nominations. This stinks of auctioneering, according to sources. In his order on the Sindigeri case, State Election Commissioner B Basavaraju noted that the aspirants had gathered voters of four gram panchayat constituencies at Eshwara Temple in Byluru village on December 5, and agreed to pay the amount to the deity after the completion of elections. "By doing so, they have actually scuttled the process of election and thereby successfully prevented the villagers of Bylur from casting their vote... The misuse of the temple premises as a platform for auctioning the seats amounts to violation of the Model Code of Conduct," the order said. Following a detailed investigation into the incident, elections to constituencies 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Sindigeri gram panchayat have been countermanded. The SEC invoked Constitution Article 243-K to act against the aspirants "as there was no specific provision to apply to the present situation." The SEC has flagged five more instances of auctioning where police complaints have been filed: Ward 1 of Bilawara gram panchayat in Yadrami, Kalaburagi; Bedli and Iragasandra villages of Madderi gram panchayat in Kolar; Yadalagatte village of Kaluvehalli gram panchayat, Challakere, Chitradurga; Bilaguli village in Arkalgud, Hassan; Hosalli EJ gram panchayat limits at Sindhanur, Raichur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/seat-auction-polls-to-sindigeri-gp-countermanded-928930.html

Officials said that the order from the Department of Administrative Reforms comes in the wake of the courts threatening contempt proceedings for the failure of the department to implement the directions. In cases where the state government or its departments are parties, the secretary/principal secretary/additional chief secretary of the concerned department will be the nodal officer to monitor the compliance of the orders from the high court, Supreme Court or the state administrative tribunal (KSAT), it said. Where the government is not a party, then the concerned head of the department or deputy commissioner of a district will be the nodal officer to monitor the compliance of such orders, it added. The latest order comes on the back of the GO issued on December 6 which said delays in a follow-up action, including appeals, review petitions or special leave petitions, has led to the government losing cases and also denied "rights of citizens". It said that all the departments should use the Court Case Monitoring System (CCMS) for tracking, follow-up and timely action on each case of the courts and listed 43 steps to be followed by the government employees within a time limit at various levels, from section officers to the heads of the departments and even the chief secretary. Sources in the government said service-related matters are among the top of the issues pending at the government level for months despite the orders from courts and tribunals. "There are several cases of improper implementation or non-implementation of orders. The Irrigation, departments, DPAR and Home Departments have more than 50 such cases," the source added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-govt-fixes-nodal-officers-to-deal-with-court-matters-928968.html

The move came after a delegation from the Brahmin Development Board petitioned Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa in this regard and said these contents were "insulting" to the Brahmin community. Stating that the seer of Mantralaya mutt had telephoned him and informed him about the feelings of the Brahmin community, Suresh Kumar in Facebook post clarified that revision of textbook or addition of any fresh chapter has not taken place after the current government came to power. "I have promised to the seer that the blunder that has taken place in the past and has come to light now will be rectified immediately," he said. While citing the reasons for the birth of new religions, the content in the class 6 social science textbook states Sanskrit was the language of priests and the common man could not understand it, the minister said in his note. According to the textbook, there was a food scarcity because 'homa' and 'havana' (fire rituals) were performed by offering large quantities of foodgrains, milk, ghee and other materials. Also it has been said sacrificing animals that were helpful to farmers in cultivation contributed to it, he pointed out. Further highlighting similar such portions, Suresh Kumar in his note said the opinion of majority of the people is that such content was unnecessary and was above the standard of the students of the age group to whom it was taught. Such provocative content will not only lead to confusion in the society, but also hurt the feelings of the people of certain sections of community or society, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-to-remove-textbook-content-that-hurt-feelings-of-brahmins-928754.html

Chodankar said earlier this week he submitted his resignation from the post of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president to interim party chief Sonia Gandhi and state in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. The Congress had won only four Zilla Panchayat seats, out of the 49 where polling was held last week. The ruling BJP had bagged 32 seats. Results of the Zilla Panchayat polls were announced on December 14. "Taking full responsibility of the ZP results. I have tendered my resignation from the post of GPCC chief, he said without elaborating further. Chodankar was appointed the GPCC chief in April 2018, replacing Shantaram Naik, a former Member of Parliament. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party had won one of the two seats in Goa. Its candidate Francisco Sardinha was elected from South Goa defeating BJPs sitting MP Narendra Sawaikar. Assembly polls in Goa are due in early 2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-congress-chief-girish-chodankar-quits-over-poor-show-in-local-polls-928668.html

Any such move will increase the annual maintenance cost by five folds and make the Metro venture non-feasible and non-starter, the former chief minister said. The Bombay High Court on Wednesday stayed the order passed by the Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in suburban Kanjurmarg for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. The erstwhile BJP government, headed by Fadnavis, had chosen Aarey Colony, a green belt in Mumbai, for the car shed, part of Mumbai Metro 3 line. However, the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, after assuming office in November last year, shifted the depot site to Kanjurmarg. After the HC order, there were reports in a section of the media about the state government exploring some other potential sites for the car shed, including BKC. "The talks of setting up the Metro car shed at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) are ridiculous and childish. The reason is that the BKC is a prized land. "The last land sold at BKC was at the rate of Rs 1,800 crore per hectare. So, if 25 hectare land is taken at BKC (for the car shed) it would cost Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore," Fadnavis said while talking to journalists at the Nagpur airport. He said the proposed bullet train station at BKC would be a three-level underground structure and take only 500 meters of land. "It is designed in such a way that financial buildings can be constructed above it without any loss. "But, if we talk about constructing the Metro car shed below the ground, then its cost will go up from Rs 500 crore (envisaged under BJP government) to more than Rs 5,000 crore," the Leader of Opposition in the assembly said. Besides, its annual maintenance cost would increase five folds and this would make the Metro project non-feasible and non-starter, he said. I am not able to understand who is giving such suggestions to this government. May be someone wants both the government and Maharashtra to sink, said Fadnavis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-metro-depot-at-bkc-will-increase-project-cost-devendra-fadnavis-928712.html

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel noted the stand of the state pollution control board that it has issued closure directions under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 against seven hotels operating without consent. It also noted that notices have also been issued to the non-compliant hotels, requiring them to show cause why they will not be closed and compensation recovered. The NGT directed the Municipal Council to comply with its constitutional obligation of Waste Management to enforce the environmental norms which needs to be overseen by the Secretary, Urban Development from the Maharashtra State. "As regards inadequacy in the Zonal Master Plan, there is some difference of opinion between the parties but it is undisputed that the ZMP has been finalised and published. The bench said instead of prolonging proceedings, it may be appropriate that the only surviving issue of coordination and checking up of factual position may be done by a senior authority of the State itself to coordinate with the different authorities so as to ensure compliance of law. The Secretary, Urban Development may hold a meeting with concerned authorities (if necessary by video) and take further remedial measures, as found necessary. "The applicant may make a representation for the purpose within four weeks. It will be open to the Secretary, Urban Development to coordinate with any State Agency who may be concerned about the matter," the NGT said. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Bombay Environment Action Group for finalisation of Zonal Master Plan for Eco-Sensitive Zone of Matheran Hill Station in State of Maharashtra.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ngt-directs-maharashtra-to-hold-meeting-to-enforce-environmental-norms-for-matheran-hill-station-928732.html

The matter came to light on Thursday after the department registered an FIR against unidentified staffers. Before lodging the case, the department had conducted an internal inquiry for four years. But despite the probe, no trace of missing gold was found. Jamnagar Superintendent of Police Deepan Bhadran confirmed to DH that the FIR has been registered. "The missing gold was part of the seized articles from 1972 to mid-1990s. We registered the FIR on Thursday and have started an investigation," he said. The FIR has been filed under section-409 of Indian Penal Code (criminal breach of trust by public servant) on the complaint submitted by Customs Inspector Ram Singh Yadav against unidentified persons at Jamnagar, division 'B' police station. The FIR states that the missing gold articles belonged to Bhuj Customs division which was transferred to Jamnagar after the latter's office got damaged in the 2001 earthquake. There was a total of 3,149.398 grams of gold at that time. In 2016, Bhuj division took back the gold when it was revealed that 2,156.722 gram of gold, worth Rs 1.10 crore, was missing. This prompted the authority to set up an internal investigation but couldn't find the culprits. Interestingly, the precious metals were locked in suitcases whose keys were also found to be missing. The officials had to break the locks back in 2016 to check them. According to the FIR, the missing gold articles had been seized in different operations in a crackdown on gold smuggling between 1982 and 1986. "It is quite difficult to trace the culprits as so many people must have been posted and transferred, besides their retirement, during this period," said a policeman familiar with the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gold-worth-rs-110-crore-goes-missing-from-customs-custody-928749.html

This is an exceptional case where the transplant spans four generations. The child -- Aizah Tanvir Qureshi -- was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease resulting from a condition known as Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and a kidney transplant was urgently needed to save her. The transplant procedure was successfully carried out at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) on November 25 by the transplant team led by Dr. Sharad Sheth, Consultant & Head - Nephrology, KDAH. After an uneventful recovery, both donor and patient were discharged, the KDAH said on Friday. “The patient is the only child of her parents. When she came to our hospital, she had facial swelling since six months, which had increased in recent weeks along with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. She was found to have severely deranged renal function along with metabolic acidosis. She was immediately put on hemodialysis and a kidney transplant was needed,” Dr Sheth. In his 40 years of practice, this was perhaps the most unique transplant considering the age and relationship of the donor and the recipient. In the entire family of the patient, the 70-year-old great-grandmother Rabiya Banu M H Ansari was the only match. Also, she was healthy and her blood group was compatible with the patient. After a thorough assessment and investigation considering her age, she was evaluated as fit for donation. After the successful transplant, both the donor and recipient are doing well. The great-grandmother was discharged on the fifth day. The patient’s kidney function tests showed an improvement and she was discharged on the 14th day. The team under Dr Sheth included Dr Sanjay Pandey, Head, Andrology and Reconstructive Urology, Dr Attar Mohammad Ismail, Consultant, Urology and Renal Transplant Surgeon and team. “It was very painful to see our little Aizah undergo hours of hemodialysis almost every alternate day. We are grateful to the KDAH for giving her an opportunity to lead a normal life like other kids. Her maternal granny came as the saviour of my child,” said the child's grateful parents, Nazneen, a housewife, and Tanvir Qureshi, a businessman.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/great-grandmother-donates-kidney-to-save-four-year-old-great-granddaughter-928772.html

The direction comes in the wake of the Bombay High Court on Wednesday staying the order passed by the Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in suburban Kanjurmarg for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. "The chief minister has asked the MMRDA to explore other sites for the metro car shed," the official from the state Urban Development Department said. However, he refused to give any further details. After the HC order, there were reports in a section of the media about the state government exploring some other potential sites for the car shed, including the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led MVA government in Maharashtra are locked in a tussle over ownership of the Kanjurmarg land that was earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot, which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The Union government had filed a petition in the high court challenging the October 1, 2020 order passed by the collector allotting the land for construction of the car shed, and said the land belongs to its (Centre's) salt department. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar had on Wednesday indicated that the state government might approach the Supreme Court against the high court's order staying allotment of Kanjurmarg salt pan land for the car shed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-asks-mmrda-to-explore-other-sites-for-metro-car-shed-928799.html

Talking to reporters, Raut said the opposition need not worry about the Metro 3 car shed, whose fate hangs in balance after a Bombay High Court order. "The government doesn't need to take advice," he said, when asked about the BJP's criticism that shifting the car shed project to BKC would be a wrong move. "There are reports in the media about a BKC plot being one of the alternative sites. The plot is being considered," the Sena MP said. One of the stations of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train has been planned at BKC, an upscale area in the suburbs which houses offices of corporates, banks and government establishments. The Bombay High Court on Wednesday stayed the order passed by the Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in suburban Kanjurmarg for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. The erstwhile BJP government, headed by Devendra Fadnavis, had chosen Aarey Colony, a green belt in Mumbai, for the car shed, part of Mumbai Metro 3 line. However, the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, after assuming office in November last year, shifted the depot site to Kanjurmarg. Meanwhile, BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Friday hit out at the MVA government for considering shifting the car depot to BKC, saying it wants to halt the bullet train project. Speaking to reporters, Shelar said, The Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government is not serious about setting up the Metro car shed. "After the High Court put a stay on the car shed construction at the Kanjurmarg site, instead of going to back to Aarey land, this government is now trying to halt the bullet train project as well. This is purely anti-development attitude." Shelar, a former minister, criticised Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for "halting" the progress of Mumbai. It is the arrogance of the Chief Minister that is halting the progress of Mumbai. The bullet train project is meant to bring development. "But by proposing the plot earmarked for the bullet train for setting up the metro car shed, the MVA government is halting both mega projects. This is foul play on part of the government, the BJP leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bkc-plot-under-consideration-for-mumbai-metro-car-shed-sanjay-raut-928825.html

This left BJP's state unit fuming as the bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad is the pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In fact, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has stepped up attack on Thackeray and his MVA government after the Bombay High Court put on hold the Mumbai Suburban Collector order of transfer of Kanjur Marg land to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority temporarily. A couple of months ago, Thackeray had scrapped the erstwhile BJP-led government for construction of car shed inside the Aarey Milk Colony, which is a green lung of Mumbai and shifted it to Kanjur Marg salt-pan land. Thackeray’s close aide and state’s Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde was quoted saying that the Bombay High Court order is being studied and the government has asked to study the land at the Bandra Kurla Complex. "There are reports in the media about a BKC plot being one of the alternative sites. The plot is being considered," Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said. Reacting to the development, Fadnavis, a former Chief Minister, said: “This is ridiculous and childish….you cannot behave like a Maharaja.” “Shifting the car shed to BKC will increase the project cost multiple times. Any such move will increase the annual maintenance cost by five folds and make the Metro venture non-feasible and non-starter.” He went on to add that the bullet train will need only 500 sq metres of land and the terminal would come three levels below the ground level. Besides, the place above has been earmarked for the International Financial Centre. Senior BJP leader Ashish Shelar said that the Shiv Sena was opposing every development project.  “They opposed the Mumbai metro rail project in Girgaon, then Samrudhi Super-Communication Highway, Coastal Road, Wadhawan port, Mumbai-Delhi corridor,” Shelar said. In an indirect reference to Thackeray and his son who is the state’s Environment Minister, Aaditya Thackeray, he said: “Mumbai’s development projects are being affected because of an ‘ahankari raja’ and ‘vilasi rajputra’,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bjp-mva-clash-over-metro-car-shed-escalates-to-fight-over-bullet-train-terminal-928851.html

It also wanted to know why the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has not called actor Kangana Ranaut so far even though she had confessed to consuming drugs. According to state Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, there seems to be a broad motive to defame Maharashtra. “Why the Anti-Narcotics Cell of Mumbai Police did not conduct the probe on the Karan Johar party when Fadnavis-government was in power. The video was viral in 2019 and Fadnavis ji was home minister. He must answer as NCB is proceeding with the investigation,” Sawant said. Sawant questioned why the NCB is still not calling Kangana Ranaut for investigation as she had confessed her drug addiction in a video. “The NCB is investigating issues which have no relationship to the Sushant Singh Rajput case. The NCB miserably failed in finding a drug angle in the SSR case,” he said. “Hence the real motive was to defame Maharashtra. The defamation of Mumbai police and Bollywood started after Yogi Adityanath decided to have a new FilmCity in Uttar Pradesh. CBI is still mum on SSR investigation. BJP used national investigation agencies and the death of SSR for their dirty politics,” said Sawant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/why-fadnavis-government-did-not-probe-karan-johar-congress-928872.html

Addressing a press conference here, Congress MP from South Goa Francisco Sardinha also said that just beef eaters in Goa should not be made to suffer just because a neighbouring state passed new legislation severely restricting cattle slaughter. "I request our chief minister to meet his counterpart, Chief Minister of Karnataka and impress upon him that Goa needs beef," Sardinha said. The former Chief Minister also said that the Congress in Goa was against the slaughter of cows, but added that beef as red meat is also sourced from cattle and buffaloes in general, which should be allowed to be slaughtered. "Beef is not just cow meat alone. Beef is (sourced from) female buffalo, male buffalo, bulls. This is needed for Goa, not only for tourism. Even if there is no tourism, our people consume beef. There are Christians and Muslims who consume beef," Sardinha said. Beef is a routinely consumed commodity in Goa and is served in restaurants in the coastal fringes of the state, which are frequented by nearly eight million tourists every year. More than 25 tons of beef is consumed in Goa every day, most of which has been imported from Karnataka's Belagavi district. The 'Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill (2020) which was passed by the Karnataka assembly amid controversy last week could shrink all export of beef to Goa. Sardinha also said that there was anxiety among the beef consuming population in Goa over fears of rising prices of beef, once the act was notified in Karnataka. "When you create scarcity, cost goes up, which never comes down. Let us be realistic and see that costs are maintained," the Congress MP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/meet-yediyurappa-resolve-beef-crisis-congress-to-goa-cm-928922.html
