Chandrashekhar (25), a resident of Kanaganakoppa, was working with Acharya High School, Manchenahalli. The victim wrote a death note on the board stating that the management was responsible for his death and he was not recruited as a government teacher. He was working at the school for the last two years as a guest teacher. As he was appointed for a period of two years, the management did not continue his service as the school was not reopened due to Covid-19 pandemic. He had taken the house of Anil Kumar on rent and was running tuition for living, said the police. On Friday he wrote the death note on the board which read:"My dear students, let your future be bright. I apologise to all those who love me. I served as a private school teacher, but the Acharya High School management did not appoint me. The management is responsible for my death."  According to the parents, he taught English at the school for the last eight years. The management had collected about Rs five lakh from him to appoint him as a permanent faculty.  The parents had sold their agricultural land to adjust money. The management awarded the position to another candidate at the last moment which hurt Chandrashekhar and he decided to end life, they charged. Local leaders staged a protest over the incident in front of the school. DySP P Ravishakar convinced the protesters to withdraw their protest. The management has assured to appoint Chandrashekhar's wife. A case has been registered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/private-school-teacher-blames-management-ends-life-923871.html

Kumaraswamy was addressing the party workers in a convention organised ahead of Gram Panchayat elections, here. He said, “The MLAs betrayed the party by joining the BJP and our own party people cheated in Hunsur byelection. Like Mandya and Hassan, JD(S) has a stronghold in Mysuru too. But, due to the differences among the leaders, the party suffered a setback. Without naming Chamundeshwari MLA G T Devegowda, who has maintained a distance from JD(S), Kumaraswamy said, "A few people have felt that JD(S) is nothing without them. But in reality, JD(S) existence is not because of the leaders but, owing to the workers and their efforts.” Kumaraswamy said that he is well aware of the efforts of the party workers of Chamundeshwari segment. The MLA was made as a district in-charge minister and he should have listened to the people’s grievances. Expressing hopes, Kumaraswamy said, "The party will come to power in 2023 and he called the party workers to take Gram Panchayat elections as a challenge." MLAs Ashvin Kumar, Mayor Tasneem, ZP president Parimala Shyam and others were present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/h-d-kumaraswamy-slams-mlas-who-joined-bjp-from-jds-923886.html

The members of various Kannada organisations staged a protest in Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan and Chamarajanagar districts and with no major impact on normal life, the bandh evoked a lukewarm response. Vehicular movement was largely normal across the region. The bandh was limited to protest and rally. The bus, autorickshaw, hotel and taxi services were not suspended at all the districts. The tourism stakeholders in the region did not participate in the bandh, but extended moral support. They functioned tying black band. In order to maintain law and order, the police had intensified the security at all the four districts and additional men were deputed at sensitive areas.   The protesters in Mysuru took out a rally from Agrahara to DC office. The agitators demanded the government to withdraw its decision of establishing MDC. Though the bandh received lukewarm response, the movement of the people and the vehicle was less in the city. The protesters also blocked roads, but the police managed to clear them. The police took a few them into custody and released them later. In Mandya, the members of various organisations gathered at Chamaraja Circle and raised slogan against the state government and staged a protest. The agitators also took out a protest rally and also blocked Mysuru-Bengaluru Highway. They submitted a memorandum to the district administration. In Hassan, the normal life was not affected and the shops, markets functioned as usual. While a few vendors extended support by closing the shops on their own, the protesters tried to shut the shops forcefully. The protestors, who gathered near Hemavathi statue, demanded apology from BJP MLA Basanagouda Yatnal for terming Kannada organisation leaders as ‘Roll Callers’. They burnt an effigy of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa after taking out a mock funeral procession in Holenarasipur. In Chamarajanagar, the agitators took out a protest march near Chamarajeshwara Temple and reached DC office via B Rachaiah Double Road. They raised slogans against the state government as well as Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. The normal life was not affected, but, the vehicle movement was less at Chamarajanagar and taluk headquarters.

Incidentally, Latha Mangipudi’s first election in 2013 was similar to the recently held US Presidential election. It had caught national attention in the US, due to a miscount of ballots and she won on a recount. It has to be noted that the US President elect Joe Biden also belongs to the Democratic Party. In 2013, Latha Mangipudi became the first Indian-American to be elected to the New Hampshire State House. She was re-elected in 2014, 2016, 2018 on November 3, 2020, and will serve a fifth term, representing Ward 8 in Nashua. Last year, she worked with Nashua Mayor Donchess on introducing sister city initiative between Mysuru-Nashua, to bring the two communities together. As a legislator, Latha has earlier organised and chaired several round table sessions to bring business leaders of the American and Indian communities together, to foster cooperative relationships in energy, tourism, education, banking and entertainment sectors. She is working with the members of the Diplomatic Core at the Indian Embassy in New York. Born as the youngest daughter of D K Ranganthan, who retired as a deputy controller in the railways and D R Indiramma, she studied at Bharathi Stree Samaja and Nirmala Convent schools. “I married Krishna Mangipudi in September 1986 and have daughter Sarayu Mangipudi and son Vikas Mangipudi. My mother, a homemaker, had not even gone to high school. My father had completed high school. But, they encouraged us to study and work hard to become independent and to serve the community. Both my parents were socially well-connected. Our teachers encouraged us to participate in plays and athletics. I played the role of Kittur Rani Chennamma and won several prizes,” she recalled. “I aspired to be a veterinarian. Despite having merit, I could not join BVSc, as preference was given to students from rural communities, especially farmers’ children. Even though we had cows at home, we were not farmers. Thus, I studied BSc and MSc in Speech and Hearing at All India Institute of Speech and Hearing in Mysuru,” she said. “My elder sister, a physician, was in the US. I migrated to the US to do a PhD, specialising in autism. I was keen on returning to Mysuru, to start a school. My husband, a friend then, was already in the US on a greencard. Thus, I stayed back and worked for Fernald State School and Farrell Hall. I did a clinical fellowship in Audiology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) and at Language and Cognitive Development Centre. After moving to New Hampshire in 1989, I started working with people with special needs, from early intervention to seniors, with memory challenges,” Latha said. “As both my children went through the Nashua public school system, I served as a Parent Teacher Organisation (PTO) president. We had 5-6 people when I was elected in 2000-2002. By the time my term ended, we had 35-40 people. This was the beginning of my community work,” she said. “In 2005, I joined Classic home care, a programme of Nashua Centre for the Multiply-Handicapped. In 2006, I chaired US-India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) at New Hampshire (USINPAC–NH). Thus, my political activism continued, especially in the nation primary process during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. I started hosting political events regularly at home. I ran for State Representative seat in 2013 in a special election, which caught national attention, due to a miscount of ballots. I became the first South Asian to be elected in New Hampshire and served two terms on criminal justice and public safety committee,” Latha said. She is on the board of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. Earlier, she served on the boards of Chinmaya Mission in Boston, Nashua Interfaith Council, and Greater Nashua Mental Health Association. She is also active with Akshaya Patra – the USA. Latha was twice recognised as one of the top 20 most influential women in New England -- in 2006 and 2014 -- in an event sponsored by The India New England Newspaper. In 2019, she co-founded Shanti Energy, LLC with Congressman Paul Hodes to advance adoption of net-zero development and renewable energy throughout New England.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mysurean-elected-as-legislator-in-the-us-for-fifth-time-in-a-row-923890.html

05-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Lost goodwill of people by joining hands with Congress: H D Kumaraswamy||Former chief minister and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy slammed Opposition Leader Siddaramaiah, saying that his goodwill was damaged as he joined hands with Congress due to emotional talks of the party supremo H D Deve Gowda. At a press conference here on Saturday, Kumaraswamy said, “I was emotionally trapped and it was a pre-plan by Siddaramaiah to taint my image. I had developed goodwill after becoming chief minister in 2006 and the people of the state blessed me for 12 years. But Siddaramaiah and his gang destroyed it,” he said. Kumaraswamy claimed, “I joined hands with Congress to form government in 2018 due to Deve Gowda’s emotions. He asked to go with an alliance with Congress as he is in favour of secular identity and thus, he suggested an alliance with Congress. But Congress damaged my image. I shed tears within one month after joining hands with Congress. I was not even betrayed by BJP during JD(S)-BJP alliance.” He said, “Siddaramaiah had dreamt of becoming chief minister for the second time and thus, accused me of disobeying the government. The JD(S)-Congress government earmarked Rs 19,000 crore for the constituencies, represented by Congress MLAs. Still, the Congress leaders accused us of non-cooperation.” “Siddaramaiah had thought that he would become chief minister as Yediyurappa go home within a month,” he charged. He said JD(S) weakened after joining hands with Congress. Before going for assembly election in 2018, Siddaramaiah managed to mislead a particular community by projecting JD(S) as ‘B’ team of BJP, he charged. Kumaraswamy said, “Congress party is heading for destruction and regional parties in the country are the alternative to BJP. I will attend a meeting convened by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who is uniting regional parties. Rao has spoken to me in this regard.”  ‘BJP will complete term’ According to Kumaraswamy, BJP will not give up power easily and the party will be in power until the last minute.  “Siddaramaiah has maintained secret contacts with a few leaders and thus, he is repeatedly talking about the change of leadership in BJP,” he said. Siddaramaiah responds Responding to Kumaraswamy's dig at the Congress, Siddaramaiah responded saying that the JD(S) leader was an expert in telling lies and giving statements for political needs. “Gowda family shedding tears is not new. Their tears, including Kumaraswamy’s, have no value.” "He never had goodwill. HD Kumaraswamy is known for his lies. He lies for political benefits. We had 80 seats & he had 37 but we made him CM for one year and three months. Now he should tell us who was benefitted. He was running govt from West End Hotel," Siddaramaiah retorted. Kumaraswamy is telling the truth: BSY Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa also added to this political crossfire, saying that JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy was now speaking the truth on who backstabbed him. Reacting to statements by Kumaraswamy, Yediyurappa told reporters in Belagavi that the truth has now come to the fore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/lost-goodwill-of-people-by-joining-hands-with-congress-h-d-kumaraswamy-923847.html
05-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Congress ups the ante against Terdal MLA Siddu Savadi for 'shoving' councillor||The Congress on Saturday decided to up the ante against the ruling BJP by demanding the arrest of Terdal MLA Siddu Savadi.  Congress workers and supporters, led by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D K Shivakumar staged a massive protest at Mahalingapur, where a woman councillor suffered miscarriage allegedly because she was pushed by Savadi and his supporters during local elections last month. Savadi, however, has refuted this.  "What happened in Terdal is murder and molestation," Shivakumar told reporters. "The woman herself has said miscarriage was because of this incident. What else is needed to take action against the MLA?" Shivakumar said, adding that Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, Women & Child Development Minister Shashikala Jolle, BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and the police were quiet.  "If this happened in the house or family of Yediyurappa, Shobha, Jolle or the DGP, what would they have done," he asked.  "If there's been a miscarriage, it's a national shame. Is there anything more shameful than this?" On November 9, Savadi allegedly shoved BJP councillors Chandni Nayak, Savitha Hurakadli and Godavari to keep them from voting during the Mahalingapur Town Municipal Council presidential and vice-presidential elections. Nayak, who was said to be carrying then, and other women had aligned with the Congress after they were denied tickets by the BJP to contest.  The Congress is expected to raise the issue during the winter session of the legislature that starts December 7. Siddu Savadi refutes charges  Meanwhile, refuting charges, Siddu Savadi said, "The Congress is trying to create an 'illusion of truth' by repeating a lie a thousand times." Speaking to reporters in Bagalkot, Savadi said, "On the day of elections to the top posts of Mahalingapur TMC, a heated exchange of words between members turned into pushing and shoving. It was a spur-of-the-moment incident and there's no need to blow it out of proportion."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-ups-the-ante-against-terdal-mla-siddu-savadi-for-shoving-councillor-923862.html
05-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||In Karnataka's quota war, tricky terrain ahead for BJP||At least four major caste groups in Karnataka are engaged in a quota war and the BJP seems caught thick in the middle of the action. It is anybody’s guess how this will pan out for the saffron party.  These demands are coming from communities that cannot be ignored and as part of the BJP’s larger Hindutva agenda, their appeasement is a high-stakes game.  However, given its expansionist agenda, the BJP has been looking to break the Congress’ hold on the Ahinda, a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits.  It appears to be headed that way in Karnataka: The Scheduled Castes have demanded an increase in their state quota from 15% to 17% and the Scheduled Tribes from 3% to 7%. The Kurubas have intensified their demand to be included under the ST list, whereas the government is keen to give Veerashaiva-Lingayats OBC status nationally, with the Panchamshalis, a sub-sect, wanting Category 2A status in the state.  A Cabinet sub-committee headed by Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu is looking into the SC/ST quota hike, which is seen as a way to buy more time. But, it is Sriramulu, a Valmiki, who spearheaded the ST quota hike demand. Likewise, the Kuruba agitation is led by the party’s own RDPR Minister K S Eshwarappa. There are influential seers, too, backing these demands. At present, Karnataka provides 32% reservation for OBCs, 15% for SCs and 3% for STs, totalling to 50% as capped by the Supreme Court.  If the BJP decides to go ahead with hiking the SC/ST quota, the 50% cap will be breached, a legal quagmire.  One way forward is to redraw the existing state quota, which will mean cutting more pieces from the same pie. This will have political ramifications.  For instance, placing the Kurubas in the ST list will pit them against the Valmikis.  And, if the numerically-strong Panchamasalis are moved from Category 3B to Category 2A, political equations will be altered. Under Category 3B, the Veerashaiva-Lingayats currently get 5% reservation. Under Category 2A, there are 102 castes and their sub-sects sharing 15% reservation and they are likely to go up in arms if the Panchamasalis are put in the same basket with them.  “Whatever we do, reservation should not exceed 50%,” Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes chairperson Jayaprakash Hegde points out.   Politically, the BJP can score brownie points with Eshwarappa emerging as the Kuruba leader, what with former Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah, seen as an Ahinda champion, keeping away from the movement. “The BJP doesn’t have to sway an entire community towards them. They just have to split votes,” a Congress leader says.  Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa himself is pushing for national OBC status for Veerashaiva-Lingayats, the community he belongs to. This will give them a share in 27% quota for central government jobs and educational institutions.  But, the frenzy around reservations is akin to running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, political analyst D Umapathy says. “Firstly, the RSS is against reservations. Where will these reservations be put to use anyway? With the government not recruiting and PSUs disinvested, where are the jobs,” he asks.  Former advocate-general Ravivarma Kumar says the only rational approach is to look at the yet-to-be-made-public socio-economic survey or the caste census. “The Supreme Court has already capped reservation at 50%. As chief minister, Veerappa Moily had increased reservation to 73%. This was stayed by the apex court and reduced to 50%, restoring the status quo. Finally, the court remanded the matter back to the government asking for empirical data to justify the 73% reservation. That’s why the survey becomes important,” Kumar explains.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/in-karnatakas-quota-war-tricky-terrain-ahead-for-bjp-923863.html

Observing that the convict had exploited the victim by taking undue advantage of her mental illness, the apex court dismissed his appeal against the September 2016 judgment of the Himachal Pradesh High Court which had convicted him in the case while setting aside the trial court order acquitting him. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan noted in its verdict that as per the DNA report, the convict was the biological father of the child delivered by the 19-year-old victim who was found to be 31-week pregnant when the matter came to light. “A person suffering from mental disorder or mental sickness deserves special care, love and affection. They are not to be exploited. In the present case, the accused has exploited the victim by taking disadvantage of her mental sickness/illness. Therefore, no interference of this court against the impugned judgment and order passed by the high court convicting the accused is called for,” said the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah. “On evidence, it has been established and proved that the victim was mentally retarded and her IQ was 62 and she was not in a position to understand the good and bad aspect of sexual assault,” the bench said in its 24-page judgement delivered on December 3. The top court said the high court was justified in re-­appreciating the entire evidence on record and reverse the order of acquittal passed by the trial court. The high court, while setting aside the trial court order acquitting the man, had convicted him for the offences of rape and criminal intimidation and sentenced him to seven years in jail. According to the police, the FIR was lodged by the victim’s father in 2008 alleging that his daughter was found to be pregnant and she told her mother that the accused had raped her when she had gone to graze cattle. The prosecution said that due to fear and mental weakness, the victim had not disclosed about the incident to anyone and when she was medically examined, she was found to be 31-week pregnant. She gave birth to a child in June 2008 in Shimla and after a DNA test it was found that the accused was the biological father of the infant, the police had said, adding that he was arrested in the case. During the trial, the accused had claimed innocence and denied the allegations. The trial court had acquitted him mainly on the ground of delay in lodging the FIR and also that the woman was not mentally unsound to understand the consequences.

05-12-2020||National||Adar Poonawalla named 'Asians of the Year' with 6 others||Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, is among six people named "Asians of the Year" by Singapore's leading daily, The Straits Times for their work in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has collaborated with the University of Oxford and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for making the Covid-19 vaccine, ''Covidshield'', and is conducting trials in India. The other five named in the list are Chinese researcher Zhang Yongzhen, who led the team that mapped and published online the first complete genome of Sars-CoV-2 - the virus that sparked the pandemic, China's Major-General Chen Wei, Japan's Dr Ryuichi Morishita and Singapore's Professor Ooi Eng Eong, who are among those at the forefront of developing vaccines against the virus, and South Korean businessman Seo Jung-jin whose company will enable the making and dispensing of the vaccines and other Covid-19 treatments to the world. Collectively referred to as "the virus busters", they are heroes of a kind, having devoted themselves to the pressing cause of resolving the coronavirus pandemic, each in their own capacity, the daily said. "Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has brought death and hardship to the world's largest and most populous continent, is meeting its tamer in The Virus Busters," the award citation said. "We salute your courage, care, commitment and creativity. In this peril-filled hour, you are a symbol of hope for Asia, indeed the world." The Serum Institute was founded by Poonawalla's father Cyrus Poonawalla in 1966. Poonawalla joined the Serum Institute of India in 2001 and became the CEO of Serum Institute with complete control of the day-to-day operations of the company in 2011. Poonawalla said that he has put $250 million of his family fortune into ramping up his institute’s manufacturing capacity. "I decided to go all out," said Poonawalla, 39, who has pledged that his firm's Covid-19 vaccines will help supply lower- and middle-income countries that face significant disadvantages in the quest to obtain them. Poonawalla said his institute is helping poorer countries level up in access to vaccines. In the big picture of ending the pandemic, commonality of purpose is key, said The Straits Times, Singapore’s mainstream daily. The Straits Times Asians of the Year have led the way, as have scores of other individuals in their own fields. When an end comes into sight, it will be due in no small part to these people who - undaunted by the tumult - have committed themselves to the sobering, much-needed work to put together an exit plan from the crisis, for humanity. "There has not been a day this year when the pandemic has not been in the news. Straits Times' editors felt there could be no more deserving recipients this year than the people squaring up to Asia's biggest-ever health challenge, engaged in pioneering and courageous efforts to prevent the highly contagious virus from wreaking more damage,” Bhagyashree Garekar, Straits Times' foreign editor, said on Saturday. "In a year that is ending with a wish for great resets... Asia's virus busters are the face of hope on the horizon," said Garekar. Between them, the recipients of the 2020 award capture the entire trajectory of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In deciding to honour The Virus Busters, Straits Times editors had in mind those who have, in one way or another, enabled the complex, multi-stage process of preventing as many people around the world from getting the deadly disease in as little time as possible. "Each year, ST editors seek out a person, team or organisation that has not only made or shaped the news, but also helped contribute positively to Asia in the process,” said Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/Malay/Tamil Media Group and editor of Straits Times. "This year, we naturally looked to those involved in the fight against Covid-19, which has dominated the headlines. We debated long and hard, but finally agreed on a group of people who have done the most to help find an answer to the crisis brought on by the virus. "They are a disparate group whose collective efforts have pushed forward the search for vaccines, allowing these to be discovered and delivered with an urgency never attempted or seen before. Their commitment and actions have helped save lives and give hope to people all around Asia, and the world," Fernandez said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/adar-poonawalla-named-asians-of-the-year-with-6-others-923660.html

"It (Canada) also opposes import restrictions to protect India's farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India's agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers," BJP's foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale tweeted. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently backed the agitating farmers in India, saying his country will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests. He had expressed concern over the situation. Reacting strongly, India on Friday summoned Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel and told him that the comments made by Trudeau and others in his cabinet on the protests were an "unacceptable interference" in the country's internal affairs and these actions, if continued, will have a "seriously damaging" impact on bilateral ties. In a series of tweets tagging Trudeau and Patel, Chauthaiwale said, "Canada's criticism of India on farmer's issues is nothing but hypocrisy. Canada is strident critic of MSP and other agriculture policies at the WTO, and often questions India's domestic agriculture measures including food and livelihood security." Noting that Canada is a member of the Cairns Group of agri exporters, he said the body's objective in WTO negotiations is to seek increased market access in countries like India. It also seeks reduction in the agri subsidies provided to domestic producers, even if such subsidies are subsistence-level, he said. "It also opposes import restrictions to protect India's farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India's agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers," the BJP leader said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given topmost priority to enhance farmers' income by increasing minimum support price, giving better access to technology and providing adequate insurance cover for agri products against natural calamities, he said, adding that "Unfortunately, Canada has refused to acknowledge it".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/canada-opposes-msp-has-scarce-interest-in-well-being-of-indian-farmers-bjp-923671.html

The protesting farmers, who have already blocked many key routes leading to Delhi from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, on Friday threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads if the government did not accept their demand. They have also called for a 'Bharat bandh' on December 8. Before the meeting with the government in the afternoon, leaders of around 40 farmer unions will discuss their strategy to press their demands. They have also given a call to protest against the central government and corporate houses, and burn their effigies on Saturday. The fourth-round talks between the government and agitating farmer unions on Thursday failed to end the standoff over the new farm laws. The blockade at the borders of Delhi, including at Tikri, Singhu, Jharoda, Ghazipur and Chilla, has thrown traffic out of gear. The diversion of traffic from these border points has led to long jams on alternative routes in the national capital. Police have kept the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu, Tikri, Jharoda, Jhatikara, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao, Maniyari and Mangesh closed as the farmers' agitation enter its tenth day. However, if anyone needs to commute towards Harayana, they can go via Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri National Highway-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, police said. The Badusarai border remained open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two wheelers, they said. The Chilla border on the Noida link road also remained closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. Similarly, police have kept the Ghazipur border on National Highway-24 shut for traffic coming from Ghaziabad to Delhi. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-stir-protesters-continue-to-camp-at-delhi-borders-fifth-round-of-talks-today-923691.html

While junking a plea, Principal bench of NGT headed by its Chairperson Justice A K Goel said there is no tangible material to support that there has been violation of law. "It is submitted that there was a prospectus dated May 12, 2020, on the website of the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, KBA, indicting the company which by itself was enough for taking action. We do not find any ground to revisit the order," the bench said. Hearing a plea filed by Tanuj Mittal alleging falsification of emission readings by Mercedes Benz, the Tribunal said the review application is an attempt for re-hearing, which is not permissible. The NGT on October 19 had refused to entertain the plea alleging falsification of emission readings by the company. "We find that neither the applicant claims to be a victim nor there is any material showing the loss suffered by the applicant. Nor he has shown his representative capacity to safeguard the rights of people who may not be able to directly take the remedy.

In an application, he pointed out the Odisha government has already fixed the price of this test to Rs 400, after adding 100% profit, since the actual cost incurred by the private labs and hospitals was not more than Rs 200, which has vindicated his stand. He said, "the people of the country are shocked and feeling befooled and cheated not only by these private labs and hospitals but by the political executives and officials of this country." They were either totally insensitive towards the 135 crores population by not inquiring or investigating why this test is so expensively charged and how much were the actual expenses incurred on this test or they have done it deliberately in connivance with the private labs and hospitals, he claimed. Agrawal said the cost of the kit and other things used in the RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test, for Covid-19, has gone down in the month of April-May itself. He asked the court to order for fixing a uniform maximum rate of Rs 400 for the RT-PCR test across the country on the principle of parity and one nation-one rate policy. The court has already on November 24 admitted his PIL for consideration and sought a response from the Union government. By his application, he said responsibility should be fixed of the concerned officials or persons in all the States, Delhi government and Union Territories for "remaining insensitive deliberately or negligently to the cause of 135 crores people".   He claimed after the top court sought the Union government's reply to his petition, several states Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bihar brought down the test price to Rs 800, Uttar Pradesh to Rs 700 and Odisha to Rs 400. Earlier, States fixed the price in range of Rs 3,200 to Rs 900.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-made-in-sc-to-refund-excess-money-charged-for-rt-pcr-test-923737.html

On Saturday, the Union health ministry said, "The antibodies against the infection build up in a human being only after a specific number of days pass after the second dose of the vaccine is taken. This is a two-dose vaccine. The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine."

The 67-year-old minister was given the first shot on November 20. Stressing that experts would know better about how the Covid-19 vaccine works, Vij told PTI over phone: "I was told that antibodies start to develop after the second dose, which is administered after 28 days of getting the first shot. And full antibodies are developed 14 days after the second dose is given. So, the complete cycle takes 42 days. In between there is no protection." Asked about his condition, Vij said he has sore throat, fever and body ache. "But overall I am okay," he said.

The case was scheduled for the cross examination of the complainant, Swamy, as a part of pre-charge evidence. “This case is a quintessential case of documentary evidence. Due to the fact that there are many documents that have been annexed to the Chief Examination of the Complainant, which are public documents, which have been marked; these are certified copies of these public documents," the application said. "Due to the fact that these are marked documents, these documents need to be proved through the testimony of the appropriate witnesses. It is reiterated that as the complainant's case is a quintessential case of the evidence being documentary evidence, therefore these documents need to be proved through their witnesses,” it said. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravinder Kumar Pandey on Saturday adjourned the matter for December 23 as the lawyers from the accused side did not appear physically and sought an adjournment. Earlier, the court had asked both the parties to explore the solution for proceeding with the matter in view of the Covid-19 situation.

In his introductory remarks at the fifth round of meeting with 40 farmers' groups, he also welcomed feedback on the new farm laws, they said. The talks between the government and the protesting unions began at the Vigyan Bhawan here around 2:30 pm. Three central ministers, including Tomar, are currently holding talks with representatives of the unions. Railway, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are also present in the meeting. In his opening remarks, Tomar, who is leading the talks for the Centre, said the government is committed to "cordial" talks with farmers' leaders and does not intend to hurt farmers' sentiments, sources said. The agriculture minister welcomed feedback on the three farm laws, they said and added that the agriculture secretary, Sanjay Agarwal, summarised the proceedings of the previous rounds of talks with farmer unions. Both the sides are currently discussing contentious issues like provision of dispute resolution and registration of traders in proposed private mandis under the new laws, the sources said. On Thursday, talks between the Union ministers and a representative group of thousands of agitating farmers failed to yield any resolution, as the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of new farm laws. Farmers on Friday announced a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads leading to the national capital if the government does not accept their demands.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/agri-minister-tomar-tells-farmer-unions-that-centre-committed-to-talks-at-fifth-round-of-meeting-923751.html

Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj said inspector Rakesh Yadav was suspended on Friday following the allegations of rape against him. Police officials said Yadav was investigating a dowry harassment case filed by a family member of the woman SPO against her in-laws. The case was filed at Sasni Gate police station here in 2018. On October 29, inspector Yadav asked the woman special police officer to produce certain documents pertaining to the case. But he told her that he would be meeting her at a hotel, making some excuse that he will not be available at the police station to receive the documents, they said. When the woman SPO arrived at the hotel room, the police inspector allegedly raped her and also warned her of dire consequences if she reported the matter to someone else, the officials said. For several days, the victim kept quiet as she was terrified. However, when the inspector started making lewd calls on her mobile, she finally approached the SSP along with taped clips of the threats made on phone, they said. SSP Muniraj told reporters that a case was registered at the Kuwarsi police station on Friday and police have launched a manhunt to nab the inspector who is absconding.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/up-police-inspector-suspended-after-woman-spo-alleges-rape-923753.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian rejected the petition filed by Kumaraswamy against the Karnataka High Court's judgement of September 11, 2020, declining him the relief. Senior advocate Shashikiran Shetty, appearing for the petitioner, questioned validity of the High Court' order. Among other grounds, he claimed out of 18 accused, 17 had already been released on bail and the trial in the matter had not made any substantial progress. The High Court had declined to grant him bail, after noting some of the co-accused who were released, had either remained absent or absconded in trial court proceedings. It had also noted the accused-petitioner was a kingpin, who entered the strong room of sub-treasury at Hanagal to take photographs of question papers, so he could not be granted any parity with other accused. A case was lodged on March 21, 2016 invoking provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Karnataka Education Act and stringent, Karnataka Control of Organised Crime Act on a complaint on leakage of Chemistry paper. The petitioner was arrested on April 17, 2016 for alleged circulation of the leaked question paper for money.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-rejects-puc-paper-leakage-case-kingpins-bail-plea-923771.html
05-12-2020||National||Tejashwi Yadav leads opposition parties' dharma in support of agitating farmers||The opposition parties on Saturday held demonstration here under the leadership of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav in protest against new farm laws and pledged support to the farmers agitating for repeal of the legislations. Joined by leaders of Congress and the Left Parties at the dharna site, the RJD leader extended support to the nationwide strike called by the farmers organisations against the agricultural legislations on December 8. Barring CPI-ML other constituents of the Grand Alliance were present at the sit-in. The Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninsts) (Liberation) did not participate in the dharna organised by the RJD as the party had organised "road blockade" across Bihar during the day to protest against the farm laws, its state Secretary Kunal told PTI. Besides, the party did not receive any information with regard to the RJDs dharna, Kunal added. Tejashwi and others were denied permission by the district administration to hold dharna in front of the statue of father of the nation inside the Gandhi Maidan following which they held the protest outside gate number four of the sprawling ground in the heart of the capital town. Later, the administration allowed a handful of the leaders including Tejashwi Yadav, RJD Bihar unit chief Jagadanand Singh, former minister Shyam Rajak, Congress leaders Madan Mohan Jha and Ajeet Sharma and those from the Left Parties to go inside the ground to garland the statue of Mahatama Gandhi where they expressed resolve to continue their support to the agitating farmers. RJD had on Friday announced that the dharna will be held in front of the statue of the Mahatma Gandhi, whose vision is under attack from the proposed legislations which intend to give a leeway to big private players in agriculture sector. A senior Patna District administration official, wishing anonymity, told PTI that "dharna inside Gandhi Maidan is not allowed as it is a 'prohibited area'. If anyone has to stage a sit-in, they can do so at Gardanibagh which has been declared as designated place to hold dharna." Besides, the administration has to ensure that Covid-19 rules are adhered to, he said adding that gathering or any sort of procession, dharna are not allowed at a public place in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Yadav, who is the younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad took a swipe at the NDA government in the state for not allowing them to hold protest inside the Gandhi maidan. "The day when a top leader of the believers of killer of the father of the nation is in the town, the BJP government in the state has locked Mahatama Gandhi inside the maidan," the RJD leader said taking a veiled dig at Mohan Bhagwat who is in the town to hold meeting with the RSS functionaries. "I am standing with the Annadata (providers of food) in their fight against the Dhandata (people who owns wealth). Is it a crime to raise voice in support of farmers demanding provision for Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the newly enacted laws. If it is a crime, then we will commit such crimes everytime," Tejashwi said in a tweet. The central government has taken a decision (bringing farm laws) after giving due consideration in order to privatise everything, Tejashwi said adding "We have been saying it for quite a long time that they (BJP) will sell everything if they come to power. It is becoming a reality now. "What is the problem in giving assurance for MSP to farmers for their produce. If it (MSP) is not ensured then, farmers will be ruined." The ruling JD(U) attacked Yadav for himself sitting on a raised platform during demonstration while others, including Jgadanand Singh, sat on the ground. "Will @yadavtejashwi tell the people as why he is trying to show him (Jagadanand Singh) his status by making him sit at his feet. Jagada babu is a symbol while your intention is to trample the social grouping. "The prince of jungle raj should reply whether your motive has been fulfilled," JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said in a tweet. One brother (Tej Pratap Yadav) refered to the late RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh as "a lota (pot) of water that makes no difference to an ocean" while another made senior party leader Jagadanand Singh sit at his feet during the dharna, said Neeraj. Jagadanand Singh is a close associate of Lalu Prasad. The JD(U) leader was referring to Tejashwis statement during assembly polls when he said the poor used to walk before "Babu Saheb", a term used to refer to upper caste Rajputs in Bihar, with their head held high when Lalu Prasad was in power. The casteist remarks had triggered controvery following which the RJD leader had come with his defence that he was actually refering to "Sarkari Babus" (government officials) who have been denying justice to the weaker sections under patronage of Nitish Kumar government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tejashwi-yadav-leads-opposition-parties-dharma-in-support-of-agitating-farmers-923783.html
05-12-2020||National||Union leaders threaten to walk out of Centre-farmers' meeting over demand to repeal farm laws||Seeking to break the deadlock over protests against new farm laws, the Central government on Saturday told representatives of agitating farmers that their concerns are being looked into but the union leaders stuck to their demand for repeal of the legislations and threatened to walk out of the talks. The government side, however, managed to convince the farmer leaders to continue the talks, which began at 2.30 PM earlier in the day. This is the fifth round of talks between the government and representatives of farmers, thousands of whom are protesting at various borders of the national capital against what they claim are the laws meant to end the mandi system and minimum support price procurement system for the benefits of corporates. As the meeting resumed after a tea break in the evening, during which the farmer leaders had their own food and tea, they threatened to walk out if the government was not willing to scrap the the three laws enacted in September. While the government managed to convince them to continue with the talks, sources said some kind of division emerged among the participating farmer leaders on various issues proposed by the ministers. Another source said the government also offered to take back cases filed against farmers for stubble burning, as also the cases filed against some farmer activists. Later in the evening, the ministers began talking to smaller groups of 3-4 farmer leaders, out of the total 40 representatives present there. At the beginning of the meeting at Vigyan Bhawan, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told the group of farmer unions that the government is committed to cordial talks and welcomed all positive feedback on the new farm laws, sources said. Later, Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, an MP from Punjab, addressed the leaders in Punjabi and said the government understands the sentiments of Punjab. "We are ready to address all your concerns with an open mind," a source quoted Parkash as telling the union leaders. The government side also included Railway, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal, besides senior officials. In his opening remarks, Tomar, who is leading the talks for the Centre, said the government is committed to "peaceful talks with farmers' leaders and does not intend to hurt farmers' sentiments". The agriculture minister welcomed feedback on the three farm laws, while agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal summarised the proceedings of the previous four rounds of talks with farmer unions during the meeting, sources said. The two sides are believed to have discussed contentious issues like provision of dispute resolution and registration of traders in proposed private mandis under the new laws. Ahead of the meeting, Tomar and Goyal, along with senior union ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliberate over proposals likely to be made to the agitating groups. Modi's decision to hold deliberations with Union ministers, who have so far been the face of the Centre’s efforts to end the farmers’ agitation, signifies the importance the prime minister has attached to defuse the crisis, sources said. On Thursday, talks between the Union ministers and representatives of agitating farmers had failed to yield any resolution, as the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of new farm laws despite the government offering to "discuss and consider with an open mind" some key points of concern raised by farmers in the three new laws. Farmers on Friday announced a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads leading to the national capital if the government does not accept their demands. The three farm laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained the MSP and mandi systems would continue and would be rather further improved and strengthened. Undeterred by the winter chill, thousands of farmers have stayed put at various border points of Delhi since November 26 as part of their protest against the Centre's farm laws. Before the start of the meeting, an All India Kisan Sabha functionary said only repealing of the new farm laws will end the stalemate. "At this juncture, we have transport unions, retail businesses and other associated groups who have shown solidarity with us. Our movement is not just about farmers," AIKS finance secretary Krishna Prasad said. Outside the meeting venue, employees of the Indian Tourist Transporters Association (ITTA), which has supplied vehicles for the transit movement of the protesting farmers, were seen holding a banner which read 'We support farmers' and shouting slogans backing the peasants' agitation. "I belong to a farmer's family. I can relate to their fears. We had farmland at Mahipalpur and now you see T-3 terminal out there. We are supporting the protesting farmers in their cause," IITA president Satish Sehrawat told PTI. He said the association is providing transportation facility to the farmers since their first meeting. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) state general secretary Onkar Singh Agaul said: "Our demand remains the same that the government should withdraw all three farm laws. We want MSP should be guaranteed through law". He also sought scrapping of electricity amendment law and an ordinance on stubble burning. BJP leader from Punjab Surjit Kumar Jayani, while entering Vigyan Bhawan along with his party colleague Harjeet Singh Grewal, hoped the issue will be resolved soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/union-leaders-threaten-to-walk-out-of-centre-farmers-meeting-over-demand-to-repeal-farm-laws-923799.html

Here is the top news of December 5, 2020:   Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday told farmer unions protesting against the new agri laws that the government is committed to cordial talks, according to sources. In his introductory remarks at the fifth round of meeting with 40 farmers' groups, he also welcomed feedback on the new farm laws, they said. Farmers on Friday announced a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads leading to the national capital if the government does not accept their demands.   Covaxin is a two-dose coronavirus vaccine and Haryana Health minister Anil Vij, who had volunteered for its phase-three trial, was given only the first dose, the Union Health Ministry clarified on Saturday hours after the minister announced that he has tested positive for Covid-19. Vij had offered to be the first volunteer in the phase three trials for Covaxin, an indigenous potential vaccine against Covid-19 being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). On Saturday, the Union health ministry said, "The antibodies against the infection build up in a human being only after a specific number of days pass after the second dose of the vaccine is taken. This is a two-dose vaccine. The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine."   The Congress said on Saturday it's too early to make an assessment on the likely impact of Rajinikanth's party in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, citing lack of clarity on ideology, programme and electoral roadmap of the proposed outfit. The party's in-charge of Tamil Nadu affairs, Dinesh Gundu Rao also claimed that "many of the BJP people" are associated with the Tamil superstar now. He said Rajinikanth's party is not yet registered, his proposed outfit's ideology and programme are not known and there is no clarity on whether it will fight next year's Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu independently or strike an electoral alliance.   An Assam district unit of right-wing Bajrang Dal in south Assam's Cachar issued a 'warning' to Hindus against attending Christmas celebrations in churches and those not adhering to its diktat would be beaten up by its members. Mithu Nath, the general secretary of Cachar district Bajrang Dal said they were compelled to issue the warning in view of recent reports that a local student union in the Christian majority Meghalaya 'shut down' some temples. "They are shutting down our temples. But our Hindus would still go to the churches and have fun on Christmas Day. This will not be allowed this time. We will beat up those still visiting the churches. Our members will ensure this," he said at a function at Silchar, the headquarters of Cachar district.   Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the comprehensive law to prevent 'Love Jihad' to be brought by the state will stand the court's scrutiny. Speaking to reporters in Belagavi on Saturday on the sidelines of BJP state executive meeting, Bommai said, we are aware of the different reasons wherein women are converted in the guise of love. Some of such marriages were with the consent of parents too. "The state will study the ordinance made by Uttar Pradesh and laws by Madhya Pradesh and Haryana. We shall formulate comprehensive law that will stand in the court," he added.   Source: DHNS / PTI||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-anil-vij-tests-positive-for-covid-19-ministry-of-health-clarifies-923821.html

The fifth round of talks began at 2.30 PM and was attended by 40 representatives of various farmer organisations. Union leaders said they had their own food and tea during a break, rather than having what was arranged by the government at Vigyan Bhawan, the meeting venue. During their last meeting on Thursday also, the farmer leaders had their own lunch, tea and even water. Farmers' leaders had earlier on Thursday told the government to focus on resolving the issues instead of trying to be a good host by offering lunch.  Thousands of farmers have been camping at various borders of the national capital as part of their protest against the laws. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of the farmer groups at the Vigyan Bhawan. Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-bring-their-own-food-tea-at-fifth-meeting-with-centre-again-923824.html

The fifth round of talks between the farmers’ organisations and the Modi government ended in a deadlock with the farmers' groups observing a "maun vrat” (vow of silence) during the six-hour-long deliberation, as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar ruled out rollback of the farm laws. During the talks, the farmer leaders insisted on repealing of the three farm laws and offered to amend some sections of the legislation to address the concerns of the agitating farmers. Both the sides agreed to meet again on December 9, when the government is expected to present a concrete proposal to end the deadlock. “We have told farmers that the government will consider their aspects. It would have been easier for us to find a solution if we get suggestions from farmers’ leaders,” Tomar told reporters after the meeting. Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that the government will prepare a draft of the changes they propose to make to the farm laws after consulting the states. “Discussions were held on MSP too but we said that we should also take up laws and talk about their rollback,” Tikait said. The six-hour talks witnessed some dramatic moments as farmer leaders’ were exasperated over the government’s approach and took to displaying placards to respond to the ministers’ queries. The ministers also requested the protestors to send the elderly and the children home from the protest sites due to cold weather and the Covid-19 pandemic. According to reports, six protestors have already died in the past ten days while one of the interlocutors Balbir Singh Rajewal also underwent a medical check-up after he complained of dizziness. The protesting farmers received support from trade union leaders and artists with popular Punjabi actor Diljit Singh Dosanjh addressing the protestor at the Singhu border in north Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-leaders-go-on-maun-vrat-in-meeting-centre-proposes-another-meeting-on-dec-9-923834.html

The police on Friday filed the charge sheet before a court in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district, where the case for alleged abetment of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother has been registered. "Despite the prima facie observations by Hon Supreme Court on applicability of abetment of suicide in Arnab Goswami case and subsequent application by him before Hon HC for stay on probe, why has MVA Government hurriedly filed the chargesheet? "Isn't this a mockery of Supreme Court's judgement? Are they again trying to suppress personal liberty?" the Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Assembly questioned in his tweets. Besides Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, the other two accused named in the charge sheet are Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda. Police had earlier said that in his suicide note, Naik, who owned Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd, had claimed that he was ending his life due to non-payment of dues by Goswami, Firoze Sheikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks. "It seems that MVA Government has not learnt any lesson from the two strongly worded judgements delivered on the very same day this govt completed 1 year," Fadnavis tweeted. The Supreme Court had last month questioned the Maharashtra government over the abetment to suicide case against Goswami and said it would be a travesty of justice if personal liberty of a person is curtailed like this.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-maharashtra-rushed-to-file-charge-sheet-against-arnab-fadnavis-923848.html
05-12-2020||National||Covaxin trials: The curious case of Anil Vij and his knowledge of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine shot||Questions on the efficacy of India’s first home-made Covid-19 vaccine rose on social media on Saturday following a Covid-positive disclosure from senior Haryana minister Anil Vij, who claimed to have taken that vaccine. But the bigger question is: How did the minister know that he was administered the vaccine in the first place?   Going by his own admission, the 67-year-old minister received the vaccine at a hospital at Ambala cantonment on November 20 after he became the first volunteer for the vaccine’s phase-3 clinical trial in Haryana. This, according to the experts, is impossible as the standard protocol for double-blind randomised control trials are being followed under which neither the trial volunteer nor the shot-giver would know who is getting what. So, a volunteer would not know whether he/she is receiving a vaccine or a placebo. In clinical trials, double-blind randomised trials are the gold standard to get the most accurate and unbiased results. In a statement, Bharat Biotech said, “The vaccine (named Covaxin) is a fully indigenous one with the largest phase-3 clinical trial being conducted in India on around 26,000 subjects at 25 sites. The phase-3 trials are double-blinded and randomised, where 50 per cent of subjects will receive vaccines and the remaining 50 per cent of subjects will receive a placebo.” The clinical trials are based on a two-dose schedule, given 28 days apart, and the vaccine efficacy will be determined 14 days post the second dose. Responding to the social media comments on the vaccine’s efficacy, a spokesperson from the Union Health Ministry said, “The antibodies against the infection build up in a human being only after a specific number of days post the second dose of the vaccine as this is a two-dose vaccine. The minister in question (Vij) has taken only one dose of the vaccine.” But the statement begets the same question: How did the Health Ministry know whether the minister received a vaccine and not a placebo? The spokesperson did not clarify despite repeated requests. Reached out for comments, a senior researcher associated with the vaccine’s clinical trial in Haryana said, “Ask the minister, how he knows he got the vaccine and not a placebo?" The phase-3 trial of Covaxin is the only efficacy trial being conducted in India for Covid-19 vaccines, to determine its suitability to the diverse Indian population. The vaccine had cleared the first two phases of the trial successfully.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covaxin-trials-the-curious-case-of-anil-vij-and-his-knowledge-of-receiving-a-covid-19-vaccine-shot-923860.html
05-12-2020||National||Centre hardens stand to counter growing criticism from foreign nations on protest by farmers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has hardened stance to counter growing criticism from foreign nations on police action on agitating farmers. A total of 36 parliamentarians from the United Kingdom echoed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other ministers and lawmakers of the nation to express solidarity with the protesters. A spokesperson of the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that Government of India should allow farmers to protest as it was their right. Even so, New Delhi stuck to its position that the comments by foreign leaders on the protests by the farmers amounted to 'unacceptable interference' in the 'internal affairs' of India. A source in the national capital said that the government would never hold any discussion with any foreign nation on internal affairs of India. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar may not take part in a virtual meeting on Covid-19 response to be chaired by Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne next week. Although, Jaishankar had taken part in the last meeting convened by Champagne on November 3, which was also attended by Foreign Ministers of Italy, Brazil, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Singapore. However, he is likely to stay away from the next consultation, ostensibly as a mark of protest against 'unwarranted' remarks by Trudeau and his ministers. New Delhi is also planning to send across a stern message to the United Kingdom, as British parliamentarians asked their Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to take up with the Modi government the issue, in a letter. The UK MPs, who signed the letter, are mostly from the Labour Party, but included some from the Conservative Party and the Scottish National Party. The move was coordinated by Tanmanjit Singh Dhesi, a Sikh representing Slough in Berkshire at the UK House of Commons. They wrote that the new laws introduced by the Centre had triggered widespread protests across India as the new legislations failed to ensure protection of the farmers from exploitation and fair prices for their produce. "This is an issue of particular concern to Sikhs in the UK and those linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts on other Indian states. Many Sikhs and Punjabis have taken this matter up with their MPs as they are directly affected with family members and ancestral land in Punjab,” Dhesi and other British MPs wrote to Raab. “Being famous as ‘India’s Bread Basket’, many Punjabis rely on farming for their existence. Therefore these new laws present the Punjabis with a huge problem with some describing it as a ‘Death Warrant’”. They requested the British Foreign Secretary for a meeting and urged him to inform them about any discussion the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office might have had taken up with New Delhi, including during the recent visit of Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla to London. Dhesi and Preet Kaur Gill, another Sikh member of the UK House of Commons, earlier took to Twitter, criticizing police actions on the agitating farmers. The majority of the farmers protesting against the new agricultural laws enacted by the Modi Government are Sikhs from Punjab and Haryana. Canada’s High Commissioner to India, Nadir Patel, was on Friday summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs, where senior officials warned him about the serious damage the bilateral relations could suffer if the Prime Minister and other leaders of the North American nation continued to make comments on agitation by the farmers in India. Trudeau, however, ignored the sharp reaction from New Delhi and reiterated that Canada would always stand up for rights of protest. Some organizations based in the UK have planned to hold a rally in London to express solidarity with the farmers protesting in India. The Metropolitan Police of London, however, advised them to explore other options to express solidarity by other means in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, like doing it on an online forum or submitting a petition. The police also asked the organizers to strictly adhere to the restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-hardens-stand-to-counter-growing-criticism-from-foreign-nations-on-protest-by-farmers-923868.html

Repeated and "unjust" increase in prices as also the central excise duty on petrol and diesel has inflicted insurmountable pain and suffering on the people of India, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. "The Congress demands complete rollback of the excise duty hike effected by the Modi government on petrol and diesel during the corona period. "The Congress urges upon the government to immediately roll back the petrol-diesel prices and excise duty hike post March 5, 2020 and pass on this benefit to the people of India in these difficult times," Surjewala said in a statement. He also demanded that the benefit of reduced international crude oil prices be passed on to people and the rates of petrol, diesel and LPG gas reduced accordingly. The Congress leader also reiterated the party's demand for bringing petrol and diesel under the purview of the GST. Surjewala said the entire nation is fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and people were expecting some kind of relief and economic assistance in these challenging times. The BJP government is "fleecing" people by not just raising fuel rates on daily basis but also refusing to share benefits of lower crude prices with the people, he claimed. "The cruel government is raising petrol and diesel rates on a daily basis, while charging very high excise duty on petrol and diesel. The government has increased petrol and diesel prices by 14 and 13 times respectively in the last 16 days since November 19, 2020," he said. The Congress general secretary said the consistent rise in prices of petrol and diesel by the Modi government is adding to people's woes. He said when the BJP assumed power in May 2014, excise duty on petrol was Rs 9.20 per litre and on diesel, it was Rs 3.46 per litre, but in the last six years, the BJP government at the Centre has increased the excise duty on petrol by an additional Rs 23.78 per litre and on diesel, by an additional Rs 28.37 per litre. This is a "shocking 820 per cent hike" in excise duty on diesel and "258 per cent increase" in excise duty on petrol, Surjewala said. "The Modi government has earned Rs 19,00,000 crore in the last 6.5 years by increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel alone. Since the lockdown eight months ago, the extent of extortion and profiteering by repeated increases in prices and excise duty on petrol and diesel has surpassed all forms of exploitation," he claimed. The price of petrol on Saturday breached the Rs 83 per litre-mark in Delhi for the first time in more than two years after a rally in international oil prices forced a 13th increase in rates in the last fortnight. Petrol price on Saturday was raised by 27 paise per litre and diesel by 25 paise, according to a price notification of oil marketing companies. Petrol price in Delhi rose to Rs 83.13 per litre from Rs 82.86. Diesel rates went up from Rs 73.07 to Rs 73.32 per litre. This is the highest rate for petrol and diesel since September 2018 and followed the 13th increase in rates since November 20, when oil companies resumed daily price revision after nearly a two-month hiatus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-demands-immediate-rollback-of-petrol-diesel-price-hikes-923893.html

The National Conference hit back at the BJP leaders and said “since they cannot talk about what they have done in the last six year, they are harping on the issues which do not pertain to the development of panchayats”. Addressing a series of election rallies in Samba and Jammu districts, Union minister for textiles and women and child development Irani said the “Gupkar gang” has come together to “deceive” the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “In this election time, Gupkar gang is just deceiving the people. They never came together to benefit the public but only came together for their own power hunger. They never came together to provide food, toilet and other basic facilities to the needy…,” she said. The PAGD was formed by seven mainstream parties including the National Conference and the PDP to press for the restoration of the pre-August 5, 2019, position to J-K. The alliance is headed by National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and PDP's chief Mehbooba Mufti is its vice chairperson. The BJP has been targeting it by calling it “Gupkar gang”. Seeking votes for the party candidates, Irani said it was the BJP which is facilitating the maiden DDC elections in J-K as its goal is the welfare of the commoners. Addressing separate election rallies in different parts of Reasi district, Thakur, who is BJP’s in-charge of DDC elections in J-K and camping here, said “the Gupkar gang is facing an existential crisis”. “The Gupkar gang is disconnected from ground realities and should look beyond their palatial estates to see the winds of change in J-K. Their attempts to bully, attack and disrupt the democratic process have met with stiff opposition from the common people of J-K, who want to oust the Gupkar gang once and for all,” he said. The Union minister of state for finance expressed satisfaction over the turnout in the first three phases of the DDC elections and said “previously we have seen how they (PAGD) discouraged citizens from participating in the electoral process. “They created an atmosphere of fear. The voting percentage was barely 3-5 percent and today the Kashmir region gets 35-40 percent voter turnout. This is because people are fed up and reposing their faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's politics of hope and development for J&K,” he said. "Their politics of hate and harbouring separatists is over, the frustration of the Gupkar gang is at their peak,” he said. He said the BJP believes in the politics of development for all, decisive action and democracy. “We will bring employment and entrepreneurship to the youth, we will bring investment and innovation for businesses and we will propel local produce of farmers and artisans to the global level so that the region reaps economic benefits,” Thakur said. Hitting back at the BJP over its tirade against the PAGD leaders, National Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana said, “Their performance card is blank and they cannot talk about what they have done in the last six years, so they are harping on the issues which do not pertain to the development of the panchayats.” “Let them come out with a white paper on development undertaken and jobs provided to the educated unemployed youth in the past six years,” Rana said, adding the BJP cannot get away from answering to the people, as they feel let down, degraded, humiliated and left in lurch during the past six years. “The promises made were never kept and, in fact, the normal course of development was also put in the rear gear, as the self-centered agenda remained the top priority,” he said. "The insult to the injury is that the BJP is again hoodwinking the people by emotive slogans, forgetting its role on the administrative and developmental front. This is brazen and speaks of the hypocrisy that is core of the BJP,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-attacks-pagd-ahead-of-4th-phase-of-ddc-elections-nc-hits-back-923895.html

The government has offered eight amendments to the three reforms and a written assurance on the continuation of the minimum support price regime as a way to end their nine-day agitation at the borders of Delhi. "I am hopeful that the farmers will think positively and end their agitation," Tomar said before going to the PM and other ministers.

This is an indication that time for dynasty politics is over now in J&K,” Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Tarun Chug, told reporters, here. Referring to Abdullahs of the NC and Muftis of the PDP, he said dynasty leaders, “who till yesterday, fought against each other and were arch-rivals, are today against the BJP.” “This is because they feel unnerved by BJP's growing popularity. BJP is growing in J&K like a storm and reaching every village and district,” Chug said. The BJP leader also lashed out at NC president Farooq Abdullah and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti asking them to stop talking about China, Pakistan and instead campaign for retrieval of Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Chug, who replaced Ram Madhav recently as BJP’s national general secretary, said if one compares the 1960’s picture of Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad with Srinagar and Jammu, “difference is huge and quite obvious.” “See how Mumbai emerged as a dream city for everyone who visits it. Bangalore is a technology hub today and Hyderabad is a place, where dreams come true. Delhi is a metropolitan city where life moves at a great speed. The question remains why Srinagar and Jammu remained away from the development,” he asked. Claiming that Srinagar and Jammu will be taken to new heights, the BJP leader said, “Now that democracy is flourishing in J&K, Srinagar and Jammu should be compared with Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad in 2030 now. The difference will be visible.” He alleged corruption and nepotism promoted by the dynasty leaders, choked development in J&K.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-growing-like-storm-in-jammu-and-kashmir-saffron-party-leader-claims-dynasty-politics-over-923716.html
05-12-2020||National Politics||TRS may need support of others to win GHMC Mayoral election||The ruling TRS in Telangana has emerged as the single largest party in the GHMC polls, but it may need the support of others to retain the Mayor's post, notwithstanding its strength of ex-officio members, who can participate in voting. The results of 149 wards out of the total 150 were declared on Saturday (counting was stopped in one ward on Friday owing to a legal issue) and TRS is the single largest party after winning 55 seats. The Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs who have their vote in the city are ex-officio members of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), official sources said. Besides this, the MLCs and Rajya Sabha members, who have their vote in the city, have to give an option choosing the GHMC to be able to vote in the Mayoral poll, they said. The sources put the number of ex-officio members as on Saturday at 49 though clarity on the matter may emerge when notification for the Mayoral election is issued. Out of the 49, the strength of TRS is 31. The party-wise number of ex-officio members is AIMIM- 10, Congress-1 and BJP-3, the sources claimed. However, the ex-officio members should not have voted six months ago in the same capacity (in a local body). Some of the ex-officio members of GHMC had voted in suburban municipalitiesearlierand they are not eligible to vote. T he Municipal Administration Department would send the details on the status of such ex-officio members to the GHMC, the sources said. According to some analysts, TRS may fall short of about 10 members and it may need the support of AIMIM. This is an option for the TRS to win the Mayor's post. However, the TRS may not be too keen on joining hands with the AIMIM, as the BJP, during the GHMC poll campaign had accused the ruling party of having an unholy alliance with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led party. The AIMIM staying away from the Mayoral election would also help the cause of TRS. Separately, the newly-elected GHMC ward members would have to wait till February to take oath as the term of present body ends on February 10. In the GHMC polls, TRS won 55, while the BJP, AIMIM and Congress secured 48, 44 and two wards respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/trs-may-need-support-of-others-to-win-ghmc-mayoral-election-923777.html

Taking a dig at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's move at setting up a film city in the state, he alleged that a lot of money was spent on the investors' meet but the people "did not see the MoUs signed taking shape on the ground level". "The film city has also become a thing of entertainment in the state," Yadav said. "There is no comparison of BJP in making tall claims. Farmers, youth and all sections of society are unhappy and even after four years of this government people are yet to see the desired results of the promises made. Yet, the government is patting itself for its hollow achievements," the SP chief said in a statement. Referring to the government's claims at job creation, he alleged that the state government was "cheating the people specially the youth by spending money on big advertisements and hiding its shortcomings through them". "The people are bearing the brunt of BJP's tricks. But now they (people) are running out of patience. People are only waiting for 2022 (Assembly polls) and they will take an account of the promises made by the BJP leaders. The youth will express their anger by voting for the cycle (Samajwadi Party symbol)," he added. No immediate reaction was available from the BJP over the Samajwadi Party chief's allegation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/uttar-pradesh-government-patting-itself-for-its-hollow-achievements-says-akhilesh-yadav-923825.html

The BJP hit back, saying Gehlot has failed to run the government and is frustrated and making unreasonable allegations. Claiming that the BJP was going to start the "game" once again with money power, Gehlot said Congress MLAs had to stay in hotels for 34 days to save his government in July when Pilot and 18 MLAs loyal to him rebelled against the chief minister. The Congress had then accused the BJP of indulging in horse-trading to topple its government in the state, a charge rejected by the opposition party. Addressing a virtual function to inaugurate a party office in Sirohi's Shivganj, Gehlot alleged that Union Home Minister Amit Shah in presence of Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Zafar Islam, BJP's Rajya Sabha member, had at that time met Congress MLAs and assured them of toppling the government while asking them to keep patience. "Ajay Maken, who stayed with us in a hotel for 34 days, knows what was happening in Rajasthan... Zafar Islam, who has now become a Rajya Sabha member and had played a key role in Jyotiraditya Scindia joining the BJP, was also at a meeting which lasted for an hour," Gehlot claimed. "This is how the entire game was played. Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Avinash Paden, Venugopal, all came and sat here and took decisions to terminate our people and leaders. Only after this, the government could be saved. BJP is doing this conspiracy everywhere. People now say that Maharashtra is the next target... Do not know what will happen. They are going to restart the same in Rajasthan again, this is their thought," he claimed. Reacting to Gehlot's claims, BJP state president Satish Poonia said, "It is regrettable, unfortunate, that despite being the chief minister of the state, without having any proof, he took name of Home Minister of India Amit Shah and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, which is beyond political dignity." He went on to add, "Today the statement of the chief minister of Rajasthan is clear that this government has failed to rule for two years and a mental deviation is seen in the statements of Ashok Gehlot. I think Gehlot has lost his morale and moral courage." In July, a feud between the chief minister and Pilot came out in the open after the latter along with 18 other MLAs revolted against Gehlot's leadership which led to a political crisis for nearly a month. Pilot, then the deputy chief minister, and two ministers in his camp were dropped from the Gehlot cabinet on July 14. During the crisis, the MLAs of Gehlot camp were lodged in a hotel here and later shifted to Jaisalmer. It came to an end when Pilot and other MLAs met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi and a committee of three members was set up by the AICC to look into their grievances.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-making-renewed-attempts-to-topple-my-government-says-gehlot-opposition-party-rubbishes-claim-923872.html

The fourth round, which was held on Thursday, failed to end the standoff, with protesting farmers sticking to their demand of scrapping the laws. "There is no doubt in our minds that only repeal of the laws will end the agitation. We will not budge. We want the government to take their proposals to the Parliament and let a Parliamentary committee discuss the issues. We will not agree to anything short of repeal of the laws,” AIKS finance secretary Krishna Prasad said. Undeterred by the winter chill, thousands of farmers have stayed put at various border points of Delhi for the past nine days as part of their protest against the Centre's farm laws. "At this juncture, we have transport unions, retail businesses and other associated groups who have shown solidarity with us. Our movement is not just about farmers," Prasad said. He claimed that these laws seek to allow foreign intervention in agriculture and said this will allow corporates to monopolise the farm sector. AIKS also demanded that the government unconditionally withdraw cases filed across India on protesting farmers. "AIKS strongly condemns the cowardly effort by the Modi Govt to use the Delhi Police in a bid to intimidate leaders, activists protesting against the Anti-Farmer Acts," the farmer union tweeted from its official handle.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/strike-will-end-once-new-agriculture-laws-are-culled-all-india-kisan-sabha-official-923705.html

It also expressed dissatisfaction over the information provided by the state government about the steps it has taken for these labourers. A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice V K Shukla gave the direction on Friday. "We are not satisfied by the chart produced by the state and its functionaries. Instead, they are required to draw out a definite plan to rehabilitate these migrated labourers so that they can earn livelihood in their home state," the court said in its order. "Let the needful be done by the next date (of hearing) along with the status report qua other facilities that are being extended to the labourers, who have been identified for extending benefits under respective schemes," it said. The court's direction came after a social organisation raised objection to the way the government filed a reply to its petition, the petitioner's counsel Shanno S Khan counsel said. The government's reply carried only a chart and some information, but there were no details about the nature of job provided to the labourers, who are natives of Madhya Pradesh, and returned home during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, she added. The government's reply stated that there are about 7,40,440 migrant labourers registered during the pandemic and employment was given to 44,634 of them, the counsel said. "There are no details about various welfare schemes meant for the labourers, including provision of loan under Centre/state schemes and how many labourers got benefit of MNREGA," Khan added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/draw-plan-to-rehabilitate-migrant-workers-mp-high-court-to-state-government-923727.html

Reports said damage was caused to houses and cars of those who voted in favour of local candidate in Karimabad village of Pulwama, 28 kms from here. Karimabad went to polls in the third phase of DDC polls on Friday. A local news gathering agency CNS reported that some of the people whose property was damaged were identified as Ghulam Nabi Zargar, Muhammad Abbas Pandit and Shahbaz Ahmed Pandit. Police while confirming the incident said some chronic stone-pelters of the village were involved in this incident. Though stone pelters and militants used to disrupt the poll process in Kashmir in the past, it is for the time that the property of those who voted has been vandalised. On Friday, a DDC candidate was shot at and injured in Kokernag area of Anantnag district while he was campaigning. Separatists, who usually used to call for boycott of elections, have not openly called for a poll boycott this time. They are under the scanner of the Centre on issues of terror funding and creating instability in the region and fear that any anti-election activity by them would land them in further trouble.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/stone-pelters-damage-property-of-voters-in-kashmir-s-pulwama-923728.html

Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of 40 farmers' unions at the Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital. Talks between the Union ministers and a representative group of thousands of agitating farmers failed to yield any resolution on Thursday, as the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of the three laws. Farmers' groups on Thursday had even refused the lunch, tea and water offered to them during the almost eight-hour-long hectic parleys. Sources said the meeting began at around 2.30 pm with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh giving introductory remarks. Outside the meeting venue, employees of the Indian Tourist Transporters Association (ITTA), which has supplied vehicles for the transit movement of the protesting farmers, were seen holding a banner which read 'we support farmers' and shouting slogans backing the peasants' agitation. "I belong to a farmer's family. I can related to their fears. We had farm land at Mahipalpur and now you see T-3 terminal out there. We are supporting the protesting farmers in their cause," IITA president Satish Sehrawat told PTI. He said the association is providing transportation facility to the farmers since their first meeting. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal state general secretary Onkar Singh Agaul said: "Our demand is same that the government should withdraw all three farm laws. We want MSP should be guaranteed through law". He also sought the scrapping of electricity amendment law and an ordinance on stubble burning. Ahead of the crucial meeting with the protesting farmer organisations, Union ministers, including Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliberate over proposals likely to be made to the agitating groups, sources said. Tomar and Goyal were also present in the meeting with the prime minister, they said. Earlier, Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah were leading deliberations among Union ministers to resolve the issues raised by the agitating farmers. Modi’s decision to hold deliberations with Union ministers, who have so far been the face of the Centre’s efforts to end the farmers’ agitation, signifies the importance the prime minister has attached to defuse the crisis, the sources said. This is the first time that Modi has held a meeting with his ministers over the issue. On Friday, the farmers announced a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads leading to the national capital if the government does not accept their demands.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/union-ministers-meet-farmers-groups-to-break-deadlock-over-farm-laws-923734.html

In a joint statement, five Left parties -- CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), Forward Bloc and RSP -- asked other political parties and other groups, who stand with the farmers' cause to extend their support and cooperation to the December 8 bandh call. The statement signed by General Secretaries Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), D Raja (CPI), Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML), Debabrata Biswas (Forward Bloc) and Manoj Bhattacharya (RSP) also condemned "the RSS/BJP’s malicious campaign, on preposterous charges, against the struggle of our 'annadatas' (food providers) to safeguard Indian agriculture and the country’s food security". The reference was to a section calling the protesting farmers as 'Khalistanis' and 'anti-nationals'. "The Left parties extend their solidarity with and support to the ongoing massive agitation by Kisan organisations from all over the country against the new agri laws.The Left parties extend their support to the call given by them for a Bharat Bandh on December 8," the statement said. It said the Left parties support the farmers' demand for the scrapping of the three farm sector laws and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions and independent Sector sectoral federations and associations also pledged their support for the December 8 agitation. A statement issued by the unions -- INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC besides sectoral Federations and Associations -- said it reiterates the wholehearted support to the ongoing united struggles of the farmers demanding scrapping of draconian Agri-laws, Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 and legislation guaranteeing MSP. The unions had held a nationwide general strike on November 26 in solidarity with the farmers against the farm laws as well as labour codes, among others. It said it notes with satisfaction that workers and employees and their unions have been fully active in holding numerous agitations in solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ struggles across the country braving arrests and intimidation from the state governments. The Joint Platform also called upon workers, employees and their unions, irrespective of affiliations, to organise active solidarity to the farmers' call for Bharat Bandh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/left-parties-trade-unions-lend-support-to-bharat-bandh-call-by-farmers-on-december-8-923741.html

Led by J-K Congress vice president and former minister Raman Bhalla, the protesters assembled outside the party headquarters at Shaheedi chowk and held a peaceful protest to show their opposition to the “anti-farmer farm laws”. Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his remarks that the farm laws reforms have opened doors of new opportunities for farmers, Bhalla said insistence in support of the legislations shows that the government is "drunk with power" and is rigid even in reconsidering them. He demanded that the government should immediately announce the suspension of the three "anti-agriculture" laws. Bhalla claimed that the laws would pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving the farmers at the "mercy" of big corporates. “The farmers of the country are angry and agitated over the three farm laws enacted recently by the Central government. It would be better if the Centre reconsiders these laws enacted without forging any consensus with farmers,” he said. He accused the Centre of seeking to mortgage the country to the rich.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/j-k-congress-stages-protest-in-jammu-in-support-of-farmers-agitation-923764.html

Abdul Momin Peer, Syed Iftikhar Andrabi, Islam-ul-Haq Peer, Afaq Ahmad Wani, Saleem Andrabi and Muneer Ahmad Banday have been charged by the NIA in the case. In a statement a spokesperson of the NIA said that the chargesheet was filed against the accused persons in case RC-03/2020/NIA/JMU under sections 8, 21, 25 and 29 of NDPS Act, 1985, section 120B of IPC and sections 17, 38 and 40 of UA(P) Act, 1967. He said Saleem Andrabi and Muneer Bandey, who are involved in the case are still absconding while four accused have been already arrested. The J&K police had on June 11 busted a Pakistan-sponsored narco-terror module and arrested three terrorist associates in Handwara area of north Kashmir’s frontier Kupwara district. As many as 21 kgs of heroin, 1.35 crores cash and a cash counting machine was recovered. On June 23 the NIA took over the probe of the case from J&K police after nod from the Union Home Ministry as it had inter-country and inter-state ramifications. The arrested persons, according to the NIA investigation, were working for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to strengthen their activities in the Valley and were also misleading and motivating the local youth to join militant ranks. The NIA investigation further revealed that accused persons including Momin Peer and Saleem Andrabi were involved in cross-border smuggling and supply of narcotic drug heroin in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of the country after procuring the same from their associates based abroad including Pakistan. "Accused Iftikhar Andrabi and Abdul Momin Peer visited Pakistan several times during 2016-17 to meet the operatives of terrorist organisations LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen. The amount generated from the sale of Heroin was pumped by the accused to further the terrorist activities of LeT. Further investigation in the case is going on," the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nia-files-chargesheet-against-six-people-in-handwara-narco-terrorism-case-923768.html

With this, 3 union territories and all 28 states have accepted the Centre's borrowing plan to meet the shortfall in tax collection. “ All the 28 states and 3 Union Territories with legislature have decided to go for Option-1 to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of the GST implementation. Jharkhand, the only remaining state, has now communicated its acceptance of Option-1,” the ministry said in a statement. Union Territories of Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir and Puducherry have accepted Option 1. The states & UTs who choose Option-1 are getting the amount of shortfall arising out of GST implementation through a special borrowing window put in place by the Centre. The Centre has already borrowed Rs 30,000 crore on behalf of the states in five installments and has passed it on to 26 states and 3 UTs on October 23, November 2, November 9, November 23 and December 1. From the next round of borrowings, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh too would receive funds raised through this window. Earlier this week, Chhattisgarh communicated its acceptance for the borrowing plan. The next installment of Rs 6,000 crore will be released to the states/UTs on December 7, 2020, the ministry added. Under the terms of Option-1, besides getting the facility of a special window for borrowings to meet the revenue shortfall, states are also entitled to get unconditional permission to borrow the final installment of 0.50 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) out of the 2 per cent additional borrowings permitted by the Centre. This is over and above the special window of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. On receipt of the choice of Option-1 from Jharkhand, the Centre has granted additional borrowing permission of Rs 1,765 crore to Jharkhand government (0.5 per cent of Chhattisgarh's GSDP), it added. Separately, Jharkhand will get Rs 1,689 crore through special borrowing window to meet the GST revenue shortfall. Under the borrowing plan (Option-1), the Centre would borrow from market Rs 1.10 lakh crore which is the revenue shortfall on account of GST implementation. The remaining Rs 73,000 crore shortfall is estimated to be the revenue impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The second option given by the Centre was that the states borrow the entire Rs 1.83 lakh crore collection shortfall. Opposition-ruled states were initially against the borrowing plan saying that the Centre should borrow the entire GST revenue shortfall and compensate the states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jharkhand-opts-in-all-states-accept-centres-borrowing-plan-for-gst-shortfall-923780.html

At a meeting at his official residence, he directed officials to increase the cold storage capacity to 2.30 lakh litres by December 15, according to an official statement. Adityanath also said that cold chain facilities would be arranged at each districts and divisions. "All security arrangements should be made to ensure its availability. The safety of the vaccine storage spots should be ensured in the same manner as that of the electronic voting machines," the chief minister said. He also directed officials to ensure that healthcare workers are trained in large number to administer vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said a Covid-19 vaccine may be ready in a few weeks as he noted that experts believe the wait for it will not be long, and asserted that the vaccination drive in India will begin as soon as scientists give the nod. Five vaccine candidates are in different phases of clinical trails in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting phase-three trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Covaxin, a vaccine indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also started its phase-three clinical trial. Another vaccine, developed in the country by Zydus Cadila, has completed phase-two clinical trail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ensure-safety-of-vaccine-storage-spots-as-that-of-evms-up-cm-to-officials-923784.html

05-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi HC quashes parts of JNU adverts for appointment to posts of prof, associate prof||The Delhi High Court has quashed parts of two Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) advertisements that pertain to appointment to two posts, one of professor and another of associate professor, following a plea by some faculty members alleging illegalities in procedure. The high court directed the university to revisit the issue and work out the roster points afresh with regard to the two posts challenged by the teachers, and complete the exercise within three months. The court was dealing with a plea filed on behalf of two assistant professors, affected by the recruitment process, and two professors, who are not affected but challenged the legality of the procedure. The petition claimed that they were proposing to apply for the vacancies under the reserved category but the university had converted one of the posts from schedule caste (SC) to schedule tribe (ST) category, while another post was de-reserved and converted to an unreserved seat. The other two petitioners are professors in the university and are not affected by the selection process pursuant to the advertisements, but have impleaded themselves in the plea only with the purpose of highlighting the alleged illegalities in filling up the reserved posts by the varsity. Justice Jyoti Singh said it is obvious that the petitioners are confining their claim only to the two posts in the advertisements and there is no reason why the entire advertisements should be quashed. “It is open to the university to initiate a fresh recruitment process and advertise the two posts after the above exercise is completed,” the court said. The judge said that the burden to “prove that the reservation rosters were correctly recast, was on the university, which in my view, it has failed to discharge. Mere statements and denials that there has been no de-reservation or exchange of reservation points would not be enough for the university to rebut the data/ tables placed on record by the petitioners.” Senior advocate Akhil Sibal, representing the petitioner teachers, submitted that the appointments to the teaching posts in the universities have to follow the policy of “post-based reservation”, which mandates that specific teaching posts be designated or reserved for persons belonging to specific reserved categories such as SC, ST and OBC (other backward classes). The reservations shall not apply to the vacancies, he said. He urged that although in an earlier advertisement issued by the JNU in 2017 certain posts were reserved, which ensured to the benefit of the two assistant professors, the said two posts have been shown in the altered categories namely ST and unreserved in the latest two advertisements, challenged in the petition. The plea, filed through advocates Maanav Kumar, Roshni Namboodiry and Nupur, have challenged the two advertisements issued by the varsity on August 19, 2019. It said the university published a statement on its website that there were 91 vacancies existing in SC/ST categories in the professor and associate professor cadre and against this only 57 have been advertised. Advocate Monika Arora, representing JNU, argued that neither any post of SC or ST has been converted by exchange nor any de-reserved into unreserved post as alleged by the petitioners and reiterated that there is merely a shift in points. This change, according to her, has not caused any loss in required reservations of SCs and STs. A division bench of the high court had earlier directed the JNU not to make any appointments on the concerned two posts till the pendency of the petition. The petition said the first teacher, Pradeep Shinde, who is an assistant professor of sociology at the Centre for Informal Sector and Labour Studies in School of Social Sciences, was proposing to apply for the post associate professor in the same centre which was earlier reserved for SC candidates but has now been converted into an ST post. The second teacher, Tsetan Namgyal, who is assistant professor at the Centre for Inner Asian Studies (Tibetian and Himalayan Studies) at School of International Studies, was desirous of applying for the post of professor which was reserved for ST candidates but it has now been de-reserved and converted to an unreserved post. According to the petitioners, they are eligible for consideration against these reserved posts, respectively, according to the roster points and this action has adversely affected their consideration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-hc-quashes-parts-of-jnu-adverts-for-appointment-to-posts-of-prof-associate-prof-923805.html
05-12-2020||North and Central||Modi government unleashes campaign to highlight benefits of farm laws||Even as talks are going on with the farmers' leaders, the Modi government has unleashed a campaign to highlight the benefits of the new farm sector laws and is insisting that the minimum support price regime would remain untouched. “If farmers get an option to sell their produce at better rates to anyone else along with the markets, how can it be called injustice,” Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. Prasad’s comments came after the meeting that the senior ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, indicating that the government is in no mood to accede to the demands of farmers to repeal the farm laws. However, the government is ready to amend certain sections of the laws to reassure the agitating farmers as is evident in the Agriculture Minister’s remarks after the fourth round of talks on Thursday. While refusing to repeal the farm sector laws, the government has expressed willingness to discuss any aspect of the laws that farmers find could do them harm. Tomar’s refrain has been that the laws nowhere mention that the minimum support price would be scrapped or that the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets would be dismantled, and farmers' apprehensions on these accounts are misplaced. The Centre has also been highlighting success stories of farmers who have benefited from various initiatives in the agriculture sector, including the new laws that were introduced through an Ordinance in June and approved by Parliament in September. The Centre has also released short films to highlight various aspects of the new laws, urging farmers not to fall prey to misinformation campaigns about the “historical agricultural reforms”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/modi-government-unleashes-campaign-to-highlight-benefits-of-farm-laws-923829.html

The order comes against the backdrop of a camera trap footage showing a Ranthambore tiger, T-108, with a wire snare around its neck. Under the 'Red Alert', all forest officials have been directed to intensify search operations and seek local police assistance to nab hunters and criminals. The department has cancelled leaves of all field officers, and directions have been issued for effective patrolling against illegal activities in protected areas. The order said reports had earlier been received from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve about animals such as cows and buffaloes getting caught in traps laid by hunters. "Recently, five hunters were arrested in Mount Abu for hunting a sambar deer, looking to which red alert is announced till February 2021," it stated. The sub-adult Ranthambore tiger T-108 was spotted twice on camera traps – 12.50 am on Thursday and 6 am on Saturday – with a wire around his neck which looks like a trap. The department sought a permission to tranquillise the big cat from the NTCA on Friday. The tiger was tranquillised at 11 am on Saturday, and released in the wild at 11.45 am after removing the wire, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/red-alert-at-all-rajasthan-reserves-sanctuaries-after-tiger-spotted-with-wire-snare-around-neck-923837.html
05-12-2020||North and Central||For some farmers, reaching protest site in itself a herculean task||For many of the thousands of farmers camping on the roads and braving the cold at night to press for their demands, reaching the Singhu border point between Delhi-Haryana to join the peasants’ agitation was in itself a major challenge which they surmounted with hard labour and ingenuity. Kawaljeet Singh (28) and Dalbir Singh Tong (36) along with eight other farmers arrived at the demonstration site two days ago close to midnight, from Amritsar district. They said they had to "move earth" and "push boulders" to overcome the obstacles that have been created on the way to Delhi from Punjab. "Roads have been dug up at a few places across the highway in Haryana, so deep that no vehicle can pass through it. But we are farmers, we don't give up. We used our strength and ingenuity ('kisan ki taqat aur dimag'), to reach here," Kawaljeet said. The farmer from Beas area said he and the accompanying farmers filled the troughs on the road with earth dug up from the nearby fields to make a passage for their four-wheeler. "At other places, huge boulders were put up in the middle of the highway to block the path. The local farmers in Haryana helped us. Someone brought their JCB machine to move the boulders to allow us to move forward," said Dalbir. Tarlochan Singh Safri, 54, sporting a bright blue turban and a flowing white beard, echoed Kawaljeet. "Efforts were made to obstruct paths on the highway so that not many farmers could reach the protest site at Singhu Border,” he alleged. "We had to take detour at some places and at other places, local farmers of Haryana helped us. They even allowed us to drive our vehicles over their farms. One Kisan always stands for other Kisans," Safri told PTI. Saturday was yet another day of protests at the Singhu and Tikri border areas, even as farmers’ leaders held another round of talks with the government representatives to find a way out of the crisis. The hardships faced in reaching the protest site and the common demand of repealing of the new farm laws have galvanised the farmers with a tremendous sense of solidarity and camaraderie. Several farmers from Haryana, wearing the trademark green 'pagdi' (turban), sat in circles around a traditional hukka that was being passed around, as they too sought complete repeal of what they alleged was a "naya kala kanoon" (new black law) that will “wreck” the lives of farmers. Babu Ram, a farmer from a neighbouring district in Haryana, sat at the Singhu border and appealed to the others to join the protest. "This country had been made with the blood and sweat of farmers and labourers, and today this government has brought them in the streets. Is this the worth of farmers in our 'krishi-pradhan desh'? Farmers coming from Punjab had to face so much of obstruction," he rued. Naunihal Singh of Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Punjab, rode from Patti in Tarn Taran district in Punjab, about 500 km from the Delhi border, on a tractor, accompanied by about 20 other farmers, including a Sikh Nihang warrior. "Our route on the highway was obstructed at several places with boulders and the road was dug up to not allow us to pass through. We farmers jointly pushed the boulders. At some places local Haryana farmers sent help with JCB machines and at others we found other indirect ways through friends,” the farmer said. “It was very tough, but we left home to achieve our goals, not to return like cowards. We are farmers from Punjab," he said. At the protest site, fiery speeches, fluttering flags of Bharat Kisan Union and other peasant bodies, and spirited 'langars' that invited everyone to join in, added to the charged atmosphere. Cries of 'Saada Haq, Aithe Rakh', 'Jo Bole So Nihal' and 'Kisan Union Ekta Zindabad' rent the air throughout the day, as the coloured turbans of protesting farmers added vibrancy to the scene of the agitation. Devendra Singh, 39, a farm labourer from Ludhiana, hitch-hiked all the way to the Singhu border. On Saturday, he carried a board hung over his body with pro-farmer slogans in Punjabi. "I took lift from various people, on a truck, tractor, two-wheeler and walked on foot too. I had started at 12:30 PM from Ludhiana on November 27 and reached the same day close to midnight. I had Rs 350 in my pocket, some of which I’ve used to buy a pair of socks and get internet (on phone) recharged,” he said. Asked how long he intended to stay at the protest site, the labourer said, "Till the farmers' demands are met".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/for-some-farmers-reaching-protest-site-in-itself-a-herculean-task-923846.html

Days after engaging in a bitter Twitter fight with actor Kangana Ranaut over the farmers' agitation, Dosanjh went to the protest site and initially sat among the crowd and listened to the speeches by other leaders. The 36-year-old actor then took the stage and started his address in Punjabi. "I am not here to talk but only listen. You people are creating history once again. I used to listen to stories that Punjabis are full of energy but I'm witnessing it for the first time," Dosanjh said. To the agitating farmers, his message was: be patient and peaceful in your protests. "This is the only way we can win this fight. Stories of these days will definitely be told in future," he said, while thanking the people who joined the protest from Haryana. The "Udta Punjab" actor then turned to Hindi for the convenience of media persons present at the site. Referring to his ugly war-of-words with Ranaut, Dosanjh said unlike the narrative being spread on Twitter, the farmers' agitation has been "peaceful".  "If you are listening to us, there's no other issue than that of farmers being talked about here. Please don't divert issues. The government should accept the demands of the farmers.  "Everyone is sitting here peacefully, no one is talking about 'khoon-kharaba.' On Twitter, a lot of things happen, everything's twisted," he said. Dosanjh and Ranaut were involved in a bitter social media fight on Thursday over her comments against an elderly participant in the farmers' protest. The fight started after Ranaut misidentified the woman farmer as Bilkis Bano, a septuagenarian who had attracted international attention for her participation in the anti-CAA protests earlier this year at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh neighbourhood. In response, Dosanjh had shared a BBC interview that identified the woman farmer as Mahinder Kaur. In the vitriolic exchange that followed, Ranaut called Dosanjh filmmaker Karan Johar's "pet", a "bootlicker" and asked if he wasn't ashamed of defending somebody who "instigated" the Delhi riots earlier this year. Dosanjh, a popular name in Punjabi films who shot to national fame with the 2016 drug drama "Udta Punjab", in turn accused Ranaut of lying and instigating people by playing with people's emotions. In his address, the actor said that he was touched by the overwhelming support the farmers have received from across the country.  "We request with folded hands to the national media, to show how all of us are sitting peacefully.

Hasseb Ahmed, who has been on a sit-in against the Centre's new farm laws here at the Ghazipur border since last Saturday, says he has two school going children, who are busy with their online classes back in his village in Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh, want a better standard of living. His elder son is in Class 12, while the younger is in class 9. "Neither of them wished to get into farming. They have their ambitions and want to land a good job. They say they don't want to be farmers," Ahmed said. "With the price that we are offered for our crops, all we can afford to give them is food and basic education. Nothing beyond that. They get disappointed to see that despite all the handwork that goes in it, we don't receive appropriate returns," he added. Another farmer, Sitaarya, who is from Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh, said her children too were slowly trying to detach themselves from farming. "They are even ready to sit in a bidi, tabocco or a paan shop to earn a living." "We work day and night on the fields but don't get the required profit. Getting into farming is like falling into a pit. Unless there is profit, our children don't wish to get into it. If only the government had focused on turning farming into an employment opportunity and set a standard price for our crops, our children would not have been so against this profession, which is in every sense the backbone of this country," she added. Agitating farmers have stressed that unless their demands are met and the new farm laws repelled, they will not move anywhere from the borders of the national capital and their protest will continue. Daryal Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from UP, pointed out that the young people in his village were ready to work even under a trader for Rs 2,000 but they do not wish to become farmers. "For ages they have seen their families struggle to get farm loans. Whatever money they make out of farming, a good portion of it goes into repaying the loan, and they are left with a meagre sum. How do we change their perceptive? Has any government ever acted for the farmers till date," he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/our-children-no-longer-want-to-become-farmers-its-like-falling-into-a-pit-uttar-pradesh-kisan-923883.html

05-12-2020||North and Central||Punjab CM Amarinder reciting BJP's script: SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal slammed Amarinder Singh on Saturday over the recent meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, accusing the Punjab chief minister of reciting the BJP's script by allegedly linking the farmers' agitation to national security. Badal alleged that Singh had surrendered to the BJP after he was summoned to Delhi and told to "choose between facing the Enforcement Directorate and betraying the farmers". "The choice he made became clear with the first thing he said as soon as he came out of the meeting with Amit Shah, telling the farmers to end their agitation, citing dangers to national security from this peaceful movement," Badal said in a statement. On Saturday evening, Singh described Badal's latest tirade against him as "utter buffoonery". The chief minister had said on Thursday he appealed to Shah and the protesting farmers to find an early resolution to the impasse over the contentious farm laws, saying the agitation was affecting Punjab's economy and the nation's security. Singh had said he never called farmers a threat to national security, adding that his remarks were in context of prolonged stand-off, which "our hostile neighbours, whom the sons of these are very farmers are fighting can exploit". Badal said everyone in Delhi knew what happened in that meeting. "Instead of telling the Centre to annul the acts, he shocked the farmers by telling them to withdraw agitation and accept defeat and go home," the SAD leader said. "The brave captain (Singh) merely recited the script given to him by the BJP high command. He sang it like a parrot," Badal said. The SAD president alleged that Singh's "cowardly surrender" before the ED and Shah might surprise those who took his "hollow bluster and boastfulness" seriously. "Like all bullies, Amarinder is a coward at heart and only needs a bigger bully to expose this cowardice," he said. In a statement, Singh said no ED cases had ever stopped him for fighting for his people, nor was he like the Badals who are "spineless or a traitor" to the farmers. "What is new about the ED cases against me or my family that I should suddenly start trembling," he asked. Singh said he and his family had been fighting the ED and other cases for years, adding that none of the cases had ever stopped him from risking everything for his people. The Badals, who were totally cornered over their "betrayal" of the farmers, had clearly pressed all the panic buttons in their "desperation to cover up their brazen treachery", the chief minister in a scathing remarks. "Such is their level of despair that Sukhbir even stooped to undermining the Pakistani threat to the security of Punjab and the nation," Singh said. "Have you and your SAD become so power-hungry that you have even closed your eyes to the threat posed by the Pakistanis to our security?" the chief minister asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-cm-amarinder-reciting-bjps-script-sad-chief-sukhbir-singh-badal-923905.html

Nadda began his four-day tour of Uttarakhand on Friday. "In this ideological war, we are pursuing the path of nationalism and development. People have rejected the opposition's selfish agenda," he said, addressing a meeting with intellectuals here on Saturday. The four-day tour will see the BJP president address a slew of meetings with party workers to galvanise the organisation ahead of the 2022 assembly polls in Uttarakhand. "The BJP keeps its flag flying under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Bihar poll verdict, in which we won 74 out of 110 seats, shows that our strike rate has been the best at 67 per cent," Nadda said. It is an indication that the people of Bihar have voted for development over regionalism and casteism, and have reposed their trust in the alliance led by BJP, he added. "Opposing Modi has led the opposition to oppose the country. People can understand this," Nadda said. He accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of issuing anti-national statements, which, he said, are being made a tool by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for an anti-India propaganda. "The former external affairs minister of the Congress is talking about enforcing Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir once again. Leaders like Shashi Tharoor go to Pakistan and denigrate india.

During his civic body polls campaign, Bandi, who emerged as the Telangana BJP's firebrand face, had announced that if his party wins the mayor seat, surgical strikes would be conducted on the old city areas to remove the Rohingyas, Pakistanis from Hyderabad. The BJP is widely short of numbers to lay claim to the Mayor position but has shocked the TRS, startled the pollsters by winning 48 seats, up by 44 wards in 2016. The BJP leader who had alleged large scale misuse of the government institutions by the K Chandrasekhar Rao government for the election purpose said that he is dedicating the BJP victory to the State Election Commission head, and the Telangana DGP. “The SEC was striving very hard for the TRS, much more than that party activists. The DGP was oblivious to the attacks on the BJP cadres. So, for trying their best to stop the BJP's triumph, our success is dedicated to them,” Bandi told media after the 1 December poll results were revealed on Friday. While thanking the Hyderabad voters for reposing faith in the BJP and hailing the party cadre's commitment, Bandi stated that the TRS's car (party symbol) would be confined to its shed after 2023 assembly polls. Speaking to reporters, TRS working president and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said that they had expected 20-25 seats more. The party in rule in GHMC was confined to 55 seats, much short of the majority needed to take the mayor chair. “In some places, we were defeated by a very narrow margin. However, we will analyze these results in detail in party forums,” Rao said. Meanwhile, Telangana Congress chief Uttam Kumar Reddy sent his resignation to the post to the party leadership, while asking for commencing the selection process for a new president immediately. Though Reddy did not specify the reasons, the resignation comes in the wake of the Congress's electoral failures in the Hyderabad civic body polls and the Dubbaka assembly by-poll last month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-bjp-chief-bandi-sanjay-who-promised-surgical-strikes-dubs-ghmc-victory-as-saffron-strike-923628.html
05-12-2020||South||GHMC Polls: Why BJP made massive inroads in Hyderabad||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made massive inroads into Hyderabad, winning 48 seats in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls on Wednesday. The saffron party emerged as the second-largest party, only seven behind Telangana Rashtra Samithi's (TRS) 55 seats, and four ahead of the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen's (AIMIM) 44 seats - whose tally remained unchanged from the 2016 elections. The BJP won 44 more seats this year compared to the last elections at the expense of the TRS.  Here are four reasons that could have lifted the saffron party's performance in Hyderabad civic polls: High-profile party leaders campaigning | In what is possibly the first instance of the BJP's national president campaigning for a civic body election, Hyderabad played host to the likes of Home Minister Amit Shah, party president J P Nadda, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Union ministers Smriti Irani, Prakash Javadekar, and youth wing chief Tejasvi Surya, apart from Secunderabad MP and MoS, Kishan Reddy.  The larger picture - 2023 Assembly polls | The saffron party approached the Hyderabad civic polls in an aggressive manner, keeping in mind the larger picture. The BJP, who have never formed the government in the newly-formed state, have only two representatives in the Assembly and occupy four of the 17 Lok Sabha seats. The active participation in the civic polls is seen as a move to gear up for 2023 Assembly polls and the 2024 general elections, where they would ideally like to consolidate votes and better their tally. The Hyderabad civic body polls lay the groundwork to achieve the larger goal. Widening the horizon | Barring Karnataka, the BJP has for long been viewed as a 'North Indian' party, with Telangana being no exception. In the hinsight, one could say that their win in the Dubakka bypolls was a precursor of what was to come, but it is still fair to say that a tally of 48 was unprecedented. The party's grand move to call national figures to talk about local issues such as transportation, flooding due to encroachment, and the contentious Bhagyalakshmi Temple row, seems to have helped them establish a connection with voters and garner more votes.  Anti-incumbency wave coupled with Congress's no show | There seems to have been a strong wave of anti-incumbency that has played right into the BJP's hands. Furthermore, Congress's inability to capitalise on the anti-incumbency wave seems to have further aided the saffron party's win. The anti-incumbency wave gave a huge blow to the TRS, who were down to 55 from 99 in 2016. They are also 10 short of the 65-seat mark to occupy the Mayor's post. The BJP, who will form the Opposition, find themselves in a strong position as TRS might be forced to reluctantly form a coalition with the AIMIM.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ghmc-polls-why-bjp-made-massive-inroads-in-hyderabad-923672.html

The marina will be developed with the help of the central government. "I will discuss with the technical experts on providing cable car connectivity between Malpe and Padukere," he said during the inauguration of the amphitheatre near Malpe Seawalk, which was built at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The Minister directed the administration to prepare an action plan to tap tourism potential by preparing a vision document and submit it to the government. A draft based on Goa's CRZ model has been prepared for Karnataka which will be submitted to the central government for approval shortly. Goa enjoys certain relaxations in the implementation of CRZ norms, which helps the state in carrying out development works which in turn promotes tourism. Similar relaxations will be sought for Karnataka as well, he said. The minister said that the four-laning of the road from Udupi to Malpe, covering a distance of 5 km is in progress and will be completed by next December. MLA Raghupathi Bhat said during the inauguration that there is a need to implement the proposal on cable car or ropeway for providing connectivity between Malpe beach to Padukere beach. The cable car may boost tourism in the district. A walking track and cycle track is also being developed near Padukere at a cost of Rs 20 crore. If the marina is set up, it will further attract tourists.  Deputy Commissioner G Jagadeesha also spoke at the event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/karnataka-to-release-rs-1-crore-for-detailed-project-report-on-marina-at-padukere-beach-923721.html

The top court had earlier asked the state police to consider allegations made by the woman and take the probe to its logical conclusion by filing the final report. On Friday, as the Telangana government counsel sought four weeks adjournment, a bench presided over by Justice A M Khanwilkar said, "We deprecate the request." It directed the Home Secretary to personally look into the matter and issue necessary directions to ensure compliance of its direction. "To avoid embarrassment to the state, we refrain from recording the reasons mentioned across the Bar for adjournment. The reasons stated indicated insensitivity with which the investigation is progressing in this case. We say no more at this stage," the bench, also comprising Justice S Ravindra Bhat said. The court posted the matter for consideration in the week commencing December 14. Advocate Alakh Alok Shrivastava, appearing for the petitioner-woman, had earlier said her daughter was a bright, young and intelligent finance professional, having other qualifications. She had joined BHEL in 2009, at a young age of 23 years and served BHEL till her last breath i.e. till October 17, 2019. "The suicide note of the deceased and her last telephonic conversation with her sister, categorically established that her own supervisor and office colleagues subjected her to extreme level of sexual, physical and mental harassment and attempted to rape her, due to which she was forced to commit suicide," the petition claimed. The Telangana police, however, had illegally given clean chit to the accused persons, in their latest report of June 02, 2020, filed before the National Commission of Women (NCW), the petition claimed and sought a CBI enquiry into the entire case to unravel the truth.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-pulls-up-telangana-govt-for-insensitivity-towards-case-of-bhel-officers-suicide-due-to-sexual-harassment-923730.html

Union Minister for Science and Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan on Friday announced that the new centre coming up in Thiruvananthapuram would be named as 'Shri Guruji Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar National Centre for Complex Disease in Cancer and Viral Infection'. RGCB is an autonomous institute of the department of Biotechnology. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted: "'Shri Guruji Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar National Centre for Complex Disease in Cancer & Viral Infection'! What is MSG's contribution to science other than promoting the disease of communalism?" Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging that the new campus should be also named after Rajiv Gandhi. The institute was named after Rajiv Gandhi considering his valuable contribution to the science and technology as well as building up modern India. RSS is an organisation that is widely accused of triggering communal divide and also allegedly involved in communal riots. Hence naming the institute after a RSS leader could not be accepted at all as it would only help in aggravating communalism, he said. CPM Kerala secretary in-charge A Vijayaraghavan termed the decision to name the institute after Golwalkar as an attempt of BJP to bring communal elements to the forefront. CPM politburo member M A Baby alleged that the decision was part of attempts by RSS to trigger communal divide in Kerala and take advantage of it. Golwalkar was one who tried to trigger communal hatred and hence the decision to name new campus of RGCB after him was not at all acceptable, he said. RGCB's new campus being developed in three phases is envisaged as a knowledge centre and hub for mid and high level innovation. The upcoming campus will be a unique knowledge centre and hub for mid and high level innovation, founded on deep and advanced level technical platforms, multi-disciplinary courses that will seed growth and innovation. Dr Vardhan said the new campus would strive to begin a state-of-the art advanced centre for Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics offering cutting edge technologies, therapies, clinical trials for cancer vaccines and immunotherapeutic. It will also have facilities for therapies such as stem cell replacement, Gene therapy, molecular tumor, targeting and imaging.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/golwalkars-name-for-biotechnology-centre-in-kerala-triggers-row-923778.html

According to the police, the girl had initially suffered sexual harassment and in that connection, her statement was recorded by the CWC chairman in October. Later the girl's statement was recorded by a magistrate as part of the investigation in the initial sexual harassment case. It was while giving the statement to the magistrate that the girl mentioned about the sexual harassment she suffered from the CWM chairman while recording her statement. Based on that, a fresh case was registered under section 12 of the POCSO Act on Friday. A former member of a Child Welfare Committee said that earlier also there were allegations regarding the CWCs recording statements of children who suffer sexual harassment. "The committees are only supposed to see if the child who suffered sexual assault need care and protection. But many committees go for detailed statement recording, which itself amounts to harassment," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/child-welfare-committee-chairman-alleged-of-sexually-harassing-minor-girl-in-kerala-923833.html

The investments made for vaccines does not mean shortcuts and huge investments in vaccination trials have enabled processes to happen in parallel to speed up the development, he said, participating in a function through video conference. "Vaccines are administered to healthy people. Therefore, the demand for trials and safety are enormous. A vaccine that is administered has to be safe, has to have an immune response that suggests it can deal with the infection and must be effective in the field", he said at 'Sangam 2020,' the annual flagship event of IIT Madras Alumni Association.  "India has got an extraordinary history of successful vaccinations... India was successful in putting forth vaccines which completely transformed the health care system. Other vaccines like smallpox were administered without much discussion... today the world has changed and everyone rightly discusses and debates everything, as it should be," he said. His comments come at a time when 30 vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are being developed within the country. Five vaccine candidates are under different phases of clinical trials in India. Vijay Raghavan said vaccines are subjected to stringent tests. "Typically, vaccines take 10 years to develop," he said. "There has been a huge amount of investment and investment comes by allowing what could otherwise have gone in series to now go in parallel. You stockpile and manufacture while the trials are going on.. but supposing the trials fail, the whole stockpile has to be dumped", he said. IIT Madras director professor Bhaskar Ramamurthi, speaking on the new normal in education and research in the backdrop of Covid-19 induced lockdown, said 40 per cent of students could not join the classes initially. "Now we are able to make sure everybody is able to attend classes, barring a handful and those cases also have been resolved now", he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/india-has-extraordinary-history-of-bringing-out-successful-vaccines-says-expert-923845.html

Post results on Friday, state unit chief Bandi Sanjay notified chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao of his party's rout in the 2023 assembly polls at the hands of BJP. Two triumphs in two consecutive months has made the BJP, a small player till recently in Telangana, thus raise the bar very high. However, the next 3-4 months would test the saffron party's ability to spread its influence elsewhere in the state, and repeat the success. Various forms of elections – from municipal to assembly by-poll – are required to take place in Telangana in the first half of 2021. Elections to two major municipal corporations – Warangal and Khammam, should be held by March. Two MLC graduate constituency polls are also due early next year. And then the by-elections to the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly polls are necessitated with the death of sitting TRS MLA Nomula Narasimhaiah due to ill health on 1 December. While the alleged neglect of Dubbaka favored the BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao in the rural constituency, in Hyderabad various issues like corruption of some TRS councilors, floods and partial relief distribution became electorally beneficial for the BJP which anyway aggressively campaigned on the communal lines. BJP leaders agree that the road ahead would be challenging for the party especially in rural Telangana, far off from its favorable urban centres. “But the fact is that farmers, and other rural sections are also dejected by the TRS' failed promises like the two bed room scheme, loan waivers, unemployment allowance. We would be fighting the polls accordingly over such matters besides the serious, statewide issues like corruption and the KCR's dynastic rule,” Premender Reddy, general secretary, TBJP tells DH. These series of elections would also help us strengthen up our party organisation from the village, ward level, Reddy says. Political analysts though believe that following the success of its Hindutva themed crusade in Hyderabad, the BJP would be tempted to replicate it everywhere. “The GHMC results have emboldened the BJP. In urban places with Muslim presence like Warangal, Khammam, the party would like to keep targeting what it calls the TRS-AIMIM unholy alliance,” says Jinka Nagaraju, noted political analyst. The BJP's other strategies seem to include encouraging defections of leaders from other parties, especially in those rural areas where it has very limited presence. The BJP is said to be in touch with Congress veteran Jana Reddy, who lost the Nagarjuna Sagar assembly seat narrowly to the TRS in 2018. While Telangana Congress leaders denied such reports, a senior BJP functionary says, “Till the day our party's scarf is accepted publicly, such news of joining should be treated only as speculation.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/first-half-of-2021-to-test-bjps-ability-to-replicate-dubbaka-ghmc-success-elsewhere-in-telangana-923865.html
05-12-2020||South||BJP could have won over 100 seats in GHMC polls if there was more time to campaign: Bandi Sanjay||BJP would have won more than 100 wards if there was more time for campaigning in the just- concluded Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections and the party is ready to cooperate with the TRS government on development, BJP president in Telangana Bandi Sanjay Kumar said on Saturday. Kumar, who held a meeting with the newly-elected BJP corporators along with other BJP leaders, claimed that his party would have won at least 20 seats more if the TRS, election authorities, police and other officials acted impartially. "If there was more time for campaigning, we would definitely have won over 100 seats," Kumar, a Lok Sabha member, told reporters here. The BJP has bagged 48 wards in the 150-ward GHMC, a sharp rise from the four it had won in the last GHMC elections in 2016. The ruling TRS secured 55 wards, a major dip from the 99 wards in 2016. Perturbed over the BJP's victory in the recent bypoll to Dubbak Assembly constituency, TRS president and CM K Chandrashekar Rao conducted the city polls in a hurry, without taking into consideration people's problems (following recent heavy rains), as Rao felt that BJP would emerge stronger if more time is available for the election, Kumar alleged. BJP is ready to cooperate with the TRS government on development, he said. The TRS should give up its "appeasement policies", he said. Kumar said all the BJP candidates who won in the GHMC polls would soon visit the Bhagyalakshmi temple at the Charminar. The temple made it to the news during the GHMC election campaign. Kumar had visited the shrine to take an oath in the name of the goddess to assert that he did not write any letter to the Election Commission urging that the distribution of financial assistance to those affected by rains and flood be stopped. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also visited the temple and offered prayers. Slamming Asaduddin Owaisi, Kumar alleged that the AIMIM president could not condemn the action of an AIMIM MLA in Bihar who wanted to avoid using "Hindustan" (while taking oath as MLA). Claiming that the AIMIM was largely confined to the old city, Kumar asked why the party did not contest in all the wards of GHMC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-could-have-won-over-100-seats-in-ghmc-polls-if-there-was-more-time-to-campaign-bandi-sanjay-923874.html

The incident in the One-Town area, however, triggered panic among the city residents as talk of a mysterious disease afflicting people spread. Deputy Chief Minister (Health) A K K Srinivas (Nani), who represents Eluru, swung into action immediately and visited the local Government General Hospital to take stock of the situation. He said everything was normal and there was no need for panic. "We have collected blood samples and sent them for examination to determine the cause of the disease, Nani said. About 60 per cent of the victims were in the 10-18 age group while others were older". West Godavari district Joint Collector Himanshu Shukla told PTI over phone that a CT scan of the victims was also taken and everything turned out to be normal. This could be a case of viral infection, he said. These people complained of body pains, headache, nausea and symptoms of fits before falling unconscious. But within 10-15 minutes, they became normal and there is nothing serious, Himanshu pointed out. A paediatrician and neurosurgeon were treating the patients and beds have also been readied in the GGH to attend to any emergency, he added. Water samples have been collected from the One-Town area to check whether any contamination caused the sudden outbreak. These cases are sporadic and not widespread even in that particular locality. But we are examining all factors, Himanshu said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/18-faint-after-showing-signs-of-fits-nausea-recover-in-minutes-923875.html

Over one lakh people will benefit from this,” he told DH.  Over the next three years, KHB will require 7,853 acres to develop the new layouts in 98 taluks. A total of 1.13 lakh sites and 3,960 houses will be developed. “People prefer to own sites rather than houses,” Somanna pointed out. Mysuru taluk will get the highest number of sites at 10,300 (Somanna was the minister in charge of the Mysuru district), followed by Dharwad (6,700) and Ballari (6,320). “The project will also cover taluks that are starved for development and are in need of sites and houses,” Housing Secretary Manoj Kumar Meena said.  The project will be funded on a ‘sharing basis’ with which the government said it had found success in the past. “If we develop 20 sites on one acre of land, 10 sites will go to the land owner. KHB is the only one offering this 50:50 sharing. The BDA, for instance, offers 40:60 (40% of a layout for land owners),” Meena explained.  “For farmers, especially, this sharing model works out better than the compensation under the Land Acquisition Act. For us, it helps us get work done faster and we won’t have to spend money on land,” Meena added.  The Housing Department is sitting on assets worth Rs 3,000 crore that will be liquidated to fund the project going forward. “We have corner sites and commercial sites that are reserved to be auctioned as and when we require money,” Meena said.  Housing is one area Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has identified as a priority, what with Karnataka home to 36.69 lakh houseless and siteless families, according to a recent Housing Departmentsurvey.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-government-approves-98-new-housing-layouts-923606.html

In order to ensure better road discipline and deter such violators of traffic laws, stringent actions need to be taken in accordance with law".

It said that the most shocking defeat for the opposition party was its loss in the Nagpur division graduates' constituency, which it held for over five decades. "In the Maharashtra Assembly elections held last year, the BJP had lost two and won three constituencies in Nagpur by a slender margin. Its downfall had begun that time and now it has significantly lost the ground," an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said. Union minister Nitin Gadkari represented the Nagpur graduates' constituency for 25 years and prior to him Gangadhar Fadnavis, father of Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, was the MLC, it said. "But in the RSS fortress, BJP candidate and Nagpur Mayor Sandeep Joshi bit the dust this time. The defeat wasn't surprising since the party's downfall had begun in the Assembly polls. The BJP is divided into Gadkari and Fadnavis camps," it said. "Fadnavis had denied ticket to sitting MLC and Gadkari confidante Anil Sole," the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said. Even in Amravati division teachers' constituency, the BJP lost, it said. "Graduates and teachers voted against the BJP in these elections. In the Dhule Nandurbar local bodies constituency, Amrish Patel, who had defected from the Congress to the BJP, won the election. But it is Patel's personal victory and not that of the BJP," it added. The Marathi daily said that the Pune graduates' constituency was also a BJP stronghold, which was earlier represented by Union minister Prakash Javadekar. It was earlier also held by state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. "When Patil represented the Pune graduates' constituency, he became the state Revenue minister. Now, under his leadership the party lost the Pune teachers' as well as graduates' seats," it said. The Sena lashed out at Patil for saying that the BJP lost because it contested the elections alone. "The BJP was overconfident. It felt that it didn't need anyone and can win alone. Good that it lost," it added. "The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies contested all the seats together genuinely and worked for each other. When the Sena contested with the BJP, it had to face the BJP rebels," it said. In a word of advice to ally Congress, the Sena said that in Nagpur, all factions and rivals of the Congress came together and fought against the BJP unitedly. "If this is done, a miracle like the Nagpur win can happen," it said. The biennial elections to the Upper House were held on December 1. While Congress won the Nagpur graduates' and Pune teachers' constituencies, the NCP won Aurangabad graduates' and Pune graduates' seats. Independent Kiran Sarnaik won Amravati teachers seat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-mlc-polls-overconfident-bjp-losing-ground-says-shiv-sena-923685.html

In recent months, Mumbai’s Filmcity has been in news because of a sort of a tussle between the Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh governments. The Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in UP is developing an ultra-modern Film City in the vicinity of the national capital New Delhi with an aim for “open competition” making the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government react sharply asserting that it would not allow Filmcity to be taken away forcibly. One thing is for sure is that the Maharashtra government needs to upgrade the facilities and put in action the modernisation plan that it has conceived and revised as well. The Filmcity or the Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari is run by the Maharashtra Film, Stage & Cultural Development Corporation Ltd (MMSCDC). The erstwhile Congress-NCP Democratic Front government and the previous BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation have given shape to the modernisation plans that are yet to be put into action. Spread across 521 acres, the Filmcity has practically every possible terrain that one can ask for. It has hills, lakes, bridges, long and winding roads, and a green expanse. Located between the Western Express Highway and Vihar Lake, it is in the vicinity of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which happens to be the only national park in the world to be located within the metropolitan limits. The Filmcity has nearly 40 different outdoor locations,16 well-equipped sound-proof studios and 80 air-conditioned makeup rooms. Recording studios equipped with state-of-the-art dubbing and mixing facilities and editing suites for 16/35 mm films are also available. They also have ready-to-use sound effects and the services of qualified sound recordists. Besides, the Filmcity has also entered into an agreement with Reliance Media Works to offer high-quality colour processing service, digital studio, animation work and VFX and film restoration services within the studio-complex. It also has a tie-up with the Mukta Arts that offers digital facilities. There are several permanent locations such as a temple, church, court, police station, jail, chawl, an ATM centre, car parking, shopping arcade, log hut, cottage, tribal village, multipurpose building exterior suitable for college, hospital and hostel entrances. One of the major issues is to upgrade security. The plan includes the creation of more studios and outdoor locations like a railway station, an airport, and an international teleport for uplinking and downlinking. There are plans to allow tourists in the future and a monumental avenue and a Bollywood museum are also being planned that would showcase the journey of Indian cinema. It would house galleries and memorabilia besides a souvenir shop. Artefacts of pathbreaking and landmark films would also be on display – like costumes and posters. Special walkways would be created so that visitors could see shoots even without disturbing the artistes, technicians and crew. The entrance gate too would be unique and a Bollywood square would also be created. A few hotels and convention centres too are expected to come up within the Filmcity. For tourists, a mock shooting floor would also be created.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-filmcity-catering-to-bollywood-for-nearly-4-decades-923719.html

Cyclones and severe depressions in the Bay of Bengal had delayed the arrival of winter in the state, the official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mumbai said. "With their weakening, several regions in the state have recorded a drop in the minimum temperature. This could be the beginning of the winter season in the state," he said. According to the IMD, the Santacruz observatory in Mumbai on Saturday morning recorded a minimum temperature of 18.4 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest so far this season. The departure from normal temperature was by 1.4 degrees Celsius. The same observatory had on Friday recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, a drop by one degree Celsius from the normal, the official said. On Saturday, some other regions of the state also witnessed a drop in the minimum temperature. Parbhani in the Marathwada region recorded 10.6 degree Celsius, Gondia in the Vidarbha region 10.5 degree Celsius, Nashik in north Maharashtra 11.1 degree Celsius and Satara and Pune in western Maharashtra 13 and 11.5 degree Celsius respectively, the IMD said. The highest departure in temperature was recorded at Parbhani, where it dropped four degrees Celsius below normal, he said. Winter plays a crucial role in the growth of Rabi crops, such as jowar, wheat and green gram and also triggers flowering in mango trees. "For good flowering of mango trees, there needs to be a drop in temperature. This will help the trees bear fruits from February onwards and can be harvested from April in Maharashtra," an agriculture expert said. Maharashtra is a major producer and exporter of Alphonso mangoes in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/winter-onset-mumbai-parts-of-maharashtra-see-drop-in-temperature-923726.html

State PWD Minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota, said this in a statement issued on Saturday. He said that as per the state's demand for vacation of the interim stay on Maratha reservation, the top court's Constitution bench will hear the government's petition on December 9 at 2 pm. "If members of the Maratha community, historians, researchers wish to give suggestions,they should communicate with this coordination committee of lawyers. It will study the suggestions and forward them to the government lawyers appearing in court," Chavan said. In September this year, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of Maharashtra's 2018 law Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act that granted 16 per cent quota to the Maratha community. The government had filed an application seeking vacation of the apex court's stay amid protests from pro-quota organisations. The Bombay High Court, while upholding the Act, had earlier said that 16 per cent reservation was not justified and that the quota shouldn't exceed 12 per cent in jobs and 13 per cent in admissions to educational institutions. The Supreme Court had said that appeals challenging the high court order were required to be considered by a larger bench. Accordingly, the hearing will take place before a five-judge Constitution bench.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-forms-five-lawyer-panel-for-coordination-on-maratha-quota-923761.html

The chief minister made the announcement after reviewing the work at Shivni-Rasulapur in Nandgaon-Khandeshwar taluka of Amravati district. "The Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Samruddhi Expressway will be the best in the country and in the next six months, the road up to Shirdi will be open to traffic," Thackeray said.

The charge sheet also said that Naik, who was under mental stress due to non-payment of dues by the accused, first strangled his mother Kumud, a partner in his business, before hanging himself to death. The police on Friday filed the charge sheet before a court in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district, where the case for alleged abetment of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother has been registered. Besides Goswami, the other two accused named in the charge sheet are Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda. "The victim (Naik) had told them (accused) that he would commit suicide if they don't pay his dues. However, the accused ignored his threat and told him to do whatever he wants," the charge sheet said. "The accused didn't pay his dues, which caused mental stress to Naik. He first strangulated his mother, thinking that she might land in trouble as she was also a partner in his business," it said. Naik later wrote a suicide note and then hanged himself, the charge sheet added. Police said that they have relied on the purported suicide note as the "dying declaration". Naik's handwriting has been matched with the writing in the suicide note and forensic report indicated that he was not under pressure while writing it, police said. Police had earlier said that in his suicide note, Naik, who owned Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd, had claimed that he was ending his life due to non-payment of dues by Goswami, Firoze Sheikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks. Police said that as per the note, the three firms owed Naik's company Rs 83 lakh, Rs four crore and Rs 55 lakh respectively. The court will take cognisance of the charge sheet on December 16, Rahul Agarwal, advocate for one of the accused, said on Saturday. The accused trio has been charged under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 109 (punishment for abetment) and 34 (common intention). As many as 65 persons were named as witnesses in the charge sheet that runs into 1,914 pages. Police have listed statements of family members and staff of Naik, call data records, and information retrieved from electronic devices as evidence in the case. In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had announced that he has ordered a fresh probe in the case after a complaint by Adnya Naik, daughter of the architect Anvay Naik. Goswami, Sheikh and Sarda were arrested by Alibaug police on November 4 in the case, but they got bail from the Supreme Court on November 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/arnab-goswami-others-ignored-anvay-naiks-suicide-threat-chargesheet-923765.html

Among the infected police personnel, two constables have been hospitalised while others are in home isolation, Joint Commissioner of Police (Admin) Ajay Chaudhary told PTI. "We started a drive from Tuesday (December 1) to test all 14,000 police personnel in Ahmedabad. Nearly, 1,000 police personnel are being tested everyday. About 100 personnel have tested positive for the virus so far," Chaudhary said, adding that this is the second drive to test the police personnel in the city.

In a drive conducted around two months ago, 200 police personnel had tested positive for coronavirus, he said. Besides Covid-19 testing, arrangements have also been made for police personnel in the city to get advice from specialised doctors on health issues like blood pressure, diabetes and heart problems through tele-medicine mode, he said. This is being done across all the police stations in Ahmedabad along with the offices of the commissioner and ACPs, Chaudhary said. He said a sanitisation drive covering all the police stations and residences of police personnel is also underway. "There are 32 police lines in the city and 50 police stations. They are being sanitised along with the offices of the commissioner, ACPs, DCPs, crime branch, etc," Chaudhary said.

According to data compiled by Drishti Marine, a private beach management agency hired by the Goa government to maintain beach safety, no fatalities were reported, although in some cases beachgoers stung by the marine animals had to be administered oxygen and first aid at the nearest health facilities. In all, 385 cases of jellyfish sting attacks were reported in Goa since November 15, out of which 302 were reported along beaches in North Goa, while only 83 such incidents occurred in South Goa. The most affected beach stretch in Goa as far as reported cases of jellyfish stings are concerned, is the Baga-Sinquerim strip in North Goa, along which 216 cases were reported. The jellyfish attacks comes at a time when the tourism prospects of Goa -- one of the top beach and nightlife destinations in the country -- are witnessing a revival of sorts ahead of the festive Christmas-New Year season, after the crippling pandemic and lockdown, with tourists slowly trickling into the state. A jellyfish sting often results in mild irritation, but a sting from particularly toxic species of jellyfish can require expert medical care. "Drishti lifesavers posted along the beach have been inundated with first-aid cases related to jellyfish stings. As crowd density along the beach is increasing with the number of tourists entering the state, constant announcements and cautioning is also being carried out by the lifesavers to warn beach goers about the jellyfish in the waters," a statement issued by Drishti Marine said. The lifeguard and beach management agency has also issued an advisory vis-a-vis the menace. The advisory issued by Drishti Marine has urged tourists "to be cautious of the presence of jellyfish that could possibly be present in the waters or along the shoreline". "If stung by a jellyfish inform the nearest lifesaver or approach the lifesaver tower. Wash the stung area with hot water (as hot as you can stand it) as heat further breaks down the toxins. Generously spray the stung area with vinegar. It is known to diffuse any poison that may be more active in the nematocysts present in the tentacles," the advisory also said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/jellyfish-continue-to-sting-goa-tourists-20-cases-reported-per-day-923832.html

Announcing the polling schedule for the ZP polls, Garg also said that the SOPs formulated by the Election Commission of India for recently conducted Bihar state assembly elections would be adopted to conduct the December 12 polls. "The state has around 1,300 Covid-19 positive persons and we have around 1200 polling stations. So it boils down to one (Covid-109 positive) person per polling station. It will not be a problem taking care of one person or two persons who have Covid-19 at each polling station," Garg told a press conference in Panaji. "Approximately 7.91 voters are eligible to cast ballot to the 48 Zilla panchayat constituencies. Voting will be conducted via ballot paper and not electronic voting machines," the top official said. "We will follow all SOPs laid down by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Election Commission of India has already conducted elections in Bihar. We will follow those instructions," the State Election Commissioner also said. "All SOPs issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will be adopted. Voters will have to wear masks in the polling station and maintain a distance of six feet. Sanitisers and handwashing facilities would be made available at every polling booth," Garg also said. The ZP polls in Goa were earlier scheduled to be held on March 22 but had to be postponed after the National Democratic Alliance government announced a pan-India lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Garg also said that candidates appearing for the ZP polls will not be allowed to conduct any public campaigning, because the campaigning process was completed in March itself before the polls were postponed. "Public campaigning will not be allowed from today till polling day. The Model Code of Conduct is already in force," Garg said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-positive-people-to-be-allowed-to-cast-ballot-during-goa-zp-elections-official-923836.html

The FIR was filed on Friday, two days after the newspaper published a news report with photographs claiming that VIP treatment is given to three accused doctors (of fire accident) and instead of keeping them in the lockup, they are allowed to doze off at D (Detection) staff's room. These doctors, associated with Uday Shivanand hospital, were arrested days after a fire accident.  The FIR mentions Mahendrasinh Jadeja, crime reporter, Pratipalsinh Gohil, city reporting head, Prakash Rameshbhai, photographer and Imran Hothi, press reporter as accused who have been booked under various sections of Information and Technology Act, 2000, for obstructing public servant in discharging public functions, among other charges. The FIR has been filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a constable Jignesh Gadhvi. It says that on December 1, the three doctors, accused in the fire accident, were arrested and brought to the police station. It claims that the accused are kept in the lock-up. For questioning, they have been taken to the D staff's room at the station when two journalists and a photographer, named as accused in the FIR, came to the station. The FIR says that they clicked the photos of the lock-up despite being warned that such photography or video recording is not permitted inside the police station. It says that the accused didn't heed the warnings. They went inside the D staffs' room despite being warned, and a day later, the newspaper reported with pictures how the accused are not kept in the lock-up and instead allowed to rest on the sofas. Earlier in May, another journalist had been booked by Vijay Rupani-led BJP government for writing a speculative report on the change of government in the state due to mismanagement of coronavirus pandemic. Recently, the Gujarat High Court quashed the FIR.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-three-journalists-photojournalist-booked-for-exposing-vip-treatment-to-accused-at-police-station-923850.html
