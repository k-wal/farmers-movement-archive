That is the case with the new Cattle Protection Bill brought by the Karnataka government and passed by the state assembly in a hurry last week without a debate. The Opposition parties had walked out in protest against the government's hurry and the lack of consultations over the bill. In the first place, there is already a cattle protection law in the state and the government is again grazing in the same field with sharper teeth, and is pushing its politics with it. The law is much more stringent than the existing one. There is more stringent penalty for violations, ranging from fines going up to Rs 10 lakh and jail terms of up to seven years. The sale and transport of cattle for slaughter is also prohibited.    The most egregious part of the law is the widening of the definition of cattle, which now includes cows, calves, bulls, bullocks and male and female buffaloes under 13 years of age. Every farm animal that is useful to the farmers and is even a part of their lives comes under the purview of the law, and farmers will not be able to sell them. Selling of animals which are past their productive age sustains the farmers’ economy. The maintenance cost of these animals might make farming more unproductive. Farmers would abandon them, as it happens in states like Uttar Pradesh, and they become a threat to the crops. The transport of cattle for any purpose will also become hazardous as that can invite the attention of the police and vigilantes. The powers given to the police for search and seizure on grounds of suspicion of sale and purchase of cattle is bound to be misused. There are legitimate fears  that the law will be used to harass and persecute members of the minority communities and Dalits. Strangely, the law even seeks to give protection to vigilantes by shielding from legal action those who ‘’act in good faith’’ to serve the cause of cattle protection.  The entire idea of the law, just as the idea behind similar laws in other states, militates against the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution to choose one’s profession and means of livelihood. The right to choose one’s food should also be part of that freedom. Beef is a source of cheap nutrition for many, and to deny it to them is wrong. The legality of the law is also doubtful as courts have ruled that cattle over 15 years of age can be sold to slaughterhouses. It is a bad law with bad consequences, and it serves no good cause.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/cattle-protection-this-bill-serves-no-good-cause-927448.html
15-12-2020||In Perspective||Making a case for paternity leave||India has made significant strides in providing maternity leave benefits to the working women but paternity leave remains an overlooked subject.  Most men avail sick leave or casual leave and sometimes even take unpaid time off in the key times of their lives such as the birth of the child. There are no explicit provisions in regard to paternity leave except the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955 and the Central Civil Services Rules, 1972 which provide for paid paternity leave to the Central government employees including a probationer up to 15 days before or up to six months from the date of delivery of the child. However, in the recent times, evolving responsibilities of new fathers are acknowledged with few private companies providing paternity leave benefits to its employees. In the year 2017, Rajeev Satav, Member of Parliament from Maharashtra, moved a private member’s Bill, ‘The Paternity Benefit Bill, 2017’, which laid down a proposal for 15 days of paid paternity leave. Paternity leave also recently gained public attention when mixed responses followed India cricket captain Virat Kohli’s decision to take paternity leave.  This debate definitely calls for serious thought on the present-day relevance of paternity leave. Women are biologically different from men and maternity leave is clearly an equitable approach. But a father’s role in the family and his childcare responsibilities are often disregarded. The social construction of parenting and gender norm expects the mother to be the primary caretaker of the child as well as the household duties while the father is the principal bread-earner of the family. These social constructs of parenthood should change to achieve gender equality at home as well as the workplace. As a matter of fact, working women avail long maternity leave and this weakens their stability in the job market which consequently aggravates gender inequalities in the workplace in the form of gender pay gap as well as in the division of work at the family unit. For that matter, even paternity leave cannot address the problems of gender inequality at home/work as paternity leave is relatively a brief leave availed by the fathers immediately before/after the birth of the child to provide post-natal care and support to the mother and the infant. Parental responsibility is a continuing and long-term responsibility of both the parents which begins from the moment of the birth of the child. The employment laws and policies across the globe have been playing a meaningful role by providing the working parents the right to paid time off to care for their children. According to a report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) of 2014, “Maternity and Paternity at Work - Law and Practice Across the World”, around 79 countries provide for paternity leave benefits to male employees.  There are over 66 countries which provide for shared parental leave ordinarily following the maternity leave period.  Shared parental leave is a longer period of leave than the paternity leave which is available to both working parents permitting them to divide the leave amongst themselves as they prefer. Gender disparity However, the foregoing category of leave defeats the entire purpose when eventually women end up availing higher share of parental leave adding to gender disparity in both the labour market and in the division of work in the family. To circumvent this situation and prevent its misuse, some countries allocate to each parent specified portions of parental leave as separate and non-transferable benefits instead of joint privileges. The paternity leave or parental leave across the globe is funded by contribution made by the employer/employee/both, accompanied by subsidy extended by the government.  The Paternity Benefit Bill, 2017 also proposed for the setting up of the Parental Benefit Scheme Fund to which all the employees (irrespective of gender), employers, the state government and the Central government shall contribute in such percentage as may be prescribed. The statutory recognition of paternity leave is a much-needed reform to the employment law in India as fathers wish to be with their new-born from the moment of the birth as much as the mothers. Besides, India must also explore the option of parental leave, available to both the working parents, to enable them to fulfil their childcare and family responsibilities. Equality between men and women in the labour market can be accomplished only when there is equality in the sharing of childcare and household duties at the family unit.

The next visit was to Manayee in Bommarabettu gram panchayat where three houses were damaged and the crop loss was significant. The team members interacted with the public in the area to know the assistance offered by district administration during emergencies. Besides, they also verified the interim compensation package. Before winding up the inspection tour, the team members visited the damaged vented dam at Kakkuje village in Karkala taluk, a damaged bridge in Nadur village and a damaged road in Jannadi village in Brahmavar. Finally, the team visited the Cyclone shelter in Thekatte in Kundapura. Prior to the visit to flood-affected areas, the team members verified the rescue and rehabilitation measures taken by the district administration during the massive floods in the district. Deputy Commissioner G Jagadheesha said the average rainfall in the month of September in the district is 405 mm. However, the district received 1,022 mm of rainfall.

People from one area have been included in a polling booth situated a few kilometres away from their houses,” he told media persons here, on Monday. The reservations for SC/STs have been announced in those wards where there are no houses of community members. The state government is misusing the administrative machinery in the gram panchayat elections, Kumar alleged. Further, he said candidates were threatened by BJP supporters to withdraw his/her candidature. The BJP is trying different tactics to face the elections. Even MLAs are interfering in the elections, he added. All the illegalities will be brought to the notice of the State Election Commission by the Congress, he added. Stating that the voters are dejected over the BJP rule in the state, Kumar said that he is confident of the victory of Congress-backed candidates in the gram panchayat elections. MLA U T Khader said that people were fed up with BJP government. Voters will support the Congress. After the saffron party came to power, ration cards have not been issued, houses have not been sanctioned, there is confusion over reopening schools and colleges and anti-farmer policy is being implemented.

While two suspects are from Ramanagar and Channarayapatna, 10 others are from various areas in Bengaluru. Weapons used for the crime, two cars and a motorbike have been seized, according to Superintendent of Police, R Srinivas Gowda. According to police, four more are still at large. Personal enmity is said to be the reason behind the murder. The deceased Lingaraja and one of the accused Mohan were trying to dominate each other to gain more power. Mohan, who thought that he can dominate real estate mafia if Lingaraja was dead, hatched a plan with his gang and murdered him at Kammaravalli, on December 8. Lingaraja was staying in Shantinagar in Bengaluru and was into real estate business. He was also involved in many crimes, including murder. He returned to Kammaravalli during the lockdown. The accused had even removed the DVR of the CCTV cameras installed at his house in Kammaravalli, to destroy evidences, the SP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/12-arrested-for-murder-of-history-sheeter-927630.html

According to the forest department personnel, the fire mishap is man-made, as thousands of devotees had visited Muthathiraya temple, as part of the last Karthika Somavara, on Monday. A matchstick thrown by one of the visitors, after smoking, while returning from the temple, might have led to the fire, the officials suspected. The fire, spotted atop the hill, started spreading fast. The people, who spotted the fire, alerted the forest department officials.

But, this year, Mysureans are missing carol singing competitions of students that heralds Christmas celebrations, the aroma of freshly baked cakes wafting in the air from popular bakeries and other activities. Along with misty mornings and chill air, December brings the mood of joy and celebrations, and people are eager to bid farewell to the passing year and welcome the New Year. But, the action is missing, with the fear of Covid still lingering. The organisers are in a dilemma and have got into a slow mode, as it is mandatory to follow Covid norms. Speaking to DH, Mohammed of Aroma Bakery said that they are under confusion of organising the cake festival. Aroma Bakery at Loyal World in Vontikoppal has been organising cake shows every year. Mohammed said that they don't want to stop the annual event and are planning to bake a huge cup cake, aiming for a Guinness record. However, a decision will be taken in a couple of days, he said. Vijay Kumar, secretary, Mysore Diocesan Educational Society said, "Carol singing competition that was usually organised in a grand manner is not being held this year, due to Covid risk. But, online and pre-recorded competitions will be held for school teachers and Churches, from December 19." He said that Christmas celebrations would be simple this year, similar to other religious festivals that are being held since the last few months, abiding by the government's instructions. The churches will restrict the number of people and will hold mass prayers at different times, for the benefit of devotees, he said. It may be mentioned that the first-ever Christmas carnival was held last year, on December 21 and 22, on the premises of St Philomena's Church in Mysuru and was a great hit among the people. From boutiques to food stalls selling mouth-watering dishes, cake shops, dance, carols, games, skit, music, dress like Santa, Christmas tree decoration and many entertainment programmes were held. Soumya, a homemaker, said, "We usually keep aside our December for family members and friends, who have settled abroad as it is the time they visit for holidays. But this year, due to Covid, only a few are expected to visit and thus, parties have been postponed for next year."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-fear-scales-down-christmas-celebrations-no-winter-fest-in-mysuru-927716.html
15-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka Council session ruckus: BJP-JD(S) moves Raj Bhavan||The BJP-JD(S) combine petitioned Governor Vajubhai R Vala on Tuesday following the ruckus in the Legislative Council, making it the second time that Raj Bhavan is being approached in less than a week on the functioning of the upper house. The BJP and JD(S) MLCs sought Vala’s intervention to get the Council re-convened after Shetty adjourned it sine die amid the disorderly scenes. On December 11, too, the BJP had knocked on Vala’s doors. The bone of contention is that Shetty is stalling a no-confidence motion that has been moved against him. In their petition, the BJP and JD(S) MLCs quoted Article 182 of the Constitution, according to which a Chairman shall not preside over the House if a no-confidence motion is moved. “It would be the Deputy Chairman who shall preside,” the petition stated, accusing Shetty of “gross misuse” of his power. The petition also discredited Shetty’s rejection of the notice to move the motion on the ground that it did not disclose any specific charges against him. “In an earlier case including that of (D H Shankaramurthy), no reasons were assigned. As a matter of fact in this case there were specific allegations made relating to the Chairman’s partisan attitude in conduct of the House,” it said, pointing out that Shetty cannot determine the ‘correctness’ of a motion made expressly against him. Congress MLCs M Narayanaswamy and Nazir Ahmed, who “forcibly assaulted the Deputy Chairman and took him away from the chair” have been named in the petition, adding that they “brought great disrespect and disgrace” to the Legislative Council.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-council-session-ruckus-bjp-jds-moves-raj-bhavan-927664.html

Addressing a news conference, Siddaramaiah said such “goondagiri” was unprecedented in the history of Karnataka’s legislature. Reading out provisions from the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Karnataka Legislative Council, Siddaramaiah said there was no validity in the no-confidence motion that the BJP wanted to move “Once a notice to move the motion is rejected, it dies. There’s no scope to bring it up again,” Siddaramaiah said. “The notice to move the motion should be given 14 days earlier. Once the notice is admitted, it shall be discussed within five days. Here, the notice itself got rejected because it was not in order,” he pointed out. “According to Kaul and Shakdher, the notice should be accompanied with evidence for the charges being levelled (against the Chairman),” he explained. Siddaramaiah said Council chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty was “very much present” in the House. “The quorum bell was still ringing, but they locked the door to prevent the chairman from entering. Such goondas! Is this Modi’s democracy,” he asked. Hitting out at Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan and Law Minister JC Madhuswamy for inciting the unruliness, Siddaramaiah said: “After the House was adjourned sine die, Madhuswamy threatened the marshall. Is this democracy?” Siddaramaiah rejected the BJP’s claims that Congress MLCs behaved like goondas. “Where have we done goondagiri? Should the House not run as per rules? That the deputy chairman took the seat itself was illegal. Locking the door to prevent the chairman from entering the House, isn’t that goondagiri?” he said, adding that even JD(S) MLCs partook in the goondagiri. “The BJP,” Siddaramaiah said, “has once again established that they don’t have any respect for democracy, rules of business and law of the land.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-legislative-council-ruckus-clp-chief-siddaramaiah-quotes-rules-says-bjp-leaders-are-goondas-927688.html

In 2017, the ruling Congress moved a no-confidence motion against Shankaramurthy, the then Council chairperson. This was unprecedented in the Legislative Council. During the motion, Shankaramurthy vacated the chair and sat as a member. Deputy Chairperson Marithibbegowda of the JD(S) conducted the proceedings. In a dramatic fashion, Shankaramurthy defeated the no-trust motion by a single vote. Then, too, the JD(S) backed the BJP, leaving the Congress embarrassed. Shankaramurthy got 37 votes, including 23 of the BJP, 12 of the JD(S) and two votes from the five Independents in the 75-member Council. The Congress managed 36 votes, including 33 of its own and the other three Independents.

15-12-2020||Main Article||Saving farmers: Why no co-operatives?||The travails of the farmers in the context of the new farm laws passed by the Centre have the entire country worried as farmers are our ‘Annadatas’ and if they suffer, all are bound to suffer too. What possibly is the genuine way to help them survive? One story from 1946 probably shows us the way. Back then, there was a strike by dairy farmers of Kaira in Gujarat, very similar to the farmers’ protests happening currently. The story goes that Polson dairy in Anand, Gujarat, had complete rights to supply milk to then ‘Bombay’ under the Bombay Milk Scheme. Polson allegedly procured milk from farmers at very low rates to sell to the Bombay government. The dairy farmers objected to the arbitrary fixing of the price of milk by Polson dairy and the share taken by the middlemen. The dairy farmers asked the government for permission to set up a co-operative with their own pasteurisation plant and also demanded that the government buy milk directly from their union. When the government turned down these demands, the farmers decided to go on a ‘milk strike’ and suspended milk supply to Bombay, which went “without a drop of milk” from Anand for 15 days. The government capitulated after this resilient show and officially recognised the Kaira Union as the milk supplier to Bombay. Thus, with the setting up of the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union, began the co-operative movement of small dairy farmers in Gujarat. In 1949, Verghese Kurien, later known as the ‘Milkman of India’, took charge of the co-operative movement and revolutionised the Indian dairy industry. Kurien’s simple method was that of offering lakhs of small dairy farmers the Anand pattern of having a dairy co-operative society at the village level federated at the district and state levels for collecting, procuring, processing and marketing milk and milk products, now well-known under the brand name, ‘Amul’. This successful co-operatised model replicated nationally through ‘Operation Flood’ gave us our own ‘Nandini’ brand in Karnataka. This enabled India to become one of the world’s largest producers of milk today. The successful model of ‘Amul’ is before our very eyes. Why is the government not helping the 85% small farmers growing food crops co-operatise themselves and gain bargaining power in similar fashion which will lead to their prosperity, similar to that of the dairy farmers? Can the current protesters too demand the government’s support for this? Instead, the three new farm laws are placing the small farmers at the mercy of corporates, similar to Polson dairy. Experts have pointed out that what the small farmers growing food crops lack currently are mandis within accessible distance, like the village-level milk collection centres. This deficiency forces them to sell to middlemen at prices lower than the MSP as it is uneconomical for them to transport their small output to the few and distant APMC yards. It is only by forming unions with other small farmers, like the dairy farmers, that they can achieve the economies of scale needed to transport their produce from the villages to district procurement centres, and market their products at state level. They also need to gain bargaining power by collectively building cold storage godowns and warehouses to store their excess produce until prices improve and also set up food processing centres which convert their unsold or perishable produce into value-added products, so that they need not dump them on the highways when they fail to get remunerative prices. The BJP manifesto However, one is hearing nothing of this from the government. But, one will be surprised to know that the BJP manifesto for the 2019 elections had promised the same and had nothing about the three farm bills! It says: “We recognize the role co-operatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play in ensuring better market linkages and opportunities in the agricultural sector and we are committed to support and strengthen them. We will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure economies of scale for farmers regarding access to inputs and markets.” The manifesto goes on: “We will build an efficient storage and transport mechanism for agriculture produce. To enable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an appropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce.” The manifesto further says, “Our Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana highlights our focus on warehousing as a means of increasing farmers’ income.” Why then has the BJP, which came to power on the basis of this manifesto, passed three laws which were not there in that document and are the total opposite of what they had promised? The new laws do mention FPOs in passing. But the state’s role in supporting and incentivising the efforts of the farmers to form FPOs and build the necessary collection, transportation, storage and processing infrastructure owned by the farmers themselves is nowhere mentioned.Hence, it will not be the FPOs but the corporates who will procure the farmers’ produce at the village level at prices that they will set. The corporates will build the storage godowns and hoard as much produce as they can until they can sell it at a price that is profitable for them. Is the manifesto then the usual “jhumla”? And if the corporates are sure of giving higher prices than the MSP, why not make MSP the minimum price for all trade? Instead of helping small farmers gain “Atmanirbharta” by implementing the promises made in the manifesto, the new laws are promoting the ‘Sarkari Nirbharta’ of the corporates by helping them become the new middlemen who will merely replace the cartelised middlemen in the APMC mandis.

The infection count now stands at 9,02,240 and the toll 11,954. While India's trajectory of active cases continues to follow a steadily dipping path, the drop in state numbers on Sunday was attributed to reduced testing. Only 64,855 tests were conducted, out of which 5,254 were Rapid Antigen Tests. The last time the state had similar testing figures was on October 25 and 26, when 63,892 and 66,701 samples were tested respectively. On weekdays, the state usually tests more than a lakh samples. Testing numbers are low over the weekends. The state’s positivity rate is 1.27% while the recoveries have reached 8,74,202. Intensive Care Units are currently treating 254 patients. Lowest in 149 days  India’s active Covid caseload further contracted to 3.52 lakh, the lowest in 149 days, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday.  The daily recoveries exceeding new cases has ensured a total net reduction of the active caseload.

Party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement through a digital address where he pitched AAP as a party with "honesty and intent", qualities which he alleged the other parties in the state do not have and take forward the state.  He sought to pitch his government's "achievements" in Delhi as the base for entering the electoral battle in the state, currently ruled by Yogi Adityanath-led BJP and where the Opposition appeared in disarray. Kejriwal's announcement also comes a couple of months after the AAP made it clear that it will be contesting all the seats in the elections to the Uttarakhand Assembly in 2022. The AAP had not contested the 2017 Assembly elections, while it garnered 0.01% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when it contested three out of 80 seats. The Opposition in Uttar Pradesh is a divided lot with Samajwadi Party, BSP and Congress looking the separate way. Samajwadi Party and Congress were in alliance in the Assembly elections while in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, SP and BSP fought together. However, the parties have gone separate ways after these elections and have indicated that there is no chance for a coming together. AAP has hit the ground some time ago with party in-charge Sanjay Singh leading several campaigns against the Adityanath government. Singh was slapped with cases, including those under sections related to sedition in the Indian Penal Code. "AAP will contest the 2022 Assembly polls in UP. Since the time the AAP government was formed for the third time in Delhi, many people who belong to UP and are residing in Delhi came to me. They and several organisations are requesting that AAP should fight elections in UP. They want all the services which are offered in Delhi to be offered in UP," Kejriwal said. "On asking them about how a small party like AAP will take this up, they said that the people of Uttar Pradesh are fed up with these old parties. The people of UP will come forward to support AAP and to defeat these big leaders who consider UP as their property," he said. Claiming that "dirty politics and corrupt leaders" are stopping UP from walking on the path of development, he said they stabbed the people in their back while breaking all records of corruption. "Why do the people of UP travel to Delhi for every major and minor facility? If a family living in Kanpur has to send their child to a good college, they have to send him/her to Delhi. If a person living in Gorakhpur has to get good medical treatment for his/her parents, they have to come to Delhi. Why?" he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aap-to-contest-uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-in-2022-927550.html

On Tuesday, farmers' agitation entered the 20th day as several rounds of talks with the BJP government have resulted in a deadlock. The protesters continue to demand complete repeal of the new farm laws while the Centre has only offered amendments insisting that the laws are here to stay.  The Union Transport Minister said, without including all the farmers, that some person belonging to the Naxalite movement was seen at the protests.  In a separate interview, he said that the farmers should "understand" the laws and that the government is open to their suggestions.  "Farmers should come and understand these laws. Our government is dedicated to farmers and is ready to accept the suggestions given by them. There will not be any injustice with farmers in our government," he told the news agency ANI. The government had alleged that "ultra-left" and "pro-Left Wing Extremist elements" were hijacking the protests and there will be cases of arson and damage to public property. The farmers, however, continued to maintain that the protests were peaceful and apolitical.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protests-used-by-some-elements-to-defame-the-farmers-says-nitin-gadkari-927567.html

Addressing the UN General Assembly special session on Covid-19, Secretary (West) in India’s Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup said on Monday the ongoing coronavirus crisis had "laid bare" the gaps that exist in global cooperation and governance structures of multilateral organisations. "It is important that we make reformed multilateralism our guiding principle. It is imperative that we must join hands to show leadership, solidarity and collaboration to deal with the pandemic. We can respond best by collaboration, not confusion; preparation, not panic and coming together, not growing apart," he said. "As a responsible member of the international community, I want to reiterate that India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis. India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capabilities for the delivery of vaccines," Swarup said at the resumed special session. World leaders, top UN leadership and vaccine developers addressed the high-level special session early this month on Covid-19 and discussed impact of the pandemic, as well as the multifaceted, coordinated response required to address the crisis. Swarup told the UN session that to combat the pandemic, India has several vaccines, which are under different stages of development. Indian vaccine candidates COVAXIN and ZyCoV-D are under phase three and phase two trials, while Indian vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India is already conducting final testing of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca COVISHIELD vaccine, he said. "India is recognised as a world leader in vaccines, as we produce 60 per cent of vaccines globally and have a record of supplying high quality, affordable vaccines to the developing world," he said. "During the unprecedented crisis faced by the world, India emerged as a net provider of health security and successfully shouldered its responsibility as the pharmacy of the world, sending consignments of medicines and medical supplies to almost 150 partner countries,” he said. Swarup stressed that while it was heartwarming to note that efforts to combat the pandemic had yielded positive results, there is still a long way to go. "No one is safe till everyone is safe. This should be our mantra. In this context, the role of the United Nations becomes important towards coordinated and concerted efforts to deal with the multi-dimensional impacts of the pandemic," he said. Highlighting India's “timely and proactive” response to the pandemic, Swarup said calculated measures by the country were designed not just to protect its huge population from the pandemic but also to ensure that minimal damage is caused to the economy. He said the initial phases of the lockdown gave India the critically needed time to ramp up its healthcare system and equip it with sufficient hospital beds, isolation facilities, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), testing kits and other medical devices as well as with trained medical staff across the country. Within two months of the pandemic, India expanded its diagnostic facilities from just one major facility for pan-India testing to more than 2,000 today. From having almost no domestic manufacturing of PPE kits, India today has become the second largest manufacturer of PPEs, he added. More than 17,000 dedicated Covid-19 facilities were set up with 1.6 million isolation beds and digital tools such as the Aarogya Setu app were developed and are being effectively used for extensive contact tracing, he said. Swarup said the government had also been doing its best to ensure that the economy and the livelihoods of the people are not adversely hampered. The Narendra Modi government announced a massive USD 266 billion stimulus package, amounting to almost 10 per cent of India’s GDP directed at helping low income groups, marginal farmers, small businesses, migrants and those in the informal sector.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/collaboration-not-confusion-is-best-response-to-covid-19-pandemic-india-at-un-927575.html

Pointing fingers at at "some political parties" who are 'misguiding' farmers, the party told its state units to consolidate its social media presence and use it proactively to promote the laws and "publicise the trend and hashtag to be given by Centre," the report cited. By showing the benefits of the farm laws and reaching out to farmer communities, the government at the Centre also wants to show that some farmers are in favour of these reforms. The attempt by BJP to go on a massive campaign comes at the back of farmers occupying the borders at Singhu and Tikri for the twentieth day in a row. Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-asks-state-units-to-step-up-outreach-social-media-presence-to-counter-protests-report-927595.html

He asked the court to pass a direction saying that his review petition against the order of conviction passed on August 14 and the sentence on August 31 be heard after his writ petition was adjudicated upon. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai, and Krishna Murari is scheduled to take up his review petitions on Wednesday. Bhushan's writ petition, filed earlier on September 12, sought the right to an intra-court appeal for a person convicted of criminal contempt by the top court, before a larger and different bench.  It also sought framing rules and guidelines providing for intra-court appeal against conviction in the original criminal contempt cases. On September 14, Bhushan again filed an application for urgent hearing of his writ petition, saying its outcome will have a direct and substantial bearing on the adjudication of the review petition. "Despite prayers in that petition having a direct bearing on this review petitions that matter has not been listed before this court whereas instant and connected review petitions have been suddenly listed for hearing on December 16, 2020," his application read.

The report is based on a survey conducted by QS IGAUGE, which rates colleges and universities in India with complete operational control held by the London-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), which comes out with coveted global university rankings. Over 1,700 faculty member from across the country participated in the Faculty Academic Review for Excellence (FARE), 2020 survey. "It is important to note that online teaching during the pandemic is not the same as the one before Covid-19. The added emotional baggage of uncertainty along with concerns around physical and psychological health, job security, finances and many more are bound to have an adverse impact and make the sudden, and for many a rather unwelcome, transition to online teaching," the report said. "At least 46 per cent of the surveyed faculty members said they have been striving hard to manage by learning continually to improve their digital competencies and skills which has resulted in extreme tiredness and draining out of energy levels," it added. The report has cited factors such as being under constant observation while teaching through an unfamiliar medium with totally new tools, difficulty in engaging learners and getting them to respond and collaborate during lessons, and assessing the learning outcomes as major challenges being faced by teachers during the period. "The transition to online classes has not been easy for teachers, and keeping them all safe in cyberspace has been a huge challenge. While approximately 9 pc of the respondents stated that they have witnessed a sharp increase in their stress and anxiety levels, 52 per cent reported a moderate increase in anxiety levels post the shift to online teaching," it said. According to the report, a significant proportion of faculty responded positively, stating their rapport has improved with the students (41 per cent), colleagues (43 per cent) and administration (41 per cent). "While a similar proportion of respondents indicated no such change, 17.4 per cent faculty members stated that their rapport with students has worsened post the shift to online teaching. The response to deteriorated rapport with colleagues was at 8 per cent and the administration at 9.9 per cent," it said. "The data also revealed that 30 per cent of the respondents lacked technical know-how, digital skills, virtual learning resources, etc while 70 per cent of the respondents emerged victorious when they managed to proudly sit before a laptop to teach their remote learner in the online class," the report added. Universities and colleges were closed in the country in the middle of March this year to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25. While the central government has permitted phased reopening of educational institutions as per the local situation of Covid-19, majority teaching-learning activities continue to be online.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/46-of-faculty-in-indian-colleges-striving-hard-to-manage-teaching-during-covid-19-qs-report-927612.html

Harnessing its vast coastline, Gujarat is taking a significant step towards transforming seawater to potable drinking water with the upcoming desalination plant at Mandvi in Kutch district, an official said. This desalination plant, with 10 crore litre per day capacity (100 MLD), will strengthen water security in Gujarat by complementing Narmada Grid, Sauni network and treated waste water infrastructure, he said. It will be an important milestone for sustainable and affordable water resource harvesting in the country. Nearly 8 lakh people across the regions of Mundra, Lakhpat, Abdasa and Nakhatrana talukas will receive desalinated water from this plant, which will also help in sharing the surplus to upstream districts of Bhachau, Rapar and Gandhidham. It is one of the five upcoming desalination plants in Gujarat besides those at Dahej (100 MLD), Dwarka (70 MLD), Ghogha Bhavnagar (70 MLD) and Gir Somnath (30 MLD). The Hybrid Renewable Energy Park near Vighakot village in the district will be the country's largest renewable energy generation park. It will lead to the generation of renewable energy to the tune of 30 GW. Spread over 72,600 hectares of land, the park will have a dedicated hybrid park zone for wind and solar energy storage, as well as exclusive zone for wind park activities. Modi also laid the foundation stone of a fully automated milk processing and packing plant at Sarhad Dairy at Anjar. The plant will cost Rs 121 crore and have the capacity to process two lakh litre milk per day, an official release said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gujarat-pm-lays-foundation-stones-for-energy-park-milk-plant-927614.html

He said that during April-September 2020, FDI increased 13 per cent to about $40 billion. "FDI inflows into India have been continuously growing. Even during the first nine months of this year, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic , our FDI has grown and we have today one of the most facilitative and congenial FDI policies in the world," he said at CII's Partnership Summit 2020. The minister said that 100 per cent FDI is allowed through automatic route in almost all sectors. For certain sectors such as telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors. There are nine sectors where FDI is prohibited and that are lottery business, gambling and betting, chit funds, Nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco. Under the government approval route, foreign investors have to take prior approval of the respective ministry/department. Through the automatic approval route, the investor just has to inform the RBI after the investment is made. Further, the minister invited investors to invest in India as the country holds opportunities in several areas. "India is a land of opportunities. I invite you to board the bus of development, growth and prosperity...We welcome you with open arms, a red carpet and assure you our complete assistance, partnership and involvement through your journey in this land of opportunities," he added. Speaking at the summit, Ville Tapio Skinnari, Finland's Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, said: "I would like to encourage India to continue on the path for deeper economic reforms and open economy". On the proposed free trade agreement between India and the European Union, Skinnari said both sides should set a time for a high-level dialogue to discuss differences about the pact as soon as possible. "For the European Union, the most  topical issue is investment protection. An agreement would greatly add to the predictability of the Indian business environment and contribute to economic growth ," he added. The proposed trade pact between the two sides has been stalled since May 2013 as both sides have yet to iron out differences over several issues.

Twenty days on, life has settled into a routine for protesting farmers who are devising ways to crack the code of living through an agitation with no immediate end in sight. When they are not raising slogans demanding a repeal of the new farm laws or listening to speeches, the protesters, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are familiarising themselves with their new way of life at Delhi's gateways. Some farmers at Singhu border, ground zero of the snowballing protests against the Centre’s new agri laws, have been there from the beginning and some a few days. The vast protest site on the stretch of road – the main access point for those coming into Delhi from Punjab – is almost beginning to feel like home, several of them said. It's a cross-section of people, young and old, men and women. Bicchittar Singh, 62, who has been camping at the Delhi-Haryana border since November 27, said he has been attending ‘kirtans’ at the protest site every day, in the morning and in the evening. “After sitting through the 'paath', I usually take a walk for a few kilometres to keep the muscles working in this cold,” he said. Bicchittar Singh is among the first batch of 32 people who came to the border from Patiala in two trucks and two trolleys towards the beginning of the protest. They have been sleeping on makeshift beds, mattresses and plastic sheets placed between two trucks. A tarpaulin sheet over the two trucks provides shade and some relief from the dipping temperatures. The younger people in the group, like 30-year-old Kulwinder Singh, engage in activities that are physically more demanding to make up for the labour they put in their fields. “Our exercise used to happen naturally when we worked in our fields. Now that it is not happening any more, I go running every morning, and then do 'kasrat' (exercise). “For most part of the day, I listen to our leaders' speeches here. In the evening, I am usually on my phone checking news updates about our protest,” Kulwinder Singh said. Gurpreet Singh, 22, from Moga in Punjab, has been demonstrating at the Singhu border for the the last eight days. “If the government thinks we will go back in a few days, it is simply fooling itself. This site has started feeling more like home than our own village. If the government doesn't meet our demands, we might just make our own huts and start living here,” Gurpreet Singh said. When not protesting actively, he said he spends his time just like he would do back home — serving food at ‘langars’ in the day and attending religious sermons in the evening. Navjot Singh, 25, has left his entire family behind in his village in Punjab’s Sangrur district and spends a considerable amount of time talking to his parents and sister on video calls “My parents and my little sister are back home and I miss them. Thankfully, the internet here is good, so I have a chat with them every now and then,” Navjot Singh said. He said he came to Singhu, one of the several border points in the city under siege from protesting farmers, about a week ago and has been staying in a makeshift tent provided by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. His co-habitant in the tent is 58-year-old Jaswinder Singh from Amritsar, who spends hours reading the newspaper, cover to cover. "I am not so good at watching videos on the mobile phone, so I read the Punjabi newspapers that are given to us here as 'sewa'. "It is important to keep ourselves updated about our agitation and what the government has been saying about us,” Jaswinder Singh said. On Monday, 33 farmer leaders went on a daylong hunger strike to draw the government's attention to their cause, after five rounds of talks with the government failed to yield results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/exercise-reading-and-sewa-farmers-crack-code-of-protest-life-miles-from-home-927623.html

According to the bi-annual Mood of the Consumer Survey by LocalCircles, in close to nine months of the pandemic, many consumers are yet to recover from the giant-fall in their personal finance amid job losses and salary cuts. "Of 8,240 responses, 68 per cent consumers said their household savings declined in the last 8 months during the Covid-19 pandemic," said the survey done to assess consumers spending behaviour during the festive season, spending plans for the next four months, and household’s expectation regarding earnings and savings situation by March. The survey received more than 44,000 responses from consumers across 302 districts of India. 62 per cent of respondents were men and 38 per cent were women. As many as 55 per cent of respondents were from tier I, 26 per cent from tier II, and 19 per cent from tier III, IV and rural districts. However, nearly 50 per cent of consumers have plans to spend on buying discretionary products or assets in the next four months, the survey noted. "One of the big takeaways is that 10 per cent of respondents plan to spend over Rs 50,000 on discretionary purchases in the next four months while 21 per cent of respondents plan to spend between Rs 10,000-50,000 in this period. This would mean good news for many sectors of the economy who saw a slowdown in consumer demand in the first six months of FY 20-21," it said. However, with the economic recovery seen in the last 3 months, there is clearly a rise in optimism and 15 per cent fewer households now expect their FY 20-21 earnings to decline in comparison to last year. While for the majority of the households, the earnings this year will be lower than last year, it said, adding, the real story is in the reduction of uncertainty about the future. Many consumers are now confident that though this year has been impacted, they haven't lost their job and things are getting back on track with their business or employer's business, and they will likely see their earnings increase or go back to previous year levels, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/decline-in-household-savings-due-to-covid-19-survey-927624.html

The survey covered 22 states and UTs in the country. Andhra Pradesh (12.6 per cent), Assam (11.7 per cent), Bihar (11 per cent), Tripura (21.9 per cent), West Bengal (16.4 per cent) reported the highest number of women aged 15-19 years who were already mothers or pregnant at the time of the National Family Health Survey-5. The NFHS-5 is being conducted on 6.1 lakh sample households, involving household-level interviews to collect information on population, health, family planning and nutrition related indicators. Bihar (40.8 per cent), Tripura (40.1 per cent) and West Bengal (41.6 per cent) were among the states where the highest number of surveyed women aged 20-24 years reported to have been married before they turned 18, which is the legal age for marriage. Assam (31.8 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (29.3 per cent), Gujarat (21.8 per cent), Karnataka (21.3 per cent), Maharashtra (21.9 per cent), Telangana (23.5 per cent) and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu (26.4 per cent) were other states and UTs where high number of women aged 20-24 years reported to have been married before they turned 18, the survey said. Meanwhile, men who got married before the legal age of 21 were much lower in nearly all the surveyed states and UTs in comparison to women. Assam (21.8 per cent), Bihar (30.5 per cent), Gujarat (27.7 per cent), Tripura (20.4 per cent), West Bengal (20 per cent) and Ladakh (20.2 per cent) were among states and UTs where comparatively higher percentage of men aged 25-29 years got married before turning 21, the survey said. The NFHS results of 17 states and five UTs (Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Mizoram, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu) have been released now as Phase-I.

15-12-2020||National||Security agencies fear 'crazy' yaba may find ground in India||A sharp rise in the smuggling of yaba or 'crazy medicine' drug tablets -- almost double than the much-abused Phensedyl cough syrup -- along the country's eastern front with Bangladesh has alarmed security agencies, prompting them to tweak their strategy for curbing the new menace, according to government reports and officials. A dossier prepared by a central security organisation notes that while India at present is a "transit" territory for the circular-shaped and red-coloured drug, its "increased inflow clearly indicates that it is just a matter of time for such an addictive drug to gain a foothold in India". It adds that Indian smugglers, involved in illegal Phensedyl transport, are "now shifting" to yaba due to high demand and profitability. "The concern of the security, intelligence and anti-narcotics agencies against yaba transit for cross-border smuggling and use within our territory has specifically grown after witnessing the seizure figures of the last two years. "The development is alarming but the agencies are prepared," a senior Union home ministry official told PTI. According to data compiled by the India-Bangladesh international border guarding force BSF, over 7.22 lakh yaba tablets were seized by its teams along the front last year as compared to over 3.08 lakh bottles of Phensedyl that used to be main drugs to be smuggled across to the neighbouring country. This year, uptil November, the Border Security Force seized over 6.65 lakh yaba tablets as compared to about 5 lakh Phensedyl bottles. In previous years, total Phensedyl (a codeine-based cough syrup abused as an intoxicant in Bangladesh) smuggling volumes were always much higher than yaba. Yaba has many aliases like Thai name 'crazy medicine', 'madness drug' or 'Nazi speed' and is a combination of stimulants, the most important being methamphetamine and caffeine.  It is stated to be manufactured in labs based in Myanmar using raw material sourced from China and is smuggled to Bangladesh from its border or through India. The dossier said Bangladesh and Myanmar share a 270-km border and a large part falls along the river Naf from where the smuggling of yaba is "mainly carried out". The drug is consumed in many ways like smoking it off a tinfoil, 'chasing the dragon' technique of inhaling its fumes by heating on an aluminium foil, taken orally or crushed and snorted. Officials say the drug is especially targeted at the youth and its abuse leads to anxiety, aggression and prolonged exposure may lead to varied levels of damage to kidneys, heart, liver and the brain. Bangladesh has come down heavily on yaba peddlers and syndicates over the last few years by arresting and neutralising many such operatives and they seek an active assistance of Indian authorities to curb the smuggling at every bilateral meeting forum, a senior anti-narcotics agency officer told PTI. The BSF, as per two senior officials, has issued fresh directives to its border patrols to check its smuggling along the 4,096-km long front after the drug was recovered in areas where it was "never seized" like West Bengal. "Unfenced and riverine border areas are most vulnerable for yaba smuggling as it is easy to conceal the tablets on the body or in goods being taken across to Bangladesh. "Drug mules bring yaba from various places in Myanmar through Champhai and Aizwal in Mizoram to Agartala and finally to Bangladesh. Some other routes are also being used," a BSF officer said. The border troops, he said, have been asked to increase manual frisking of suspects, re-work their intelligence gathering and interception techniques even as more women personnel are being deployed on routes to search ladies, children and their belongings. "The BSF has assured its Bangladeshi counterpart that all steps will be taken to crush this menace," the officer added. "The routes that were earlier infamous for Phensedyl, cattle and IMFL smuggling are now being used for yaba smuggling," a security officer said quoting the proceedings of a recent multi-agency intelligence sharing meeting said. He said the profit margin in the smuggling of this drug is high and hence couriers and narco networks are increasingly "shifting" to it against dealing in other drugs like Phensedyl. Yaba is sold anywhere from Rs 150-1000 per piece as per quality and demand, they said. In Bangladesh, its price ranges from Taka 300-500 and sometimes more, officials say. Trans-border smugglers active in Tripura are also "switching" from cannabis to yaba due to the incentives of the illegal trade, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/security-agencies-fear-crazy-yaba-may-find-ground-in-india-927636.html

Through a notification, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) extended the deadline for completion of such investigations by authorities, like DGAP, under section 171 of GST Act, till March 31, 2021. In September, CBIC had extended the deadline till November 30, 2020. Section 171 of GST Act deals with anti-profiteering measures. Under the GST law, a National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) and a Standing Committee on anti-profiteering have been set up to examine complaints of not passing on tax rate cut benefits to consumers. GST was rolled out on July 1, 2017. Directorate General of Anti Profiteering (DGAP) investigates profiteering complaints and submits report to NAA, which passes the final order. DGAP is mandated to complete the investigation within a period of six months of the receipt of the reference from the Standing Committee, which can be further extended by three months. The GST rules also specify that NAA shall, within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of the report from DGAP, determine whether a registered person has passed on the benefit of GST rate cut or the benefit of input tax credit to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices. EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said the government has further extended timeline for anti-profiteering authorities to complete their investigations, and as such any investigation required to be closed by DGAP by November 30, 2020 can now be completed up to March 31, 2021. "This extension, much like the previous one, seems to be on account of the limitations posed (inability for businesses to provide requisite data) to the revenue authorities on account of the ongoing pandemic, as well as the quantum of pending cases," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-extends-deadline-for-completing-gst-anti-profiteering-probe-till-march-2021-927638.html

Rupa Publications had announced last week that the fourth volume of Mukherjee's autobiography 'The President Years: 2012-2017' will hit the stands next month while releasing some excerpts. Taking to Twitter, former Congress MP and Mukherjee's elder son Abhijit said, "I, the son of the author of the memoir 'The Presidential Memoirs' request you to kindly stop the publication of the memoir as well as motivated excerpts which is already floating in certain media platforms without my written consent."  According to the excerpts, Mukherjee felt Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed a “rather autocratic style of functioning” while former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was “pre-occupied” with saving the UPA that took a toll on governance. It also says that Sonia Gandhi was “unable” to handle the affairs as the Congress “lost” political focus leading to the party's defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.  "Since my father is no more, I being his son, want to go through the contents of the final copy of the book before it's publication as I believe, had my father been alive today, he too would have done the same," he wrote. Mukherjee passed away on August 31 after completing his book. Therefore, he said, the publisher should immediately stop the publication "without my written consent till I go through its contents!". Abhijit also said he has written a letter to Kapish Mehra of Rupa Publications in this regard. Responding to this, Mukherjee's daughter and Delhi Mahila Congress President Sharmistha asked her brother not to create trouble and that her father had completed the manuscript before he fell sick.  "I, daughter of the author of the memoir ‘The Presidential Years’, request my brother @ABHIJIT_LS not to create any unnecessary hurdles in publication of the last book written by our father. He completed the manuscript before he fell sick." "The final draft contains my dads’ hand written notes & comments that have been strictly adhered to. The views expressed by him are his own & no one should try to stop it from being published for any cheap publicity. That would be the greatest disservice to our departed father," she said. She also appeared to taunt Abhijit for giving a wrong title when she said, "btw (by the way bro), the title of the book is ‘The Presidential Years’, not ‘The Presidential Memoirs’." However, Abhijit had corrected it before she pointed it out. A spokesperson for Rupa Publications, which released Mukherjee's earlier three volumes, said "no comments" when asked about Abhijit's demand.  The fourth volume will also have Mukherjee's views on the controversial imposition of President's Rule in Arunachal Pradesh, demonetisation and surgical strikes and his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first volume of his autobiography -- The Dramatic Years: The Indira Gandhi Years -- focussed on his relationship with the former prime minister, the Emergency years and the Congress losing power. The Turbulent Years: 1980-1996 -- the second volume -- recorded the events, including the return of the Congress to power, Indira's assassination, his fall out with Rajiv Gandhi, return to the Congress after forming his own party, and the Narasimha Rao years. In the third volume -- The Coalition Years: 1996-2012 --  Mukherjee dealt with the United Front days, the ousting of Sitaram Kesri as the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi's leadership and UPA years till 2012 July when he was chosen as the President.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/former-president-pranab-mukherjees-son-daughter-spar-over-autobiography-release-927641.html

The separate interactions took place on the sidelines of an event where Modi, on a day-long visit to Gujarat, laid foundation stones for a host of projects in the border district. The PM met delegations of farmers from Punjab settled in Kutch district as well as local cultivators and heard their issues with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani accompanying him. Sikh farmers cultivate land in areas near the Indo-Pak border. The meeting came amid the ongoing protests by farmers, most of them from Punjab and Haryana, on Delhi borders against the Centre's new agri laws. The interaction took place at the tent city at Dhordo in Kutch district from where the Prime Minister laid foundation stones for the multiple projects. These projects include the world's largest hybrid renewable energy park, a desalination plant and a milk processing plant. The PM also interacted with a group of local women from a self-help group at the venue. As per a rough estimate, around 5,000 Sikh families residing in and around Lakhpat taluka of Kutch district. Sikhs started settling in Lakhpat after the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri urged citizens to settle in this barren patch of land after the 1965 India-Pakistan war. Over the last several days, farmers have been protesting outside Delhi against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly sought to allay fears over the new farm laws and asserted there will be no tinkering with the existing MSP regime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/on-gujarat-visit-pm-interacts-with-farmers-shg-members-927642.html

They include 50 families, 24 singles, four infants under the age of two, and 19 people over the age of 62. Their immigration was approved by the Israeli government in October. After landing, they went through the immigration process. "Some 90 per cent of them have completed their aliyah (immigration) permit process and soon all of them will be taken to a Shavei Israel absorption centre in the Nordiya moshav close to Netanya," a Bnei Menashe community member present at the airport told PTI. Shavei Israel is a non-profit organisation that has led the movement to bring back Jews looking to immigrate to Israel. "They will complete their quarantine period at the moshav (an agricultural commune) and spend some three months there going through the formal absorption process, including learning Hebrew. Following that they are likely to be settled in the north in the Nazareth Illit area", he said. Some 2,437 people from the Bnei Menashe community have so far immigrated to Israel from the north-eastern states of Manipur and Mizoram since 2003, the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption said. “I am happy that I have the merit to bring the Bnei Menashe to Israel after many years of waiting,” Minister for Immigration and Absorption Pnina Tamano-Shata said. There have been intense debates around the Jewishness of Bnei Menashe in the past but in 2005, the then Chief Rabbi of the Sephardi community, Rabbi Shlomo Amar, recognised them as descendants of Israel paving the way for their immigration to Israel. The community claims that it belongs to the Menashe tribe, one of the ten tribes pushed into exile by the Assyrians some 2700 years ago.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/252-indian-jews-from-the-bnei-menashe-community-immigrate-to-israel-927643.html

Asking the former ally to shun the “arrogant attitude” over the farm laws and accept what farmers want, Badal warned the BJP against any attempt to set Hindus against Sikhs. He said if one speaks in favour of the central government, he is called 'Desh Bhakt' and if he speaks out against it, he is branded as “tukde tukde gang”. “BJP is the real #TukdeTukdeGang in the country. It has smashed the national unity to pieces, shamelessly inciting Hindus against Muslims & now desperately setting peace-loving Punjabi Hindus against their Sikh brethren esp #farmers. They're pushing patriotic Punjab into communal flames” Badal alleged in a tweet. The SAD had quit the National Democratic Alliance over the issue of farm legislations. SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had also resigned as Union minister.

Rao, however, will continue to stay in Nanavati Hospital at least till Monday, the next date of hearing on his bail plea on the medical grounds and the plea filed by his wife Hemlatha alleging breach of Rao's fundamental rights due to "continued incarceration without adequate healthcare". The submission was made by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, before a bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik. During the day's hearing, senior counsels Indira Jaising and Anand Grover urged the high court to grant bail to Rao. Grover said that the 81-year-old poet was suffering from inherent medical issues since the time of his arrest in 2018. He said that authorities at Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, where Rao was lodged as an undertrial, did not have the expertise or medical infrastructure to treat him. Grover further said it would be most suitable for Rao's health if he was granted bail and permitted to go back to his home in Hyderabad. Rao would not flee if granted bail, Grover added. "He (Rao) has been tried for 24 cases in his lifetime which is not a joke for anyone, and he has been acquitted in all of them," Grover told the high court. "He has been chargesheeted and acquitted. He never absconded and has stood trial and he will stand trial here as well, and that should be considered while granting him bail," Grover argued. ASG Singh, however, intervened to argue that Rao had applied for bail on medical grounds and hence, his counsels must not argue on the merits of the case. The bench, however, pointed out that the Supreme Court in its recent order granting interim bail to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami had held that "under Article 226, a court is not bound by the prayers in a petition". "The Supreme Court in Goswami's judgment has also held that the high court has wide powers under 226. It has been made clear by the SC that interim bail can be granted under article 226 which was earlier a grey area. "The Supreme Court has specifically said that the high court can give interim bail, even when lower courts have not been approached. There are paragraphs devoted to this," the bench said. Further hearing was adjourned due to paucity of time. The bench suggested that since several senior citizen lawyers were appearing in the case, the next hearing on Monday be conducted via video-conferencing. The bench also said Rao will continue to stay at the Nanavati Hospital till then. "The earlier order will have to continue. We cannot break the hospital treatment procedure," it said. On a lighter note, the bench also asked Grover if he remembered any of Rao's poems as his counsel. Replying in the affirmative, Grover said, "It is a legal poem". Advocate Jaising requested that Rao's lawyers be permitted to meet him at the hospital. To this, the bench said lawyers could send written legal correspondence to Rao through his wife, who was permitted to meet him at the hospital. Rao has been in an out of state-run JJ Hospital in Mumbai and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018. On July 16 this year, Rao tested positive for coronavirus, after which he was shifted to Nanavati Hospital. He was discharged following a final assessment report on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison. On November 18, the high court noted that Rao was 81 years old, suffered from neurological ailments and also needed post-COVID-19 care. A person was on death bed and in such circumstances the state government cannot say that he should be treated in the jail, the high court had said. Following the high court's observations, the Maharashtra government on November 18 agreed to shift Rao from Taloja prison to the Nanavati hospital and also to bear the expenses of his treatment. His and his wife's petitions claimed that he was suffering from several ailments. Rao and a few other left-leaning activists were arrested for alleged links with Naxals following the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune on December 31, 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/varavara-rao-fit-to-go-back-to-jail-from-hospital-nia-to-hc-927662.html
15-12-2020||National||Centre says Covid-19 cases, deaths declining in India; cautions against any laxity||Covid-19 cases and deaths are declining in India which is very reassuring, the Centre said on Tuesday but cautioned against any laxity saying an overwhelming proportion of the country's population is still "very very susceptible" to the virus and the situation may escalate unexpectedly. While there is a continuous increasing trend in Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, particularly in America and Europe and the situation in the world is becoming worrisome, in contrast, the scene in India is satisfying as the cases and deaths are declining, Dr V K Paul, member (health) at NITI Aayog, told a press conference here. "Mortality is declining and it is well below 400 per day. Cases have come down to almost 22,000. This is the kind of number we all experienced in July. So that is very reassuring. As a nation, we seem to be now doing very well. "We are saving lives. But remember, this cannot be taken for granted. An overwhelming proportion of our population is still very very susceptible to the virus. And the situation can escalate unexpectedly," Paul said while cautioning against any laxity. He further said the reassuring thing is that people are saying the R0 has come below one which means the pandemic is shrinking. "So we should be happy about that but cautiously happy," he said. Noting Delhi has made progress, he said, "We congratulate the government of Delhi as also all the other governments who have done so well in contributing towards such a significant control (in cases) in recent times." Paul, however, expressed concern over the Covid-19 situation in some states like Uttarakhand, Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh and stated all efforts to control the spread are being made in collaboration with these governments. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that more than 15.55 crore tests have been conducted so far for detection of coronavirus infection in the country, and the cumulative positivity rate has come down to 6.37 while the average daily positivity rate during last week was 3.00 per cent. India's Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is also among the lowest in the world. At present, India's CFR is 1.45 per cent, whereas globally it is 2.26 per cent, Bhushan said. Speaking about the preparation for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, Bhushan said guidelines for estimation of electrical and non-electrical cold chain equipment and their strengthening have been issued to states. Guidelines for management of cold chain at last cold chain points and session sites have been issued. At least 29,000 cold chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers and 300 solar refrigerators will be used for the Covid-19 vaccination drive. States have been asked to identify at least one adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) management centre in each block. "Adverse events following immunisation is a critical aspect. Even during universal immunisation programmes, which have been going on for decades, some adverse effects are seen in children and pregnant women after vaccination. "So, we can't deny the possibility of an adverse event when the Covid-19 vaccination begins. The countries where inocolution has already started, especially in the UK, adverse events took place on the very first day. So, it is essential that states and union territories prepare for this too," Bhushan said. Detailed instructions on infection prevention and control practices during vaccination and management of minor, severe, serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) have been issued to states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-says-covid-19-cases-deaths-declining-in-india-cautions-against-any-laxity-927663.html

Chairing a review meeting, the chief minister said the consultant should submit the detailed project report by February 2021 for rapid progress of the project. "The PWD should remove all hurdles in the redesigning of the city roads along the lines of European cities to complete the project within stipulated deadline," he said. The consultant is responsible for preparing and submitting a detailed project report by February 2021 based on which tenders will be given and the operations will begin by June 2021, said a government statement. The Delhi government is working to redesign 540 km of 100-feet-wide roads on the built-operate-transfer (BOT) model and the construction company will take care of the maintenance for 15 years, it said. Public Works Department Minister Satyendar Jain, the secretary, engineer-in-chief and officials of the department were present in the meeting. Bottlenecks on roads cause traffic congestion at various points in the city, the statement said. The priority will be to remove these bottlenecks first for smooth flow of traffic and an organised lane system, it said. The second goal would be to increase the efficiency of the existing space on the roads, it said. There will be measured and planned spaces for vehicles, non-motorised vehicles, footpaths, and side-lanes. The footpaths will be widely mapped to an average of 10 feet for the convenience of pedestrians and will be redesigned and reconstructed as per a standard height for the convenience of the physically handicapped, it said. The project will also enhance greenery and address the issue of road dust. There will be separate spaces for the planting of trees on the sides of the footpaths, it said. The slope of the roads, as well as the drains, will be redesigned to tackle the problem of waterlogging on the roads. Rainwater harvesting structures will be built inside the drainage systems to store rainwater as groundwater, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-roads-to-be-redesigned-on-lines-of-european-cities-arvind-kejriwal-927668.html

They said they will completely block the Chilla Border between Delhi and Noida on Wednesday to press for their demands. Addressing a press conference at Singhu Border here, farmer leader Jagjeet Dallewal said, "The government is saying 'we won't repeal these laws', we are saying we will make you do it." "The fight has reached a stage where we are determined to win no matter what," he said. He also said, "We are not running away from negotiation, but the government has to pay heed to our demands and come forward with concrete proposals." Several other farmer leaders also addressed the press conference, and called upon people to pay tributes on December 20 to those farmers who have lost their lives during the ongoing protests. Farmer leader Rishipal said that one farmer has died every day on an average since the protest started in the last week of November. "A Homage Day (Shraddhanjali Diwas) for all the farmers who lost their lives and became martyrs in the ongoing protest will be organised across the country in villages and tehsil headquarters on 20th December from 11 am to 1pm," said another farmer leader. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that farmers gathered near Delhi are being misled as part of a conspiracy. Speaking after laying foundation stones for some development projects in his home state Gujarat, Modi also said his government is addressing farmers' concerns over the new agri laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-harden-stance-say-will-make-govt-repeal-farm-laws-to-block-chilla-border-on-wednesday-927669.html

Developed with a goal of optimising the in-farm productivity through Artificial Intelligence (AI), the application called "AgSpeak" will help the farmers in making decisions and managing farm activities through their smartphone or computer. "India is a leading agricultural country with immense potential, yet 2 billion people globally did not have regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food in 2019 alone. To end this global starvation, we need to double agricultural productivity in the next 15 years. Unless we use technology appropriately in the agricultural sector, this would be impossible," said IIT Guwahati Director TG Sitharam. According to Manik Mittal, a student at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, the startup is leading this initiative in the northeastern India, which has untapped potential with diverse ecosystems having agriculture as the major economic activity. "The developed application is multi-lingual and has an option of Assamese as well. This feature is a first among all the agri-tech applications available in the market. Driven by hyper local crop data coming from satellite and smart IOT devices, AgSpeak considers up to 20 local crop parameters which are key indicators of their health like rainfall, sunlight hours, soil health status, among others, to alert farmers about probable crop threats in advance and suggest best practices to tackle the incoming threat, hence optimising resources used and maximising productivity," he said. "The app along with the internet of things hardware has been tested for the past three months with 500 farmers and two tea estates. Some of the major breakthroughs by the algorithm were precise prediction of blight in potato and tea mosquito bug, along with water stress in winter crops. "These are major reasons of woes to farmers and small tea growers of Assam and cause lakhs in crop damages if not controlled in time," he added. Another IIT Guwahati student Akash Sharma, said, nearly 250 farmers have already been provided hands on training in utilising the full potential of the app. "However, the user friendliness and multilingual features of the app make it extremely easy for farmers to use and seldom require training. The mobile app is completely free for general small farmers. There are in-app purchases like soil testing and agri-doctor consultation. "Besides this, the IOT devices can be rented on monthly or yearly purposes by commercial farms to further enhance precision farm management. It has been tested with many farmers and its practical utility established," he added. The other co-founders include Siddhartha Bora (NIT Silchar), Nitin Chauhan (IIT Guwahati), Dhritiman Talukdar (NIT Silchar alumnus) and Kookil Pran Goswami (Dibrugarh University).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/assam-students-develop-ai-based-mobile-app-for-farmers-to-smartly-manage-their-crops-farms-927671.html

The specialist graphite and graphene producer with operations in Madagascar and India is also the latest issuer to receive the London Stock Exchange’s Green Economy Mark, which recognises equity issuers in London with green revenues of 50 per cent or more. The company said it plans to use the funds raised to complete its stage two investments, which will see a three to four times expansion in its current capacities. “It will also kickstart the availability of specialty graphite used in advanced applications for which India and the globe are currently substantially dependent on Chinese sources,” explained Shishir Poddar, CEO of Tirupati Graphite. “The development will therefore lay the foundations for diversification of flake and specialty graphite sources and that too manufactured in a more eco-friendly process. India is a huge net importer of graphite with limited new sources under development. An Indian origin company shall help it secure its needs too,” he said. Graphene has wide-ranging revolutionary uses and Tirupati Graphite, whose founder originates from the city of Ranchi, is focused on composite materials with graphene – both metals and non-metals – and also coatings and energy storage. The funds raised at London Stock Exchange will be used to build second-stage production across its established portfolio, which includes primary mining and processing in Madagascar where the company operates two key projects, Sahamamy and Vatomina. The current annual production of 3,000 tonnes of high-quality flake graphite concentrate with up to 96 per cent purity is set to increase to 81,000 tonnes per annum by 2023. In India, the company processes and produces speciality graphite for use in hi-tech applications like lithium-ion batteries, fire retardants, and composites. Its hi-tech graphite processing operations include the 1,200 tonnes p/a Patalganga Project, which was commissioned in July 2019 to manufacture and sell CARBOFLAMEX®, a trademarked fire-retardant product made from expandable graphite. “Our admission to trading on London Stock Exchange is a historic moment for Tirupati, which provides us with greater visibility and opportunity for growth as we build our market share in the high demand graphite and graphene market,” said Poddar. “Our multi-asset, cash generative, ‘green’ portfolio offers significant scope for further value creation and we have a defined development strategy in place to deliver upon this,” he added. The London Stock Exchange welcomed the company to its fold, which raised 1.75 million pounds through an Intermediaries offering, including a PrimaryBid retail tranche. “Through London's markets, issuers can access the diverse UK and international investor base, providing global liquidity, and increase their international profile. This listing demonstrates the opportunities for companies across all sizes and sectors to raise capital in London,” said Gokul Mani, Head of Middle East, Africa & India, Primary Markets at the London Stock Exchange. So far this year, London Stock Exchange said it has welcomed 34 Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), raising a combined 9.2 billion pounds.

Authorities at 633 districts were advised to create at least one such dedicated centre equipped with doctors and paramedical staff at each block to manage the adverse events. Detailed instructions on infection prevention and control practices during vaccination and management of minor, severe, serious AEFI have been issued to states by the Centre. “We can't deny the possibility of an adverse event when the Covid-19 vaccination begins. In countries where inoculation has already started, especially in the UK, adverse events took place on the very first day. It is essential that states and Union Territories prepare for this too,” said Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan. Every vaccination site has been linked to one such unit so that in case of any serious side-effect, the recipient can be taken to a management centre quickly. "Our existing AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) system is targeted towards children and women. Most of these vaccines are administered in hospital settings. So, while dealing with an adult vaccine, there has to be separate AEFI management unit as the Covid-19 vaccines are new vaccines based on multiple types of platforms,” Vinod Paul, NITI Ayog member and a former professor at AIIMS Delhi said on Tuesday. The Centre initially plans to vaccinate 30 crore individuals, starting with one crore doctors and two crore front-line workers. While six vaccines are under clinical evaluation at the moment, three manufacturers have approached the Central Drug Standards and Control Organisation seeking emergency use authorisation. During the clinical trials in India, two such adverse events were recorded in Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad and Serum Institute, Pune. Preliminary probe by the institutional ethics committee found no causal links between the vaccine and the adverse effects and the trial continues. The regulator, CDSCO, however, is silent so far. “Given the limited period of information available for (Covid-19) vaccines, it is necessary to allay if any apprehensions are there in addition to the built robust evidence base for real-time effectiveness,” Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India told DH, explaining the importance of setting up the AEFI network. While the daily count of fresh Covid-19 cases has dropped to 22,000 plus, India is on the cusp of registering more than one crore Covid-19 cases as the tally stood at 99.06 lakh. The death toll stands at 1,43,709, of which 354 was added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/possibility-of-adverse-event-after-covid-19-vaccination-cant-be-ruled-out-states-uts-should-be-prepared-centre-927687.html

He also said that the Minimum Support Price (MSP), at which the government commits to procure the produce from farmers, is an administrative decision and it "will continue as it is". Tomar's comments followed a meeting with members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kisan) from Uttar Pradesh, who submitted a memorandum to the minister with suggestions regarding the Farm Acts and the MSP. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kisan) has also decided to end for now its protest, which it was holding at district levels in Uttar Pradesh. They have not been part of nearly 40 farmers' groups that have been protesting on various borders of the national capital and had attended the recent rounds of talks with the Centre without any breakthrough. According to the ministry's statement, Tomar thanked the BKU (Kisan) leaders for coming out in support of the Farm Acts and said these laws have been welcomed in various states across the country. "He (Tomar) further added that the Government is willing to continue dialogue with genuine farm unions and is willing to find a solution with an open mind," the statement said. The BKU (Kisan) leaders suggested that farmers be given an option of going to civil courts in case of a dispute. They also suggested that the Panchayat head should be accorded the same importance as the head of the mandi to safeguard the rights of the farmers in small towns and villages. In the case of the Essential Commodities Act, they suggested that it should prevent hoarding and black marketing. The union leaders also suggested that electricity rates for irrigation should be reduced and electricity should be available for longer hours in Uttar Pradesh. They also proposed that standards for crops should be decided at the procurement centres so that farmers do not face any problem in selling the produce. After the meeting, BKU (Kisan) President Pawan Thakur told reporters, "The minister explained the laws in detail and we realised the laws are really good. We had some doubts, he cleared them all. ...The minister said he will look into our demands." He also said the union stop its protest for the time being in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. "If our demands are not met, we will protest again," he added. "The minister listened to our key amendments carefully. He said the government is discussing these issues already. We suggested six issues to make the laws more effective. We are happy with talks with the minister. We believe that the government is working positively," said Acharya Ram Gopala Dixit, BKU (Kisan) Patron since 2009. According to a memorandum earlier given by the union members, they pressed for a separate legislation to ensure guaranteed MSP for crops, saying the middleman buy crops at lower rate from farmers and sell it to government at MSP. "We want a law on MSP so that crops outside mandis can not sold below that rate. Farmers incurred losses this kharif season as they were forced to sell below the MSP. If our demand is accepted we are ready to support the laws. We don't know at what rate crops will be sold. Ideally, our crops should be sold above MSP but it is sold below that rate," Thakur had said before his meeting with Tomar. Tomar and some other ministers including Rajnath Singh have been meeting various farmer unions in the past few days who have extended support to the new laws. However, several other farmer unions, particularly from Punjab and Haryana, are continuing to protest for more than two weeks against the three farm laws, saying the new legislation will lead to the dismantling of the MSP and mandi systems and leave them at the mercy of corporates. Some ministers have also said that a few anti-social elements and Maoists are misusing the platform of farmers' protest to further their own agenda. Speaking in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said separately that "a conspiracy is afoot to confuse farmers who have gathered near Delhi at present." The Centre announces MSP for more than 20 Kharif and Rabi crops. It mainly procures wheat and paddy to fulfil commitment under the National Food Security Act and to create buffer stock. The government, under the food law, provides 5 kg of wheat or rice per person per month at Rs 2-3 per kg to over 80 crore people through ration shops.   Of late, the Centre also procures pulses and oilseeds under different schemes such as the Price Stabilisation Fund. In its proposal to farmers on Wednesday last week, the Centre had said it will give a written assurance that the MSP system will remain and also redress their other key concerns. The unions, however, are demanding complete rollback of the central laws and have threatened to intensify their agitation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-willing-to-continue-talks-with-genuine-farm-unions-msp-will-continue-as-it-is-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-927689.html

A three-judge bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan disapproved a Kerala High Court's direction that if any qualified doctor practising AYUSH medicine, made any advertisement or prescribed any drugs or medicines, as a cure for Covid-19 disease, it was open for the authorities to take appropriate action under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. "When the scientists of the entire world are engaged in research to find out proper medicine/vaccine for Covid-19, there is no occasion for making any observation as with regard to Homeopathic medical practitioners. The Homoeopathy does not cure the disease, but it cures the patients," the bench said. The top court, however, added that the high court was right in its observation that no medical practitioner can claim that it can cure Covid-19. "There is no such claim in other therapy including allopathy. The high court is right in observing that no claim for cure can be made in Homeopathy. The Homeopathy is contemplated to be used in preventing and mitigating Covid-19 as is reflected by the advisory and guidelines issued by the Ministry of AYUSH," the bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah, said. The court passed its judgement on an appeal filed by Dr A K B Sadbhavana Mission School of Homeo Pharmacy against the HC's judgement of August 21, 2020. "The high court in its judgment has not fully comprehended the guidelines of March 6, 2020, and taking a restricted view of the guidelines and have made observations for taking appropriate actions against the Homeopathic medical practitioners, which cannot be approved," the bench said. The court, further, pointed out the guidelines made it clear that Homeopathy has been envisaged as the therapeutic aid.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-homeopathic-or-other-medical-practitioner-can-claim-to-cure-for-covid-19-sc-927694.html

A bench of Justices R F Nariman, K M Joseph and Krishna Murari dismissed an appeal against the NCLAT's order of May 29, 2020. Both the CCI and the NCLAT found that Ola and Uber do not facilitate cartelisation or anti-competitive practices between drivers, who are independent individuals. The CCI had noted that a rider books a raid at any given time which is accepted by an anonymous driver available in the area, and there is no opportunity for the driver to coordinate with other drivers.  "This cannot be termed as a cartel activity/conduct through Ola/Uber’s platform," it had said. The top court rejected preliminary objections against filing a case before the CCI and NCLAT by Samir Agrawal. "When the CCI performs inquisitorial, as opposed to adjudicatory functions, the doors of approaching the CCI and the appellate authority, i.e., the NCLAT, must be kept wide open in the public interest, so as to subserve the high public purpose of the Act," the court said.  In 2018, Agrawal asked the CCI to initiate an inquiry against Ola and Uber alleging that they entered into price-fixing agreements in contravention of section 3(1) read with section 3(3)(a) of the Competition Act.  He claimed Uber and Ola calculated the fare by an algorithm based on many factors. Due to algorithmic-based pricing, neither are riders able to negotiate fares with individual drivers nor are the drivers able to offer any discounts. The CCI, however, said that the algorithmically determined pricing for each rider and each trip tends to be different owing to the interplay of large data sets.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-plea-on-cartelisation-by-cab-aggregators-uber-ola-927698.html

Johnson has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi accepting the invitation from the Government of India to attend the Republic Day ceremony on January 26, 2021. He has also invited Modi to take part in the G-7 summit, which will be hosted by the UK Government next year. When the two Prime Ministers meet in New Delhi next month, they are expected to announce a 10-year-roadmap for India-UK relations as well as an “Enhanced Trade Partnership”, which will be a prelude to the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Apart from focusing on stepping up bilateral trade and investment relations to boost post-Covid-19 economic recovery in both India and the UK, the two sides are also keen to use the British Prime Minister’s visit to India to step up cooperation in defence and security as well as in dealing with climate change. They will also focus on enhancing cooperation in the healthcare sector, building on partnership between the Serum Institute of India and the AstraZeneca PLC to produce the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University of the UK. Johnson’s tour to New Delhi is going to be his first foreign visit after the UK’s departure from the European Union will be completed on December 31. He is also going to be the first foreign leader to visit New Delhi after the Covid-19 pandemic swept the world in February-March this year. “As a key player in the Indo-Pacific region, India is an increasingly indispensable partner for the United Kingdom as we work to boost jobs and growth, confront shared threats to our security and protect our planet,” the British Prime Minister was quoted saying in a press-release issued by his office in London. Johnson also said that he was looking forward to the “quantum leap” in the UK-India bilateral relationship that he and Modi “pledged to achieve”. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab met in New Delhi on Tuesday and discussed ways to step up trade and economic engagement, apart from defence and security cooperation. They discussed a comprehensive migration and mobility partnership agreement, which is also likely to be signed next month to facilitate swifter movement of students and professionals between India and the UK. Raab said that he and Jaishankar agreed to “work together to deliver an Enhanced Trade Partnership to unlock the huge potential for British and Indian businesses and jobs”. Jaishankar said that India too had a “serious intent” to take the trade relationship with the UK forward. The UK is keen on expediting negotiation with India for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in order to support economic recovery after the Covid-19 crisis as well as to cushion the impact of its exit from the EU. New Delhi has also over the past few months evinced interests in clinching the proposed bilateral trade deal at the earliest, even as negotiations for India-EU FTA could not make any progress over the past few years. The India-UK bilateral trade in goods has been in the range of $15.45 billion during the FY 2019-20, remained in favour of India, but reduced by 11.33 per cent in comparison to the previous year.

The food ministry has proposed Rs 3,600 crore subsidy for exports of 60 lakh tonnes of sugar in the marketing year 2020-21 (October-September), they added. The sources said the proposal is likely to be taken up by the Cabinet in its meeting on Wednesday (December 16). In the previous marketing year 2019-20, the government provided a lump sum export subsidy of Rs 10,448 per tonne, costing the exchequer Rs 6,268 crore. The ministry has proposed lower export subsidy for the current marketing year 2020-21. Mills exported 5.7 million tonnes of sugar against the mandatory quota of 6 million tonnes set for the 2019-20 season (October-September), according to official data. Last month, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said the government is reconsidering extension of sugar export subsidies as India has got good opportunity to sell the sweetener in the international market. India, the world's second-largest sugar-producing country, had to offer export subsidies during the past two years to reduce surplus stocks and help cash-starved sugar mills clear cane payment to growers. "Thailand's production is expected to be down this year, while Brazil's crushing will only start in April 2021. From now till April, there is good export opportunity for India," the secretary had said. "This is the opportunity the industry has to encash upon, we are doing our best given that India is expected to have a bumper sugar production this year," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cabinet-may-consider-rs-3600-cr-sugar-export-subsidy-on-wednesday-927719.html

On the intervening night of December 16 and 17, 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, referred to as Nirbhaya, was raped and brutally assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012, at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Four of the six were convicted and hanged on March 20 this year. One of them, Ram Singh, allegedly took his own life in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case and another, a juvenile, was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home. Nirbhaya's father, who joined an online petition which was started by NGOs Save the Children and Yuva to mark the eighth anniversary of the gruesome gangrape case, said that "the fight is not over yet". "You have probably never heard from me. Today, I felt it was necessary for you to hear my voice. My name is Badrinath Singh. But since the night of 16th December, 2012, I am known as 'Nirbhaya's father'. This is how I will be known for the rest of my life," he said in a statement. Eight years ago when, "my daughter was snatched away from us in the most brutal way, crowds led by women came out on the streets" and they made "my family's fight their fight for justice", he said. "I thought this case would change us as a country for good. But when I turn on the news, there is a new case of another daughter being brutally assaulted every day. Nothing has changed," Nirbhaya's father said. While laws and systems help, a permanent change will only come when people's collective mindset changes, he said, adding that men must stop being mute spectators while women face abuse online and on the ground. "Therefore, I invite every boy and man to become an ally, an active supporter in the fight for women's safety," he said. "If you see a woman being trolled and threatened with rape on social media, speak up and report it. If you notice this happening in your surroundings, stand up with her," he said. Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am on March 20 for the savage assault on the 23-year-old woman who came to be known the world over as Nirbhaya, the fearless one. After raping and brutalising the woman, they dumped her on the road and left for dead on the cold winter night. Her friend who was with her was also severely beaten and thrown out along with her.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/daughters-being-brutally-assaulted-every-day-fight-not-over-yet-nirbhayas-father-927725.html

Addressing the inaugural session of the second conference on 'Good Practices in Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) and Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS), Reddy said such integrated database concepts -- CCTNS and ICJS -- have become indispensable to realise the dream of 'New India'.  The minister said that out of the total of 16,098 police stations in the country, the CCTNS software is being used in over 95 per cent of police stations and connectivity is available at 97 per cent police stations, and 93 per cent of police stations are entering 100 per cent FIRs through CCTNS, according to an official statement. The CCTNS is accessible to the investigating officers throughout the country. The minister of state for home affairs said that it is a reality that crime does not follow jurisdictional boundaries and hence, the response to crime should also not be restricted by boundaries. "Immediate recording of crime and the access of the information to all stakeholders is undoubtedly a key aspect of any effective law enforcement operation. This has led to the genesis of the project of CCTNS," he said. The minister said the Rs 2,000 crore mission-mode project has revolutionised investigation and policing with its massive reach and connectivity. It has also managed to connect police stations and other offices, even in the most far-flung areas, Reddy said. Reddy said the ICJS takes data sharing to a higher level and ensures a single source of truth between law enforcement and judicial systems. "The operational efficiency of the criminal justice system, without doubt, the ICJS is a force multiplier in this data-driven world," he said. The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated that the 'New India' needs to be a combination of ancient wisdom and modern technology. Under the prime minister's vision of 'SMART Policing', a new vision has emerged of maintaining law and order with a focus on accountability, transparency, community-based strategies and efficiency, Reddy said. The two new universities, the Rashtriya Raksha University and the National Forensic Science University have been instituted with the vision to promote an objective and scientific approach in the criminal justice system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cctns-available-in-95-pc-of-police-stations-mos-home-reddy-927727.html

He also said that the union territory will soon emerge as an educational hub and will expand educational opportunities for the youth. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made Jammu and Kashmir a key priority area in his strategy for 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India). He has not only taken a special interest in the development of the region but also put it on a superhighway of growth," Thakur said while addressing rallies in support of District Development Council (DDC) candidates in Jammu and Kashmir. He said Modi has accelerated the development process begun by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Union minister said that from strengthening security, social welfare and securing the lives and livelihoods of the people to ensuring individual democratic rights and building a conducive environment for investment are the hallmarks of the Modi government towards Jammu and Kashmir. "Jammu and Kashmir will soon emerge as an educational hub, IIT, IIM, IIMC, AIIMS will expand educational opportunities for the youth. We want the youth of the union territory to compete with the rest of India and achieve their aspirations," Thakur said.  Expanding infrastructure and investment in the state will provide them avenues for employment and setting up enterprises, he added. Thakur said, "Economic growth requires world-class infrastructure and we have promised this under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). Nearly 11,517 km in total length, 1,858 roads, 84 bridges have already been constructed." Another 1,961 km in total length, 3,261 roads and 243 bridges have been approved as part of infrastructure projects by the Modi government. In fact, the Srinagar to Leh connectivity has been improved by Rs 9,000 crore Zozila Tunnel, which again is a historic milestone." Thakur further said the government has augmented power infrastructure at a cost of Rs 54,593 crore, which will increase 6,298 MW worth of electricity production.  "For the past four decades, only 3,000 MW electricity production was there, however, we have ensured in the next four years it is scaled up by adding another 3,000 MW. "Srinagar-Leh transmission line along with 220KV Srinagar-Kargil-Leh power transmission system is another historic initiative towards providing power security to this region. Jammu and Srinagar regions will get two lakh smart meters, which will stop theft and bring transparency. Not only will this brighten up the lives of people in this region but also get the wheels of industry moving," he added. Thakur said Jammu and Kashmir is a crucial factor in the economic strategy and growth of India's economy. "We are investing in educational, health, power and public infrastructure such as roads and bridges because we want to set a strong foundation for growth of this region," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modis-aatmanirbhar-strategy-has-put-jk-on-superhighway-of-growth-thakur-927743.html

Special Judge Mohammad Gazali rejected Punia’s pre-arrest bail plea saying that the offences alleged against him were serious. An FIR was registered against Punia at the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow for his alleged objectionable tweet against the RSS. Punia was booked under IPC sections related to promoting enmity between different groups (153 A), outraging religious feelings (295 A), public mischief (505-2) and section 67 of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008. Punia had pleaded that for his alleged objectionable statement, as many as six FIRs were lodged at different places in the country and he got the anticipatory bail in all other cases. Accordingly, he should be granted bail in the case lodged at the Hazratganj police station of Lucknow as well, he had pleaded in his petition. The court, however, rejected his plea.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi conveyed the decision to Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, saying that he had informal consultations with floor leaders of various political parties. “...they have expressed their concerns about the ongoing pandemic and opined of doing away with winter session,” Joshi said in the letter to Chowdhury. Chowdhury said Congress, the main opposition party in Parliament, was not consulted over skipping the winter session of Parliament. “The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha was not consulted. Mr. Pralhad Joshi is as ususal departing from the truth,” Jairam Ramesh, the chief whip of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha, said. Joshi said the government was willing to have the next session of Parliament at the earliest and that it would be appropriate to have the Budget Session, 2021 in January, 2021 keeping in mind the unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Winter months are very crucial for managing the pandemic because of recent spurt in cases during this period, particularly in Delhi. At present, we are in the middle of December and a Covid vaccine is expected very soon,” the minister said in the letter to Chowdhury. The Monsoon Session of Parliament, which usually begins in July, held in September amid extraordinary measures in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The brief session comprising 10 sittings without a day's break too had to be cut short as more than 30 lawmakers and hundreds of support staff in Parliament contracted the infection during the session. According to the Constitution there should not be a gap of more than six months between two sessions of Parliament. However, it has been a convention to hold three sessions of Parliament – budget, monsoon and winter – in a calendar year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-winter-session-of-parliament-government-suggests-convening-budget-session-in-jan-2021-927540.html

In the virtual pre-budget consultation meeting with the minister, the captains of the Indian industry suggested lowering direct tax rates for individuals, more incentives for the housing sector and rationalisation of GST structure with a view of boosting growth. The industry chambers also made a case for accelerating infrastructure investment, privatisation of state-owned companies and greater tax incentives for research and development activities. "The economy is recovering at a quick pace and this momentum needs to be sustained. Quick and timely action by the government has led to this turnaround. Next year's budget must prioritise growth-oriented measures and fiscal considerations should be secondary. The need for further fiscal stimulus remains," said FICCI in its budget recommendations. Presenting the suggestions, CII President Uday Kotak said, "Government expenditure should be prioritised in three areas - infrastructure, healthcare and sustainability. The budget proposals should also address two critical areas of boosting private investments and providing support for employment generation." Emphasizing the urgent need for financial sector reforms, Kotak said achieving the vision of India being a USD 5 trillion economy is contingent on having a strong financial sector, and the government should bring down its stake in public sector banks to below 50 per cent through the market route over the next 12 months, except for 3-4 large banks such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank. The government should also create, government-owned, professionally managed Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to finance key sectors of the economy, on the lines of KfW Germany, Brazil Development Bank (BNDES), and Korea Development Bank. This could be achieved by infusing equity in NABARD for financing agriculture and rural sector, SIDBI for financing MSMEs and IIFCL for financing infrastructure, he added. Making a pitch for moderation in taxes, Assocham suggested rates for individuals may be reduced keeping in mind the reduced corporate tax rates and increased surcharge on individual taxpayers. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has outlived its utility and creates avoidable disputes and litigation, which may go up significantly on account of transition to IND AS, it said, adding that the tax should be abolished and alternatively the rate under section 115JB of the Act should be reduced to 12 per cent. To promote the real estate sector, industry chambers made various suggestions, including increasing the limit for interest deduction paid on home loans from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh and interest subvention on housing loans of 3-4 per cent for a period of 3-4 years. "Consider making employee's contribution to EPF voluntary (without making any change in the employer's contribution). Also, consider giving a three-year holiday for ESI contribution to both employers and employees," Ficci said. "These will enhance the take-home salary for individuals and will be particularly helpful in reducing the gap between gross and net salary for employees at the bottom of the pyramid," it added. Utilise a small part of foreign exchange reserves (USD 15 or 20 billion) for setting up a fund and lend to Indian industry at say 6 per cent in rupees for new projects and substantial expansion, and the tenure for these loans should be 8-12 years, the chamber said. "Pledge PSU shares to RBI and raise resources at low rates, the market value of government shareholding in PSUs will be around Rs 15 lakh. A third of the shares can be pledged to RBI and the government can raise Rs 5 lakh crore. This can be a loan at a low rate of interest – repo rate," it said. Accelerate planned disinvestment program, the chamber said, adding that privatisation should be in true spirits ensuring capital investment from private sector (domestic or foreign). Given that the tenure of National Anti-Profiteering Authority was initially prescribed for a two-year period and with GST law largely been settled, it is recommended that determination of prices should be left to the market forces and the provision of anti-profiteering in the GST law should be discontinued prospective effect, it said. The lack of guidelines on the subject is just adding to ambiguity in the implementation of the anti-profiteering provision by the industry, it said. CII suggested a stronger role for the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to ensure seamless coordination amongst regulators for protecting the interests of depositors and small investors. It recommended not to include any significant deductions/exemptions, but focus on greater clarity in the law, simplification of procedures and reduction of litigation and extend 'Vivad se Vishwas' Scheme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-inc-makes-case-for-fresh-fiscal-stimulus-more-steps-to-boost-growth-927547.html

Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws for 20 days now, demanding a complete repeal of the three contentious laws. While the Centre, firm on not giving in to their demand, has held several rounds of talks with farmers, they all have been inconclusive.  The economist feels that “deep lack of trust” is one of the reasons why talks between the Centre and the farmers have been unsuccessful. Banerjee believes that the government proposal on the farm laws is not “fully spelt out”. “Farmers think of a scenario in which one or more corporates hold them to ransom. The proposal needs detail on how the government will deal with such eventualities. Will they promise to step in in certain situations?"||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/abhijit-banerjee-on-why-talks-between-centre-and-farmers-have-been-unsuccessful-927558.html

In the wake of Brexit, the UK has been looking at ramping up trade with leading economies like India.

"For Modi Govt: Dissenting students are anti-nationals. Concerned citizens are urban Naxals. Migrant labourers are Covid carriers. Rape victims are nobody. Protesting farmers are Khalistani.

Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/for-modi-govt-crony-capitalists-are-best-friends-alleges-rahul-927585.html

Kumar made the statement in response to queries about the intense speculations about a tussle between his JD(U) and the BJP coming in the way of expansion of the cabinet which has 14 members, including himself, less than half of the sanctioned strength. As per the rule, a maximum of 36 ministers, including the chief minister, can be appointed to the 243-member Bihar Assembly. "At present, we are busy with moving forward on our blueprint for the next five years. A cabinet meeting is scheduled later in the day for the purpose. "When the BJP proposes expansion of the cabinet, we will think over it. So far no proposal has been received", Kumar told reporters. Speculations were rife that the cabinet expansion was deferred as the JD(U) was insistent on having a number of berths equal to that of the BJP which at present has seven ministers, as against only four from the chief minister's party. Two of the BJP ministers Tar Kishor Prasad and Renu Devi have been designated as Deputy CM. One of the JD(U) ministers, Mewa Lal Chaudhary, had to resign within hours of taking charge as a massive controversy had erupted over his being named in a case relating to irregular appointments at an agriculture university of which he was then the Vice-Chancellor. While the BJP is said to be of the view that it deserved a greater share of the pie on account of its superior tally in the assembly, the JD(U) holds that it suffered in the assembly elections because of Chirag Paswan's politics of brinkmanship whom the saffron party failed to rein in despite its clout. In the assembly polls, the BJP returned with a tally of 74 while the JD(U) won only 43 seats. The JD(U) is also said to have underscored that it had contested as many seats as the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls last year, despite then having a strength in the assembly that was superior to the latter. The JD(U), the BJP, and the LJP had fought the 2019 general elections together for the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar and returned with respective tallies, of 16, 17, and six. While the LJP has pulled out of the NDA in the state, insisting that it was still a constituent at the Centre, two small parties former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhis Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Bollywood set designer- turned- politician Mukesh Sahni's Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) joined the coalition ahead of the assembly elections. Son of Manjhi, whose party won seats set aside by the JD (U) from its own quota of 122 seats, and Sahni, who was accommodated by the BJP after he snapped ties with the RJD-led Grand Alliance, have been accommodated into the state cabinet. Both the parties had won four seats each in the October- November state elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-proposal-from-the-bjp-for-cabinet-expansion-nitish-927601.html
15-12-2020||National Politics||Govt addressing farmers' concerns; Opposition misguiding them: PM Narendra Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday once again reiterated that his government's firm stance on not going back on three controversial agriculture laws against which farmers are staging protests in Delhi. Ruling out any such possibility, Modi blamed the Opposition parties for "misleading" the farmers in order to reap political benefits and said that "these laws are most beneficial for which even Opposition parties and farmers' bodies were demanding for years." Reaching out to farmers in his address from Dhordo, a major tourist attraction in Kutch district, PM Modi said, "Friends, the agriculture reforms are exactly the same as sought by farmer bodies and even opposition parties for years. These opposition parties supported these laws when they were in power but couldn't make a decision. Now that these have become laws, they are misleading the farmers that their lands will be taken away." At the function in Dhordo, where tourists throng in winter to see "White Rann", farmers including Sikhs had been brought "to interact with the prime minister." There is a sizable population of Sikh farmers in the region who have settled there following the 1962 war with Pakistan following a scheme by the central government. Incidentally, most of the farmers protesting in Delhi are from Punjab and Haryana. Modi said in his address, "Farmers who have gathered in Delhi are being misled as part of a conspiracy by opposition. Farmers are told that their land will be snatched by others if new farm reforms get implemented. I want to ask you, did the dairy owner take your cattle because you are selling milk to him?", he added that the dairy sector contributes immensely to the agriculture sector. He also said that the new farm laws would be beneficial to marginal farmers who grow whole grains and pulses.  "But, the opposition is spreading falsehood and misleading the farmers. I want to reiterate that my government is ready 24 hours to resolve all your doubts," Modi said. He further said that "I am confident that our honest intentions and efforts will defeat those who are misleading the farmers to reap political gains." Prime Minister Modi also laid foundation stones for three major projects in the region which includes a hybrid renewable energy park, said to be the world's largest, in Khavda, close to the international border with Pakistan, a desalination plant at Mandvi, which will have a capacity of 10 crore litres of water every day and a fully automated milk processing and packing plant at Sarhad Dairy Anjar, Kutch.  Interestingly, last month union home minister Amit Shah had visited the region where he held a meeting with sarpanches of three nearby districts that share its borders with Pakistan. PM Modi was also briefed on the progress of Smruti Van, a large memorial being built in the name of 2001 earthquake victims. The first phase of the project is likely to be inaugurated soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/govt-addressing-farmers-concerns-opposition-misguiding-them-pm-narendra-modi-927635.html

Senior Congress leader and the party's chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh also said that the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, was not consulted on the matter. In a letter to leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said, "Winter months are very crucial for managing the pandemic because of recent spurt in cases during this period, particularly in Delhi. At present, we are in the middle of December and a COVID vaccine is expected very soon." The minister said he had informally contacted floor leaders of various political parties and "they have expressed their concerns about the ongoing pandemic and opined of doing away with winter session". Responding to the minister's remarks, Ramesh tweeted, "The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha was not consulted. Mr. Pralhad Joshi is as usual departing from the truth." Hitting out at the government, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter, "Modi ji, decimation of 'parliamentary democracy' is complete. NEET/JEE exams can be held during Covid. Schools can be opened, universities can hold exams. Rallies can be held in Bihar-Bengal. But winter session of Parliament can't be held." "Any semblance of democracy left?" he asked. On its official Twitter handle, the Congress said, "Another step in the BJP's attempt to destroy democracy." "The BJP-brought crisis on democracy is not limited to parliamentary sessions, but is a crisis on every common person's life, their independence, their wishes. We will fight this crisis," the party said in a tweet in Hindi. Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, "Now give me one good reason why it is not possible to have a ‘parliament from home’? Are we so backward in IT that we can't connect 543 MPs?" And with everything else open, how come only the most important legislative entity of the country is forced to remain shut, asked Tharoor. Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said the Inter-Parliamentary Union data shows more than 105 countries across the world held multiple Parliamentary sessions amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. He asked why the Modi government is evading accountability by cancelling the Parliament session. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, "Bihar election -- not postponed. New Parliament building ceremony - not postponed. BJP Bengal rallies- not postponed. But Parliament winter session - postponed due to Covid-19. Winter session postponement is BJP's expected sinister strategy to avoid debate, questions on farmers' protest." Another Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed also hit out at the BJP for going ahead with poll campaigning amid the pandemic, but citing COVID-19 to not hold the winter session of Parliament. "If COVID-19 hasn't stopped the BJP government from campaigning for elections or even going ahead with a new Parliament building, why should winter session of Parliament be scrapped because of it? BJP is using the pandemic as an excuse to undermine essential democratic processes!" she tweeted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/decimation-of-parliamentary-democracy-is-complete-congress-slams-centre-over-no-winter-session-927771.html

He threatened to block the Ghazipur border if the farmers from the two states were not allowed to join the agitation. Thousands of farmers are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They are demanding that these laws, which were enacted in September, be repealed. "State governments should not intervene in our agitation and stop trying to create hindrance as it will prolong till our demand of scrapping farm laws is not fulfilled," Tikait said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/police-torturing-farmers-in-up-uttarakhand-to-stop-them-from-joining-protests-bku-927445.html

The Samajwadi Party chief laid his party’s claim over Lord Ram while taking a brief break here in Ayodhya on his way back to Lucknow from Azamgarh. “Lord Rama belongs to the Samajwadi Party. We are Ram Bhakts and Krishna Bhakts," Yadav told reporters during his brief interaction with them here on Monday evening. Yadav also said he would come soon to Ayodhya along with his family members to offer their prayers to Lord Ram. He, however, did not specify when he plans to visit Ayodhya to offer prayers to the deity. While talking to reporters, Yadav also listed various works done by him during his government’s term for the development of the temple town. Among the various works done by him as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yadav listed the plantation of “Parijaat trees” along the “Prikrama Marg”, a ring road around Ayodhya on which devotees take rounds after Diwali festival, assuming their act akin to taking the round of Ram Janmabhoomi temple site itself. Yadav had got planted various species of trees along this road with religious significance. “I had also arranged lights on the banks of river Saryu and sound system at the 'Bhajan Sthal' for the worship of Lord Rama,” he said. On his future electoral plans, Yadav said his party will no longer go in for pre-poll alliances with bigger parties as he did not have a good experience of such tie-ups. “I will have pre-poll alliances only with smaller parties,” he said while exuding confidence that his party would win at least 351 out of 403 seats in the next Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2022 and form the government in the state. Yadav said he would give one seat to his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav. On the three central farmers laws, against which farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at different border points of the national capital for nearly a fortnight now, Yadav said the laws are death warrants for the farmers. He said the government must give statutory guarantee to farmers to continue with the system of minimum support price for them and to double their income. He said the form in which the three laws have been enacted by the Centre would benefit corporate houses only.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/lord-ram-belongs-to-samajwadi-party-we-are-ram-bhakts-akhilesh-yadav-in-ayodhya-927452.html

Vij was examined on Monday by a special medical board comprising a team of senior doctors of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), constituted by the institute's director Rohtas Yadav. "Anil Vij was cheerful... and his vital parameters were normal," said the bulletin. However, the minister has fever, it said. The treatment being given to him was thoroughly reviewed by the doctors, it said. "In view of skigram (X-ray) finding and status of the pulmonary parameters, the committee (doctors) was of the opinion that he has moderate COVID-19 with bilateral viral pneumonia," the bulletin said. "Various options for the management were discussed... it was decided that Anil Vij shall be given one more unit of convalescent plasma today (Monday) evening and all other therapies can continue as before," it said.         The bulletin also mentioned that "the issue of any adverse development of his condition has also been discussed and conveyed to the health minister (Vij). Various therapies and their pros and cons were also discussed with him..."         Vij, who is also the state's home minister, was shifted from Civil Hospital at Ambala to PGIMS on Saturday night after he complained of discomfort. The minister had last month got one shot of the two-dose trial of the Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin after he offered to be a volunteer. He had tested positive for Covid-19 on December 5. The 67-year-old BJP leader had offered to be the first volunteer in the phase three trials for Covaxin, an indigenous potential vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech against Covid-19. He was administered the dose on November 20 at the Civil Hospital in Ambala Cantonment, about 50 km from Chandigarh. Bharat Biotech had said that clinical trials of the vaccine are based on a two-dose schedule, given 28 days apart. The vaccine efficacy will be determined two weeks after the second dose, it said. COVAXIN has been designed to be protective 2 weeks after volunteers receive the 2nd dose. The Union Health Ministry had also stepped in to say that Covaxin is a two-dose anti-coronavirus vaccine and that Vij was given only the first dose a fortnight before he tested positive. "The antibodies against the infection build up in a human being only after a specific number of days pass after the second dose of the vaccine is taken. This is a two-dose vaccine. The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine," the ministry had said in a statement. Vij had earlier said that he had gone to Panipat few days prior to testing positive for coronavirus where he spent 2-3 hours with a BJP leader, who too had tested positive for COVID-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-positive-haryana-minister-anil-vijs-vital-parameters-normal-undergoing-plasma-therapy-doctors-927465.html

The Jammu and Kashmir adminstration has identified over 4,000 sites and 24,000 vaccinators for it, he said. The health administration has already started advance planning for coronavirus vaccine rollout and deputy commissioners have prepared district-wise micro-plans for vaccination sites, cold chain storage points and logistics requirements. "Jammu and Kashmir has identified around 4,000 vaccination sites, more than 5000 trained vaccinators and 19,000 potential vaccinators for COVID 19 vaccination under the COVID vaccination programme," Financial Commissioner, Health and Medical Education Department, Atal Dulloo told PTI. He said over one lakh health workers, both from government and private healthcare facilities, have been registered for the first phase of vaccination. "The cold chain and logistics assessment for the COVID-19 vaccine has been done, and the union territory has 987 ice-lined refrigerators (ILR), 795 deep freezers, 11 solar refrigerators, five walk-in coolers and one walk-in freezers," Dulloo said. He said a cascade of training for the coronavirus vaccine programme has also been initiated with the orientation of all the divisional-level and district-level officials, followed by block-level functionaries through virtual platforms and traditional training. Despite freezing winters and snow covered mountain areas, the health administration will reach out to all the sections in a phased manner, he said. Jammu and Kashmir has taken strong measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 through better diagnostics and treatment, and now it is also planning for a vaccine introduction for a lasting solution by enhancing immunity and containing the disease spread, he said. "Globally, over 274 candidate vaccines are in different stages of development. The majority of vaccines in clinical evaluation as of December 2020 will require a two-dose schedule to be administered two, three or four weeks apart, and need to be administered through the intramuscular route," the financial commissioner said. Dulloo said there are nine COVID-19 vaccines in different phases of development in India. Out of these, three are in pre-clinical phase, whereas six are under phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. "The COVID-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities based on evolving pandemic situation, and finally to the remaining population based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-over-1-lakh-health-workers-to-be-vaccinated-in-phase-1-in-jk-927492.html

On Monday night, the two again had heated arguments over making chapatis for the dogs. A furious Ashish shot at his sister with a country-made pistol after she refused to make chapatis. The woman, who was hit on the head and chest, died even before she could be taken to the hospital.

Foggy conditions prevailed in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh witnessed very light rains at isolated places, while temperatures hovered below normal limits in Haryana and Punjab. In Himachal Pradesh, Keylong and Kalpa recorded sub-zero temperatures despite dry weather in the state in the last 24 hours. The national capital was gripped by a cold wave as the icy winds blowing from snow-covered western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 4.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the city this season so far, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The maximum temperature also dipped to 18.5 degrees Celsius, over four notches below normal, the weather department said.

Last year, the minimum temperature had dropped below the five-degree mark in the last week of December. According to the IMD, the mercury is set to dip further. In the Kashmir Valley, night temperatures dipped below the freezing point owing to a clear sky, with the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg shivering at minus 10.2 degrees Celsius, Meteorological (MeT) Department officials said. All weather stations in the Valley recorded sub-zero night temperatures several degrees below the normal for this part of the season, the officials said. They said the temperature in Gulmarg, the famous ski-resort in north Kashmir, settled at a low of minus 10.2 degrees Celsius, which is six degrees below the normal for this time of the season.

The barbs from Uttar Pradesh minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh on Tuesday were in reaction to the AAP leader’s criticism of the BJP government in UP while announcing his party’s plans for 2022. "He is a habitual liar while his inefficient administration skills have been exposed thoroughly, especially during the COVID-19 crisis,'' the minister said, claiming that the AAP government in Delhi has been an “abject failure”. Singh also reminded Kejriwal of his defeat in Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency, and called his Uttar Pradesh plans just daydreams -- “Kejriwal ke Haseen Sapne' “It seems that you have forgotten 2014, remember what happened with you in Varanasi," the BJP leader said. Modi won the seat by a huge margin of 3.37 lakh votes. The UP minister also recalled the exodus of migrant labourers from Delhi during the lockdown after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. "It is hard to imagine how he turned out the hapless people of UP, Bihar and Jharkhand from Delhi during the trying times of coronavirus,” Singh said. “It was for the Yogi government to receive them, provide them free rations, give them a sustenance allowance and get them tested for coronavirus for free," he added. Singh said it is surprising that the Delhi CM has something to comment on the UP government despite having “failed” Delhi on more than one occasion. He said UP has conducted more than two crore tests for coronavirus, compared to 72 lakh in Delhi. He said Delhi has recorded 6.08 lakh cases of the virus while the figure for UP, which is several times bigger, is 5.66 lakh. The minister also referred to a Delhi High Court observation on the handling of pandemic in the national capital. Singh said Kejriwal owed an apology for “insulting” people from Purvanchal by saying that they come to Delhi on a Rs-500 ticket to get medical treatment worth Rs 5 lakh, depriving Delhi’s citizens of the facilities. "Don't you forget that even Purvanchal has enough facilities to match the standard of your hospitals,'' Singh said. The minister also took a dig at Kejriwal over his claim on providing oximeters to COVID-19 patients recovering at home. “I would suggest you to kindly get your oxygen level checked with an oximeter," he said. Singh said the Yogi Adityanath government has cleared UP sugarcane farmers’ dues of about Rs 1.12 lakh crore, claiming that this amount alone was more than the Delhi government’s entire budget. "Yet another political foray of Kejriwal into UP is like 'Mungerilal ke Haseen Sapne' which will change to 'Kejriwal ke Haseen Sapne' after 2022," he said, in an apparent reference to an old TV serial and the Delhi CM’s 2014 Lok Sabha defeat. Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said UP is being held back by its "dirty politics" and "corrupt leaders" and compared medical and other facilities there with those in Delhi. "Why do the people of UP travel to Delhi for every major and minor facility? If a family living in Kanpur has to send their child to a good college, they have to send her to Delhi. If a person living in Gorakhpur has to get good medical treatment for his parents, they have to come to Delhi. Why?" he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/kejriwals-up-poll-plan-yogi-govt-reminds-him-of-varanasi-defeat-says-he-failed-in-delhi-927718.html

However, they were stopped by police and asked to disperse, the officials said. The students claimed that 14 of the protestors, including Umar Khalid's mother and sisters, were detained, but the police denied it. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said a group of protestors had assembled at Batla house for a candle march to mark the anniversary of the protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). "The police team removed the agitators from the spot. Meanwhile, three women also accompanied the protestors. The protestors were then counselled regarding COVID guidelines and were requested to return to their respective homes. No one was taken to the police station," Meena said. "On the occasion of the anniversary of anti-CAA agitation and police crackdown on students at Jamia Nagar in 2019, a candle march was held. But the local police detained 14 people, including three women (mother and sisters of Umad Khalid) for holding this candle march," a protestor claimed. The December 15 protests had spiralled into violence after a section of protesters, including students and residents, tried to march to Parliament against the Citizenship Amendment Act but were stopped by police at Mathura Road. As a section of protesters started pelting stones and set buses and private vehicles on fire, police retaliated with lathi-charge and eventually stormed the campus. Seven people, including former Congress MLA of Okhla Asif Khan, have been named by Delhi Police in its FIRs. Police also charge-sheeted JNU PhD student Sharjeel Imam and Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha. Umar Khalid was arrested in the case on October 1 and is in judicial custody. He was earlier arrested in September in a separate case related to larger conspiracy in the northeast Delhi riots which erupted between anti-CAA protesters and those supporting the Act in February, killing over 50 people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jamia-violence-anniversarystudents-umar-khalids-kin-take-out-candle-march-stopped-by-police-927755.html

Saini, an MP from Kurukshetra, was visiting Khurdi village in the district to lay the foundation stones of some projects and inaugurate a community centre. As soon as the word spread that the MP would be coming to the village, a large group of farmers gathered there and began protesting. The protesters also threw black paint on the foundation stones before Saini's arrival. The farmers said that they have already announced that leaders of the ruling BJP-JJP alliance and ministers of the Haryana government will face boycott till the time the farm laws are not repealed. "If they come, they will be opposed," said a farmer leader. However, the protesters dispersed after some time and Saini took part in all the scheduled events.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-bjp-mp-faces-farmers-ire-at-function-in-yamunanagar-927764.html
15-12-2020||Oasis||The power of optimism||As many of us eagerly await to see this year-end, there are some who wove their success stories right amidst the pandemic. One such tale is of a friend,  an avid marathoner, a Bharatanatyam dancer and a superbike rider who always bettered the other entrants. However, life took a major turn a few months back when she tested positive for cancer. Though fronting challenges was a part of every hobby she embraced, the herculean task of battling this deadly disease with an open mind was the first momentous step she took towards the road to recovery. Albeit many still fear to hear the name and the afflictions associated with this disease, it was prodigious to see her accepting and being optimistic when everything was falling apart. As times became harder with Covid, a venture to the hospital became perilous and with little or no help, her battle with this ailment became a lone race to victory.  The will power to fight and get back on her feet enunciates about her pragmatic outlook towards life. The spirit to win back and getting back into her running shoes is truly a lesson worth learning. What we plan and what life plans for us may not be the same. Our preparedness towards the challenges becomes the first step towards overcoming the hurdles.  This pandemic has taught something to each one facing its wrath. The power to stay resolute without any support of family and friends can be overwhelming for any normal individual. Like words of Henry Ford” When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the aeroplane takes off against the wind, not with it,” remove all thoughts which are adversarial and allow that one thought of assurance in and believe completely in it. The coming New year will bring fresh starts and new beginnings. Let’s be optimistic and bid farewell to this remarkable year, keeping in mind that “ Every dark cloud has a silver lining and behind it, the Sun is shining.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/the-power-of-optimism-927463.html
15-12-2020||Opinion||Did the Resistance defeat Donald Trump?||Two of the most intense factions in our politics, the anti-Trump Resistance with its claim to be standing against fascism and the conservatives trying to delegitimise Joe Biden’s victory with claims of widespread voter fraud, agree on almost nothing, but they do agree on one point: The Trump administration was successfully undermined — the Trump agenda thwarted and Donald Trump himself defeated — by liberal institutions that refused to normalise him, maintained a persistent alarm about his presidency and took every opportunity to obstruct, investigate, protest and impeach. The liberals urging constant vigilance and outrage against Trump’s challenge to the 2020 outcome are trying to see this project of resistance through to its Biden-inauguration end. Meanwhile, the Trumpian side is trying to imitate it, since lurking below the right’s fantasy politics is a more cynical assumption that it’s a great idea, a highly effective political counterpunch, for Republicans to act like Biden is an anti-president, a Great Pretender — because that’s what liberals did to Trump and it obviously worked. I think both of these groups are mostly wrong — that what defeated Trump was Trump himself, that the “fascism” discourse around his presidency was often a distraction, and that the most successful strategies pursued by the Democrats were strategies of normalcy rather than alarm. But now that the Electoral College has voted and a Biden presidency seems essentially assured, let’s consider the best arguments for how and why the Resistance undid Trump. From the Resisters themselves, those arguments accuse anyone who was skeptical of their alarmism of ignoring the importance of passion, organisation and mobilisation in American politics. To eye-roll at the would-be defenders of liberalism and democracy, Laura K. Field of the Niskanen Center asserted just before the election, is to engage in an “implicit denial of the work that has gone into attempting to defeat Trump.” If his authoritarianism has fizzled out in fantasy and hopeless lawsuits, it still could have been much, much worse if people hadn’t felt a world-historical incentive to resist — an effort that merits “gratitude and respect, not dismissive call-outs and belittling tweets.” Rather than emphasising mobilisation, meanwhile, the Trumpist version of Field’s argument emphasises elite power — the way that the media and the judiciary and the bureaucracy joined with congressional Democrats in denying Trump any of the normal space of action that his predecessors enjoyed. This newspaper’s famous Op-Ed by “Anonymous” (later revealed to be Miles Taylor, the homeland security secretary’s chief of staff) claiming to represent the Resistance inside the Trump White House offers a condensed symbol of what these Trump supporters have in mind — a kind of inside-outside game of obstruction, with media entities and government officials cooperating to keep the agenda that Trump actually campaigned on from taking shape. To these arguments I would offer a concession and a rejoinder. The concession first: There’s no question that the anti-authoritarian, America-imperiled narrative of the last four years had some benefits for Trump’s opponents. It helped pressure the disparate factions of the American elite, from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, to close ranks against the president. It created an ideological home and a compelling self-understanding for anti-Trump Republicans. It contributed to the mobilisation of suburban and minority voters in crucial states like Georgia and to the general sense of purpose that a successful political movement needs. And in its inside-game form, elite resistance definitely obstructed at least some of Trump’s expressed desires, from Gary Cohn and John Bolton maneuvering deceptively on NAFTA or NATO to the generals who repeatedly slow-walked orders to withdraw forces from the Middle East or Afghanistan. My rejoinder, though, is that it’s not clear whether the Resistance mentality was more effective than more politically normal modes of fighting Trump, and whether the inside-the-system obstruction of the president actually derailed a real agenda rather than just adding extra layers of chaos to a presidency that never had a vision or a plan. On the first point, one might observe that the Trump-era controversies most dominated by Resistance theatrics were conflicts that the Resistance didn’t win — the long Russiagate investigation and imbroglio, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle, the impeachment fight. At the same time, Trump’s actual defeats were the work of very conventional political campaigning: a midterm campaign in which the Democrats organised around health care and other kitchen-table issues and a presidential election in which they nominated their most moderate candidate and ran on normalcy and decency, casting Trump as a terrible person and a bad president but not a Mussolini in the making. Then, too, the gains from the Resistance mentality came with a political price. The anti-Trump closing-of-ranks within elite institutions helped shore up the president’s populist bona fides, his claim to represent outsiders and non-elites, even when his actual policies favored insiders and the rich. The tendency to see an authoritarian depredation behind every policy move, however banal, weakened the credibility of the media, especially putatively neutral outlets like CNN. The pitch of anti-Trumpism bound once-dubious Republicans to his cause, almost matching the mobilisation on the Democratic side. And the liberal belief that Trump was obviously, self-evidently a white supremacist and semi-fascist left liberalism somewhat blindsided by the voters who disagreed: not just the white shy-Trumpers of the suburbs but also the Trump-voting Latinos and African Americans who helped keep the 2020 race competitive, denying Biden his blowout and the Resistance the full repudiation of Trumpism that it sought. On the right, meanwhile, the Trumpist conceit that the Mueller investigation or MSNBC hysteria were the main forces preventing a more successful Trump agenda gives that opposition way too much credit — and Trump himself way too little blame. It was not the Resistance but his own indifference that induced Trump to outsource policymaking to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during the two years when his party actually controlled the government. It was not the Mueller investigation but the attempted Obamacare repeal and a not-very-populist tax plan that drove his polling numbers to their notable lows. When Kayleigh McEnany complained recently that her boss “was never given an orderly transition of power,” she had a point — but the major source of disorder was not Crossfire Hurricane or the Steele dossier but just the Trump team’s own incompetence, notably Jared Kushner’s decision to ditch Chris Christie’s transition plan without having a replacement. The Resistance may have induced Democrats to take a lot of party-line votes against the president, but if Trump actually pursued his promised infrastructure bill he would have found Democratic takers. In areas where he had competent people working for him (judicial nominations, above all), the political and media opposition was impotent to stop him. Impeachment was just a segue into his presidency’s peak, a triumphant State of the Union address just before the coronavirus came calling. Even late in 2020, Nancy Pelosi was willing to make a deal with him on a big new round of coronavirus relief, which might have helped save his reelection bid — yet Trump preferred instead to go down tweeting. So treating Biden the way Trump was treated, opposing him as Trump was opposed, is only a devastating strategy if you assume that Biden and his White House will miss as many opportunities and perform as many face-plants as Trump’s administration did. And that’s without even getting into the fact that the Republican campaign to delegitimise Biden can’t really emulate the Resistance, since the whole point of the anti-Trump effort was to mobilise a political and cultural establishment from which the populist right is notably excluded. At most a refusal to recognise Biden’s legitimacy could keep congressional Republicans voting in lock step against whatever the new president supports. But most would vote in lock step anyway, and the Republican senators most likely to break ranks, a Mitt Romney or a Susan Collins, are the least likely to be swayed by appeals to Biden’s supposed illegitimacy. Which means the attempt to build a right-wing Resistance narrative should probably be understood less as an effort to actually impede Biden’s administration and much more as a project to maintain Donald Trump’s position as his party’s leader, a president in exile — because, after all under its theory, he never really lost. If the idea of Trump 2024 appeals to you, as it currently does to many Republicans, then this kind of Resistancing may sound like a good way to keep anybody else from claiming any kind of real position in the party. But the primary claim being made for it — that it will obstruct and defeat Biden the way Resistance liberals took down Trump — is a twofold error: They didn’t, and it won’t.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/did-the-resistance-defeat-donald-trump-927652.html
15-12-2020||Panorama||Mental healthcare through telehealth||Mental wellbeing is a critical aspect of overall health, yet in India, the issue is frequently ignored and underrated. According to a study by Lancet, it is estimated that in India, 197.3 million people suffered from mental disorders in 2017. Of these numbers, 44.9 million people were affected by anxiety disorders, while 45.7 million people had depressive disorders. Further, a survey revealed that in 2019 there was a massive jump of 367% in mental health queries from non-metro towns. This was even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck the country.  Mental health disorders can affect anyone and there is treatment available to help them. However, because of lack of awareness and scarcity of mental health experts, thousands of patients remain neglected from mental health treatment, especially in rural areas. The growing popularity of virtual healthcare is expected to play a crucial role in bridging the gap between seekers and providers. Telemedicine services can facilitate counselling sessions in remote and inaccessible parts of the country. A major reason behind the country’s mental health epidemic is the stigma around mental health issues. In our society, a person suffering from mental health problems is often tagged “lunatic” which leads to a dangerous cycle of isolation, suffering, and shame. Another factor contributing to the epidemic is the paucity of the mental healthcare workforce. WHO reported that in 2011, for 100,000 mental health patients in India there were 0.047 psychologists and 0.301 psychiatrists. When it comes to mental illness in India, there is a lot of social stigmas that discourages people to seek treatment. In fact, in villages and small towns, genuine conditions of bipolar disorders and schizophrenia are overlooked and thought of as possessions by the devil. With telemedicine, a person has remote access to the treatment and can get immediate help without the need to visit a clinic. This also helps the person undergoing treatment to keep his or her identity anonymous.     In a country with a population of over 130 crores, there are only 56,600 psychiatric beds. On top of that, a significant population of psychologists and psychiatrists reside in big cities and metros causing severe deficiency of expert mental health providers in rural areas and villages. With different modes of communication like audio, video, chat platforms, and general messaging, telepsychiatry can remove the need for face-to-face consultation and make counselling sessions accessible across inaccessible pockets of the country. While an audio platform can be used for mild cases of mental stress, a video platform can be used for more severe cases to also notice non-verbal gestures, eye movement, postures, etc.  A counselling session with a psychiatrist or mental health expert can cost anything between Rs 800 to Rs 2500 or more, surveys have shown. When the overall duration of the treatment spans over several sessions, the cost involved can turn out to be a burden for people belonging to lower-middle-class, middle-class families, and unaffordable for the poor. Even though the National Mental healthcare Act 2017 has mandated insurance companies to include coverage for mental health, it is yet to be seen how everything evolves. In such an environment, telepsychiatry can be a big boon by eliminating the transportation cost of patients. Other than that, it can also help professionals to minimise the need for proficient medical infrastructure thereby reducing the costs involved.  A mental health disorder can make a person miserable and cause problems in daily life. Depending on the severity of the disorder, circumstances, and various other factors, the symptoms can worsen at any time leading to agitated/aggressive behaviour, psychoactive substance use, and self-harm. In such cases where there can arise the need for immediate intervention, telepsychiatry services can reduce the response time. It can be crucial for patients who would require immediate counselling or special attention. Telepsychiatry has the potential to reach out to a larger base of the population suffering from mental health conditions. However, it is also important to develop standardised templates to cater to the needs of patients from different backgrounds. Majority of the methods available today are designed for the urban crowd. To make telepsychiatry more democratic, it is essential to use standardised methods and tools in smaller towns and rural settings as well.  (The writer is global head for mental health at Round Glass, Managing Trustee Poddar Foundation)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/mental-healthcare-through-telehealth-927462.html
15-12-2020||Panorama||In five years, education technology will progress tremendously: Srinivasan Ramani||Pioneering internet connectivity in India in the early 1980s, Srinivasan Ramani was the first Indian to be inducted into The Internet Hall of Fame in 2014. As founding director of National Centre for Software Technology (rechristened C-DAC), his leadership and vision led to the creation of the nationwide Education and Research Network (ERNET), a platform dedicated to support the needs of the research and education community within the country.  In an interaction with Rasheed Kappan of DH, Ramani traces the early days of the internet in India while seeking a relook at the state of online education during the pandemic era. The beginning of the Internet revolution in India was linked to the premier educational institutes. Could you recall experiences from those initial days? That was a great time for certain research institutions. The research scientists, irrespective of their disciplines, were all excited by the prospect of the Internet. Many physicists and chemists took great personal interest in getting the necessary infrastructure installed in their offices. If not available, they would travel for long distances to access those facilities. During 1988-90, we had a colleague from IIT Kanpur who was very keen that the institute should be connected with internet. The link was critical for international connections. He came to Bombay and told us that they needed internet connection badly but it was impossible to get the telecommunication facility to Kanpur. To get around this, we, the ERNET team and the IIT Kanpur computer centre director, worked out a scheme. We resolved it in a peculiar way. IIT Kanpur built itself a local area network, with local cables connected to different buildings, to enable sending inter-department mails. The computer centre would then write on tape the email that was supposed to go abroad and to other cities in India. The mails, put on media such as tape or floppy discs, were then delivered by speed post to Bombay. It would take a day or two. In Bombay, the mails would be read through a reading device, fed into Ethernet and then get into the global Internet. So, somebody in IIT Kanpur could send an email to someone in the University of Illinois in three days. The reply would take another three days. It was still a great improvement because you could send a 20-page paper without worrying about a big envelope, big stamp, a lot of money, and a month or two for delivery. We called it the floppy mail. After initial hiccups, Internet penetration progressed slowly. Why was the spread slow? I feel if we had good telecommunications in those days, it would have been fantastic. But what we did have was the enthusiasm of teams of scientists who said we will not work without the Internet. However, what eventually was possible in a research lab or an advanced institute, could not happen in every arts and science college and every high school. Millions and millions of students were denied these facilities for years because we were still developing in telecom. But great days lay ahead. In the mid-1990s, Indian telecom underwent a change when monopoly control over it was removed and private players were allowed to enter. By 1995, they were into the internet scene as well. Privatisation of telecom and the huge revolution that followed in the telecom sector made a very big change. Without that kind of change, I don’t think Indian software technology would be where it is today. Propelled by social-distancing needs, education has shifted online. But this transition has not been smooth. Your thoughts. The real change is now. The same schools and colleges that used to threaten students that their phones would be confiscated if brought them to the campus are driving that change. Their idea about the phone as a tool of distraction, as an enemy of education, has to be given up. We have to develop the confidence that we can somehow share values with our students that will make them self-disciplined. We should use the smartphone as a very important instrument. Finally, that position is becoming unavoidable. Today, even the very poor want them. I know a domestic servant earning Rs 2,000 per month spent Rs 15,000 to get a good phone so that her son could access the best school lessons. In the search for hi-tech solutions, are we failing to fully exploit the potential of existing low-tech options? Even when devices are available, the knowledge about them is poor. For instance, there are Bluetooth speakers available in the market that can easily connect to smartphones. This way, the sound can be amplified so that an entire classroom can hear. It can help even children with hearing issues. If we seriously scale up at the government level, a lot of educational content in spoken form can be disseminated through speaker-linked phones. We need it because it is easy to create content in Indian languages in spoken form. Almost everyone is comfortable if good spoken material is recorded and made available as valuable educational material. Technology, high or low, can face accessibility issues. For instance, there was this boy whose phone was not picking up signals to access his school lessons online. He went to a mobile service shop where he was told that the signals were not going through the metal corrugated roof of his house. The boy found that the phone worked well outside. How do you think will online education evolve in India in the future? I suspect that in the next five years, education technology will progress tremendously in India. I see that already happening. A few months ago, I had gone to an engineering college in Mumbai where education had shifted online post-Covid. They had tied up with an online course provider, after which 3,500 courses relevant to engineering became available to the students. Within three months, students had completed the course, taken the online examination and earned 13,000 certificates. This amazing turn has brought to Indian education a terrific flexibility. An electronics engineer can now learn something about mechanical engineering, unlike earlier. The normal system does not allow this. Did reluctance to release spectrum play a role? Tremendous improvements occurred when we got the freedom. But there was a time when we could not get the required spectrum. For research, we needed one or two wireless frequencies to send computer data over radio frequency. The people controlling access to the radio spectrum wanted to know why we were asking since they had told ‘no’ even to the Ahmedabad police. So, we had to wait for a few years to get spectrum. But today, look at how much spectrum we have. Spectrum earns lakhs and crores of rupees. How many million cell phone signals are being carried at the same time! But this electromagnetic spectrum has always been there. It has been ours. But why did we not use it? We did not encourage enterprise that goes out and tries out new technology. We are very cautious that somebody might misuse the spectrum and we may not have enough capacity and it may be required for the defence. We have all kinds of cautious thoughts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/in-five-years-education-technology-will-progress-tremendously-srinivasan-ramani-927389.html
15-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Dawn of compassion||Norman Cole, my Scottish boss in Munnar in the 1960s, was a man of few words.  However, he could be expansive when in a good mood.  Once while travelling together in his jeep he narrated this story. In the 1950s, Munnar’s British tea planters sometimes spent the Christmas holidays in Eravikulam, which bordered their tea estates, either trophy-hunting or trout-fishing. Eravikulam then was not a national park as it is now. It was a wildlife preserve belonging to James Finlay and Company, a Scottish tea major who owned most of the tea gardens in Munnar too.  To shoot a stag with record-sized antlers was the cherished dream of most hunters then. The trophy would be sent to Van Ingen and Van Ingen, the well-known taxidermists in Bangalore, to be mounted for display in their bungalows.  Many of these relics can still be seen in Munnar’s tea museum. A keen hunter, Cole once decided to try his luck during Christmas 1954. Intending to camp from December 24 to 26 in the log cabin deep in the heart of Eravikulam, he carried the required provisions for himself and three tribal guides. At the crack of dawn on December 25, Cole set out with his rifle. Soon he spotted a small herd of sambar deer grazing placidly in a valley. Through his binoculars, he noticed there was an exceptionally large stag among them. Its coat was almost greyish black, an indication of its age, and its magnificently branching antlers, he surmised, measured well over 40 inches – a record ‘head’ that was eminently shootable, he decided. Crawling, Cole began to stalk the stag, creeping closer and closer through the waist-high grass carpeting the hillside.  When he was about 80 yards from his unsuspecting quarry, he paused behind a boulder to regain his breath. Then, pulse racing, Cole trained his rifle on the stag’s bristly shoulder glistening in the rising sun. He squinted down the sights, his forefinger curled lightly around the trigger.  That was as far as he got – for some indefinable force made him hold his fire. He just stood there, mesmerized by the stag’s air of regality. Slowly Cole lowered his rifle, unable to take his eyes off the splendid stag.  It was the day of Christmas, he reminded himself a trifle ruefully, which heralds peace and goodwill. The giant stag must be spared, he decided magnanimously, even if it meant losing the chance of a lifetime. Compassion had triumphed over blood-lust.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/dawn-of-compassion-927460.html
15-12-2020||Second Edit||Arogya Kavacha: Fix the problems||The failure of Karnataka’s government-run ambulance services to ferry accident and medical emergency patients to the hospital within the critical ‘golden period’ is costing the state heavily in terms of human lives. People, whose lives could have been saved had they reached the hospital early, are dying. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report for 2014 to 2019, the Arogya Kavacha ambulance service reached the patient to a hospital within 30 minutes in 72% of the cases and in an hour in nearly 50% of cases. The objective of the 108 Arogya Kavacha service is to ensure speedy response to a patient in need of emergency medical attention.  The aim is to reach a patient within minutes of the receipt of a phone call. However, the CAG report indicates that the Arogya Kavacha’s ambulance service is not as swift and efficient as it should be. To be fair, the Arogya Kavacha has helped lakhs of people across the state since its launch in 2008. It has ferried patients from remote villages to hospitals. Its ambulance personnel have risen to the occasion countless times to give emergency support to patients, even helping in delivering new-born babies in the ambulances. However, it needs to speed up its response to be truly effective. It is well known that in case of road accidents or medical emergencies, the first hour is the ‘golden hour’; if timely medical treatment is given during this period, a victim or patient has a higher chance of survival. Prompt medical attention can not only reduce the severity of injuries but also saves lives. Slow response of ambulance services can thus make a huge difference in saving lives. There are several reasons for Arogya Kavacha’s below par performance. A part of the reason is that there is a shortage of ambulances and personnel, which means that many areas are still poorly served by the ambulance service and it takes time to even reach the patient, let alone ferry her to a hospital. Besides, many jobs are vacant, which means that many ambulances do not have trained attendants. Public irresponsibility too has undermined Arogya Kavacha’s work. It has been reported that around 60% of the calls made to the emergency service are prank calls, which means that much of the service’s energies are being wasted by the public. None of the problems that beset the Arogya Kavacha are impossible to fix. The government must act to ensure the public is able to tap its full potential.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/arogya-kavacha-fix-the-problems-927447.html

He has been booked under Section 306 of IPC that deals with abetment of suicide,” a senior police officer told DH. After his arrest, Hemnath was sent to judicial custody by a local court on Tuesday. Police said Chitra (29) and Hemnath had registered their marriage a few months ago and had planned to hold a formal ceremony in January. “They seem to have had differences over a lot of issues and it is believed that the couple had an argument before they checked-in to the hotel where Chitra was found dead,” the officer added. A separate probe by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) is also underway. Chitra’s mother had also blamed Hemnath for her daughter’s suicide. The police also said it has been established, after going through call records, that the actor last spoke to her mother before taking the extreme step. Chitra was a popular face on television, acting in serials and hosting shows. She shot into limelight after her role in Saravanan Meenatchi, a popular television serial and went on to become popular. She was acting in Pandian Stores, another popular television soap broadcast on an entertainment channel. Chitra was found dead inside her hotel room in Nazarathpet near Poonamallee on the outskirts of Chennai in the early hours of December 9. Hemnath had told police that he was waiting outside the room as Chitra locked herself inside the room to take a shower. The couple had checked-in to the hotel after Chitra completed her shooting for a serial.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/husband-arrested-for-tamil-tv-actor-chitra-s-suicide-927443.html
15-12-2020||South||Kamal Haasan praises 'Yusuf Khan,' says Indian democracy is 'ill'||Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Kamal Haasan on Monday praised 18th century rebel commander Mohammed Yusuf Khan for his 'fight against the Britishers' and alleged that Indian democracy was now afflicted by illness. Hailing Khan aka Marudanayagam (1725-64), Haasan said he fought against the Britishers and was hanged by them through a conspiracy and not in a war. This happened about '100 years before the Sepoy Mutiny' (1857, the first war of Indian independence) and Khan's fight against the Englishmen is the 'first Sepoy mutiny' for independence, he said, addressing a party event. Haasan had aspired to produce a film on the life and times of Marudanayagam, but the project did not take off. Subsequently, he said the struggle was continued by men like Tipu Sultan and Velu Nachiar for independence and it was achieved. Like the bygone saga of valour, another 'revolution' should be ushered in as Indian democracy was afflicted by illness, he said. "It will not be an exaggeration to say that Indian democracy is today afflicted by illness," he said. The Election Commission, Haasan said, has denied the torch light symbol allotted in the 2019 Lok Sabha election to the party and added that it could not deter them. Earlier in the day, he said in Madurai that he would contest the Assembly elections, but declined to specify the constituency. If voted to power, he assured the people of an honest and corruption free government by his party. On the farmers' protest in Delhi, he said his part workers have taken part in the stir in the national capital. On Sunday, launching his campaign for the Assembly elections from Madurai, he hinted at the possibility of political realignment. Also, he said he was 'continuing' the dream of late chief Minister M G Ramachandran to make Madurai the second capital of Tamil Nadu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-praises-yusuf-khan-says-indian-democracy-is-ill-927488.html

Out of the 978 samples lifted from the IIT-M since December 1, a total of 183 people have tested positive till date and results for 25 specimens alone were yet to be received, Tamil Nadu Health Secretary, J Radhakrishnan said. From 104 on Monday, with the addition of 79 more positive cases, the IIT-M's Covid-19 tally stood at 183. For testing, as many as 539 samples were taken on Monday alone which includes workers in addition to students and from this batch, 79 tested positive, he said. The overall positivity rate vis-a-vis the institution has however gone down to 15 per cent from about 20 per cent seen earlier, he said. A majority of those affected were students and the rest being people like workers in canteens. All of them are being treated at the government-run King's Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research here. Following the outbreak, the institute shut all its departments and classes were being held online. Allaying fears over further spread of the virus in the area, the official told reporters that IIT-M was only a localised cluster. Earlier, similar localised outbreaks were witnessed elsewhere like in a large textile store and in a gathering for a feast and hence, people should wear masks always without fail and follow all other norms to help prevent the virus spread, he said. Testing would be done for those associated with facilities like canteens in educational institutions and mansions for early identification of positive cases and treatment, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/79-more-covid-19-cases-from-iit-m-tally-now-183-927618.html

So far, only Antigen test was being insisted upon. However, there were concerns over the accuracy of the negative test results delivered by Antigen test. As many as 299 persons, including 245 staff, 51 pilgrims and three others, have tested positive for Covid-19 so far since the pilgrimage began on November 16. Various organisations, including the Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association, had raised concerns over the increase in cases. According to the fresh advisory on Sabarimala issued by the state health department, as the number of Covid-19 cases at Sabarimala were increasing even after all were tested, it became necessary to conduct RT-PCR technology based test for all pilgrims and officials. Covid-negative result of RT-PCR or RtLamp or Express NAT tests conducted at NABL-accredited ICMR approved laboratories 24 hours prior to reaching the base camp would be required. Kerala Health Minister K K Shailaja said that 31 per cent increase in number of Covid patients was reported in Pathanamthitta district where the Ayyappa temple is situated and 11 per cent increase was reported in nearby Kottayam, through which most pilgrims travel to Sabarimala. The state was also under concerns of further surge due to the flouting of Covid-19 norms during local body electioneering in the state. Hence, the people should strictly adhere to the Covid-19 norms. The daily number of pilgrims allowed at Sabarimala was initially fixed at 1,000 for weekdays and 2,000 for weekends. It was later increased to 2,000 and 3,000 respectively considering the plea of the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages temple, citing the steep fall in revenue from the temple. Various Hindu outfits had raised objection against it citing that in case Covid-19 spreads among temple priests, it may affect the routine rituals also.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-mandates-negative-rt-pcr-test-for-pilgrims-from-december-26-927645.html

He repeated the same offence in next year as well. Another person who dragged a pet by tying to his two-wheeler at Koothatukulam on the suburbs of Ernakulam about 10 years ago was imposed with a fie of Rs 160 after a prolonged legal battle. For these reasons, animal rights activists did not see much hope of effective punishment to the 62-year-old man in Ernakulam who recently dragged a dog by tying to his car in a bid to abandon it. Unless the laws against animal cruelty are made stringent, there won't be much relief to the animals from the cruelty they face, activists say. Ambili Purackal, founder co-ordinator of Daya Animal Welfare Organisation, said that the incident received swift action from the authorities only because it went viral on the social media. On the same day, a meat shop owner at Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district inflicted deep injury on a dog with a knife injuring the dog critically, but the police did not act against the accused. Latha Indira, a member of People for Animal in Kerala, said that a dog was found dead with it hands and legs tied using steel strings near Varkala on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram about two weeks back. The local police registered a case only after PFA members met the police higher-ups and pressurised. Ambili and Latha said that apart from the feeble punishments warranted by the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), there was a lack of awareness among police personnel about the need to initiate police action. Ambili said that the police often maintain that they were already burdened with crimes against people and don't have time to look into complaints of cruelty towards animals. Even as many animal rights organisations initiated campaigns for enhancing the punishments for cruelty towards animals, any positive outcome was yet to come. At present, the fine for various offences against animals is only in the range of Rs 50 to Rs 500. The law warrants imprisonment for repeated offenders, but it is hardly enforced. Latha said that the scant regard people had for the law was evident from the incident in Thiruvananthapuram in which a person allegedly shot a dog even after a similar case was pending against him. Ambili, who initiated the rescue of the dragged dog in Ernakulam, said that she was pursuing many such cases of cruelty against animals over years and she did not receive a satisfactory legal outcome in any of the cases. Hence she was not moved as the accused in the present case also obtained bail easily. His driving licence and car's registration were suspended as the incident triggered resentment in social media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-laws-lack-teeth-to-prevent-animal-cruelty-say-activists-927672.html

Learning lessons from the IIT-M episode, the Tamil Nadu government has stepped up efforts to test students living in college hostels and mansions to prevent another cluster. Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said a total of 978 samples, including those of students, research scholars, and staff, were collected from the IIT-M campus. Of 953 samples, results of which are known, 183 have returned positive – 104 till Monday, and 79 on Tuesday. The emergence of a cluster at the IIT-M came as the Tamil Nadu government reopened classes for final semester students at arts and science and engineering colleges on December 7. Officials have blamed the mess at IIT-M campus for Covid-19 spread, and have now asked institutions to serve meals to students at their rooms, instead of asking them to take their food at a common place. “After the IIT-M episode came into public domain, Chief Minister (Edappadi K Palaniswami) asked us to go for saturation test. We have so far tested 978 persons from the campus. Results of 953 have come out of which 183 are positive. 25 samples are under process. This is a big lesson for all of us,” Radhakrishnan said. He also appealed to students and people in general not to “remove your masks” while in a group thinking that Covid-19 “has gone away.” “The responsibility of preventing Covid-19 spread inside the college campuses rests on the management as well as the government and civic body cannot do everything. We want compliance of Covid-19 rules inside the campuses,” he said. Radhakrishnan said the government has advised testing of students in hostels, people living in mansions, and those who stay at working women’s hostels. The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is also planning to conduct fever camps inside college campuses to detect Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, the IIT-M said the total number positive cases as on December 15 stood at 183. “With this testing has been completed. Next round of testing for everyone will be after 10 days,” an update from the institute said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/with-covid-19-cases-in-iit-m-still-on-rise-tamil-nadu-to-test-students-in-college-hostels-927674.html

Simultaneous with the launch on Tuesday, Rs 1,252 crore was credited into the bank accounts of 9.48 lakh farmers who have lost their crops during 2019. Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that his government took the responsibility of supporting the farmers in their difficult times. “We have brought the free crop insurance scheme, without levying any burden of premium on the farmers. Whereas during the previous (Chandrababu Naidu) government, farmers had to pay their share, besides the contribution of the state and central governments in the premium amount,” Reddy said pointing that the premium amount was discouraging the farmers from enrolling under the scheme. “However, neither the state nor the central governments used to doggedly pursue the crop insurance claims and farmers were receiving the amount very late or losing it altogether. To resolve this, our government has decided to process the claims in a fast-track mode,” the CM said. “From 2016-19, the previous government had spent on an average Rs 393 crore per annum towards the insurance premium, while the farmers had paid about Rs 290 crore. And only about 20 lakh farmers were enrolled for insurance coverage during the TDP regime.” “Now, 49.80 lakh farmers are under the insurance cover, and the state government is paying Rs 971 crore towards the premium in 2019-20,” the chief minister said adding that 45.96 lakh hectares of cropland are brought under insurance. Crop loss compensation for 2020 will be paid in April 2021, after the Planning Department submits its report. The state is also purchasing germinated and decoloured grains at a graded MSP to ensure that no farmer suffers financially, the CM said. Reddy said that the recent Nivar cyclone caused crop loss enumeration is completed, and the compensation would be paid by December 31. Chief Minister Reddy said that 10,641 Rythu Bharosa Kendrams are set up, integrated with village secretariats to support the farmers. The government has initiated e-cropping, where details of all crops are uploaded in a database, including the crop loss numbers. All this information, crop loss compensations would be displayed at the RBKs for social audit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-cm-jaganmohan-launches-ysr-free-crop-insurance-scheme-for-farmers-927681.html

However, he had a caveat for them to join hands in politics – ideologies should match. While Kamal Haasan has already hit the campaign trail for the crucial 2021 Assembly polls, Rajinikanth is expected to float his political party in January next year. Both project themselves as change agents in Tamil Nadu that has seen DMK and AIADMK coming to power alternatively since 1967. Ever since they announced their intention to take the political plunge, there has been speculation that they might come together. The speculation mounted early this month when Rajinikanth finally said he would announce the date for the launch of his party on the last day of 2020 with the superstar’s aides maintaining that he may not be the chief ministerial candidate. Well-wishers and common friends of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan have been pushing for an alliance between them. However, neither side has taken any concrete step towards the potential tie-up. Speaking to reporters in Kovilpatti, in Thoothukudi district, Kamal Haasan said both have come to politics for bringing about a change. "He has not made his ideology and policies clear. We cannot consider what is said as a one-liner as ideology. Let him first spell out his ideology. Then, we will talk. We are good friends and we are just a phone call away. We can talk on the phone whenever we wish. We will help each other if we can,” the actor said. “If our ideologies match and if it (coming together) helps the people of Tamil Nadu, we are ready to join hands by shedding our egos. I have said this earlier and there is no change in the stand,” he added. Taking to Twitter, the actor also sought to claim the legacy of late matinee idol M G Ramachandran. “MGR was always a people's man. He was not called a DMK man when he was in the DMK, and an AIADMK man when he founded the party. He belongs to the people. I grew up on his lap. Those who did not even look at MGR’s face, do remember this,” he said. Kamal Haasan also posted a video of MGR kissing him on his forehead while presenting an award in the 1980s.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/may-join-hands-with-rajini-if-ideologies-converge-kamal-haasan-927686.html
15-12-2020||South||Kerala local body election results on Dec 16||It is a D-day for the main stream political parties in Kerala on Wednesday as the results of the local body election will be announced. With the Assembly elections hardly five months away, the local body elections are considered as semi-finals and a trend setter. Polling were held to 21,865 wards in 1,199 local bodies in the three-phase polls. The ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) is concerned if the series of allegations against the state government would have its impact, while the Congress -led United Democratic Front (UDF), which is the main opposition party, is hopeful of taking advantage of anti-incumbency factor against the LDF government. The BJP-led NDA, which has been increasing its presence in electoral politics in Kerala over the years, is pinning hopes of improving its position further by taking advantage of resentment against the LDF and UDF. In the 2015 local body election, the left-front had an upper hand by winning around 690 local bodies, while the UDF got majority in around 470. The BJP that won around 15 local bodies including Palakkad municipality made a major stride in Thiruvananthapuram corporation by emerging in the second place to LDF and making it hung. Hence the BJP has high hopes of winning Thiruvananthapuram corporation this time and put an end to the 25 year long LDF tenure. BJP is also having high hopes in Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-local-body-election-results-on-dec-16-927695.html

Sources said that Velachery, which has more than three lakh voters, has been identified for the MNM president. “Senior leaders in the party and other office-bearers feel Velachery is the right choice for Kamal Haasan to make his electoral debut. A formal proposal has been made to our party president in this regard. But the final decision rests with him,” a source said, on condition of anonymity. Kamal Haasan, who did not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, had on Monday announced that he will test his electoral fortunes during the April-May Assembly polls. However, he refused to divulge the name of the constituency. Velachery Assembly constituency, which came into being in 2011 after the delimitation exercise, has a sizable chunk of IT professionals, middle and upper-middle class voters. Besides, Velachery and a few areas in the constituency are a favourite for retired government employees, to whom Kamal Haasan’s policies and his charisma may be amenable, the leaders feel. MNM leaders told DH that Kamal Haasan strikes a chord with urban voters, who had voted in considerable numbers for party candidates in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The party had scored more than one lakh votes each in four Parliamentary constituencies — Chennai (North), Chennai (South), Sriperumbudur, and Coimbatore. In Velachery, which comes under Chennai (South), MNM candidate R Rangarajan had polled 23,099 votes. In all, MNM had polled 15.76 lakh votes in its debut elections in 2019, scoring to 3.72%. “Urban voters are our base and it is only fitting that the party’s chief ministerial face contests from an urban constituency. It is youngsters and first-time voters who yearn for a change and freshness more than others. Velachery is the home for many IT professionals and they may express their confidence in Kamal Haasan if he contests from there,” the source explained. Velachery, which is currently represented by DMK’s ‘Vagai’ Chandrashekar, is prone to flooding and several localities come under the water during heavy rains. Several upscale areas like Adyar, Thiruvanmiyur, Besant Nagar and Sashtri Nagar are part of the constituency that houses the affluent, middle class and upper-middle class voters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/2021-tamil-nadu-assembly-election-kamal-haasan-to-contest-from-chennai-s-velachery-927701.html

The opening of the 'heavenly' gate during Vaikunta Ekadasi, an auspicious day dedicated to Lord Vishnu during Margashirsha (December-January) at the 8th century temple attracts several lakhs of devotees, many of whom throng the shrine all through the night. "This time due to the pandemic and owing to the implementation of standard operating procedure laid down by the state government, it has been decided not to allow devotees between 4.30 am and 6.30 am on Vaikunta Ekadasi," a senior Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department official told PTI. He said the devotees would however be allowed after the ceremonial opening of the gate but "they should either register (online) or purchase a darshan ticket to enter the temple." Entry of devotees will be regulated depending upon the crowd.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/devotees-not-to-be-allowed-for-sorgavasal-opening-at-chennais-parthasarathy-temple-927722.html
15-12-2020||State||SC sets aside Karnataka HC order on eviction of woman from in-laws place under Senior Citizens Act||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that a social welfare legislation, the Senior Citizens Act 2007 cannot be interpreted in a manner to evict the daughter-in-law from her shared household. The daughter-in-law is otherwise entitled to the shares under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The top court set aside the Karnataka High Court's order of September 17, 2019 directing a woman to evict the residential house belonging to her mother-in-law in North Bengaluru. The HC had upheld the order of the Deputy Commissioner, passed under the Senior Citizens Act, 2007. The HC also said the remedy of the woman for maintenance and shelter lied only against her estranged husband. "Allowing the Senior Citizens Act 2007 to have an overriding force and effect in all situations, irrespective of competing entitlements of a woman to a right in a shared household within the meaning of the PWDV Act 2005, would defeat the object and purpose sought to be achieved in enacting the latter legislation," a three-judge bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud said. The top court allowed the woman's appeal with Rs 25,000 cost and restrained her in-laws and husband who tried to dispossess her from the premises and also from selling the house for one year to enable her to pursue her remedies under the Domestic Violence Act. "We have also seen the series of transactions which took place in respect of the property: the woman's spouse purchased it in his own name a few months before the marriage but subsequently sold it, after a few years, under a registered sale deed at the same price to his father (the father-in-law of the woman), who in turn gifted it to his spouse i.e. the mother-in-law after divorce proceedings were instituted by the husband," the bench said. The court said merely because the ownership of the property has been subsequently transferred to her in-laws or that her estranged spouse was now residing separately, was no ground to deprive the woman of the protection under the Domestic Violence Act. The court pointed out that the law protecting the interest of senior citizens is intended to ensure that they are not left destitute, or at the mercy of their children or relatives. Equally, the purpose of the PWDV Act 2005 cannot be ignored by a sleight of statutory interpretation. "Both sets of legislations have to be harmoniously construed. Hence the right of a woman to secure a residence order in respect of a shared household cannot be defeated by the simple expedient of securing an order of eviction by adopting the summary procedure under the Senior Citizens Act 2007," the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/sc-sets-aside-karnataka-hc-order-on-eviction-of-woman-from-in-laws-place-under-senior-citizens-act-927670.html

However, employees have given the state government a three-month deadline to act on its promise, failing which they will be back on the streets. During a truce meeting on Sunday, Transport Minister Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol and Revenue Minister R Ashoka had agreed to address nine demands of the employees subject to certain conditions. However, employees made a U-turn, insisting the government fulfil their main demand — that they be considered as regular government staff — which left the government in a fix. On Monday, with the government reluctant to commit to the main demand, Kodihalli Chandrashekar insisted that the transport minister visit Freedom Park and hand over the proceedings of the meeting and an assurance letter. Meanwhile, Savadi and other ministers decided to send BMTC chairperson Nandiesha Reddy as the government’s emissary. Reddy, accompanied by Yelahanka MLA and BDA Chairperson SR Vishwanath and MLA Rajugowda, visited the protesting employees and handed over the letter. But more drama was to follow. When Chandrashekhar showed the letter to the protesting employees, they raised objections to the government’s reply on implementing the 6th Pay Commission recommendations. Transport minister had said the government will try its best keeping in mind the financial condition of the state. But it wasn’t enough, as employees, particularly women workers, wanted the minister to come down to Freedom Park and clarify on the stand. To resolve the deadlock, Chandrashekhar spoke to Nandiesha Reddy over the phone and was assured that the government will address the issue sensibly. Following the assurance, Chandrashekhar announced that the strike had been called off, but workers refused to budge and criticised the leader’s stand. Chandrashekhar spoke to the employees for more than an hour and convinced them to withdraw the strike at around4.15 pm. “We are calling off the strike with immediate effect. But we have given a deadline of three months to the government. If the government does not act on its promises, we will come back again here to protest,” Chandrashekhar told workers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-buses-to-roll-as-transport-strike-ends-927456.html
15-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Fist fights, slogans, abuses: Ruckus in Karnataka Legislative Council session||The Karnataka Legislative Council, which is considered as the House of Elders, witnessed a new low as its members pushed, pulled and abused each other on Tuesday.  It started when Deputy Chairman S L Dharmegowda of the JD(S) occupied the chair before Chairman K Pratapachandra Shetty (Congress) arrived. This angered the Congress as Dharmegowda would have allowed the no-confidence motion against Shetty to be taken up.  The BJP, with the help of the JD(S), wanted to dislodge Shetty through the no-trust motion.  Congress MLCs forced Dharmegowda out of the chair by pulling him, even as the BJP tried to stop this. In the melee, MLCs were seen fist-fighting and hurling abuses. Slogans were raised and papers were torn. The Council Marshalls could do little as MLCs were too enraged.  Having physically removed Dharmegowda from the chair, Congress’s Chandrashekhar Patil occupied it with the party’s MLCs standing guard. They wanted Shetty to occupy it, even as BJP MLCs protested. Finally, Shetty managed to trudge past the pushing and shoving. “I am adjourning the session sine die,” he said and left.  Leader of Opposition S R Patil of the Congress said Dharmegowda occupying the chair was against the rules. “How can he take the chair without permission? Also, the chairperson had rejected the BJP’s no-confidence motion saying it was not in order,” he said.  RDPR Minister K S Eshwarappa said the Council had not seen such scenes in its 120-year history. “The entire country has seen how Congress has behaved,” he said.  “We wanted to move the motion. Dharmegowda had taken the chair, which meant that the JD(S) would have supported the motion,” Eshwarappa said.  Tuesday’s session was convened under the pressure of the state government. Shetty had similarly adjourned the session sine die on December 10, following which the BJP had petitioned the Governor.  “The Chairperson should have said he will allow for discussion on this. He has adjourned this earlier too. I condemn this behaviour. We will meet Governor seeking directions to convene the session again. Our fight will continue,” Revenue Minister R Ashoka said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/fist-fights-slogans-abuses-ruckus-in-karnataka-legislative-council-session-927556.html

The government is likely to consider promulgating an ordinance to give effect to this law.  Gowda pointed out that the existing Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964, had enough scope for action to be taken against those who violate its provisions.  “In 2010, the then BJP government tabled a Bill containing provisions that had some specific communities in mind in order to target them on the issue of cow slaughter, imprisonment was increased from one year to seven years. Even as the Opposition Congress and the JD(S) staged protests, the majority BJP got it passed and it was sent to the Governor for assent,” Gowda said.  “My party leaders and I met the then Governor T N Chaturvedi and urged him not to approve the Bill, which was sent to the President. We met the President and apprised him of how Bill’s provisions were against the interests of communities and farmers. And then, the government changed hands and the Bill was withdrawn,” Gowda said.  “Given this background, the BJP has once again tabled the Bill in the legislature to create unrest in society and turn people’s lives upside down. The JD(S) will completely oppose this Bill,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/deve-gowda-says-jds-to-completely-oppose-bjps-anti-cow-slaughter-bill-927574.html

After knowing that it had no majority, it was the Congress’s duty to get the chairman to resign,” Yediyurappa told reporters.  The BJP, with the help of the JD(S), wanted to dislodge Shetty through a no-confidence motion that was moved last week.  “Once a no-confidence motion is tabled, according to legalities and experts, (Shetty) is not eligible to take the chair,” Yediyurappa pointed out.  Till Monday evening, the Congress was under the impression that it had enough numbers in the upper house along with the JD(S) to thwart the BJP’s no-confidence motion. But, the Legislative Council witnessed ugly scenes earlier in the day when the Deputy Chairman S L Dharmegowda of the JD(S) took the chair even before Shetty arrived and the bell was still ringing. That’s when the Congress realized that the JD(S) was in on the BJP’s plan. Congress MLCs dragged Dharmegowda out from the chair.  “The JD(S) had made it clear that the deputy chairman will be seated. If (we) didn’t have a majority, (Shetty) would have continued. So, it’s not a question of whether the bell was ringing. The question is, does the Congress have a majority?” Yediyurappa asked.  “A deputy chairman being dragged by his neck is unprecedented in India’s history. There’s no better example to show the Congress’s culture. At least now, the chairman should throw his resignation and leave,” Yediyurappa asserted.  All BJP and JD(S) MLCs will head to Raj Bhavan and petition Governor Vajubhai R Vala on the developments, Yediyurappa added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cm-b-s-yediyurappa-asks-council-chairman-to-quit-hits-out-at-congress-927577.html

Whether it is the Fort precinct or structures of the Victorian Neo-Gothic architectural style, Indo-Saracenic Revival, or Neoclassical styles – it is a great visual treat. In fact, a walk from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the headquarters of Central Railway to the Western Railway headquarters at Churchgate, is a visual treat. “The hurried, often harried resident of the city, traversing through the Fort area and thereabouts, seldom finds the luxury of time away from necessary engagements of business and everyday commitments to appreciate the veritable open-air museum that the area was made out to be, over a period of hundred years ranging from the mid-19th century to mid-20th century,” said Venkatesh, an avid photographer, researcher, traveller and storyteller. Venkatesh, who is associated with Mumbai Research Centre (MRC) of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, is holding various events and 'Jashn-e-Dastaan-e-Mumbai', during which he will be conducting 'Heritage Quiz' and 'Look Up Mumbai' virtual walk. According to him, the city as it evolved into its Neo-Gothic imperial grandeur representative of the Urbs Prima in Indis (the first/foremost city of India), and later to its more democratic, private architecture, inspired by global developments of Art Deco, provides us with a wide array of architectural attractions that support an extraordinary exhibition of sculptural embellishments. “These embellishments range from thematic, symbolic iconography to representations of key public figures, both Indian and British, that jointly created the city’s economic fabric, that made it a magnet for myriad commercial endeavours, supported by multiple communities of entrepreneurs, professionals, labourers, all intermeshed internally and externally networked across the oceans with multiple nations in diverse initiatives,” he said. This photographic walk focusses upon the sculptures on both public and private buildings, explaining their architecture, socio-economic and political context, hinging upon modern Mumbai’s evolution, catapulted to international destiny by both serendipity as well as intentional and industrious efforts of its populace involved in trading, banking, shipping, mills and civic governance. Some of the building tops that would be covered in the virtual tour are Crawford Market, BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation, CSMT, Churchgate, Bombay High Court, University of Mumbai, Regal Cinema, Institute of Science, Wellington Fountain, Elphinstone College, Sassoon Library, New India Assurance, Marshall Building, Port House, MacKinnon Mackenzie, Construction House, Kamani Chambers, Mulji Fountain, Laxmi Building, Western Building, Onlooker Building and Canada Building. The quiz is brought together by Venkatesh and Raamesh GR and Pravin Subramanian, who while specialising in their own areas of expertise, have come together to deliver a unique, multi-dimensional content in the quiz, that focusses on the tangible, intangible and natural heritage of Mumbai metropolitan region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/free-open-air-museum-heritage-expert-highlights-mumbais-architectural-attractions-927560.html

Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar opposed the proposal to extend the time, but MLC Ashok alias Bhai Jagtap of the ruling Congress countered him. Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik submitted the breach of privilege notices against Goswami and Ranaut to the office of the state Assembly Speaker on September 7. Sarnaik had a spat with Ranaut in the past after she compared Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The MLA had also sought re-opening of an alleged abetment to suicide case of 2018 in which Goswami was arrested by Mumbai Police recently. Goswami is currently out on bail. Jagtap and Shiv Sena MLC Manisha Kayande had also submitted notices against Goswami on September 8. On the same day, Jagtap also submitted a notice against Ranaut over her "PoK" remark. BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar, speaking in the state Assembly on Tuesday, wondered if the scope of breach of privilege is being expanded. "When was the notice accepted and converted into a motion? Was the due process, of 29 members standing in favour of the notice on the floor of the House, followed?" he asked. He said the breach of privilege was to be used against those creating hurdles in the functioning of the House. BJP MLA Atul Bhatkalkar said "why use the Legislative Assembly when defamation laws are there to take action against certain individuals". State Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the business listed on the agenda was only to grant an extension to the privileges committee to submit its report. The privileges committee chairman, Deepak Kesarkar, said the notices were accepted by the Chair and forwarded to the committee. "Any discussion on this issue is the encroachment of the Speaker's rights," he said. State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said all legislators have special privileges, and "what is their use if they are not used". Assembly Speaker Nana Patole said Uddhav Thackeray is the chief minister and head of the state. "It is not a matter of individuals but the post and any insult of the post is insult of the state and the Legislature," he said. In the Council, Darekar opposed the proposal to extend the time for the privileges committee to submit its report. "It cannot be a breach of privilege...because we know the reason. The court has passed strictures on the government's action against Goswami," Darekar said. "The notices of breach of privilege against Goswami and Ranaut stem from political motive. Hence, I request the (Council) Chairman not to grant the extension and give a decision on the same at your level," he said. Jagtap countered Darekar, contending what the BJP leader said was "half-truth and not the complete truth". "The Supreme Court has nowhere in its decision said that there cannot be a breach of privilege," Jagtap said. The Congress leader also charged opposition members with committing the "sin" of supporting Ranaut, who had compared Mumbai with PoK.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/notices-against-arnab-kangana-privileges-panel-gets-more-time-927571.html

Council Chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar moved the motion in the House to congratulate Disale. The zilla praishad primary school teacher from Paritewadi, a tiny village with less than 2,000 population in Maharashtra's Solapur district, was recognised for his efforts to promote girls' education and trigger a quick-response coded textbook revolution in India. Disale had earlier said he would share 50 per cent of the prize money equally among his fellow finalists. Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar hailed Disale for his generosity of sharing the prize money. Darekar said one does not get to see such generosity nowadays and lauded Disale for winning the prize, bringing honour not only to the Solapur district or Maharashtra but also the country. "...the Council is considered as the House of seniors. Litterateurs, journalists and thinkers become its members...when I had visited his (Disale's) home, other teachers and villagers present at his home then demanded his appointment as member of the Council," Darekar said. "He himself did not say anything. This (Disale's appointment as MLC) will enhance the dignity of the House...I request the government to recommend Disale's name as a Council member," Darekar said. State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab also hailed Disale's decision to share the prize money. "The government will definitely make efforts to increase the quality of education, realising the concepts he (Disale) talked about...all his work will be honoured in an appropriate manner," Parab said. "His wisdom will be used for Maharashtra. I salute him on behalf of the government and extend best wishes for his future," the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/darekar-seeks-appointment-of-maharashtra-school-teacher-disale-as-mlc-927611.html

Rampal has been asked to remain present before the NCB team, which is conducting a probe into the alleged Bollywood- drugs nexus following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the official said. This is the second time that the NCB will question the model-turned-actor in the drugs case. Earlier, he was questioned by the agency on November 13 for around seven hours. Rampal was summoned on Wednesday after the NCB obtained some information during interrogation of some of the persons arrested in the drugs case, the official said The NCB last month conducted searches at Rampal's residence in Bandra area of Mumbai and seized electronic gadgets and some medicines banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. His partner Gabriella Demtriades was also questioned by the agency for two days last month in the case. Gabriella's brother Agisilaos Demetriades was arrested by the NCB in the case in October and it was found that he was in touch with many Bollywood celebrities, the official said. Rampal's friend Paul Bartel was also earlier arrested by the NCB in the drugs case. Based on some WhatsApp chats involving drugs, the NCB launched a probe into the alleged drug use in Bollywood after the death of Rajput in June this year. The central agency had earlier arrested Rajput's girlfriend, actress Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, some employees of the late filmstar and a few others under sections of the NDPS Act. Rhea Chakraborty, her brother, and some other accused were later granted bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/drugs-case-bollywood-actor-arjun-rampal-summoned-by-ncb-on-december-16-927634.html

The BJP leader faced attack from various quarters after he sought to link Pakistan and China to the protests by farmers who are demanding scrapping of the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. "I am a true farmer and no one, including myself, can say anything critical against farmers of this country. Earlier the media had shown me driving a bullock cart and feeding fodder to cattle. "My statement was misinterpreted for sake of news," he said at a press conference here when asked about his remark that the two neighbouring countries were behind the protests. The Minister of State for Consumer Affairs said the three new farm laws passed by Parliament in September were in the interest of cultivators. "Now farmers can sell their crop yield anywhere, even out of their home state...also there is no need to pay market committee taxes. "Farmers are asking for inclusion of MSP in law, but it was never in law. The Prime Minister has already clarified that procurement of crops under the MSP regime will continue," the Union minister said. "The government has set a target of doubling the income of farmers in the country by 2022. These new laws are a step towards achieving that target," Danve added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/my-statement-on-farm-protests-misinterpreted-raosaheb-danve-927639.html

In the communication to Sawant, the Quraishi Meat Traders Association of Goa has also urged the Chief Minister to intervene and urge the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leadership in Karnataka as well as at the Centre to stop the controversial law from being notified. "In the circumstances we turn to your good offices to intercede for the state of Goa so that the said act is not notified, in as much as the state of Karnataka is ruled by a BJP-led coalition government, in the state of Goa as well as in the Centre and we earnestly believe that in this time of crisis, it is only your good offices that can prevent the said act from being notified," the Association has pleaded in a letter to Sawant. "The state of Goa is one of the highest beef consuming states in the whole of India in as much as in addition to having a population of mixed cultures, many of which treat beef as an integral part of their staple diet, it is also a renowned tourist destination which invites tourists from various parts of the globe who find Goa because of its Indo-Portuguese, western and Indian nuanced culinary skills which highlights a menu interalia based on beef," the letter also said. Beef is a routinely consumed commodity in Goa and is served in restaurants in the coastal fringes of the state, which are frequented by nearly eight million tourists every year.More than 25 tons of beef is consumed in Goa every day, most of which has been imported from Karnataka's Belgavi district. The Opposition in Goa has already slammed the BJP-led coalition government in Goa for not taking enough measures to ensure a smooth supply of beef to the state, where more than 30 per cent of the population consumes beef as part of a staple diet. "It is respectfully stated that if the said act is notified and becomes a law, it will be a major setback to members of the undersigned association in as much as the undersigned association will be deprived of carrying on with their sole occupation viz. meat trading and trades ancillary thereto," the Association has also said in its letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/use-good-offices-to-stop-karnatakas-anti-cattle-slaughter-law-beef-traders-to-goa-cm-927712.html
