29-10-2020||First Edit||The ground beneath changes for Jammu and Kashmir||The new central order on Kashmir, notified on Tuesday, would make fundamental changes to land and property relations in the state-turned-Union Territory like few other government decisions have done in the past. A similar action of long-term impact was the land reform enactment of the Sheikh Abdullah government in 1950. The present order will overturn what have been among the most progressive land reforms in any state in the country. It enables any Indian citizen to buy non-agricultural land in the UT, without being a permanent resident or domicile. The government can also decide any area as “strategic’’ and take it over for use of the armed forces. As many as 38 state laws have been revoked or amended to facilitate the working of the new order. The revocation of Article 370 and 35A last year had changed the political status of Jammu and Kashmir within the Union of India, the present order operationalises it on the ground, directly affecting life there.  Political parties in the UT, except the BJP, have opposed the changes and strongly condemned them. The people of Jammu would also not be happy with the new order. Most parties fear it as a measure to facilitate the large-scale acquisition of land by people from other parts of the country, including corporates, in service of a political project to change J&K’s demography and extinguish Kashmiri identity. It is a matter of surprise that, in the process, the long-standing law under which major beneficial land reforms were carried out in the erstwhile state has been abolished now. It has been pointed out that the new order is in violation of the promises made to the people of Kashmir by the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister. The most glaring deficiency of the new order is that it has been issued without consultation with, not to speak of the consent of, the people of Jammu and Kashmir. There is no elected, representative body functioning in J&K and so there is a question mark over not just its acceptability but its very legitimacy. A decision of such import should have been made by the state Assembly or should have been endorsed by it. The legality of the decision may be especially questioned because the legality of the abrogation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 itself has not been settled by the court. It should also be noted that the people of J&K now do not have the land rights which those in Himachal Pradesh and some North-East states have. The latest order is bound to fuel more discontent in Kashmir. And that’s not a good thing for the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/the-ground-beneath-changes-for-jammu-and-kashmir-908793.html
29-10-2020||In Perspective||With Sushant Singh Rajput case, focus back on CBI||The Maharashtra government recently withdrew general consent to the CBI to investigate in the state. Thus, Maharashtra adds itself to the general trend of states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal etc having withdrawn general consent to the CBI. This, in fact, is a natural consequence of what the CBI has done to itself. It has been criticised for its political way of functioning which is aimed to please its ‘political masters’ than actually investigate and perform its duties properly. So much so, the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court, had called it out in no unclear terms as “its master’s voice” and “caged parrot”. Maharashtra’s withdrawal can be traced to recent instances where the state police and CBI have been pitted against each other to investigate cases so much so that these cases have landed in courts demanding CBI investigation. In Arnab Goswami’s case, it was stated that the Maharashtra police would not conduct a fair investigation and hence, CBI investigation was necessary. This was rejected by the court.  In investigation of death of Sushant Singh Rajput, the case was handed over to the CBI despite the court not finding any evidence of wrong doings of the Mumbai police. Recent event in this tussle is the alleged TRP scam by some media houses such as Republic TV.  In this case, it was likely that it would be sought to exclude Maharashtra police for no reason except that CBI could be used for political advantages, as feared by the ruling Shiv Sena. The CBI finds its origin in a pre-independence 1941 law on Special Police Establishment (SPE). This was then extended to independent India via the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (DSPE Act). Interestingly, CBI is not a body under DSPE Act per se but a body created by a notification under the DSPE Act. The agency is authorised under the DSPE Act to investigate the alleged offence. There is a general power of investigation in Union Territories but in relation to any state, the power can be exercised only upon the consent of that state government. Division of powers The Constitution envisages division of powers between states and the Union to be exercised exclusively by them and some powers to be exercised by both entities. This is subject to some exceptional circumstances where the Union may exercise powers given to the state. This idea is encapsulated in the form of Union List, State List and Concurrent List. It is noteworthy that ‘police’ falls under State List thereby giving exclusive control to the state over this matter. Interestingly, the CBI as a body was declared unconstitutional by the Gauhati High Court in 2013 which was subsequently stayed by the Supreme Court. Since then, the Supreme Court has not heard and decided the appeal on constitutionality of CBI.  The CBI has therefore been functioning on not so sound grounds than on which a body of such repute and responsibility would like to. The CBI is under the administrative and financial control of the Central government. This gives scope for control and politicisation of the body. The agency was set up possibly for the dual idea of impartiality and competence, to provide for fair investigation in the former and provide skilled investigation in complex cases in the latter. While the competence is generally not under attack, it is impartiality that is questioned quite frequently. It so happens that Central government also has some political interest in the matter being investigated and uses CBI for favourable outcomes. Hence, the investigation gets politicised and doesn’t really bring about a fair result. Therefore, CBI has struggled on both counts of impartiality and administrative control. It is noteworthy that the CBI does far better in those cases which are not political or high-profile in that sense of the term. It is amply clear that CBI owing to numerous reasons has not been able to follow the golden thread of justice: justice should not only be done but seen to be done. There is always suspicion of influence and politicisation of CBI which has also reflected in decreasing public faith in it. It is need of the hour that CBI be given statutory status where it is made independent and free from any administrative interference or otherwise. This would go a long way in ensuring that we have a fair body to resort to when cases involving local influence or some other influence cannot be investigated by the state police.  (The writer is a student at the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/with-sushant-singh-rajput-case-focus-back-on-cbi-908796.html

Presiding over the monthly meeting, MCC Mayor Diwakar said that the MCC had initiated steps to collect segregated waste at source within its jurisdiction. Unsegregated waste from Bantwal, Ullal, Kotekar and the 15 gram panchayats were being dumped at Pacchanady unit. The Council decided not to allow vehicles to dump unsegregated waste at Pacchanady.Some corporators even went to the extent of rejecting garbage from outside the MCC limits. MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said: "Other ULBs and GPs will face inconveniences if we suddenly refuse to accept garbage. There is a need to give them sufficient time. Notices will be served to all ULBs and GPs to segregate waste before bringing it to Pacchandy. In addition, GPs will be asked to pay pending waste processing fee to MCC." Leader of Opposition in Council Abdul Rauf said the High Court had criticised the MCC over the garbage slide incident at Pacchanady. "Why did the MCC fail to initiate action against officials who were responsible for the sliding of garbage at site," he asked. Former mayor Bhaskar thanked the government for releasing compensation to the garbage slide victims. Government should not demand any rent for having made temporary housing arrangement for the victims, he added. The Opposition members took the officials to the task for not using the photo of the Opposition leader in the flex used during the inauguration of Alake market.  Meeting soon Mayor Diwakar said a meeting on Smart City works will be convened soon. The assurance came when members alleged misuse of funds under the Mangaluru Smart City Mission.Abdul Rauf alleged that funds earmarked for slum development in his ward was diverted. MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar clarified that funds cannot be diverted. But with special permission, it can be utilised. Rauf said owing to the confusion over Central Market, daily wage workers were in distress. The work on temporary stalls taken up under the Smart City Mission at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore near the Town Hall was halted due to the court order.   SWM processing Environment engineer Madhu informed the members that apartments have been directed to process solid waste on their own. Accordingly, 51 apartments had set up waste management units on their premises. The wet waste are managed in 4,000 houses in the MCC limits. Applications have been received from them to provide them 50% concession in SWM cess.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/unsegregated-garbage-from-15-gps-ulbs-not-allowed-at-pacchanady-908528.html

29-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||KU uploads video clips in place of prospectus to attract students||For the first time since its establishment, in place of the prospectus, the Kuvempu University is uploading video clips highlighting the available courses, facilities, and achievements on its website to attract students for the admissions to postgraduate courses. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, educational institutes have been prompted to utilise advanced technology extensively to reach out to the students. Earlier, the university used to print around 2,000 prospectuses every year for students seeking admission to PG courses. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the university decided to upload video clips to provide information on 32 courses which are being offered at its Jnana Sahyadri campus at Shankaraghatta. Students seeking admission to PG courses can download the application, and apply to any number of courses they wish online from November 12. Besides, they can also view the video clips in which each department head speaks about the course, syllabus, etc, for about two to three minutes. The selected students receive SMS on the given cell phone number, and such students can visit the campus to pay the admission fee. The entire admission process including counselling has been made online. 32 PG courses Speaking to DH, Kuvempu University Registrar S S Patil said, the university is offering 32 PG courses at its campus at Shankaraghatta, and the intake is limited to 40 students for each course. Besides, PG courses are being offered at Kadur in Chikkamagaluru, and in some colleges in Shivamogga district for the benefit of students. The university used to spend Rs three lakh on the prospectus earlier. This time, it has spent around Rs two lakh on video clips, and the online admission system. As many as 95 degree colleges functioning in Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru districts are affiliated to the university. Of them, 63 are government, 20 are unaided, and the remaining are aided colleges. He said that the university wants to attract students from Bhutan, Srilanka, Nepal, and Arab countries by utilising its rank at the national level, and achievements in the field of research and higher education. "At present, many PhD students are from the North-East States of India. They have a high opinion about the university, and mouth-to-mouth publicity will play a key role in attracting students from other States, and neighbouring countries. We have a good number of students from Yemen and Ghana," he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ku-uploads-video-clips-in-place-of-prospectus-to-attract-students-908714.html
29-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||MLA, BJP corporators walk out of council meet||JD(S) MLA G T Devegowda walked out of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) council meeting alleging that the meeting agenda had not included the topic of bringing four gram panchayats (GP), inside the Outer Ring Road (ORR), under MCC limits. The meeting was chaired by Deputy Mayor C Sridhar here, on Thursday. When the meeting commenced, BJP corporator Subbaiah pointed out that though MP Pratap Simha had written to the Mayor and MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde suggesting to include the topic of bringing Hinkal, Chamundi Hill, Srirampura and Alanahalli gram panchayats under MCC limits, the authorities have omitted them in the meeting agenda. MLA G T Devegowda said, "It was decided to send a proposal to the state government to include four GPs to the MCC limits. Though the District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar, MP, MLAs decided to send a proposal, the civic body authorities failed to include it in the meeting agenda." Sridhar explained that as Mayor Tasneem was absent for the meeting and a few MLAs raised objection for the proposal, the matter was not included. Another corporator Arif Hussain said that it is not possible to include the matter in the agenda without discussing the pros and cons. However, G T Devegowda expressed unhappiness and said, "The council has disrespected the decision of the minister, MP and MLAs by not including it in the agenda. As the MLA and BJP corporators walked out of the meeting, the Deputy Mayor postponed the meeting for 15 minutes." Sridhar said, "A special meeting will be organised to discuss the matter. The MLAs and MP will be invited to discuss the matter." Corporator Ayub Khan expressed displeasure over the MCC officials for not achieving the target in tax collection. The civic body had launched a special drive to collect the tax and collected Rs 8 crore in 28 days. The authorities should have collected a minimum of Rs 25 crore. The officials are not working efficiently, he blamed. The corporator suggested to purchase 65 tractors rather than buying 25 tractors and 11 compactors to dispose waste.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mla-bjp-corporators-walk-out-of-council-meet-908809.html
29-10-2020||Main Article||Our healthcare's weakest link — providing for the middle class||India’s middle class is the backbone of our society but unfortunately, their healthcare needs have never been addressed adequately. Our ability to deliver quality healthcare at a fraction of the cost of the West and other developed Asian countries, has made us one of the most attractive healthcare destinations in the world. However, it is important to note that healthcare is still expensive by Indian standards.  A prolonged illness or a sudden trip to the ICU can plunge even a relatively well-to-do family into debt.  Which is why it is important for us to move towards health insurance for everyone. India can broadly be classed into four sections based on wealth and healthcare coverage: The uber-rich who can afford healthcare anywhere in the world: Those employed in the formal sector or by the government and are covered by private employer insurance schemes and government schemes like CGHS; The poor who rely on government assistance like Ayushman Bharat: And finally, the 'Missing Middle’ - this group is a part of the middle class. They are either self-employed or work for the unorganised sector and have nowhere to go in case of a healthcare crisis. Over 60% of our population pay out of pocket for healthcare and this has driven millions into poverty. Who makes up the Indian middle class? The size of the Indian middle class is estimated to be anywhere between 78 million and 604 million. The government is looking to cover the lower middle class under the extended Ayushman Bharat scheme. This still leaves a large percentage of people unprotected. Based on the definitions by economists Sandhya Krishnan and Neeraj Hatekar, the monthly family income of middle class works out to Rs 45,000-80,000 for a family of four.  These families have disposable incomes and typically have a vehicle per family. They are already familiar with the concept of insurance, so educating them on the importance of health insurance is relatively easy.  If you’ve accepted that vehicular insurance is mandatory, it is easy to understand why health insurance should be mandatory as well. How do we do this? Look at other countries with successful models. Thailand has a form of social security for private employees while the rest are covered by government resources and a small co-pay from the individual.  The patients are mostly treated in government hospitals with a few private hospitals participating in these schemes.  The UK’s NHS provides free healthcare; `Medicare and Medicaid’ in the US cover the healthcare needs of many of their citizens. Unfortunately, we cannot simply emulate the USA’s Medicare, or the UK’s NHS because India does not have a large enough tax base to fund everyone’s healthcare.  Our middle class will need to pay a small premium to insure themselves and their families. Our government hospitals need to address the severe shortage of trained personnel and they require a lot of upgradation (in capacity and quality) before they can take on a larger caseload. Till this is accomplished, India would do best with a public-private partnership. With this public-private partnership involving insurance companies, the government and the private sector can provide quality healthcare to the middle class at an affordable cost by playing on each one’s strengths. The retail cost of a Rs 5 lakh health insurance policy for a family of four is currently around Rs 10,000-15,000 per year.  This works out to be around Rs 1,000 a month which can be lowered, by taking the steps outlined below: The bills can be reduced by 30-50% if everyone buys insurance. Insurance premiums for a group are determined by combining the healthcare costs of all the people in the pool.  We can significantly reduce the risk (and by extension the premium) by adding more healthy (young) people to the pool. Larger numbers will reduce premiums because of the economy of scale.  A small co-payment model would disincentivise availing of unnecessary healthcare services. The government should work with the private sector to build functional hospitals and convince people to come to them for treatment.  These do not need to be five-star hospitals with deluxe suites.  We should also focus on building and strengthening the primary care centres, setting up secondary care centres and a few designated tertiary care centres. Tertiary care Tertiary care centres are expensive and should not be everyone’s first option and patients should be screened before they are referred to a tertiary care centre because most illnesses don’t require specialised equipment and super-specialists. Preventive care and creation of wellness is far more cost-effective than treating illness.  Which is why the government should work with experts to strengthen public health, primary, preventive care to include cancer screening, non-communicable diseases-screening and early appropriate treatment.  This will significantly reduce the cost of healthcare. Forcing the private sector to provide treatment at capped prices is not a long-term solution.  Doctors, medical students, nurses and technicians work incredibly long hours under immense pressure and they deserve fair compensation. It takes 12 years of medical schooling to become a heart surgeon or a neurosurgeon. Many accredited seats are already going vacant in these tough and essential specialisations.  We cannot afford to short-change them. Purely from a doctor’s perspective, national health ID is a Godsend.  An accurate and complete patient history will allow us to treat patients appropriately, free up medical manpower and most importantly, reduce medical errors and costs. However, privacy concerns need to be addressed. As Covid-19 has so painfully shown us, anyone can get sick and require hospitalisation.  In the light of this indisputable fact, it is unconscionable for us to expect people to continue on as they have been.  We have to do something and we have to do it now.India is only as strong as her healthcare system is.  It is high time we recognise this. Let us get to work on achieving this as soon as possible.

29-10-2020||National||India extends $1 billion for developmental projects in central Asia||India on Wednesday announced extending USD 1 billion line of credit for "priority" developmental projects in central Asian countries while vowing to further expand cooperation with the resource-rich region including confronting the common challenges of terrorism and extremism. The announcement on the quantum of the financial assistance was made by India during the second meeting of the India-Central Asia Dialogue which also discussed a plethora of key issues as well as ways to expand cooperation between the two sides. The virtual meeting was chaired by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and it was attended by his counterparts from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. While the Kyrgyz Republic was represented by its first deputy foreign minister, the acting foreign minister of Afghanistan too attended it as a special invitee. "The ministers of the Central Asian countries welcomed the provision by India of USD 1 billion line of credit for priority developmental projects in fields such as connectivity, energy, IT, healthcare, education, agriculture etc," a joint statement issued after the talks said. The joint statement said the ministers strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed the determination of their countries to combat the menace by destroying terrorist safe-havens, networks, infrastructure and funding channels. "They also underlined the need for every country to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks against other countries," it said. "We face common challenges of terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking and such other issues. All these commonalities make us a natural partner in our developmental journey," he said. He further said: "We consider Central Asia as India's 'extended neighbourhood'. We share a common geography which facilitated continuous exchange of people, ideas and goods in both directions and left indelible imprints on our customs, traditions and languages." The ministers also called for the settlement of the Afghan conflict on the principle of Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process. "The ministers expressed their interest in strengthening cooperation for the development and economic reconstruction of Afghanistan, including through the implementation of infrastructure, energy, transit and transport projects," the statement said. It said they also emphasised preserving the socio-economic development and political gains made by Afghanistan in the last 19 years while extending support for a united, sovereign and the democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In the talks, the ministers also emphasised the importance of connectivity for increasing trade and commerce as well as people-to-people contacts between India and the Central Asian countries. "The ministers expressed their continued interest in further developing the transit and transport potential of their countries, improving the logistics network of the region and promoting joint initiatives to create regional and international transport corridors," the statement said. "In this regard, the Ministers of the Central Asian countries appreciated India's efforts to modernise the infrastructure of the Chabahar port in Iran, which could become an important link in trade and transport communications between the markets of Central and South Asia," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-extends-1-billion-for-developmental-projects-in-central-asia-908480.html
29-10-2020||National||US pitches cheaper solar tech to India amid high dependence on China||The United States wants India to explore manufacturing a cheaper alternative to silicon solar cells, U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said on Wednesday, amid high dependence on Chinese technology. Brouillette, who was addressing a virtual press conference at the conclusion of the India energy forum at the IHS CERA Week, said India was "perfectly positioned as a potential manufacturer" of perovskite cells, on which the U.S. was conducting research at its national laboratory in Colorado. "We have seen recently with this pandemic, supply chain issues have arisen with countries like China and in certain cases we have become overly dependent upon one country," Brouillette said. India has an ambitious plan to increase its renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, nearly three-fifths of which will be solar power. The energy hungry nation, which imports over 80% of its solar cells and modules from its neighbour, wants to increase domestic manufacturing but has so far had little success. "It is a technology we want to share with India, we think it is better done there than other parts around the world," Brouillette said. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered by scientists as a potential cheap alternative to silicon cells. "PSCs offer a much lower production cost compared to silicon solar cells and its efficiency has improved dramatically," said Sandheep Ravishankar, a scientist researching PSCs at the Institute of Energy and Climate Research, Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. "However, PSCs are still not stable enough to be considered as a commercial competitor of silicon," Sandheep said. Scientists are also exploring using perovskite in tandem with silicon to increase efficiency, and research on the technology is being carried out in countries including the United States, Saudi Arabia and Germany.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-pitches-cheaper-solar-tech-to-india-amid-high-dependence-on-china-908482.html
29-10-2020||National||India committed Covid-19 aid to 150 countries, says PM Modi; RTI says 81||Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a United Nations forum in mid-July that India has extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries in the wake of Covid-19 but an RTI response has shown that New Delhi has committed aid only to 81 countries to the tune of Rs 97.73 crore as on the first week of August. Of this, aid worth Rs 69.72 crore were delivered till August 5. Among the countries, the response by the Ministry of External Affairs to transparency activist Venkatesh Nayak showed, China with whom India is locked in an intense boundary dispute was one of the highest beneficiaries receiving the whole committed aid worth Rs 1.87 crore as on August 5. Interestingly, the RTI response showed that India spent Rs 4.24 crore in transporting the aid worth Rs 1.87 crore. Nayak had filed the RTI in May but received the reply only in September. However, the RTI response is in variance with a written reply tabled by Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan in Lok Sabha on March 18 when he said India had sent medical aid worth Rs 2.11 crore to China. The Government of India provided 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising one lakh pieces of surgical masks, five lakh gloves, 75 infusion pumps, 30 enteral feeding pumps, 21 defibrillators and 4,000 N-95 masks worth Rs 2.11 crore on February 26, Muraleedharan had said. The aid was delivered by an Indian Air Force C-17 special flight which landed in Wuhan. The RTI response is also in variance with the Prime Minister's address at the high-level segment of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) session on July 17 when he said, "in our joint fight against Covid-19, we have extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries". However, the MEA has only provided the list of 81 countries to which New Delhi has promised aid as on August 5. "The Prime Minister has said India has sent assistance to 150 countries. But data updated much later by MEA is limited to 81 countries. So we do not know which are the other 70 countries to which India supplied medical and other relief supplies in the fight against Covid-19," Nayak told DH. According to the RTI, India committed to Myanmar the highest aid worth Rs 6.89 crore of which aid worth Rs 5.84 crore was delivered by the first week of August. Nepal came second with aid worth Rs 6.78 crore committed and Rs 3.93 crore worth aid delivered. Among the neighbours, Bangladesh came third with Rs 3.97 crore aid committed out of which aid worth Rs 3.61 crore has been delivered. While Afghanistan was promised aid worth Rs 2.23 crore, only aid worth Rs 29 lakh was delivered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-committed-covid-19-aid-to-150-countries-says-pm-modi-rti-says-81-908488.html

29-10-2020||National||Coronavirus India update: State-wise total number of confirmed cases, deaths on October 29||The spread of the novel coronavirus in India has quickened in the last few days with new cases of Covid-19 and deaths reported every day.

29-10-2020||National||Centre brings out ordinance to set up permanent commission to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR||The Union government has brought out an ordinance to set up a permanent commission for air quality management in Delhi and adjoining areas as it has become a cause of concern due to activities of stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust and urban construction. The contravention of Commission's orders would be an offence, punishable with up to five-year jail or with fine up to Rs one crore or both. A 'Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas' would be set to provide a permanent solution and establish a self-regulated, and democratically-monitored mechanism for tackling air pollution.  This body, mainly comprising the to officers from the Centre and States, and ISRO, would replace the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, set up on January 29, 1998, by the Supreme Court in the M C Mehta case and the Justice Madan B Lokur Commission again appointed by the top court in the case of Aditya Dubey this month.    The Law and Justice Ministry on Thursday issued the ordinance, promulgated by the President saying, "It is necessary to provide for a consolidated and conjoint approach, monitoring, tackling and researching in air pollution". This was also essential for specifically monitoring the measures taken by the Centre and the states of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to prevent factors causing air pollution, including stubble burning, industrial emissions, road dust, vehicular pollution, construction activities, biomass burning and other major causes, it said. The commission, coming into force at once, seeks to replace previous bodies to streamline public participation, the inter-state cooperation, expert involvement and persistent research and innovation, it added. The commission would consist of a full-time Chairman, who is or has been Secretary to Union government or chief secretary of a State, a representative to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, five ex-officio members who are chief secretaries to the States, a technical member from the Central Pollution Control Board, and three members from NGOs, among others. It would be planning and executing the programme for the region for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution, besides laying down standards for air quality, and emission and discharge of pollution. An appeal against the decision or orders by the Commission would only lie before the National Green Tribunal. The Supreme Court had on October 26 suspended its order of October 16 appointing former judge, Justice Lokur as one-man commission to monitor the steps being taken to check stubble burning, which created a layer of smog in Delhi and National Capital Region. The court directed to keep its order in abeyance till further directions, as the Centre, led by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, said it would set up a permanent body within days by enacting a legislation to deal with annual air pollution problem arising from stubble burning in northern states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  The top court is scheduled to take up the matter on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-brings-out-ordinance-to-set-up-permanent-commission-to-tackle-air-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-908514.html
29-10-2020||National||A self-reliant India is also a friend of the world: PM Modi||PM Narendra Modi has asserted that his government’s call for making India ‘Atmanirbhar’ is not a move aimed at dominance, but rather at dependability and looking out for the world, and that a self-reliant India is also a friend to the world. Admitting that the assessment of the Covid-19 situation depends on the numbers, Modi said the the country’s fight against the virus should be assessed based on how many lives were saved. The virus is proving to be very fickle, the prime minister said, citing examples of cases in Gujarat, Kerala and Karnataka, and stated that there cannot be any complacency in the fight against the disease. India went into a cautious zone ahead of major festivals, anticipating a spike like in the case of Kerala after Onam. Union Minister Harsh Vardhan urged people to follow protocols and stay in. The Kolkata HC even clamped down Durga Puja festivities, not allowing visitors inside pandals. The prime minister defended the government’s strategy for the lockdown, saying they got the broad timing of various phases of the lockdown and the unlock processes correct, and the result of that is the economy slowly going back on track.However, the timing of India’s lockdown and subsequent unlocking has been under criticism by economists and health experts alike who believe India went into lockdown too early and reopened itself too soon. The world’s biggest lockdown that resulted in the exodus of migrants and job losses has been penalised for being improperly handled and poorly managed. On the issue of Atmanirbhar Bharat, Modi emphasised that India does not believe in gaining from other countries’ losses, and will be a global manufacturing hub on its own merit. The PM’s initiative of Atmanirbhar Bharat is often seen as a counter against China, against whom the country has been involved in a standoff owing to military tensions in Ladakh after a scuffle broke out betwen the two sides, killing 20 Indian soldiers. China, which supplies raw materials and finished goods to several industries globally, has already been engaged in an offensive with the United States over trade relations. India too banned apps and some imports from China following military tensions and ramped up its own production in order to be less reliant on China and be 'Atmanirbhar'. PM Modi, however, said that the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat is not to become an alternative to another country. He cited examples of progress in the pharma and healthcare sectors, such has the greater contribution to the global pharma supply chain and increased manufacturing of ventilators. Earlier, PM Modi had said that India would provide all assitance to other nations in the development and distribution of vaccines. Modi also said that the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign does not refer to India becoming self-centred, but rather to unlocking India’s potential so that its firms can serve global markets. Asserting that everyone will be vaccinated once a Covid-19 vaccine arrives in the market. He said that a national expert group has been constituted to chart the way forward in the vaccination drive against the disease. Hailing his government’s measures, he said that it was not just a matter of saving 130 crore lives from the pandemic but also to ensure that the poor got enough food and essentials, which was the aim of the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/a-self-reliant-india-is-also-a-friend-of-the-world-pm-modi-908529.html
29-10-2020||National||Adar Poonawalla believes India could have a Covid-19 vaccine by December||However it would take up a few months for the vaccine rollout after the government sanctions it and at least two months for it to have a widespread reach. "If we don't go for an emergency license, our trials should be over by December and then we can maybe we can launch in India in January," Poonawalla said. He added that after the UK unveils the vaccine data and shares it with the world, deeming the vaccine safe, the government of India can take a decision on emergency authorisation. Stressing that even when the vaccine is declared safe, it will be the decision of the health ministry and regulator in India to enforce distribution, and review the vaccine if emergency licence is applied for,  Poonawalla said, "That review (for an emergency licence) could take about two-three weeks I imagine and then you can have a vaccine by December but all these would have to happen and I don't want to venture a guess whether that would happen or not happen because it's not my place to do so -- that's for the health ministry officials to decide. "We are aiming for 100 million doses a month at first. This should be available by Q2-Q3 of 2021." Earlier in September, SII announced that it will partner with Gavi and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to manufacture an additional up to 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for India and low and middle-income countries (LMICs). SII has signed an agreement to manufacture the potential vaccine developed by Jenner Institute of Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca. Meanwhile, India's Covid-19 caseload surpassed the 80-lakh mark on Thursday, 18 days after it had gone past 70 lakh, with 49,881 new cases.

Sources said the NIA teams conducted raids at nine places in Kashmir and one in Delhi on Thursday. The NIA raided the offices of Falah-e-Aam Trust, Charity Alliance, Human Welfare Foundation, JK Yateem Foundation, Salvation Movement and J&K Voice of Victims (JKVoV), all in Kashmir, they said. On Wednesday, the premier probe agency had raided 10 locations in Kashmir and one in Bangalore in connection with the same case. Several incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized during the searches. Those whose premises were searched include residence and office of Khurram Parvez (coordinator of J&K Coalition of Civil Society), his associates Parvez Bukhari, Parvez Matta and Bengaluru-based associate Swati Sheshadri, Parveena Ahanger, Chairperson of Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons and offices of NGO Athrout and Greater Kashmir Trust. The raids are being conducted as part of a case registered in early October by the NIA in connection with a case of funds being raised by certain NGOs and trusts from “India and abroad in the name of charitable activities” and allegedly being used “for carrying out secessionist and separatist activities in J&K.” The raids have drawn severe criticism from political leaders in the Valley, with PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti describing it as a “vicious crackdown on freedom of expression” and Peoples Conference president Sajad Lone saying that the “raids add to the environment of fear.” However, surprisingly, another former CM and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, who usually reacts on most of the issues on his Twitter handle, remained silent over the NIA raids.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nia-raids-continue-in-kashmir-delhi-over-fund-diversion-by-ngos-908543.html

Sivasankar has been arraigned as the fifth accused in a case registered by the ED against gold smuggling in the state. The agency has maintained that there was evidence of Sivasankar intervening to release baggage with a diplomatic tag that contained gold. Considering the health problems cited by Sivasankar, the Ernakulam principal sessions court directed that Sivasankar should be quizzed only between 6 am and 6 pm and he should be given one-hour rest after every three hours of quizzing. His close relatives including wife and brother would be allowed to meet him. He would be allowed to undergo Ayurveda treatment without affecting the quizzing. The ED maintained that Sivasankar was not cooperating with the quizzing. Sivasankar's bail application will be considered by the court next week. Sivasankar was arrested after the Kerala High Court denied him anticipatory bail on Wednesday. Various sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) were invoked against him as there was evidence of him helping the smuggling accused Swapna Suresh manage the illegally-earned money. Sivasankar also allegedly pressurised a private bank to convert about Rs 1.4 crore to US dollars for Swapna. According to the arrest memo issued by the ED, Sivasankar even intervened for releasing baggage with a diplomatic tag in 2019 that contained gold. As soon as the gold smuggling racket came to the fore in July, the BJP alleged that someone from the Chief Minister's office had contacted the Customs requesting to release the baggage that contained gold. But a Customs official later denied it and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan also strongly flayed the opposition parties for making such baseless allegation. Hence, the present revelation by the ED would be causing much embarrassment to the Chief Minister. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran alleged that two more officials at the Chief Minister's office were involved in the nexus with the accused in the gold smuggling case. Already the links of a couple of ministers have surfaced. Various opposition parties staged protests against the government across the state on Thursday, demanding the Chief Minister to resign.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gold-smuggling-case-sivasankar-sent-to-7-day-custody-908545.html
29-10-2020||National||Jail authorities gear up for surrender of prisoners released on bail amid Covid-19||Over 6,700 prisoners, who were released either on interim bail or parole in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, will now have to surrender in a phased manner at a temporary jail set up near Mandoli here after the Delhi High Court decided to put an end to the bail extensions granted to them. Once the prisoners surrender, those who test negative for coronavirus will be quarantined for 15 days and those who test positive will be sent to a hospital or a a Covid care centre. The temporary jail has been set up in a police colony near Mandoli jail in northeast Delhi. It has 300 flats and can accommodate 2,000 people. At least six inmates would be put up in each flat which has two bedrooms with dinning space keeping in mind social distancing norms, Director General (Delhi Prisons), Sandeep Goel, told PTI. The Delhi High Court on October 20 had said that all undertrials whose bail period was extended prior to and during Covid-19 lockdown have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and November 13. The court also said that the order would also be applicable to 356 prisoners who were granted bail by the high court and they would have to surrender before jail authorities on November 13. Citing the high court order, Goel said that with inmates set to return, jail authorities have made massive arrangements and taken adequate precautions to ensure safety in order to combat the further spread of coronavirus. "According to a high court order issued on October 20, we are expecting around 2,200 inmates to surrender in a phased manner from November 2 to November 13. Out of them, 356 prisoners are those who were granted bail by the high court and would have to surrender before jail authorities on November 13," he said. Goel said all these prisoners who need to surrender from November 2 to November 13 would have to directly surrender at the temporary jail. "All prisoners who are set to return as per their date of surrender would be kept in a temporary jail in Mandoli for first 15 days. After their quarantine period is over, they would be shifted to their respective jails. While they surrender, they would be first tested for Covid-19 through rapid antigen test and if there results are negative, they would be allowed inside our temporary jail where they would be quarantined," he said. In case anyone of them test positive for coronavirus, the prisoner would be either shifted to a hospital or a Covid care centre by jail authorities under police guard and would still be considered surrendered, the officer said. However, in case if anyone tests negative for the virus but still has fever or is unwell, then that inmate will be kept in isolation, he said. Delhi Prisons comprises Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails and the current population of prisoners lodged is around 16,000, the jail authorities said. A data shared by the Delhi Prisons on October 28 said out of the 96 inmates who had tested positive for Covid-19, 86 have recovered, two died and there are presently eight active cases. Besides, out of the 235 prison staff who tested positive, 214 have recovered and there are presently 21 active cases. According to jail authorities, out of the 5,500 inmates released on interim bail in view of the pandemic, 3,337 inmates were released on the basis of criteria set by the High Power Committee (HPC) In its order, the high court had said that a decision on the surrender of all those prisoners who have been granted bail on the recommendations of the High Power Committee, would have to be taken by HPC within 10 days. The Director General (Delhi Prisons) said that following a meeting, the HPC has recommended to the High Court to extend the interim bail of 3,337 inmates for 30 days and so these prisoners who were granted bail on the recommendations of the HPC will not have to surrender now. Accordingly, the surrender of 3,337 prisoners will begin with effect from December 5, he said. It has also been decided that 1182 inmates who were out on emergency parole and had to surrender from November 1 will now have to surrender only from November 29. "Those 1,182 sent on emergency parole had to surrender on November 1 but the Delhi Prisons has requested the government to extend their date of surrender by four weeks. So, as per the decision taken, they will now have to surrender from November 29," Goel said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jail-authorities-gear-up-for-surrender-of-prisoners-released-on-bail-amid-covid-19-908559.html

His family told media persons that Patel was rushed to a hospital early morning after he complained of breathlessness. Patel was the first BJP chief minister in 1995 but had to resign after Shankersinh Vaghela quit the government and forced a split in the party. Three years later, Patel again swore in as chief minister but had to give way to Narendra Modi who took over the reigns as chief minister in 2001 months after the devastating earthquake. He floated his own party in 2012 Assembly polls but merged it with the BJP in 2014. Condoling his death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet, "Our beloved and respected Keshubhai has passed away…I am deeply pained and saddened. He was an outstanding leader who cared for every section of society. His life was devoted towards the progress of Gujarat and the empowerment of every Gujarati." He further added that Keshubhai travelled across the length and breadth of Gujarat to strengthen the Jana Sangh and BJP. "He resisted the Emergency tooth and nail. Issues of farmer welfare were closest to his heart. Be it as MLA, MP, Minister or CM, he ensured many farmer-friendly measures were passed," he said.  "Keshubhai mentored and groomed many younger Karyakartas including me. Everyone loved his affable nature. His demise is an irreparable loss. We are all grieving today. My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers. Spoke to his son Bharat and expressed condolences. Om Shanti," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gujarats-former-cm-keshubhai-patel-passes-away-908564.html

During the third edition of the Indo-US 2+2 dialogue in New Delhi on Tuesday, the two countries vowed to ramp up their overall security ties and inked a total of five pacts, including the strategic Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information. The other pacts will facilitate cooperation in areas of nuclear energy, earth sciences and Ayurveda. The talks were led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar from the Indian side and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper from the US side. “The US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue has brought unprecedented cooperation between our two countries, pushing our Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership to new heights,” said Congressman Michael T McCaul, Republican Leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The achievements of the 2+2 dialogue, including the BECA geo-spatial cooperation agreement, add to a successful month, during which our two nations deepened the Quad framework with Japan and Australia, and welcomed Australia into the quadrilateral maritime Exercise Malabar, he said. In a significant move amid a Sino-India border row, India on October 19 announced Australia's participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping -- the Quad. “The United States will keep working with India to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and will remain steadfast as India seeks to defend its sovereignty from external aggression,” McCaul said. India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open, and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region. In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence. In the midst of growing global concern over China's expansionist behaviour, the foreign ministers of the Quad member nations met in Tokyo on October 6 and reaffirmed their collective vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness. Congressman Brad Sherman, in a tweet, welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2+2 ministerial. “Great to see India & the US conclude another successful 2+2 Ministerial to further expand the US-India relationship,” he said. He said it was great to see that the US-India Parliamentary Exchange he established with his India Caucus Co-Chair last December has been mentioned. "Looking forward to virtually hosting the Parliamentary Exchange in November,” Sherman added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/22-dialogue-brought-unprecedented-cooperation-between-india-us-908573.html

A bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud granted more time to the Union government to comprehensively implement the top court's judgement of March 17, this year. The court passed its order on a contempt petition filed by five women Navy officers, alleging non-implementation of the verdict. The bench also asked the Centre to provide Rs 25 lakh compensation in four weeks to five Naval women officers, who were not considered for the permanent commission in addition to pensionary benefits. The bench extended the time for grant of permanent commission for Short Service Commission women officers in the Navy till December 31.  In its March 17 verdict, the court allowed permanent commission to serving women officers in Indian Navy, saying that there cannot be gender discrimination with women officers in Navy after the statutory bar was lifted by Centre to allow their entry in the force.  "Women officers have worked shoulder to shoulder with their men counterparts in every walk of service. The contention that certain sea-going duties are ill-suited to women officers is premised on sex stereotypes that male officers are more suited to certain duties by virtue of the physiological characteristics," it said.  In June, the Centre filed an application in the top court for extension of the deadline by six months in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-fixes-deadline-of-dec-31-2020-to-implement-judgement-on-permanent-commission-to-women-naval-officers-908576.html

The petitioner, relying upon the WHO report published on October 15, submitted that several hundred trials have been carried out with Remdesivir and it was found that this medicine has little or no effect in the treatment of Covid-19.  Remdesivir and Favipiravir are antiviral drugs and their efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 patients is still under debate among medical experts.  According to the WHO report, “Interim results from the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial, coordinated by the World Health Organization, indicate that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of Covid-19 among hospitalised patients." Sharma said that nowhere these medicines have been officially termed successful in the cure of Covid-19 disease.  The WHO report said that the study was carried out in more than 30 countries, looked at the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients.  On September 16, the court had noted that there was an approval by the Centre on the use of Remdesivir and Favipiravir, as medicines in the treatment of Covid-19.  The petitioner sought registration of an FIR by the CBI against ten Indian pharmaceutical firms for manufacturing and selling these two medicines allegedly without valid licenses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-sc-notice-to-centre-over-plea-on-sale-of-remdesivir-favipiravir-908577.html

While stating that she had continuously received warmth and guidance of both Congress presidents Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi during her 15-year association with the party, Tandon said there is a "misalignment between the state-level leadership" and she did not see their support coming her way since the past several months. “The state leadership of the party has focused only on social media management and self branding and is oblivious to the deep divisions in the party and the voters it has thus caused,” Tandon said. She said canards were being spread about her and her associates by the local, irrelevant, and chosen few. Terming it as both "painful and disgusting", she said there was no attempt by the party leadership to stem this. Tandon said she had raised the matter with incharge of UP Priyanka Gandhi, who had assured that the Congress president is fully apprised of the situation.However, the matter had remained unresolved. My ideology and principles have been aligned with the senior leadership of the party and my resignation does not change this, she said, adding she would be consulting her workers on the future path.

The 92-year-old had recovered from Covid-19 recently and was rushed to a hospital in the morning following health complications. "Our beloved and respected Keshubhai has passed away…I am deeply pained and saddened," Prime Minister Modi said. Patel was an outstanding leader who cared for every section of society, he said. Patel's life was devoted towards the progress of Gujarat and the empowerment of every Gujarati, the prime minister said. Keshubhai travelled across the length and breadth of Gujarat to strengthen the Jana Sangh and BJP, Modi said. "He resisted the Emergency tooth and nail. Issues of farmer welfare were closest to his heart," the prime minister said in a series of tweets. Be it as an MLA, MP, Minister or CM, Patel ensured many farmer friendly measures were passed, Modi said. "Keshubhai mentored and groomed many younger Karyakartas including me. Everyone loved his affable nature. His demise is an irreparable loss," the prime minister said. "We are all grieving today. My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers. Spoke to his son Bharat and expressed condolences. Om Shanti," he said. Patel, a BJP veteran, was the state Chief Minister in 1995 and again during 1998-2001. Modi had succeeded him as Gujarat Chief Minister. Patel was a member of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly six times. He quit the BJP in 2012 and floated the Gujarat Parivartan Party, which performed poorly in the 2012 Assembly polls and merged with the BJP in 2014.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-condoles-demise-of-ex-gujarat-cm-keshubhai-patel-hails-him-as-outstanding-leader-908600.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah noted the high court had passed the "drastic" order which had taken "everybody by surprise" as there was no prayer for it in the PIL filed by journalist Umesh Kumar Sharma and others. The court issued notice to Sharma and others on whose petition the high court had passed its order on Tuesday. Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for Rawat, contended that this was something that the high court should not have done at all as it had an effect and had consequences of destabilising the government. He said the order was passed without hearing the other side and hampering the reputation of an accused.  The apex court stayed the operation of the order and sought a response from the petitioners in the high court within four weeks. "This matter required detailed consideration, you need to file a reply," the court told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sharma, who did not oppose a plea for stay on the order. Sharma, who owned a news channel called 'Samachar Plus', alleged transfer of money into the bank account of Rawat's relatives for an appointment at Gau Sewa Ayog when he was in-charge of Jharkhand BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-uttarakhand-high-court-order-for-cbi-probe-against-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-on-corruption-allegations-908604.html

Interacting with reporters, he also said, it would be too early to say, if this was a "third wave" in surge in fresh cases. Amid festive season and rising pollution level, Delhi on Wednesday recorded over 5,600 Covid-19 cases for the first time, with the national capital witnessing a sudden surge in daily cases in the past few days. "We have changed our strategy, and now going for aggressive tracing and testing of people who came in contact with those found positive for infection. So, also this rise is being seen," Jain told reporters. Entire family, close contacts even asymptomatic ones, of positive cases being tested, and RT-PCR tests also scaled up, he added. Asked about the figures of 15000 cases per day projected by experts in coming months, the minister said, "figures have been projected by experts on surge in daily Covid-19 cases, but it may not reach that level. However, we want to be full prepared".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-changed-strategy-going-for-aggressive-covid-19-contact-tracing-testing-jain-908605.html

In a statement, the Health Ministry said 15 lakh tests can be done everyday now. "The declining trend of cumulative positivity rate in the past three weeks is a testimony of the wide expansion of the country's testing facilities," it said. "With 10,75,760 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, the cumulative tests have crossed 10.65 crore (10,65,63,440). Nearly 11 lakh tests have been conducted daily on an average during the past six weeks," it added. Giving break-up from the states, the ministry said 79 per cent of the new cases are from 10 states and union territories. "Kerala continues to be the state reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 8,000 cases, followed by Maharashtra with more than 6,000 cases," it said. The ministry said the declining trend of the active cases is supported by the rising number of recovered cases. "The total recovered cases have crossed 73 lakh (73,15,989). The gap between recovered cases and active cases has crossed 67 lakh (67,12,302). With an increasing number of recoveries, this gap is continuously widening," it said.

29-10-2020||National||India, UK strike new Covid-19 research tie-ups||India and the UK have clinched new partnerships to boost bilateral cooperation on combating the coronavirus pandemic as part of the 10th UK-India Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), held virtually following the Covid-19 lockdown and travel constraints. A GBP 8-million joint funding initiative announced on Wednesday as part of the EFD outcomes will support collaborative research focused on understanding the severity of Covid-19 in South Asian populations in India. The UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in Indian Ministry of Science and Technology said their collaborative research will support research projects that are trying to understand the pandemic through the study of related ethnic groups in different environments in both countries. "This joint programme builds on the strong foundation of India-UK research collaboration and is an opportunity to bring together our collective expertise to understand the severity of Covid-19 infection in South Asian populations of both India and the UK," said Dr Renu Swarup, Secretary of the Department of Biotechnology. "This pandemic has brought together scientific research groups nationally and globally to address key research questions. Faced with one of the biggest challenges of our time, research from this DBT-UKRI collaboration will be important in understanding the differential response among these two populations. Improved understanding in this regard will empower us in planning more effective interventions to fight Covid-19 pandemic and any such events in future," she said. The DBT and UKRI said the latest funding, of GBP four million each, builds on the significant rapid investment in Covid-19 research since the start of the pandemic. Successful projects will focus on mechanistic studies of the disease and its sequela; virology, immunity and pathophysiology; and epidemiology and behavioural science. Dame Ottoline Leyser, Chief Executive of UK Research and Innovation, said: "In the UK, emerging evidence shows that, after taking account of age and other sociodemographic factors, people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are nearly twice as likely to die of Covid-19 as white people. There is an urgent need for more data on why Covid-19 disproportionately impacts people from minority ethnic backgrounds in the UK and around the world. "Through the UKRI-DBT Covid-19 Partnership Initiative, we hope to support collaborative UK-India research teams to investigate exactly that. We hope the findings from this new programme will help to mitigate the severity of Covid-19 in the UK and India.” A second Covid-19 related project, detailed in the joint statement issued by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the end of their dialogue, involves the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) contributing to India's Coronavirus Joint Response Plan (JRP) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) via the World Health Organisation (WHO), with an initial amount of GBP 600,000. This will provide a platform for further bilateral cooperation on AMR through a Fleming Fund partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-uk-strike-new-covid-19-research-tie-ups-908622.html

Following this, Jain withdrew the defamation case he filed against Mishra, who was AAP Minister and left the party following differences with Kejriwal and other leaders. After recording the unconditional apology, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja allowed Jain to withdraw his complaint. In his statement submitted in the court, Mishra said the statements made against Jain were "politically motivated and wrong" and that he tenders "unconditional apology to the complainant and the same will never be repeated". "It is submitted by the accused that he is ready to make the statement before the court tendering unconditional apology. The complainant also submitted that in case the accused gives his statement before the court, he shall withdraw the present complaint," the judge said in his order. "Separate statement of accused, as well as complainant, recorded. In view of the statement given by the complainant, the present complaint stands disposed off as withdrawn," he said. During a press conference, Mishra had said, "I saw Satyendar Jain give Kejriwal Rs two crore in cash. I asked him 'What is this?' He (Kejriwal) refused to answer. And then he said in politics things like this happen that can only be talked about later." AAP tweeted, "truth prevails! Kapil Mishra tenders unconditional apology to Satyendar Jain for levelling false charges of corruption against him. Admits directing baseless and politically motivated charges against the AAP leader." As AAP celebrated the apology, Mishra hit back tweeting images of a series of apologies issued by Kejriwal to political opponents who had filed defamation cases against him. "Thirty (apologies) by AAP. Mine one. Elders have said that some things should be learned from the enemy as well. If AAP abuses me for entering into a compromise in a defamation case, then all those abuses will apply to Kejriwal as well in around 30 times (when he issued apology)," Mishra said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kapil-mishra-apologises-to-aap-minister-satyendar-jain-for-rs-2-crore-bribe-barb-908627.html

29-10-2020||National||SC to examine Ordinance on Commission to tackle air pollution||The Supreme Court on Thursday decided to examine an Ordinance issued by the Union government to set up a permanent Commission to tackle air pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted a couple of matters related to PIL by environmental activist M C Mehta and a minor, Aditya Dubey, for consideration next Friday. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the court "we have come out with a law, and the ordinance has been promulgated." "President Ram Nath Kovind signed the Ordinance to tackle air pollution and to monitor and improve air quality in Delhi-NCR," he said. "We would like to look at Ordinance before passing any order. Even the petitioners would like to see. Let's hear it next Friday," the bench said. The petitioners raised the issue of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Dubey, cautioned that the situation would get worse by next week. "We will hear all parties and look at the points made by you. This is not an adversarial litigation," the bench said. In a lighter vein, the CJI told Mehta, "If any of the parties here fall sick because of air pollution till next date then you are solely responsible." Mehta was quick to acknowledge, saying, "What falls from you is mandamus". The CJI also observed that some experts have informed us informally that it is not only stubble burning that created pollution.  "All of you should also stop using the beautiful cars. All of you start using bicycles now," he remarked. The Union government had on Thursday brought out an Ordinance to set up a permanent Commission for air quality management in Delhi and adjoining areas as it has become a cause of concern due to activities of stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust and urban construction. The contravention of Commission's orders would be an offence, punishable with upto five-year jail or with fine upto Rs one crore or both. A 'Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas' would be set to provide a permanent solution and establish a self regulated, and democratically monitored mechanism for tackling air pollution, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-examine-ordinance-on-commission-to-tackle-air-pollution-908645.html

A bench presided over by Justice U U Lalit asked senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for Rao's wife to approach the High Court. The court noted that the questions regarding human rights of an accused-prisoner were involved here and that the matter was last heard by the HC on September 17. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for Rao's wife Pendyala Hemlatha, contended that his right to health was being violated. The bench, however, said since cognisance has been taken so we cannot say detention of the man was illegal. The issue of bail was before the HC. The bail could be on merit or on medical grounds. Jaising said the report by Nanavati Hospital was before the HC. It is bothering us that two judges recused and the matter was not being heard, she added. "Why is the matter not being listed before the HC? We can direct for the matter to be heard by the HC in two weeks," the bench said. Jaising submitted that prisoners have a right to health in custody as held by the Supreme Court. She claimed that the petitioner’s right to life and dignity was being violated. "The High Court must see if facilities at Taloja hospital is sufficient. We need to see if jail hospital has all the facilities or not. If they have, then you can't say there is better facility in England or Nanavati. If its available, then treatment will be in jail hospital," the bench said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the NIA in the matter.  The court finally allowed the petitioner to withdraw the plea and approach the High Court. In her writ petition, Rao's wife Hemalatha claimed that his continued custody amounted to "cruel and inhuman treatment," violating his right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. She said Rao was hospitalised on May 27 but was hurriedly discharged on June 2. His bail plea on the grounds of his medical condition and Covid-19 was pending despite the fact that he needed constant follow-up. Varavara Rao and nine other activists have been arrested by Maharashtra police in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case which was initially probed by the Pune police and transferred to the NIA in January this year. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune in December 31,2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-declines-to-consider-plea-for-interim-bail-to-varavara-rao-908646.html

Bombay High Court asks Centre||The Bombay High Court on Thursday asked the Union government to clarify whether "excessive" reportage by the press on an ongoing investigation amounted to interference in the administration of justice under the Contempt of Courts Act. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni asked the government to state by November 6 if such reportage adversely affects the probe and subsequent trial, and if the court should lay guidelines on media reporting. "If there is excessive reporting, that can put an accused on guard, and he may resort to destroying evidence or absconding. Or if that person is actually innocent, the excessive media reporting can damage his reputation," it said. "We would not like the media to cross it boundaries and we would also like to be within our boundaries," the court said and asked the state if such reportage would amount to interference and if the government thought the HC had the jurisdiction to frame guidelines. "Whetherexcessive reporting by media in an ongoing investigation amounts to interference in the administration of justice under Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act and should we lay guidelines? This is the issue before us," HC said. It also asked the government's counsel, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, to consider scenarios where such reportage on an ongoing probe, where a charge sheet was yet to be filed, influenced the investigating officer or resulted in a witness being threatened. It asked if the court must step in and formulate guidelines to regulate the press to avoid such scenarios. "If media identifies that a person is a very vital witness, he could be won over, threatened, or he could be even physically harmed so that he does not give evidence," it said. On the possibility of the press influencing an investigating officer, the HC said, "Think of a police officer. Can anyone guarantee that he will not be influenced?" "He may be following a particular track. Media says no no this must be the track. He loses track and rounds up an innocent person," it said. "Or, if the officer is competent and does not get influenced, then the media starts maligning him. Is this welcome in a society governed by rule of law?" the HC asked. The court was hearing final arguments on a bunch of public interest litigations seeking that the media trial in the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death be stopped. The pleas have been filed by some activists and retired police officers. On the previous hearings, the HC heard the petitioners, private TV news channels, and the National Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) on the need for a regulatory mechanism for the electronic media. The TV channels and the NBSA argued in favour of a self-regulatory mechanism and said the state must not be given any control over their content. On Thursday, the HC said it had expected the government to address the court on the queries raised above. It directed ASG Singh to file his written submission and address the court on November 6 on all the questions raised by the bench. The court said the media often defended such reportage by saying it constituted investigative journalism. However, investigative journalism meant "to lay bare the truth," it said. "Is there any law which says that whatever an investigation agency collected as evidence should be laid before the public? Where is the obligation for the investigating officer to disclose evidence?" the HC asked. "How does the postmortem report come to the media unless of course it is disclosed? Should we lay down guidelines on these aspects?" the court sought to know. The HC also said if the press had access to information that could aid a probe, then it should give such information to police under Section 38 of the Criminal Procedure Code||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/can-excessive-media-reporting-hinder-justice-bombay-high-court-asks-centre-908649.html

The proportion of children not enrolled in schools were 1.8% in the age group of 6-10 years in 2018. “Because schools are closed, many young children have not yet secured admission to Std 1. The increase in not enrolled children in the 6-10 age group is therefore likely to be more a reflection of children waiting to enroll in school rather than of children who have indeed dropped out,” the survey noted. The survey found, at the national level, a small shift in enrollment from private schools to government-run institutions across all grades and among both – girls and boys. “The proportion of boys enrolled in government schools rose from 62.8% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2020. Similarly, the proportion of girls enrolled in government schools rose from 70% to 73% during the same period,” it said. Although only a third of children had received materials from their teachers during the week preceding the survey, most children (70.2%) had done some sort of learning activity during that week. The survey found that these activities were shared by diverse sources such as private tutors and family members themselves, in addition to or instead of what was received from schools. “The proportion of children in government schools and private schools doing these activities was similar. However, … children in private schools were much more likely to have accessed online resources than those in government schools,” the survey found. For instance, 28.7% of children enrolled in private schools had watched videos or other pre recorded content online, as compared to 18.3% of government school students. “States, where less than a quarter of all children had received any material, include Rajasthan (21.5%), Uttar Pradesh (21%), and Bihar (7.7%). Regardless of school type, WhatsApp was the most common medium through which activities and materials were received. However, this proportion was much higher among children in private schools (87.2%) than those in government schools (67.3%). The survey was conducted in September, the sixth month of school closure due ti the Covid pandemic in 26 states and four union territories. It reached a total of 52,227 households and 59,251 children in the age group of 5-16 years, as well as teachers or head teachers from 8,963 government schools offering primary grades.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/more-kids-aged-between-6-10-not-enrolling-in-schools-proportion-sees-sharp-hike-survey-908664.html

The schemes will promote women researchers in regular service in academic and research institutions to take up R&D at the highest level through two categories of research support: SERB – POWER Fellowship and SERB – POWER Research Grants. The SERB-Power Fellowship offers a personal fellowship and a research grant to top-performing women researchers for a period of three years, while the SERB – Power Research Grants ensure funding to undertake highly impactful research across all disciplines of Science & Technology. The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) is a body under the Department of Science and Technology. Speaking at the virtual event, Vardhan emphasised the significance of empowering women researchers in the S&T landscape. He said globally, just 30 per cent of the world's researchers are women while 18.6 per cent of India's full-time R&D personnel are women. Highlighting the problems faced by women scientists like career interruptions especially related to caregiving responsibilities, Vardhan said they need special attention and alternate ways of support system. The new Science Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) 2020 will also emphasise on encouraging women scientists, he said. The SERB – Power Fellowship will be given to women researchers in the age group of 35-55 years. The fellowship will be of Rs 15,000 per month in addition to regular income, while the research grant will be of Rs 10 lakh per annum for a period of three years. Under the SERB – Power Research Grants, women researchers will be funded under two categories. The first category includes women scientists from IITs, IISERs, IISc, NITs, central universities, and national labs of the Central government institutions. They will be eligible for funding up to Rs 60 lakhs for three years. Level two will comprise scientists and researchers from state universities/ colleges and private academics. They will be eligible for funding up to 30 lakhs for three years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dst-launches-schemes-for-women-scientists-researchers-in-science-and-engineering-908677.html

"Humne Hindustan ko ghus ke maara (We hit India in their home). Our success in Pulwama, is a success of this nation under the leadership of Imran Khan. You and us are all part of that success," Science & Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in the National Assembly during a debate. Chaudhry, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, made the remarks a day after Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ayaz Sadiq said that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded to release Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019, after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets. In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. "Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night'", Sadiq said, recalling the high-level meeting which was also attended by Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, and added that "India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan." Chaudhry, who was the information and broadcasting minister at the time of the Pulwama attack, criticised Sadiq’s remarks and termed them as "inappropriate".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pak-minister-fawad-chaudhry-admits-pakistans-role-in-pulwama-terrorist-attack-in-jk-908692.html

Metropolitan magistrate Bhagawat T Zirape ordered the inquiry, saying that it was necessary in deciding the role of the accused. The court also asked the police station concerned to submit the inquiry report by December 5. Advocate Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh had approached the court saying that no action was taken by Amboli police, where he had lodged the complaint against the sisters. As per the complaint, Chandel had posted a hate speech on Twitter in April targeting a particular community, following which her account on the micro-blogging site was suspended. The "Queen" actress had later posted a video in support of her sister over her controversial tweets. In the video that was released on various social media platforms, she called a sect of that community as terrorist, the complaint said. This way, both the accused posted hateful and derogatory statements against the community, it said. The metropolitan magistrate, after verification of the complaint, said that the evidence against the accused was electronic in nature and police inquiry was necessary for proceeding against the accused. Recently, the Bandra Police had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Ranaut and her sister after a local court ordered them to investigate a complaint filed by a Bollywood casting director and fitness trainer, who accused them of promoting enmity between communities through their remarks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/court-orders-probe-into-social-media-posts-of-kangana-ranaut-sister-rangoli-chandel-908695.html

Here are the top news of October 29, 2020: Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of Kerala CPI(M) secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, was on Thursday arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after being questioned in connection with his alleged links with an accused in the Bengaluru drug case. Bineesh was questioned at the agency's zonal office here this morning for three hours following which he was taken to the court for further proceedings. This was the third time Bineesh was asked to appear before the central agency for interrogation. Bengaluru City Police Commissioner has prohibited sale, consumption, procurement and storage of liquor or any intoxicant in specific areas from 05:00pm on November 1 to 12 midnight of November 3 and from 06:00am on November to 12 midnight of November 10, in view of RR Nagar Assembly by-poll. Tamil superstar Rajinikanth on Thursday dropped a hint that his much anticipated entry into politics may not happen during the 2021 elections as announced three years back. With just seven months to go for the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, the actor posted a terse statement on his verified Twitter page to "quell rumours" about a letter circulating on the social media in his name. But the statement raised more questions on the actor's political entry.  "A letter which claims to be my statement is being circulated on the social media widely. Everyone knows that is not my statement. However, the details mentioned in the letter about my health is true. I will consult functionaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram at an appropriate time and announce my political stand," Rajinikanth said in the statement. Amid speculation that some of her party MLAs could switch sides in Uttar Pradesh, BSP leader Mayawati on Thursday said to ensure the defeat of Samajwadi Party candidates in future elections, including those of MLC and Rajya Sabha, her party will vote for BJP or any other party's candidate. The former UP Chief Minister said her party will leave no stone unturned to defeat SP candidates even if it means voting for candidates of BJP or any other party. Any candidate who dominates over SP's second candidate will get BSP MLAs' vote, she said in a statement. Controversial BJP leader Kapil Mishra has tendered an unconditional apology to senior AAP leader and Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain for accusing him three years ago of paying Rs two crore to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Following this, Jain withdrew the defamation case he filed against Mishra, who was AAP Minister and left the party following differences with Kejriwal and other leaders. After recording the unconditional apology, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja allowed Jain to withdraw his complaint. Veteran politician and BJP's first chief minister in Gujarat Keshubhai Patel passed away in Ahmedabad on Thursday at the age of 92. His family told media persons that Patel was rushed to a hospital early morning after he complained of breathlessness. About ten days back, he was tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to a private hospital from where he was discharged after recovery. However, Patel's condition deteriorated again on Thursday morning as he complained of difficulty in breathing. He was rushed to Sterling hospital where he died during the treatment. A knife-wielding man killed three people at a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday, slitting the throat of at least one of them, in what officials are treating as the latest jihadist attack to rock the country. It was the third attack in two months in France. The assailant was wounded by police and hospitalized after the killings at the Notre Dame Church, less than a kilometer from the site in 2016 where another attacker plowed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd, killing dozens. Less than two weeks ago, an assailant decapitated a French middle school teacher who showed caricatures of the Prophet for a class on free speech. Those caricatures were published by Charlie Hebdo and cited by the men who gunned down the newspaper's editorial meeting in 2015. In September, a man who had sought asylum in France attacked bystanders outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices with a butcher knife.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-ed-arrests-bineesh-kodiyeri-tamil-superstar-rajinikanth-hints-at-shelving-his-political-ambitions-908704.html

"The NHAI needed urgent reforms. The time had come to act against the non-performing employees," he said while inaugurating the new building of the NHAI at Dwaraka in Delhi. "We have been unable to identify performance bottlenecks. Many committees were formed, they gave their report. But these corrupt and inept and lazy people of NHAI are so powerful that despite orders, they take wrong decisions," he said. The NHAI is a nodal agency to build national highways. The Minister also expressed unhappiness over progress in constructing the new building. The building was planned in 2008 and construction started in 2011 and it has been completed in 2020. "Why so much delay in completing construction of building Rs 250 crore worth building. In nine years period, two governments came to Centre and 8 chairmen served the NHAI. Who is responsible for the delay," Gadkari said. "The current chairman and members are unrelated to it. But the great personalities who worked on it from 2011 to 2020, If possible, their photos should be put up in the building. They delayed decisions for nine years," he said. "We say with pride that we will complete the Delhi-Mumbai expressway in two to three years. It is worth Rs 80,000 to 1 lakh crore. But it took so many years to complete this project of Rs 250 crore,"  Gadkari said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-slams-corrupt-nhai-officials-for-delay-in-projects-908711.html

He also expressed confidence that the target of making India a $5-trillion economy will be achieved by 2024, saying that the crisis gave the government an opportunity to carry out reforms that were waiting to happen for decades but no one earlier took the initiative. "Reforms across sectors such as coal, agriculture, labour, defence, civil aviation and so on have been undertaken which will help us get back on the high growth path that we were on before the crisis," Modi said in an interview published in the Economic Times newspaper on Thursday. On Covid-19 vaccine, he said every Indian will be vaccinated as and when a vaccine becomes available, though the focus initially would be on protecting the most vulnerable and the frontline workers. Modi reiterated that there should be no room for complacency in fighting this virus and the only way forward is to take precautions such as wearing masks, hand washing and social distancing. He said the government in the very beginning decided to be proactive and introduced a timely nationwide lockdown. "We not only got the broad timing of various phases of lockdown right, we also got the unlock process right and much of our economy is also coming back on track. The data for August and September indicates that" he said. He said this is a new virus and countries which had initially controlled the outbreak are now reporting a resurgence. "The geographical spread of India, population density, the regular social gatherings must be kept in mind when we look at these numbers and seek to compare with others. Many of our states are larger than countries," he added. Modi said India's response in tackling the crisis has been focused on increasing capabilities to handle the situation, making people more aware, creating more facilities etc in keeping with the dictum 'Hope for the best but prepare for the worst'. Asked about plans for further stimulus for the economy, he said, "We will take all measures needed to constantly stimulate the economy in a timely manner while ensuring overall macro-economic stability. "Remember, we are still not over with the pandemic. Yet, our economy has shown a remarkable capability to bounce back, largely because of the resilience of our people. "This is something that is not captured in these numbers but is the reason behind those numbers. The shop-owner, the trader, the person running an MSME, the person working on the factory floor, the entrepreneur, all these are the heroes responsible for the strong market sentiment and revival of the economy," he said. Modi further said India has not started speaking about manufacturing only after the pandemic and the work has been continuing on increasing manufacturing for some time now. "India is, after all, a young country with a skilled workforce. But India doesn't believe in gaining from the loss of others. India will become a global manufacturing hub on its own strengths. "Our effort is not to become some country's alternative, but to become a country which offers unique opportunities. We want to see the progress of all. If India progresses, one-sixth of humanity will progress," he said. Referring to a new world order that was formed after World War II, the prime minister said something similar will happen post-Covid-19. "This time, India will ride the bus of manufacturing and integrating in global supply chains. We have specific advantages in the form of democracy, demography and demand," he said. On the USD 5-trillion target for the Indian economy by 2024, he said, "Our government has a track record of meeting our targets." "We met the rural sanitation target before the deadline, we met the village electrification target before the deadline, we met the 8 crore Ujjwala connections target too well before the deadline. So, going by our track record and continuing reforms, people also have confidence in our abilities to reach the target," Modi said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-got-unlock-process-right-much-of-economy-coming-back-on-track-pm-confident-of-meeting-5-trillion-target-by-2024-908715.html
29-10-2020||National||Gold smuggling case: ED alleges multiple offences against Sivasankar||The Enforcement Directorate, probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case, has alleged multiple offences against M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to the Chief Minister, arrested by it on Wednesday night in connection with the sensational case. The National Investigation Agency, Customs and the ED are conducting separate investigations into the seizure of gold worth nearly Rs 15 crore from a "diplomatic baggage" of UAE consulate at Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. The ED has alleged that Sivasankar had intervened to clear the diplomatic baggage containing smuggled gold without examination by the Customs at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport. Sivasankar was remanded to the agency's custody for seven days by a court here today. In its arrest order, the ED has claimed that during his statement given to it on October 15, Sivasankar admitted to having spoken to a senior Customs officer and made the request as per the wishes of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the gold smuggling case. "This clearly shows your active involvement in the offences committed by Swapna Suresh," the ED said in the order. The probe agency claimed that during its investigation, it was revealed that he was involved in the commission of a scheduled offence. "Whatsapp chats between Sivasankar and Swapna revealed that she has requested Sivasankar to intervene with the Terminal Manager/Airport Authority/Customs Authority for some work at the airport/ clearance of diplomatic baggage without examination by the Customs," it said. The agency said this also amounts to misuse of public office and interference in the official working of other government departments. It said analysis of WhatsApp chats is also indicative of the fact that Sivasankar, in his official capacity, might have called for the clearance of other diplomatic cargos as well including the ones containing smuggled gold because nobody could tell what was inside such diplomatic bags once cleared un-examined. "It has been found that 21 consignments were sent between 2019 and 2020 and Sivasankar's involvement has helped in the commission of the offence. This clearly shows that you (Sivasankar) knowingly assisted in the process of activity connected with the proceeds of crime and therefore committed the offence of money laundering," the ED said. The agency on Thursday sought 14-day custody of the officer when he was produced before the Special PMLA court here. It said an investigation under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has revealed that a bank locker was hired in State Bank of India, Thiruvananthapuram City branch on November 30, 2018, jointly in the name of Swapna Suresh and his chartered accountant P Venugopal on the instructions of Sivasankar. The ED said Venugopal has also admitted that Sivasankar wanted him to manage the finances of Swapna Suresh. Venugopal has submitted Whatsapp messages to that effect. Further, during the search conducted by NIA, an amount of Rs 64 lakh was seized from this locker and Rs 36.50 lakh from another locker in Federal Bank, statue branch, Thiruvananthapuram. This proceeds of crime were generated by Swapna Suresh with the active support of Sivasankar, the ED said. When Sivasankar was confronted with these facts he remained evasive and non-cooperative, the agency said while seeking his custody. Granting his seven days custody to the ED, the court said the accused shall not be subjected to any sort of harassment or torture while in enforcement custody. He shall be given liberty to contact his lawyer and there shall be a break for one hour if interrogation continues for three hours, it said. The court also directed that the interrogation shall be done only from 9 am to 6 pm and there shall not be any interrogation at all after 6 pm. He shall be allowed to take rest after 6 pm, it added. The court directed the investigating officer to ensure all medical assistance to Sivasankar and provide ayurvedic treatment to him for his back pain during the period of custody without disturbing the interrogation process. If necessary, he can be taken to the doctor even after 6 pm, the court said after Sivasankar complained to the judge about his disc prolapse issues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gold-smuggling-case-ed-alleges-multiple-offences-against-sivasankar-908718.html

A three-judge bench by a majority view of 2:1 passed a landmark ruling, saying a statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the special law. According to Section 67 of the NDPS Act, any officer authorised by the Centre or a state government may during an investigation call for information “from any person for the purpose of satisfying himself whether there has been any contravention of the provisions of this Act or any rule or order made thereunder”. "The officers who are invested with powers under Section 53 of the NDPS Act are “police officers” within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act. As a result of which, any confessional statement made to them would be barred under the provisions of Section 25 of the Evidence Act, and cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act," the majority view of Justices R F Nariman and Navin Sinha said. Notably, a confession recorded by the police officer of an accused cannot be used against him under Section 25 of the Evidence Act. Justice Indira Banerjee, however, differed with the majority view, saying she was unable to agree to a view that a statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used against an accused offender in the trial of an offence. "A confessional statement does not automatically result in the conviction of an accused offender. Such statements have to be tendered and proved in accordance with the law. The evidentiary value of the statement which is confessional in nature has to be weighed and assessed by the court at the trial," she said. The court passed its judgement on a reference made by a division bench in 2013.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/statements-by-officers-under-ndps-cannot-be-treated-as-confessions-sc-908733.html

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the country that provides shelter to "maximum number of UN-proscribed terrorists" should not even attempt to play the victim card. "The whole world knows truth about Pakistan's role in supporting terrorism," he said at a media briefing while answering questions on Islamabad's reaction to the Indo-US joint statement. "Even their leaders have time and again spoken about their role with regard to terrorism," Srivastava said. In the joint statement, India and the US on Tuesday strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms and asked Pakistan to take "immediate, sustained and irreversible" action to ensure that no territory under its control is used for launching terror attacks. In its reaction, Pakistan on Wednesday called it "unwarranted" the reference made towards it. "We reject the Pakistan-specific reference in the joint statement', issued by India and the US after their 2+2 ministerial dialogue," the Pakistan Foreign Office had said in its reaction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/whole-world-knows-truth-about-pakistans-role-in-supporting-terrorism-india-908735.html

A meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi cleared the proposed Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC). Officials said that the MoC will pave the way for cooperation between the two countries in various fields like the rollout of 5G network, telecom security, submarine cable, standard certification of communication equipment, utilisation of the latest wireless technologies, capacity building, public protection and disaster relief, Artificial Intelligence, BlockChain, Spectrum Chain and Spectrum Management. It will also set the framework for bilateral cooperation in multilateral platforms, they said. The pact is likely to be inked when Modi and the new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will hold the next annual bilateral summit. They also sign the pact on cybersecurity cooperation which was approved by the government on October 7. The government said the MoC would further enhance opportunities for India to get into the global standardisation process, apart from helping it strengthen its ICT infrastructure and the development of future submarine cable networks and technologies will help in boost connectivity of mainland India to remote areas. A government press release issued after the Cabinet meeting said, “the MoC aims to promote human capacity building in the field of ICTs and further development of the startup ecosystem which will contribute in realising the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat.”  Tokyo had in December 2018 banned the use of Huawei equipment in rolling out 5G technology in Japan, months after President Donald Trump’s administration did so in the US. Japan’s telecom giants Rakuten Mobile Inc, NTT Docomo Inc., KDDI Corp. and SoftBank Corp. have already launched 5G mobile internet service. Notwithstanding pressure from the US to exclude companies based in China, Modi government had on December 30 last year announced its decision to let all network equipment makers, including Huawei, to participate in the 5G trial in India. In the wake of the stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, New Delhi earlier this year banned the use of several apps linked to China-based companies. But Modi government last month informed the Parliament that it had no plan to keep Huawei and ZTE Corporation out of the 5G rollout in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-clears-text-of-india-japan-pact-for-cooperation-in-5g-telecom-security-908744.html

The ministry had on May 21 placed these limits through seven bands, classified on the basis of flight duration, till August 24. Later, it was extended till November 24. Puri said if the scheduled domestic flights reach pre-Covid levels by the end of the year, he will have no hesitation in removing the fare limits at that time. "We are extending the price bands for another three months," he said at a press conference. "Even though we are extending it by three months, if by the time we reach the end of the year, and if we find that there is a very appreciable movement in the situation and we are reaching pre-Covid levels, I would absolutely have no hesitation if my colleagues (aviation ministry officials) want us to not utilise the price band for the full three months period," Puri added. Domestic passenger services resumed on May 25 after nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak.  The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had on May 21 announced seven bands of ticket pricing with lower and upper fare limits based on flight duration. The first such band consists of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration. The lower and the upper fare limits for the first band is Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, respectively. The subsequent bands are for flights with durations of 40-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, 90-120 minutes, 120-150 minutes, 150-180 minutes and 180-210 minutes.

Sinha (62), a former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, will succeed Bimal Jhulka who retired in August this year while Mahurkar, a Senior Deputy Editor with India Today and who considers himself a follower of controversial right-wing figure Savarkar, will be the sixth Information Commissioner. While formal orders are yet to be issued, sources said a three-member panel headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cleared the names of Sinha and Mahurkar. There are still four vacancies in the 11-member Commission. However, sources said Congress Leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a member of the panel, has submitted a dissent note, objected to the way in which the short-listing of candidates has been done.   Chowdhury is also learnt to have objected to Mahurkar's appointment as his name was not among the applicants but found space in the short-list. Seven persons, including Mahurkar, were short-listed for the post of Information Commissioner from among 355 applicants. Home Amit Shah is the third member in the panel, which met twice this month to decide on the names. Replying to a message about his appointment on Twitter, Mahurkar said, "an opportunity to serve the nation in Veer Savarkar’s spirit of true Nation First." He was responding to BJP Tamil Nadu spokesperson and RSS "Swayamsevak" S G Suryah who tweeted, "fellow Savarkarite and senior journalist Uday Mahurkar is appointed as the Information Commissioner in Government of India. This is a well deserving recognition and honour. Congratulations on your new responsibility Swamin." Mahurkar is also the author of 'Marching with a Billion', a book on Modi's governance. In the choice of Sinha, sources said, the government has followed the seniority principle. Sinha, a 1981-batch IFS officer, was appointed an Information Commissioner in January 2019 and is the senior-most among them. Activists had earlier criticised the Narendra Modi government for allowing the CIC to remain headless for the fifth time in the last six years when Jhulka retired on August 27. Transparency activist Anjali Bhardwaj also approached the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing alleging that the Central government has defied the apex court's directions on appointments in the body.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/y-k-sinha-likely-to-be-cic-journalist-mahurkar-new-ic-908756.html

Modi took to Twitter to “strongly condemn” the recent terrorist attacks in France, including the one at a church on Thursday. “Our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and the people of France. India stands with France in the fight against terrorism.” I strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in France, including today's heinous attack in Nice inside a church. Our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and the people of France. India stands with France in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla reached Paris on Thursday to meet his counterpart and other officials in the French Government. He is likely to underline New Delhi’s views on terrorism and stress on India-France cooperation in strengthening the global fight against the menace. Shringla, who delivered a speech at Institut Français des Relations Internationales (IFRI), reiterated New Delhi’s position that nothing could justify terrorism. He referred to the robust cooperation between India and France in combating terrorism. Ahead of Foreign Secretary’s visit to Paris, India extended support to France even as the President of the West European nation, Emmanuel Macron, drew flak for making some comments, which some perceived to be Islamophobic. New Delhi subtly disapproved Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s recent comment on French President. “We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said, without directly referring to the Turkish President’s recent comment that French President needed treatment for his mental condition. What irked Erdoğan was the comment made by Macron after the recent beheading of a teacher Samuel Paty in Paris. Paty was killed by Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov after he showed some cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. Macron said after the killing that France would defend freedom of speech and would not give cartoons, drawings. In a speech delivered before the murder of Paty, Macron also said that Islam was in crisis all over the world. Not only Erdoğan, but Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan also reacted to French President’s comment. “This is a time when President Macron could have put a healing touch and denied space to extremists rather than creating further polarization and marginalization that inevitably leads to radicalization,” said Khan. Macron’s Government in Paris has been steadfastly supporting New Delhi in the campaign against terrorism, particularly in drawing global attention to export of the menace from Pakistan to India. France, along with the United States, helped India overcome resistance by China and Pakistan to get Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Moulana Masood Azhar sanctioned by the United Nations after the February 14, 2019 terror attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-stands-with-france-in-fight-against-terrorism-says-prime-minister-narendra-modi-908761.html

29-10-2020||National||Military talks with China have no link with 'any extraneous issue': India||India on Thursday said its military talks with China on the border row have no connection with "any extraneous issue", comments that came in the backdrop of recently concluded Indo-US 2+2 dialogue during which the two countries discussed Beijing's military belligerence in eastern Ladakh and Indo-Pacific region, and inked a strategic defence pact. About the next round of corps commander-level talks with China, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the two sides have agreed to maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible. "Let me make it clear that there is no connection between this and any extraneous issue," he said at a media briefing while replying to questions on the Sino-India boundary row, and whether China has delayed the next round of military talks due to signing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) between India and the US during their 2+2 dialogue. On Tuesday, India and the US inked the BECA that provides for sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information. "As regards the recent 2+2, ...the external affairs minister had stated that the Indo-Pacific region was a particular focus of our talks. We reiterated the importance of peace, stability and prosperity for all countries in this region," Srivastava said. "This is possible only by upholding the rules-based international order, ensuring the freedom of navigation in the international seas, promoting open connectivity and respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states," he said. China's military belligerence in eastern Ladakh and Indo-Pacific region figured during the 2+2 strategic dialogue with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo strongly affirming that it stands firmly with New Delhi in its efforts to defend sovereignty. In its reaction, China urged Pompeo to stop sowing discord between Beijing and other countries in the region. In his briefing, Srivastava also referred to the last round of military dialogue between Indian and Chinese armies on 12 October, saying it enabled in-depth discussions between the two sides resulting in enhanced understanding of each other’s positions. "The two sides had agreed to maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible," he said. The MEA Spokesperson said the two sides agreed to implement the understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries in not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas. "Accordingly we have maintained communications with the Chinese side with a view to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and restore full peace and tranquillity," he said. The two sides have so far held seven rounds of high-level military talks on the border row. However, there has been no breakthrough on the disengagement of troops from the friction points so far. India has been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region. Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters. The sixth round of talks took place with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave. The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/military-talks-with-china-have-no-link-with-any-extraneous-issue-india-908773.html

Top executives of the search engine appeared before the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Personal Data Protection Bill and responded to queries related to data security. Gitanjali Duggal, Google's director and head of legal in India; Aman Jain, head of government affairs and public policy; and Rahul Jain, manager of public policy and government relations, deposed before the panel, headed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi. "They themselves are the platforms, sellers and news agencies. And Google itself has the control button to which information will come first, which will come later or which news will flash and which will be suppressed. So how it can be a neutral platform?" Lekhi told PTI after the meeting. Members of the panel, including Congress MP Vivek Tankha, BJP MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar and BJD MPs Bhartruhari Mahtab and Amar Patnaik, posed a number of queries to Google representatives. According to sources, some panel members asked them the search engine is "controlling the choices of your users, isn't it a violation of fundamental rights?" During the meeting, MPs cutting across party lines asked how can Google be a "neutral platform" when it is engaged in both advertising and content, and how is it possible that it does not give "preferential treatment" to some advertisers in search results, sources said. Some members also posed questions whether data being processed and stored in the country of origin or somewhere outside, sources said. Noting that Google has a wider presence and available on different forms on the web, some members said it "has the power to affect the choices of its users" and that needs to be checked. The members stressed that regulations are required for the safety and processing of data, according to sources. A few MPs also posed queries about Google's linkages with public relations and image makeover agencies for positive public profiling of individuals on the web by suppressing critical content against them, sources said. Besides Google, representatives of Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and Paytm have deposed before the panel. Representatives of telecom operators Reliance Jio and Airtel and cab aggregators Ola and Uber have been asked to appear before it. The committee is examining the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The Personal Data Protection Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha by Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on December 11, 2019. The bill seeks to provide for protection of personal data of individuals and establishment of a data protection authority for the same. The bill was later referred to a joint select committee of both Houses of Parliament. The proposed law seeks bar on storing and processing of personal data by entities without the explicit consent of an individual.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/isnt-google-violating-users-fundamental-rights-by-controlling-choices-asks-parliamentary-panel-908784.html

The global map printed on the new 20 Riyal banknote, released to mark Saudi Arabia's Presidency of the G20 grouping, does not feature Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as part of India. MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India has asked Saudi Arabia to take "urgent corrective steps" in the matter and asserted that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of the country. "We have seen the banknote referred by you which gives an incorrect depiction of India's external territorial boundaries. The note was issued by Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority on October 24 to mark the occasion of Saudi presidency of the G20," Srivastava said during a weekly media briefing. "We have conveyed our serious concern to Saudi Arabia, both through their Ambassador in New Delhi as well as in Riyadh, for this gross misrepresentation of India's external territorial boundaries on an official and legal banknote of Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudi side to take urgent corrective steps in this regard," he said. Srivastava said, "I would like to further reiterate that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of India." According to reports, the map does not even depict Pakistan-occupied- Kashmir including Gilgit-Baltistan as part of Pakistani territory. Pakistan considers Saudi Arabia as a key ally, and exclusion of the PoK from the map of Pakistan is seen by many in Islamabad as a major snub to the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-conveys-serious-concern-to-saudi-over-gross-misrepresentation-of-its-external-boundaries-908794.html

Top central government officials on Thursday reviewed the Covid-19 situation with these three states, which had been advised to gear up the “testing, tracking and treatment’ strategy during the festival season besides giving a thrust to public awareness and enforcement of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. In the last 24 hours, there were 49,881 new infections in the country whereas 43,893 cases were recorded on October 28. India registered its lowest Covid-19 numbers in the recent months on Oct 27 with 36,470 new cases, as per the Union Health Ministry. Incidentally, on the same day, the number of new Covid-19 deaths also dropped below the 500 mark after several weeks. The relief, however, was a brief one as the daily toll crossed 500 on the very next day. On Thursday, the official record shows 517 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours. More than 58% of these deaths occur in five states – Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. Similarly, nearly 57% of the new cases were concentrated in Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Karnataka. “The bad news is that West Bengal, Kerala and Delhi all have R-values more than one. And Delhi has a whopping 1.13,” Sitabhra Sinha, a scientist at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai who is tracking the epidemic from the beginning with his model, told DH. R is the number of persons one infected person can spread the infection to. An R-value of 1.9 means that 10 infected persons will on average cause 19 new infections. The R-value will be much below one for the nation as well as for individual states when the epidemic will subside. The most alarming rise is being seen in Delhi that witnessed nearly 46% increase in the new cases over the past four weeks, and 9% jump in the positivity rate in the same period. The rising cases were due to the social gatherings during the festivities, deteriorating air quality, increasing incidences of respiratory disorders and clusters of positive cases at workplaces, said a Health Ministry official. In West Bengal, the average daily cases have recorded 23% increase over the last four weeks while there is 1% increase in the positivity rate. In the same period, the average daily cases have recorded an 11% increase in Kerala. Since the increase in new cases due to festivities was a matter of grave concern, the states had been suggested to ramp up the awareness practices and promote mask-wearing with more rigour, the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-cases-are-on-the-rise-again-india-records-nearly-50000-cases-on-october-29-908824.html

The new banknote issued by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority was initially cheered by the netizens of India, as the world map printed on it did not show Gilgit-Baltistan and the parts of Kashmir illegally occupied by Pakistan as part of the territory of the neighbouring country. However, it was noticed later that the map on the banknote also put Ladakh and J&K outside the territory of India. New Delhi has now lodged a protest with the Saudi Arabian government and asked it to immediately withdraw the banknote and reissue it with the correct map of India. The banknote was issued to commemorate Saudi Arabia’s G20 presidency. The King of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, will host the G20 summit next month. “We have seen the banknote which gives an incorrect depiction of India's external territorial boundaries,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said. The Modi Government lodged a protest with Saudi Arabia, both through the envoy of Riyadh to New Delhi as well as through the Embassy of India in the capital of the kingdom. New Delhi conveyed its “serious concern” over “gross misrepresentation” of India’s “external territorial boundaries” on an official and legal banknote of Saudi Arabia. Srivastava said that New Delhi had asked Saudi Arabian government to take “urgent corrective steps in this regard”. “I would like to further reiterate that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of India,” said the MEA spokesperson.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-asks-saudi-arabia-to-change-banknote-map-showing-jk-ladakh-out-of-india-908831.html
29-10-2020||National||Home remedies boom as Covid-19 cases soar in India||New Delhi housewife Sashi scoops Covid-19 "immunity-boosting" powder into a jug of water every morning for her family, joining a growing number of Indians who believe traditional supplements will help ward off the pandemic. As India passes eight million cases -- second in the world behind the United States -- and the death toll exceeds 120,000, people are increasingly turning to ancient Hindu "Ayurvedic" medicine. And modern Indian consumer companies are cashing in on growing demand for alternative approaches, turning homemade therapies into packaged products such as turmeric milk and holy basil drops. Sashi, 50, saw adverts on television for a herbal drink made by Ayurveda and yoga tycoon Baba Ramdev "that can keep my family safe from the coronavirus". "I thought that since it's been on TV, it must be good," she said. The pandemic has increased nervousness about the fragile state of India's healthcare system. Experts believe that, because of under-testing and under-reporting, the number of cases and deaths is much higher than officially reported. There is no scientific evidence that ayurvedic treatments can prevent coronavirus. But the sector had already been massive before the pandemic, with people believing claims that natural remedies can cure everything from cancer to the common cold. It is now worth $10 billion a year, according to the Confederation of Indian Industry. Ayurveda practitioner Bhaswati Bhattacharya said the lack of a coronavirus vaccine and other conventional treatments has driven the rush towards familiar natural remedies. "Ayurveda has been written for 5,000 years and been around probably for twice that at least. It's lived through plagues, smallpox and pandemics, so people are saying, 'Let's see if it works'," she told AFP. The rising interest in Ayurveda -- the "science of life" in Sanskrit -- and other therapies have also been encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party, which set up a dedicated ministry in 2014. In January, the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homeopathy) touted traditional remedies as a means to combat the coronavirus. More recently, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan released guidelines for treating some asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 sufferers with Ayurveda and yoga. At chemist shops, Ayurveda products are displayed as prominently as pharmaceutical drugs. Mother Dairy, a leading milk producer, said there has been a "phenomenal" consumer response to its recently launched turmeric milk for children. "The demand is very, very high so we are ramping up the production and distribution," Mother Dairy's products chief Sanjay Sharma told AFP. "Health and immunity-led products are new phenomena. This is an opportunity... to provide precautionary healthcare for consumers at a very affordable price." Philipe Haydon, former chief executive of Himalaya Drug Company -- a major producer of herbal pills and creams -- said demand for wellness and immunity products was up to 10 times higher than before the pandemic. But the hungry for alternative treatments have also fuelled controversial and pseudoscientific claims to have found Covid-19 "cures". Although there is no scientific evidence, several politicians from Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party have advocated using cow dung and urine to cure the virus. And in June, the AYUSH ministry ordered yoga guru Ramdev, who has turned his Patanjali company into one of India's best-known brands, to stop marketing his "Coronil" herbal remedy as to a cure. The Indian Medical Association has also called on the health minister, himself a doctor, to provide evidence that Ayurveda and yoga are effective in treating the virus. "None of them provides any specific protection against Covid-19," Anand Krishnan, a community medicine professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told AFP. "It is more important for people to follow the measures of social distancing, masking and hand-washing."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/home-remedies-boom-as-covid-19-cases-soar-in-india-908833.html

The Commission would be having suitable legal and administrative authority to take up clean up measures to be undertaken in Delhi and adjoining states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Such measures would be taken in consultation with the state governments. As a part of the clean up measures, a regulatory mechanism for stubble burning was being put in place for the first time, sources in the Union Environment Ministry told DH. “The Commission shall be a statutory authority with appropriate powers, and charged with the duty of taking comprehensive measures to tackle air pollution on a war footing, with power to coordinate with relevant states and the central government and if necessary, issue directions to statutory authorities established under the laws,” sources said. Any violation of the Commission’s order would attract a prison term of up to 5 years or a fine up to Rs one crore. The national capital's air quality on Thursday inched closer to the "severe" category due to calm winds and a spike in farm fires. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' monitoring agency SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 36% - the maximum so far this season. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index of 395. It was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. For comparison, good air quality is between 0-50 while satisfactory AQI is between 51 and 100. Anything above 400 comes under the severe category. As the new body replaces the Supreme Court-mandated EPCA, its chairperson and former bureaucrat Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain reminded Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar that taking actions to stop stubble burning and implementing a new parking policy in Delhi with steep charges for private vehicles were among the pending agenda that needed to be fulfilled to clean up Delhi air.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/regulations-for-stubble-burning-in-the-offing-penalty-may-include-5-year-jail-term-rs-one-crore-fine-908838.html

The 37-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019, after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Before his jet was hit, Varthaman downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. Recalling the tension in Islamabad at the time, former national assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq said, "Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night'". He added that "India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan." Reacting to Sadiq’s remarks, Foreign Office spokesman Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said on Thursday that "there was no pressure on Pakistan at all regarding the release of Wing Commander Abhinandan." "The Government of Pakistan took the decision as a gesture of peace, which was appreciated by the international community,” he told reporters during his weekly media briefing here. Talking about the Financial Action Task Force, he said India was trying to politicize the technical process of the global terror financing and money laundering watchdog. A three-day virtual plenary of the Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog concluded on Friday that Pakistan will continue to remain in its 'grey' list till February 2021 as it has failed to fulfil the agency's six key obligations, including failure to take action against two of India's most wanted terrorists -- Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed. When asked about granting consular access to Indian prisoner on death row Kulbhushan Jadhav, the spokesman said that the offer of a third consular access is still on the table. "We have also repeatedly asked India to cooperate with Pakistani Court in the matter, as effective review and reconsideration envisaged in the ICJ judgment can only be provided by Pakistani Court,” he said. Pakistan has rejected India's demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen's counsel should be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/there-was-no-pressure-on-pakistan-to-release-iaf-pilot-abhinandan-paks-foreign-office-908852.html

In a letter to Adityanath, the Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh said it has come to her notice that from some time Varanasi's weavers were very worried and desperate. "The families of the weavers of Banarasi sarees, famous in the whole world, are desperate for making ends meet," she said in her letter in Hindi. The Uttar Pradesh government should help them in this difficult period, Priyanka Gandhi said. "The UPA government had implemented a scheme of providing weavers electricity at a flat rate in 2006, but your government is doing injustice to the weavers by discontinuing that scheme," she said in the letter. Priyanka Gandhi said the weavers have told her that when they held a strike against arbitrary power bills, the government called them for a dialogue and officials assured them that their demands will be considered, but despite that no efforts were made to solve their problems. In the letter, Priyanka Gandhi made three main demands -- the scheme to provide electricity to them at flat rate be restored, their "harassment" in the name of "fake" outstanding bills be stopped and their electricity connections should not be cut while the already cut connections be restored. "I hope you will take these demands seriously and take constructive steps," she said. Her letter to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister comes days after she interacted with weavers from Varanasi and assured them that the Congress was standing with them against injustice of all kinds. Priyanka Gandhi had on Monday interacted with around 40 to 50 weavers through videoconferencing and heard the various problems being faced by them. The weavers had apprised her about the problems arising out of power tariff hike and also how their connections are being snapped.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/priyanka-gandhi-asks-yogi-adityanath-to-restore-electricity-scheme-for-varanasi-weavers-908578.html

A furious BSP supremo Mayawati on Thursday termed her short-lived electoral alliance with the SP a ''big mistake'' and vowed to teach the SP a lesson even if it meant supporting the BJP. ''The decision to ally with the SP in 2019 LS polls was taken in haste and therefore it failed to yield the expected results....the SP can not be trusted,'' Mayawati said here. Accusing the SP of trying to break her party, Mayawati said that she had even withdrawn the case pertaining to an attack on her after the BSP had withdrawn support to the then SP-BSP coalition government in 2003 after the two parties struck an alliance in the LS polls at the insistence of SP President Akhilesh Yadav. ''We will teach SP a lesson in the upcoming polls to the UP Legislative Council....our party will support even the BJP or any other opposition party to defeat the SP nominees,'' Mayawati remarked. The BSP had fielded its lone candidate in the biennial polls for ten RS seats from the state though the party did not have the required numbers. It apparently hoped to garner the spare votes from the BJP, SP and other parties.  Initially, it appeared that there would be no contest as only ten candidates filed their nominations, including eight from the BJP and one each from the SP and BSP.  The SP, however, queered the pitch for the BSP nominee by backing an independent nominee, who became the 11th candidate. Though the independent nominees' nomination papers were rejected during the scrutiny, seven BSP MLAs met Akhilesh and pledged their support to the party, incurring the wrath of BSP Chief Mayawati. ''Is there anything else to say?'' Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked apparently hinting at a tacit understanding between the BJP and the BSP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ready-to-even-vote-for-bjp-mayawati-claims-to-leave-no-stone-unturned-to-defeat-samajwadi-party-908579.html
29-10-2020||National Politics||Gold smuggling case: Left government on the backfoot in Kerala after Sivasankar's arrest||The arrest of suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar by the Enforcement Directorate has put the Left Democratic Front government and the CPI(M) in Kerala in a spot at a time when the state is getting ready for the crucial local body and assembly polls. The Left party and its leaders cannot simply wash their hands off the development by saying Sivasankar, said to be a close confidant of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and once the most influential official in the CMO, was just one among the several civil service officers in the state cadre, according to political observers. Sivasankar, the former principal secretary to Vijayan, was on Wednesday arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the controversial gold smuggling case, after over six hours of interrogation by the ED, probing the money trail in the case. The case and the allegations against the Chief Minister's office have cropped up at a time when the left front was all confident of returning to power in the assembly polls due early next year and showcase good performance in the civic body elections in December, banking on its performance during its four and half year reign. The arrest has given the opposition- Congress and BJP- an unexpected political weapon to attack Vijayan, heading the lone Communist government in the country, which has claimed to have implemented several people-friendly initiatives. Since the beginning, the opposition parties have been targeting the Chief Minister using Sivasankar, said to be his most trustworthy officer, to point fingers at the Marxist veteran and demand his resignation. While serving as the principal secretary to Vijayan, the officer had the power to take crucial administrative decisions and advise the Chief Minister on important policy matters and he might have misused it for unlawful activities, the opposition alleged. It might be for the first time in the country that a serving IAS officer, that too holding a key position in the CMO, has been arrested by a national agency for allegedly getting involved in a crime like smuggling, they said. With the arrest of Sivasankar, both the BJP and Congress have intensified their demand for Vijayan's resignation taking moral responsibility for the alleged wrongdoings by the official in his office. Demanding his resignation, they said Vijayan cannot run away from the moral responsibility of his office's involvement in "unlawful activities." The Congress has already announced state-wide protests demanding his resignation and Youth Congress activists took out a march to the Cliff House here, the official residence of Chief Minister, Thursday morning. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran said the Chief Minister had given Sivasankar all powers and freedom and his arrest was equivalent to the arrest of Vijayan. BJP leader and Union Minister V Muraleedharan said Vijayan should tender an apology to the people of the state. Vijayan, who had supported Sivasankar in the initial days when the controversy broke, had recently said: "let the probe go ahead in the right direction and the wrongdoers be punished." The CPI(M)'s stand was that Sivasankar was no longer part of the government as he was suspended and removed from the post he held as soon as the allegations had cropped up. They also have a view that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre was using the central agencies to take political revenge against the governments in non-BJP ruled states. Brushing aside the demand for the Chief Minister's resignation, senior CPI(M) leader M Govindan Master on Thursday said there was no need for him to quit over the issue. "The CM has already revealed his stand and welcomed any kind of probe. Sivasankar was removed from his position, as soon as the charges were raised against him. Let the probe and the legal proceedings continue.. it is not a matter of any concern to us," he told reporters. When contacted, Kanam Rajendran, the CPI state secretary, told PTI that his party would discuss the latest development at the next LDF meeting. "I do not want to make any open comment on the arrest of M Sivasankar right now. Anyway, we will discuss this within the LDF," he said. Political observers feel that the upcoming polls won't be a cakewalk for the ruling front in the wake of the row. It will also not be easy for the left party and the front to justify itself as it had staged protests during the tenure of the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front ministry, demanding the resignation of the then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy when allegations had cropped up against his office in connection with the solar scam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gold-smuggling-case-left-government-on-the-backfoot-in-kerala-after-sivasankars-arrest-908644.html

Training her gun on the state leaders, Tandon said she has sent her resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi. When asked about it, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said she "has been expelled from the party for six years on charges of anti-party activities". She had "not been taking interest in party programmes for a long time" and the disciplinary committee of the party looked into these charges, Lallu added. The development comes days ahead of the November 3 by-election in Bangarmau Assembly seat under Unnao, once represented by Tandon in Lok Sabha. In a statement released to the media in the morning, Tandon said that she has requested Sonia Gandhi to accept her resignation immediately. While stating that she had continuously received warmth and guidance of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi during her 15-year association with the party, Tandon said there is a "misalignment between the state-level leadership" and she did not see their support coming her way since the past several months. "The state leadership of the party has focused only on social media management and self-branding and is oblivious to the deep divisions in the party and the voters it has thus caused,” Tandon said. She said canards were being spread about her and her associates by the local, irrelevant, and chosen few. Terming it both "painful and disgusting", she said there was no attempt by the party leadership to stem this. Tandon said she had raised the matter with in-charge of UP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who had assured that the Congress president is fully apprised of the situation. However, the matter had remained unresolved. "My ideology and principles have been aligned with the senior leadership of the party and my resignation does not change this," she said, adding she would be consulting her workers on the future path.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/annu-tandon-quits-up-congress-party-claims-she-was-removed-908658.html

Amid speculation that the MLAs could switch sides in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati also said that to ensure defeat of Samajwadi Party candidates in future MLC elections, her party will vote for BJP or any other party's candidate. The former UP chief minister said as soon as the rebel MLAs join any party, the BSP would take action against them under the anti-defection law. She said the party organisation has been informed that the suspended legislators should not be invited to any party function. Mayawati said that her party will leave no stone unturned to defeat SP candidates in the future even if it means voting for candidates of BJP or any other party. Any candidate who dominates over SP's second candidate will get BSP MLAs' vote, she said in a statement. In a jolt to the BSP on Wednesday, six party MLAs reportedly met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and later threw hints that they may switch sides. Four of the group of rebels also filed an affidavit, saying their signatures on the party candidate Gautam’s nomination for the Rajya Sabha polls had been “forged”. The move turned out to be futile with the Returning Officer still accepting Gautam’s nomination as the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate for the November 9 biennial elections for the 10 Uttar Pradesh seats that are falling vacant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mayawati-suspends-seven-rebel-mlas-908663.html

On a whirlwind tour of Baroda assembly constituency, where bypolls will be held on November 3, the Chief Minister said the minimum support price (MSP) will continue and these laws will only give farmers a greater choice in selling their produce. Addressing a series of public gatherings in different villages, he also touched upon several steps taken by his government for farmers' welfare. Khattar said the Congress is "misleading" farmers by telling them that the new laws will "ruin" them, and lead to dismantling of mandis and MSP system. "These mandis will continue, MSP will continue. These laws give a greater choice to farmers to sell their produce anywhere," he said. "MSP is guaranteed in mandis. I announce that if MSP will end, I will quit politics," he said while addressing a gathering in Kathura village. Khattar was accompanied by wrestler-turned-politician and BJP candidate from Baroda Yogeshwar Dutt, Haryana Minister and Independent MLA Ranjit Singh Chautala, JJP leader Digvijay Singh Chautala and a number of state BJP leaders. Hitting out at the Congress, Khattar said the opposition party had created a hue and cry when Article 370 was scrapped and claimed that it would lead to a bloodbath in the Kashmir valley. "Has anything happened in Kashmir in the past year?" he asked. The Congress had also made a lot of noise on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said. The Centre has been saying the recently enacted three farm laws will raise farmers' income, free them from the clutches of the middleman and usher in new technology in farming. The Opposition and some farmers' organisations have, however, been agitating against the laws alleging that they will destroy the MSP mechanism, end Agricultural Produce Market Committees and allow corporates to arm-twist farmers. Khattar said only the father-son (former chief minister B S Hooda and his son Deepender Hooda) duo is campaigning for Congress candidate Induraj Narwal in Baroda. "No other Congress leader is ready to go there," he claimed. "Earlier, they used to say Yogeshwar Dutt's security deposit will be forfeited. But now they have realised that the ground situation is something else and the tide is turning against them," he said. Urging people to vote for Dutt, Khattar said, "If you make him victorious, it will be the victory of Baroda. But if the Congress candidate wins, it will be the victory of only a few Congress leaders." Khattar dubbed Narwal as a "dummy candidate" who is not known to many in his constituency. On the other hand, he said, Dutt is an internationally acclaimed wrestler. Khattar also spoke about the steps taken by his government for farmers' welfare. He said the state government procures crops like bajra, mustard, sunflower, moong, and groundnut at MSP. He added that his government has announced a number of developmental projects for Baroda, including setting up of an industrial model township, a rice mill and two colleges. Khattar extended an olive branch to Kapoor Singh Narwal, who recently left the BJP to contest the Baroda bypolls as an independent candidate only to withdraw later to support the Congress candidate. He said the BJP has not closed its doors on Narwal. "For us, he is still what he was before," the chief minister said. Dutt assured people he would work for Baroda's development. He said he will serve his constituents the same way as he had served the country as a sportsperson. The Baroda bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda in April.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-misleading-farmers-on-farm-laws-will-quit-politics-if-msp-system-dismantled-khattar-908721.html
29-10-2020||National Politics||BJP's dream of expanding footprints in eastern India will end in Bihar: Sachin Pilot||Senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Thursday exuded confidence that the BJP's dream of forming governments in Eastern Indian states will be ended in the assembly election in Bihar as the Grand Alliance, of which his party is a constituent, will post a "historic victory" in the state. He also said that the Grand Alliance is now setting agenda for Bihar's development as its promise of sanctioning 10 lakh government jobs at the first cabinet meeting after coming to power was followed up by the BJP which said it will offer to people 19 lakh employments. The Grand Alliance consists of the RJD, the Congress and three Left parties. "We (Grand Alliance) will post a historic victory in Bihar assembly elections and it is going to have its impact on the country's polity. The BJP has plans to expand its footprint to the eastern part of the country especially in West Bengal, Assam. But we will stop them firmly in Bihar itself," Pilot told reporters here. West Bengal is now ruled by the Trinamool Congress while Assam is governed by a coalition headed by the BJP. Assembly elections in both states are likely to be held between March and May next year. After decades of its limited presence in West Bengal, the BJP has emerged as the main rival to the ruling Trinamool Congress and won 18 of its 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general elections. The Grand Alliance is now setting the agenda in the Bihar elections and the BJP is only responding to it, Pilot said. RJD leader and the Grand Alliance's chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav had said that, after coming to power, the grouping will sanction 10 lakh government jobs in the first cabinet meeting. "The BJP later came out with a poll promise of 19 lakh jobs," the Congress leader said. Seeking to reach out to the youth, the saffron party's manifesto for the Bihar assembly polls promised 19 lakh jobs in the next five years. Pilot also raked up Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2015 remark over Nitish Kumar's DNA to attack the Bihar chief minister whose party JD(U) is now contesting the assembly polls in the state in alliance with the BJP. He said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi had raised a question on Nitish Kumars DNA in the last assembly elections. The same person has now aligned with the BJP which criticised him." The CM and his party can go to any extent just to remain in power and such a person cannot any good to Bihar, Pilot claimed. Kumar severed ties with the BJP after Modi was named as the NDAs prime ministerial candidate before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. In 2015, Kumar had invited Modi to a dinner only to cancel it. Later, at a rally, the prime minister had said, "There seems to be some problem in his (Kumar's) DNA, because the DNA of democracy is not like that. In democracy, you respect even your political rivals." Kumar's JD(U) joined the Grand Alliance of the RJD and the Congress and won the 2015 assembly election. But after around two years, he ended the relationship with the coalition over corruption charges against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and returned to NDA to form a new government. Pilot, a former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, also sought to blunt the NDAs "15 years versus 15 years" campaign narrative by claiming that it is the symbol of "weak leadership" to talk about the previous government's functioning. "It rather shows that the current dispensation does not have any achievement to show to people. It also does not have any agenda for the future," he said. The NDA has been highlighting the works done during the 15 years of RJD rule in Bihar from 1990 to 2005 vis a vis those under Kumar between 2005 and 2020. Terming as "indecent" the Bihar CM's recent statement making a personal attack on Lalu Prasad and his family, Pilot said, "This shows his political immaturity and nervousness." At an election meeting on October 26, Kumar had said that no development can be expected from people producing 8-9 kids for a son. He, however, had not named Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, who have nine children including Tejashwi Yadav. Pilot also criticised the BJP for its poll promise of providing free Covid vaccine to all people of Bihar, saying "putting this in the manifesto proves their mental bankruptcy." To a query on when he would become the chief minister of Rajasthan, Pilot said he is working for the party without having any longing for posts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjps-dream-of-expanding-footprints-in-eastern-india-will-end-in-bihar-sachin-pilot-908754.html

Nine police personnel, including an ACP, were injured when a protest by around 2,000 sanitation staffers had turned violent on Wednesday, an official said. The workers were protesting the SDMC's reported proposal to privatise sanitation work in Delhi, and the police filed a case against four AAP MLAs who participated in the stir. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said the protesters blocked the road and attacked police personnel when they tried to stop them. AAP MLAs Rakhi Birla, Kuldeep Kumar, Akhilesh Tripathi and Rohit Kumar and some volunteers had joined the sanitation workers in their protest outside the Civic Centre against a bill to reportedly privatise sanitation work. Addressing a press conference, Tripathi claimed they were holding a peaceful protest and the registration of an FIR was a "tactic" of the BJP to scare them. "The BJP instructed the Delhi Police to torture us and to file FIR to scare us because we were exposing the BJP's anti-Dalit mindset and corruption in MCDs," he said. Kumar said the AAP will not be scared by such intimidation and will always protest against anti-Dalit laws and the mindset of the BJP. Mehraulia and Birla claimed that during Wednesday's protest, male officers of Delhi Police manhandled the women protestors of AAP and sanitation workers and said the BJP should be "ashamed".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-instructed-delhi-police-to-torture-us-for-exposing-corruption-in-mcds-aap-mlas-908790.html
29-10-2020||National Politics||Why does BJP rake up Pakistan every time elections are held: Congress to J P Nadda||The Congress on Thursday hit back at BJP chief J P Nadda over his swipe at Rahul Gandhi and asked why the BJP brought up Pakistan every time there was an election in the country. Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said it seems the BJP chief has decided to contest elections in Pakistan and that is why he is watching Pakistani TV channels and talking about the neighbouring country at a time when elections are being held in Bihar. "The Congress party stands with the Indian Army and will continue to be so. But, the question is why does BJP remember Pakistan when elections come? Why is it that the moment elections come, you remember Kashmir or 'shamshan versus kabristan'?" he told reporters. "This KPK (Kashmir, Pakistan, Kabristan) model will not work anymore. What will work is good governance, employment, safety and security of women. KPK model is gone, now it is only RRR (rozgaar, rozgar, rozgaar (employment) model on which we are contesting this election." The BJP on Thursday launched a scathing attack on the Congress, alleging that the opposition party has been "mocking" the armed forces while a video has emerged that shows a top Pakistani opposition leader saying that pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was released by Islamabad as it feared an attack by India. In the video tweeted by Nadda, PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq, who was speaking in the country's national assembly, says that Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and the country's Army Chief Gen Bajwa were shivering and sweating during a meeting over reports that India would attack "that night at 9 pm" if Varthaman was not released. Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, the BJP president said, "Congress' princeling does not believe anything Indian, be it our Army, our Government, our Citizens. So, here is something from his ‘Most Trusted Nation’, Pakistan. Hopefully, now he sees some light..."  Hitting out at the Congress, Nadda said the party "premised its entire campaign around keeping our armed forces weak". The Congress and its leaders "mocked our armed forces, questioned their valour and tried every trick to ensure India doesn't get latest Rafale planes," Nadda said, adding people of India rejected such politics and punished Congress. Hitting back, Vallabh said it seems the BJP chief has decided to contest elections in Pakistan, even as elections were being held in Bihar. It would be better if he focusses on the Indian Parliament rather than what happens in Pakistan's Parliament. He should also see Indian channels instead of seeing Pakistani ones, he said. "You (Nadda) do not have anything to say on development or new schools, new hospital, jobs and infrastructure projects. When you do not have these figures, you start watching Pak TV channels. "Elections are in Bihar and why does Nadda ji not tell why jobs were not offered to the youth in Bihar and why vacancies were not filled up and why Patna became a sea during monsoons. Why did Bihar fare poorly on UN's sustainable development goals," the Congress leader posed. Wing Commander Varthaman landed in Pakistani custody following an aerial dogfight between Indian and Pakistani pilots after the Balakot airstrikes by India in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/why-does-bjp-rake-up-pakistan-every-time-elections-are-held-congress-to-j-p-nadda-908811.html

The BJP had called a 12-hour bandh in Bagnan assembly constituency area against the killing of its worker Kinkar Majhi, who succumbed to his bullet injuries on Wednesday. Majhi was allegedly shot at by a TMC worker, who was his neighbour, over a land dispute on October 24. He was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Kolkata. Trouble began when BJP Yuva Morcha state president and Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan went inside the Bagnan police station to talk to senior officers after the saffron party was denied permission to take out the rally. In the midst of it BJP workers attempted to scale the closed gates of the police station leading to a scuffle with the force personnel on duty. Denied permission to hold the rally, the BJP workers blocked roads and burnt tyres to register their protest against the killing. The police said the BJP workers were denied permission to take out the rally as it could have created a law and order problem in the area. Khan told newsmen, "Our party worker was killed but we are not being allowed to take out a rally. Our activists have been beaten up by the police and arrested, while TMC leaders were allowed to take out a rally today". He was later allowed to meet Majhi's family. The area remained tense since Wednesday evening following Majhi's death. There were reports of violence and arson even as police patrolled the area. Huge contingents of Rapid Action Force and Combat Force were deployed to disperse the mob, the police said. Several crude bombs were recovered from different places in Bagnan and several BJP activists were arrested, the police said. The ruling TMC has claimed that miscreants had shot at Majhi due to a family dispute and accused the BJP of trying to "politicise the issue".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-activists-clash-with-police-during-bandh-over-workers-killing-in-kolkata-908846.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||J&K LG Sinha inaugurates Jammu and Kashmir International Arbitration Centre||Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday inaugurated the Jammu and Kashmir International Arbitration Centre (JKIAC), saying its establishment in the time of liberal economy and globalisation is a significant move. With this institution of arbitration, Jammu and Kashmir has secured its place in the commercial arbitration map of the world. The step will help the union territory to promote domestic and international investments, industry, business and trade, the LG said in his address. "Globalisation has reduced the relevance of borders in trade and investments but we need to follow international practices to maximise benefits. Arbitration, as a mode of Alternate Dispute Resolution, gives flexibility, choice and confidence to investors," the Lt governor said. Sinha said the establishment of the Jammu and Kashmir International Arbitration Centre in the time of liberal economy and globalisation is a significant move. The setting up of the Centre is in line with requirements of modern-day borderless trade, business and investments which cannot flourish with legal issues of jurisdictions cropping up in the event of any dispute, he said. This mechanism will do away with cultural and language barriers, confusion over legal language employed in different courts and delays which causes great financial and other hardships to investors, Sinha added. The Lt governor said the Indian companies prefer arbitration for resolution of disputes half of the time. Good arbitration helps in improving ranking under the ease of doing business index. "I believe that a robust arbitration institution would help strengthen India's position as a global leader in the business world," he said. Underlining the importance of arbitration, the Lt Governor said that it suits foreign investors and traders who do not have knowledge about domestic laws and would like their disputes to be confidential and resolved faster. "I have seen encouraging results emanate from the Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration and the Delhi International Arbitration Centre, " he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-lg-sinha-inaugurates-jammu-and-kashmir-international-arbitration-centre-908486.html

The PDP leaders had organised a protest rally from the party headquarters in Srinagar to the Press Enclave to protest the Center’s order allowing any Indian citizen to buy land in the UT. However, soon after the leaders reached the party headquarters, they were detained by the police already deployed there. PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti while slamming the administration for the move, tweeted: “PDP office in Srinagar sealed by J&K admin & workers arrested for organising a peaceful protest. A similar protest was allowed in Jammu so why was it thwarted here? Is this your definition of ‘normalcy’ that’s being showcased in the world?” In another tweet, she said they will continue to raise their voice collectively and won’t tolerate attempts to change demographics. “PDP’s @parawahid, Khurshid Alam, Rouf Bhat, @MohsinQayoom_& @buttkout were arrested by J&K police for protesting against the settler colonial land laws thrusted upon people of J&K.

Sanjay Raina posted three pictures on Twitter on Thursday morning showing passengers standing extremely close to each other during a security check at the airport.

Someone needs to take responsibility. Hats off to airline staff still managing." In his response, Puri said that he had discussed the matter with Arvind Singh, Chairman, Airports Authority of India (AAI). "We will check the facts & take immediate corrective action," the minister added. The AAI manages more than 100 airports across India, including the Srinagar airport. In April, the AAI had issued guidelines to its airports wherein it said sufficient staff must be deployed near washrooms, X-ray machines and conveyor belts to ensure that passengers maintain social distancing norms. Alternate check-in counters may be opened and that too well-in advance so as to stagger the crowd and avoid congestion, the guidelines noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/puri-promises-action-after-passenger-alleges-covid-19-protocol-violation-at-srinagar-airport-908568.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's Air Quality Index 'severe' as Punjab farm fires spike||The national capital's overall air quality inched closer to the “severe” category on Thursday morning as pollution levels rose sharply after a marginal reduction, primarily due to calm winds and spike in farm fires. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a significant increase in the number of “fire points” was observed over Punjab (around 3,000), Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday which is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 397 at 11 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. Sixteen monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (406), Patparganj (411), Jahangirpuri (429) and Vivek Vihar (432), recorded the air quality in the “severe” category. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the wind speed dipped on Wednesday which allowed the accumulation of pollutants. “Following slight relief, the air quality again entered the ‘very poor’ category by the evening,” he said. PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 420 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am -- the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. The levels of PM2.5 - finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream - were 227µg/m3. The PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fires that covered most parts of Punjab and some regions of Haryana. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 18 per cent on Wednesday. It was 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday. SAFAR said accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble is burnt will be major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels. According to IMD, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was eight kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius -- the lowest in this season so far. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed -- is likely to be around 4,000 meter square per second on Thursday -- unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. On Wednesday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said only “green” firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-index-severe-as-punjab-farm-fires-spike-908574.html

29-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi records lowest October temperature in 26 years||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the lowest in October in 26 years, according to the India Meteorological Department. The normal minimum temperature for this time of the year is 15 to 16 degrees Celsius, it said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said the last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data. The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said. The senior IMD scientist said the absence of cloud cover was the major reason for such low minimum temperatures this time. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds which allow the formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said. The minimum temperature is likely to dip to 11 degrees Celsius by November 1, the IMD added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-lowest-october-temperature-in-26-years-908606.html

He also urged finance commissions and local bodies to encourage green buildings through tax incentives. The Vice President said it is time to consider making all new buildings to mandatorily go green and environment friendly. Inaugurating CII's Green Building Congress, he said existing buildings too should be retrofitted to make them environment friendly by adopting green practices that promote energy efficiency and water conservation. He termed sustainable buildings as an important component in building resilient communities and called for extensive use and promotion of low carbon technologies. “We not only need a stronger India but also a greener India,” he said according to an official statement. Drawing attention to the increasing number of extreme climate events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires, Naidu said climate change is as real as daylight and countries all over the world must adopt drastic and revolutionary measures to mitigate the problem of global warming. Calling for the sustainable approach to development, the Vice President said the challenge is to marry development and environment. “If we take care of nature, the nature in turn will take care of the mankind,” he said. Observing that buildings and construction account for 39 per cent of energy-related CO2 emissions in the world, Naidu called for the process of total de-carbonisation of the built environment to be accelerated. Highlighting the pace of rapid urbanisation in the country, he opined that sustainable development should become a critical part of our nation-building.

The results of the study conducted by the Government Medical College Srinagar (GMC) show a quantum jump from 3.8 per cent sero-prevalence recorded in a similar study conducted in the city in June, and suggests that a large fraction of the population in the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir may have been infected by the novel coronavirus. A sero-survey involves testing the blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against infection. "We have conducted a sero-survey in Srinagar district which has revealed that over 40 per cent of the 2,400 persons tested negative but had developed antibodies," said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine at GMC Srinagar. Khan noted that the samples were taken randomly from 20 clusters in Srinagar district which also showed a higher prevalence of antibodies in the female population than males. However, officials said the results should be interpreted with caution due to its small sample size. "The sample survey was only 2,400 in a population of around 15 lakh. In order to get an accurate picture, the sample size should have been more,” an official said. Giving details, the official said that earlier Srinagar had witnessed 18 per cent of positivity rate for Covid-19 when the testing capacity was around 60,000. "However, when testing capacity was increased to 4 Lakh, the rate of positive patients in Srinagar was only 18,000," the official said. The official noted that the survey results could be misconstrued, and can lead to complacency among the people. "The trend is encouraging but there is no way we can say that Covid-19 will be defeated at a certain level of population by developing the antibodies. The scientific community is also wary of using the term herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine," he added. Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90 per cent, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected by it. But there are many grey areas clouding the issue as far as the novel coronavirus is concerned with no consensus on when herd immunity sets in. Srinagar has been the worst affected district by Covid-19 in Jammu and Kashmir with nearly 19,000 persons infected so far and 348 deaths due to the pandemic. The district has 1,651 active cases as compared to 5,300 in the remaining 19 districts of the union territory. Khan said a wider sero-survey is underway across the remaining nine districts of Kashmir valley where 400 samples have been collected from each district. "The results are expected to come within two weeks from now," he added. Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed nearly 85,000 Covid-19 infections and 1,455 deaths so far due to the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/40-of-srinagar-residents-have-covid-19-antibodies-sero-survey-shows-908611.html

Samajwadi party leaders and workers gathered at the party office here on Thursday morning and demanded action against those responsible for it. Red and green tiles have been used in the toilet at Lalit Narayan Mishra Railway Hospital in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, a party leader said. "We will not tolerate such insult to our party flag and we demand the railway administration change it and the district administration act against those behind it. The toilet was constructed 3-4 months ago, but it came into our notice on Wednesday," SP district president Ram Nagina Sahini said.

29-10-2020||North and Central||Stubble burning share in Delhi's pollution rises to 36%: SAFAR||The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution rose to 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, according to a central government air quality monitoring agency. The number of farm fires in neighbouring states was 2,912 on Wednesday, the highest so far this season, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor SAFAR. "Stubble burning share in Delhi PM2.5 concentration was 36 per cent on Thursday," it said. It was 18 per cent on Wednesday, 23 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and nine per cent on Saturday. Delhi's air quality entered the "severe" category -- for the first time since January -- as calm winds and low temperature allowed the accumulation of pollutants amid a spike in farm fires. "Extremely calm surface and boundary layer winds along with the low nighttime boundary layer height resulted in low ventilation...practically stagnant, no dispersion condition has resulted in the current situation,” SAFAR said. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 402 at 2 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. SAFAR said the accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-northwesterly boundary level winds from regions where stubble is burnt were major factors for the increase in PM 2.5 levels. An increase in surface wind speed and better ventilation conditions are likely to "significantly" improve the situation by Saturday, it said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction on Thursday was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius -- the lowest in October in 26 years. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/stubble-burning-share-in-delhis-pollution-rises-to-36-safar-908632.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||'Legs were shaking' at Pakistan's top leaders' meeting as Shah Mahmood Qureshi pleaded to release Abhinandan Varthaman||"Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring" at a meeting of Pakistan's top leaders, including Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, wherein Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi pleaded to release Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, saying if he was not released, India would attack Pakistan, a top Pakistani opposition leader has said. Recalling the tension in Islamabad after India bombed a terror training camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Sardar Ayaz Sadiq criticised the Imran Khan government over its response, saying the Opposition has supported the government on every issue, including Kashmir and Varthaman, but it will no longer be appropriate to provide any further support, Dunya News reported on Wednesday. Sadiq, who was the Speaker of the National Assembly during the PML-N government, made a similar statement earlier on Wednesday in Parliament here that Foreign Minister Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded that let Varthaman go back because India is attacking Pakistan. The 37-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Before his jet was hit, Varthaman downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. In a speech in the National Assembly, Sadiq said that Prime Minister Imran Khan skipped the high-level meeting, which was attended by top leadership, including Army chief Gen Bajwa and Foreign Minister Qureshi. "Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night'", Sadiq said, recalling the meeting which was also attended by parliamentary leaders, including those from Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and PML-N, and added that "India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan." It was not very clear whether Sadiq was referring to Gen. Bajwa or foreign minister Qureshi whose legs were shaking and forehead perspiring. He also did not mention the date of the meeting but indicated that it was held before the release of Varthaman. Sadiq said that he tries not to make any personal attacks but "when those in power refer to us as thieves or "Modi ka yaar" (Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pal), we will have to respond”. He also said that those running the government were not serious people. "The rulers don’t even know the rules of Parliament," he said. Sadiq said that the Opposition has supported the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan on every issue, including Kashmir and Varthaman, but it will no longer be appropriate to provide any further support.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/legs-were-shaking-at-pakistans-top-leaders-meeting-as-shah-mahmood-qureshi-pleaded-to-release-abhinandan-varthaman-908684.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||Politicians up the ante against new land laws in Jammu and Kashmir||Political parties in Jammu and Kashmir have upped the ante against Center’s recent decision to introduce new land laws in the union territory (UT) with protests gaining momentum. The regional People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had organized a protest rally from the party headquarters to the Press Enclave in Srinagar. However, soon after the leaders reached the party headquarters, they were detained by the police already deployed there. Talking to reporters at her Gupkar residence after she wasn’t allowed to meet the workers detained by the police, the PDP president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti accused the government of India of resorting to open loot of J&K’s resources by making fresh announcements that include repealing of land laws. “I am glad that people of Jammu and Ladakh too have realized the essence of People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration as the intentions of BJP led government at the Centre are quite clear now,” she said, adding that “it’s time for a united battle against New Delhi’s anti-J&K policy.” “I am not going to sit idle and will fight Centere’s open loot in J&K. They are stealing our resources. Every day there is a new announcement from the Centre. The latest is repealing of land laws and allowing outsiders to buy land in J&K. This is just an election stunt as polls are round the corner in Bihar and then elections will be held in West Bengal too,” she said. Asked about her next step, the former CM said: “Sarfaroshi ki tamana ab hamaray dil mei hai, dekhna hai zoor kitna bazuway kaatil mei hai.” Sounding a bugle for a long-drawn battle against the Centre, National Conference leader and another former CM Omar Abdullah said the time for power-politics is over and all political parties have come together to fight for the restoration of Article 370. “We won’t engage in petty political fights right now. We can’t talk about forming the government now as people are looking at us to know if they will save our land and identity… It is not going to last for weeks or months but we will fight. If we lose this fight, we will remain nowhere….hope we see victory in our lifetime,” he said while addressing party workers at ‘Nawa-i-Subah’ office, here. While questioning the intentions of the Center, Omar asked: “What do you want from us? Do you want us to leave mainstream politics here? In Jammu PDP had held a protest against the new land laws on Wednesday, denouncing the move by New Delhi to “put the land of the erstwhile state on sale.” Similarly, J&K National Panthers Party chairman Harshdev Singh led a protest demonstration in Jammu and rejected the new land laws for J&K. “The BJP time and again assured the people that their right of land and jobs shall be safeguarded at all costs post abrogation of Article 370 but the notification of the obnoxious law has sent ripples and shock waves among the people who are feeling cheated,” Singh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/politicians-up-the-ante-against-new-land-laws-in-jammu-and-kashmir-908687.html

Chief Justice S A Bobde, presiding over a bench, observed that some experts have informed us informally that it is not only stubble burning that created pollution. “All of you should also stop using the big and beautiful cars. All of you start using bicycles now,” he told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Vikas Singh. The top court decided to examine an Ordinance issued by the Union government to set up a permanent commission to tackle air pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas. The court posted a couple of matters related to PIL by environmental activist M C Mehta and a minor, Aditya Dubey, for consideration next Friday. "We would like to look at Ordinance before passing any order. Even the petitioners would like to see. Let's hear it next Friday," the bench said. The petitioners raised the issue of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Singh, appearing for Dubey, cautioned that the situation would get worse by next week. "We will hear all parties and look at the points made by you. This is not an adversarial litigation," the bench said. In a lighter vein, the CJI told Mehta, "If any of the parties here fall sick because of air pollution till next date then you are solely responsible." Mehta was quick to acknowledge, saying, "What falls from you is mandamus".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/it-s-time-to-take-out-bicycles-stop-using-beautiful-cars-supreme-court-on-delhi-air-pollution-908713.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||Other states, UTs have laws to protect their land, why not J&K? asks Omar||National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Thursday said many states especially in the northeast have special laws relating to land ownership whereby people from other parts of the country cannot buy land there, and questioned why the Jammu and Kashmir could not have similar laws. "There are many states like Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Nagaland and union territories where no Indian can go and buy land even today," the former chief minister said. "Why is it only us who become anti-national when we talk of these laws? Why are there no media debates when similar voices (for special provisions) are raised from other states?" he asked, addressing a function at the National Conference headquarters here. He further said the "fight" is for protecting "our identity" for "our tomorrow". Abdullah accused the BJP-ruled Centre of pushing to the brink the mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir who he said have come together in the battle to protect their land and identity. "What do the Delhiwallas (Centre) want?  Do they want us to leave the mainstream? We are battling to save our identity and land," he said. Asserting that it was not a crime to seek constitutional rights through peaceful and democratic means, he said, "Today, there was a peaceful protest against the new (amended) land laws (by PDP) but it was not allowed. Are we wrong in seeking our right within the Constitution and peacefully?" Abdullah said last year after the Lok Sabha elections, political parties had expected that assembly elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir. "But today we are fighting for our identity. Shame on those of us who are still hankering after power. It is no more about power," he said. About the formation of the People's Alliance, he said the Centre has been using "all kinds of tricks" to "weaken and divide us". "I wish we had forged an alliance earlier. Maybe we could have avoided the situation (revocation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir)," he said, adding "Whatever we are facing today is because of that weakened voice. We were divided and they implemented their plan, our voice got weakened and they attempted to erase our identity". He further said those making "tall claims about merging Jammu and Kashmir with India are still indulging in step-motherly treatment with us", saying the land amendments done earlier this week were an apt example for that. The Centre had on Tuesday cleared the decks for people from across the country to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir by amending several laws, a move which mainstream political parties in the union territory said was akin to putting the erstwhile state up "for sale".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/other-states-uts-have-laws-to-protect-their-land-why-not-jk-asks-omar-908741.html
29-10-2020||North and Central||Protest at DND flyway prompts security beef up at Delhi-Noida border||The Gautam Buddh Nagar police heightened security at the DND border on Thursday, officials said, amid a protest in Delhi by people demanding “justice” for a businessman who had killed himself a month ago, alleging blackmailing. The protesters, including those from Noida and Greater Noida among other parts of the national capital region (NCR), gathered in large numbers near the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway around noon. Aman Baisla, a 22-year-old Delhi-based businessman, was found dead in his office on September 29. According to a purported video he posted on social media before his suicide, Baisla had accused a former business partner and a singer from Haryana of cheating him. “Although the protest was taking place on the Delhi side, we have stepped up security at the border and more personnel were deployed to check any untoward incident," Noida Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Ranvijay Singh said. The gathering of protesters at the key connecting stretch between Delhi and Noida led to disruption of traffic and also prompted the authorities to suggest the alternative Akshardham route to commuters. Manish Awana, a resident of Noida who joined the protesters, said Baisla's supporters have demanded that the Delhi Police arrest the accused. “Those accused by Baisla were not arrested. Also, the police should take strict action against the local policemen who did not take appropriate action in the case which eventually triggered the outrage,” he told PTI. “The protesters are also demanding that the Delhi Police provide protection to Baisla's family,” he added. Calls had been brewing on social media for the Thursday protest since past some days, with netizens demanding “justice for Aman Baisla”. Mukul Gurjar (24), a resident of Meerut, said he, along with 50 other people, reached Delhi on Thursday morning to join the protest. “We came to know about the protest through social media and reached here around 10 am. We want police to arrest the accused,” he said. The victim’s father, Ram Niwas, said they submitted their demands to police. “Police were not taking any action against three persons -- Neha Jindal, Sumit Goswami and Vipin Khatri -- who were responsible for my son’s suicide, due to which we came here and demanding justice for Aman. Two days ago, the case was transferred to the crime branch and they have given us in written and asked for time. A senior police officer said, “The case has been transferred to the Delhi Police Crime Branch and is being investigated on a priority." About the issue of a police officer taking a selfie with one of the accused, he said if there is any apprehension about it, it will be enquired and necessary action will be taken. " If there is an apprehension about security threat to any person, proper assessment will be done and security can be provided under the witness protection programme after due assessment,” he said. Aman Baisala had allegedly hanged himself at his home in New Delhi’s Rohini area a month ago. His father had filed a complaint alleging that three people were responsible for the death of his son who had uploaded a video on social media before killing himself.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/protest-at-dnd-flyway-prompts-security-beef-up-at-delhi-noida-border-908750.html

29-10-2020||North and Central||21% candidates in UP bypolls have declared criminal cases against themselves: ADR||As many as 21 per cent candidates contesting the upcoming by-elections in Uttar Pradesh have declared criminal cases against themselves, with serious criminal cases registered against 83 per cent candidates from SP and 71 per cent from BSP, according to a report by poll rights group ADR. Out of 87 candidates contesting the UP by-elections, about 15 candidates or 17 per cent have declared 'serious' criminal cases against themselves, the report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) said. 'Serious' criminal cases are non-bailable offences attracting over five years' imprisonment, it said. Among the major parties, five (71 per cent) out of seven candidates analysed from BSP, five (83 per cent) out of six candidates analysed from SP, one (17 per cent) out of six candidates analysed from Congress and three (14 per cent) out of 22 Independent candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, the report said. Among the major parties, five (71 per cent) out of seven candidates analysed from BSP, five (83 per cent) out of six candidates analysed from SP and two (9 per cent) out of 22 Independent candidates have declared 'serious' criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, the ADR said. One candidate has declared a case related to murder (IPC Section 302) against himself and one candidate has declared case related to rape (IPC Section 376) against himself, the ADR said. Four candidates have declared cases related to attempt to murder (IPC Section 307) against themselves. Two (29 per cent) out of seven constituencies are red alert constituencies, i.e. those where three or more contesting candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves, the report said. "The directions of the Supreme Court have had no effect on the political parties in selection of candidates as they have again followed their old practice of giving tickets to around 21 per cent candidates with criminal cases. All major parties (less BJP) contesting in Uttar Pradesh by-elections have given tickets to 17 per cent to 83 per cent candidates who have declared criminal cases against themselves," it said. The Supreme Court in its directions in February had asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates with criminal backgrounds and why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates. The details of the financial background of the candidates were also given in the report. "Out of the 87 candidates, 34 (39 per cent) are crorepatis. Among the major parties seven (100 per cent) out of seven candidates analysed from BSP, five (83 per cent) out of six candidates analysed from SP, four (67 per cent) out of six candidates analysed from Congress, four (57 per cent) out of seven candidates analysed from BJP and six (27 per cent) out of 22 Independent candidates have declared assets worth more than Rs. 1 crore," it said.

This is the second consecutive day when over 5,000 cases have been reported in a day in the city. The previous highest single-day spike of 5,673 cases was recorded on Wednesday. According to the latest health department bulletin, the positivity rate has also jumped to 9.55 per cent, amid the festive season and the rise in pollution level. Twenty-seven new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 6,423, according to the latest bulletin issued by the Delhi health department. The 5,739 fresh cases came out of the 60,124 tests conducted the previous day. The active cases tally on Thursday rose to 30,952 from 29,378 the previous day, as per the bulletin. The bulletin said that the total number of cases has climbed to 3,75,753. Amid a staggering spike in cases of Covid-19 here, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said the city government has changed its strategy and now going for "aggressive tracing and testing" of people who came in contact with those found positive for the infection, attributing it as one of the factors behind surge in cases. Interacting with reporters, he also said it would be too early to say if this was a "third wave" in surge in fresh cases. The sudden spike in cases comes amid the festive season and rising pollution level. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, the next festival is Diwali and Chhath in November. Delhi has been witnessing a rise in pollution the last few days. The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. Meanwhile, Union Health Secretary took a meeting with senior officers of health and revenue departments of the Delhi government on Covid-19 management. Milling crowd in the festive season, increase in pollution level and laxity in behaviour by many people in observing Covid-19 safety norms have led to a massive surge in daily cases in the last few days in the national capital, experts said on Thursday. The recovery rate on Wednesday was over 90 per cent, the bulletin said. According to the Thursday bulletin, out of the total number of 15,749 beds in Covid hospitals, 9,895 are vacant. It said that 456 beds in Covid care centres are occupied by persons under quarantine, including travellers who have returned by the Vande Bharat Mission and bubble flights. The Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days, with the count on several times crossing the 60,000-mark. The number of Rapid Antigen Tests conducted on Wednesday stood at 43,095 while the RT-PCR, CBNAAT and True NAAT tests figures were 17,029 in all adding to 60,124, according to the bulletin. The number of tests done per million, as on Wednesday, was over 2.4 lakh while the total number of tests stood at over 45.7 lakh. The bulletin said that 3,38,378 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far. Since September, daily cases had begun to rise in the city. From the last week of September, it had started to come down a bit. The number of people in home isolation rose to 18,069 compared to 16,822 the previous day.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-delhi-records-5739-cases-highest-single-day-spike-death-toll-climbs-to-6423-908844.html

He also said the police have been instructed to present the challan in the case before the court at the earliest. A 21-year-old woman, Nikita, was shot dead outside her college in Faridabad district's Ballabhgarh on Monday allegedly by a man who had been pressuring her to marry him, according to the police. The victim, a B.Com final-year student, had stepped out of college after appearing for an exam when the incident took place. Before shooting her, the accused tried to force her into the car he had come in, the police had said. "The trial of the Nikita murder case will be held in a fast-track court so that the case can be heard on a daily basis and the accused is punished soon. The Faridabad police has been instructed to present the challan in the case before the court at the earliest," Vij said in a tweet in Hindi. The police have arrested two men -- Tausif, the main accused, and Rehan -- in the case. The victim's family has claimed that Tausif had harassed her two years ago and pressured her to convert to Islam in order to marry him, which she had refused. The victim's family had lodged a police complaint against Tausif but withdrew it after his family members assured them that he would mend his ways. However, Vij had on Wednesday claimed that the main accused is related to some Congress leaders in the state and it was due to pressure from them that the victim's family had withdrawn the complaint against him. A three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) began its probe in the case on Wednesday and met the victim's family members in Ballabhgarh.

29-10-2020||Panorama||World’s rich nations jostle to lead globalisation clubhouse||The race to fill a role at the heart of world economic policymaking is turning into a new battleground for the future of globalisation. Angel Gurria retires next year as Secretary-General of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Washington is proposing U.S. President Donald Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff, Christopher Liddell, as a successor. The OECD acts like an auditor for globalisation, shaping policies and setting standards in areas from taxation to trade and education. It’s currently running contentious negotiations over digital taxes that are on the brink of imploding into a transatlantic trade war. Liddell faces competition from European candidates on the other side of that issue, including former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. Member countries have until Nov. 1 to put forward a candidate. On Wednesday, Switzerland nominated Blackrock’s Philipp Hildebrand, a former head of the country’s central bank. “This is the most important multilateral organization that most people have never heard of,” said Daniel F. Runde, Senior Vice President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The OECD sets the Marquess of Queensberry rules of globalisation,” he said, referring to the standards of modern boxing. The organization was formally established in 1961 when the U.S. and Canada joined what was originally a European group running the Marshall Plan after World War II. While still majority European, it’s grown to become a global forum. Under Gurria’s 15-year stewardship, it expanded further and took on a more pro-active role, notably leading a crackdown on tax havens after the financial crisis and working more closely with large non-members China and India. “Gurria has been the artisan of developing the OECD,” said Francoise Nicolas, a senior research fellow at the French institute for international relations. “When he arrived there it didn’t have the same aura; it was a mysterious, fusty place.” John Llewelyn, who worked in various positions at the OECD for nearly 20 years, says key to the role is a careful balance between pushing member states and preserving the organization’s analytic neutrality. “It’s not an easy job to fill because you really do want to be an intellectual leader to a certain extent, but the secretariat has to be like the pilot fish with the whale: in front but not too much in front,” Llewelyn said. Gurria’s replacement will get a seat at the top table of global policy negotiations at the Group of 20, backed by a team of more than 3,000 economists, lawyers and scientists operating from the Chateau de la Muette in western Paris. The final decision on candidates will be taken by March 1, after closed-door interviews and “confidential consultations” between ambassadors to the OECD. Christopher Liddell Trump’s pick for the top job also has New Zealand citizenship, bolstering his international credentials. Unlike other candidates, Liddell, 62, has lengthy experience in the private sector with a stint as chief financial officer at both General Motors Co. and Microsoft Corp. A key question mark hanging over his candidacy is whether Joe Biden, if he won the presidential election, would continue to back the nomination. Other OECD countries may also be skeptical of a Trump-backed candidate given the disagreements over digital taxation. Cecilia Malmstrom The 52-year-old Swedish politician is vaunting her experience of multilateral negotiations as an EU Trade Commissioner. While in that role, she worked closely on agreements with Canada, Japan, and the Mercosur trading bloc, as well as the dispute with the U.S. She’s said the OECD must address climate change, digital taxation, and make the case for the “good aspects of globalisation.” If successful, Malmstrom would be the first woman to head the OECD and the first European in over two decades. Kersti Kaljulaid Malmstrom is not the only European woman in the running. Kaljulaid, Estonia’s first ever female president, says she can bring experience from a country that has transitioned to democracy to build one of the most digitally advanced societies with a leading education system. The 50-year-old said in an interview with Bloomberg News that taxing tech giants is “only the first step,” and the OECD needs to consider the broader issue of how societies can provide public services when individuals are moving and selling their work globally. Bill Morneau The Canadian government is proposing its former finance minister as a consensus broker on key topics like digital taxation. Morneau, who resigned in August citing his interest in the OECD role, has experience of the G-20 and G-7, the IMF and the World Bank. After announcing his candidacy in late September, the 58-year-old traveled to Paris to spend several weeks meeting ambassadors. Convincing delegates he should be the next Secretary General may be tricky, as Gurria’s predecessor at the OECD helm, Donald Johnston, was also a Canadian. Vladimir Dlouhy Head of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, Dlouhy, 67, is calling for the OECD to stick to a limited number of priorities and wants it to listen more to members. The Czech government says his time as a minister in the country’s first post-communist government equipped him with experience of managing complex transitions that advanced economies will have to undergo in the wake of the Covid crisis. It’s also says the appointment would help redress central Europe’s under-representation in international institutions. Mathias Cormann Australia’s longest-serving finance minister could be a compromise candidate for Europe and the U.S. Belgian-born Cormann, 50, is a pro-market, pro-small government Christian conservative who says witnessing the fall of the Berlin Wall was a key influence in his political development. A native German speaker, Cormann is also fluent in French, an official language at the Paris-based organization together with English. Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Cormann would provide “a voice from the Asia Pacific, which will increasingly be the center of the global economy.” Famous for his Teutonic accent in Australia, Cormann does an uncanny impersonation of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “I’ll be back” from The Terminator.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/world-s-rich-nations-jostle-to-lead-globalisation-clubhouse-908798.html
29-10-2020||Panorama||Debate on Ayush protocols for Covid-19||Recently, the Indian Ministry of Health released Ayush protocols (Ayush an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga and naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) for prophylaxis and support in treating Covid-19 patients. The protocols involved recommendations of yoga, certain Ayush herbs and the use of products to support and prevent viral infections, in addition to other measures. The Ministry did not say the protocols were geared towards treating severe Covid-19 cases.  Almost immediately, the Indian Medical Association, a body of medical practitioners shot off a letter questioning the release of these protocols. The medical body demanded whether these protocols have gone through Randomized Controlled Double-Blind clinical trials (RCDB). Such trials are generally accepted as gold standards for the generation of evidence for drugs. However, such clinical trials are debated and in some scientific circles. Controlled clinical trials are one part that is discussed. All aspects of subjects or patients, the conduct of the studies and sometimes the drug is not fully controllable. The mental status of the subjects, stress and stress tolerance levels, potential mood disturbances are not controllable amongst the enrolled subjects. In case of studies involving adult subjects of both sexes, the monthly cycles of female participants and the impact of hormonal changes also may not be controlled. In studies that involve the administration of the drug for longer periods, fatigue is known to set in, affecting the compliance to diet restrictions, exercise, consumption of medicines at right time in the right way and consumption of undeclared other products (viz. Fruit juices, herbal juices, vitamin and other supplements) also affect the controls. These factors would affect the outcomes.  It is known that the outcomes measured even in RCDB trials vary drastically. Declaration of the effectiveness of a drug in such studies is not always looking at ”all patients to show positive outcome”. In the 90’s when Taxol injection was approved to treat breast and ovarian cancer only 6% of patients showed complete recovery and about 26% of cancer patients showed 50% reduction in tumour size with Taxol treatment. There is debate on the trials being conducted for vaccines to protect from Covid-19. It was stated to be effective, the vaccine should show a response in 50% of people who took the vaccine. Some scientists demanded this number should be 70% and not 50%. This would mean a cleared vaccine may not protect all those who take the vaccine. Efficacy measures vary from medicine to medicine and seldom is a 100% seen in controlled studies. A number of confounding factors impact even controlled studies. Scientists are still working to understand why drugs don’t work in all 100% of patients? Some patients may get cured while others show only partial response.  Applying an RCDB trial design to holistic treatment and protocols of Ayush is a challenge, and the medical body should recognize this. Unlike drugs which work on a single receptor, cell or an organ, the Ayush protocol consists of multiple components, multiple targets/organs and is holistic in nature. Scientists studying Ayush treatments or products often struggle to decide what is to be tested. Should the product only be tested in an RCDB trial or the complete protocol involving yoga, diet controls, product be tested? Systems biology approach is evolving in such situations.  The role of neuroendocrine functions is important in controlled trials which should be recognized as being almost absent in what the medical body questioned for Ayush protocols. The tone and tenor of IMA’s letter are not what is expected from such a professional body. A body consisting of professional medical physicians should have offered to be part of observing such protocol being administered and come out with the findings.  (The writer is a scientist involved in drug development and research on Ayush)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/debate-on-ayush-protocols-for-covid-19-908799.html
29-10-2020||Second Edit||Mask rule, targets are not fine||The battle against Covid-19 in Karnataka has been muddled in confusion right from the start and the latest order on compulsory wearing of masks in public places only exemplifies this. It has been made mandatory for even a single occupant of a car, driving with the windows rolled up, to wear, and every Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) marshal has been given a target to penalise at least 20 violators a day per Assembly constituency. In a typical case of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing, while senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil, the special officer for Bengaluru (South) who has issued the order, has gone on record that he would personally like to fix the target at 100 people a day, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad is of the view that the way forward is to educate people while fines should be imposed only as a last resort. Given the undue pressure on them to meet targets, the marshals are forced to go to ridiculous lengths, like penalising people who momentarily remove their masks to consume water or answer their phones. Bureaucrats who turn the other way while social distancing norms are thrown to the wind at by-election rallies in the state or when thousands congregate at different markets on the eve of festivals, seem to be deriving some vicarious pleasure by harassing the common man. Instead of deploying marshals in large numbers at street corners, their services could be used for more important roles like contact tracing or ensuring that those in-home quarantine remain so, tasks that the authorities have failed in, after the initial enthusiasm to implement them. Exploiting the pandemic to augment the revenue of the government at a time when people are already facing hardship due to loss of jobs and income is deplorable. Instead, the government should educate citizens about safety precautions and incentivise them to wear masks, perhaps by providing them with masks free of cost or at concessional rates. While there may be some rationale behind wearing masks in crowded places or while riding a two-wheeler, the only purpose of making it mandatory for solo drivers seems to be to increase the fine collection.  That the administration is expending its energy on such trivial issues ignoring more important concerns gives rise to the sinking feeling that it may have lost the plot in the fight against Covid-19. Chief Minister has stepped in previously when the bureaucracy played truant. He should do so again and save the public from unnecessary harassment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/mask-rule-targets-are-not-fine-908792.html

Data released by the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TNSDMA) said the city received an average rainfall of 97.27 mm till 8 am on Thursday morning. Mylapore, one of the upscale areas in the city, received maximum rainfall recording 178 mm, while Purasawakkam recorded 94.40 mm, Ambathur (90 mm), and Ayanavaram recording 53 mm, the lowest.  Residents of the city woke up to waterlogged streets as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that the rains would continue till 10 am. As nearly 100 mm of rains lashed the city, motorists found it difficult to navigate through waterlogged roads as several railway sub-ways in the city were flooded.  The thunderstorms began at 3 am on Thursday and continued till about 6 am in various parts of the city, though the rains continued till the time of writing. Waterlogging was reported from various parts of the city with people posting pictures on Twitter and other social media platforms.  “More rain bands converging from NE, the super-duper rains in Chennai will continue for a while.

It said the searches were conducted on Wednesday at 22 premises in Coimbatore, Erode, Chennai and Namakkal of the group and their associates, including a civil contractor. "The search has led to identification of unaccounted investments and on-money payments to the extent of around Rs 150 crore. Cash amounting to Rs 5 crore has been seized. "Some lockers are yet to be operated. The search is still continuing," the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement. The electronic devices seized are also being examined, it said. The CBDT is the administrative authority for the Income Tax (I-T) department. It said the action was undertaken on the basis of information that fees collected from students were "not fully accounted for" in the regular books of accounts. "Evidences found during the search reveal that the allegations regarding suppression of fees received are true and the unaccounted receipts are siphoned off to the personal accounts of the trustees, which in turn are invested in real estate through a company. "The other shareholders of the company, like an architect from Tirupur and a textile businessman, were also covered," it said. In the case of raid on the civil contractors from Namakkal, inflation of expenditure by booking "bogus expenses" under labour charges, material purchase, etc. has been found, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/i-t-raids-tamil-nadu-education-group-detects-rs-150-cr-tax-evasion-908589.html

But the statement raised more questions on the actor's political entry.  "A letter which claims to be my statement is being circulated on the social media widely. Everyone knows that is not my statement. However, the details mentioned in the letter about my health is true. I will consult functionaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram at an appropriate time and announce my political stand," Rajinikanth said in the statement.  His statement came a day after a letter purportedly written by Rajinikanth to his "close circle of friends and well-wishers" on his inability to keep his date with politics was leaked in the public domain. The letter cites Covid-19 as the reason with doctors advising Rajinikanth not to participate in public events as he could be vulnerable.  The statement by Rajinikanth comes seven months after he put the onus on the people to “show resurgence towards a political change” for him to take the formal plunge. “Take this message to the people, to the nook and corner of the state and please stop projecting me as the next chief minister. Tell people about my ideas and let there be a resurgence and wave (in favour of me), I will come then. I will come,” Rajinikanth had said on March 12 in his signature filmy style by thumping the podium before which he was making the speech.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rajinikanth-hints-at-shelving-political-plunge-908593.html

The Congress and Yuva Morcha, the youth organisation of the BJP, staged protests in front of the state secretariat and a few activists of the BJP's Mahila Morcha managed to enter the complex. Police arrested and removed the activists from the north block area, where the Chief Minister's office is situated. The opposition parties burned the effigies of the Chief Minister in various parts of the state and in some places, the police had to use water cannons to disperse the protesters who tried to climb over the barricades. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ramesh Chennithala sought the resignation of Vijayan and claimed the probe will reach the Chief Minister and that the senior IAS officer was just a pawn in the matter. "... The real accused in the case is the Chief Minister. Kerala has not seen such a deplorable governance in its history. Reports also say two other officials are under scanner of the probe agencies. How can the Chief Minister wash his hands off in this matter?" Chennithala said at a press meet. BJP state chief K Surendran alleged two other ministers were also involved and that Sivasankar had threatened the customs officials. "Sivasankar had contacted customs officials numerous times from his personal phone and his official number and threatened them. The Chief Minister should also be questioned. Two other senior officials of the Chief Minister's Office have also contacted the gold smuggling gang. Two ministers are also involved," Surendran said. A court in Ernakulam district on Thursday granted the Enforcement Directorate seven day custody of Sivasankar, who was arrested last night. Central agencies -- National Investigation Agency, Customs and the Enforcement Directorate, are conducting separate inquiries into the seizure of gold worth nearly Rs 15 crore from a "diplomatic baggage" at Thiruvananthapuram International airport on July 5.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/congress-bjp-protest-seeking-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-resignation-908619.html

The showers that started late last night continued till morning, leading to water logging at several locations. Stretches of the arterial Anna Salai came under water, while three other key roads were inundated. This slowed down traffic and several two-wheeler riders had to push their bikes through sheets of water after their vehicles stopped. Rainwater entered some houses in low lying locations like Palavakkam. Greater Chennai Corporation said workers pumped out rain water from inundated roads and 20 plus subways in the city. "The rainwater was pumped out within two hours though the rainfall was heavy," a GCC statement said, adding water stagnation was present in only about 10 locations and it was being attended to. The rainfall was heavy in some localities, including Mylapore, which received 18 cm. Other areas, including Kotturpuram, received similar showers, (14 cm Anna University) and Red Hills on the northern periphery experienced 13 cm rains, a Met office bulletin said. However, several other areas like MGR Nagar (5 cm) received moderate and mild rains. Several areas falling under nearby Chengelpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts, including Tambaram, Uthukottai and Mamallapuram, received relatively low rainfall (2 cm), while other areas in these districts like Tiruporur and Sriperumbudur saw precipitation of one cm. GCC said despite the heavy rainfall in Mylapore, there was 'no water stagnation' and rainwater reached the Sri Kapaleeswarar temple tank in view of the robust stormwater drain network. Also, spots like those in Vadapalani that used to witness water stagnation during monsoon are free of inundation, the civic body said. Till morning, two trees were uprooted and these were cleared. A tree fell on a car at Royapettahdamaging the vehicle. Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), N Kannan said movement of traffic slowed down in view of water stagnation due to the overnight rains. "However, traffic did not come to a complete halt. We made diversions in a few locations, considering water stagnation," he said, adding that the full strength of 3,000 traffic personnel in addition to those from the Armed Reserve have been deployed. About 120 spots, identified in the city as vulnerable to waterlogging, were being monitored by patrolling teams, he said. Rainwater has been pumped out of 20 plus subways and vehicle movement has been normalised, Kannan said. He advised road users to exercise caution taking into account slippery pathways and chances of skidding.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/heavy-rains-lash-chennai-many-roads-inundated-908698.html
29-10-2020||South||Fall of a highly reputed IAS officer, M Sivasankar||From a second rank holder in Class 10 examination to a fifth accused in a money laundering case, Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar has been so far considered as a no-nonsense officer. Even after facing serious allegations over the last couple of months owing to his nexus with gold smugglers, Sivasankar's social media page has been witnessing many posting messages hailing his career as an IAS officer. Sivasankar, who joined state service as deputy collector and later conferred with IAS in 1995, has been widely credited for many IT initiatives like the Akshaya centres across Kerala aimed at imparting computer literacy and delivering IT-enabled government services to the grassroots. While in charge as IT secretary, the engineering degree holder, initiated many steps for promoting start-ups and attracting IT companies to Kerala. As Kerala State Electricity Board chairman he brought in professionalism in the organisation by setting up a call centre for addressing consumer grievances and minimising distribution loss. As sports secretary, he managed to conduct the National Games quite smoothly. While Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan handpicked Sivasankar as his secretary the day he took over as Chief Minister, it was widely considered a very positive move owing to the high credentials of Sivasankar, who is now 57. However, the move had reportedly not gone down well with many senior IAS officers as they felt that Sivasankar was playing the role of a super chief secretary. Sivasankar was often accused of bypassing government procedures to ensure speedy action. This was evident in a recent row over Kerala government engaging US firm Sprinklr for Covid-19 data analysis. Sivasankar had said that he skipped the vetting process by various departments as he was convinced of the data security in the deal. It could be owing to the high credentials of Sivasankar that Vijayan even made him the point of contact in Kerala government for the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. However, Vijayan seems to be now paying price for that move. Sources close to Sivasankar still firmly believe that he would not knowingly get involved in illegal activities. He could have been taken for a ride by Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the gold smuggling case and a former executive secretary at the UAE consulate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/fall-of-a-highly-reputed-ias-officer-m-sivasankar-908712.html

The move is to curb the rampant liquor smuggling into the state since May that has severely dented its excise revenues. The state has earlier this week also put a ban on carrying in alcohol from other states, without its permit. The price cut effective from Friday varies from Rs 50 to Rs 1,350 depending on the size and segment of the alcohol bottle, according to a government order on Thursday. The decision, interestingly, was based on the suggestion of the Special Enforcement Bureau, formed in May to eradicate the illegal transportation, unauthorized sale, and illicit liquor processing in the state. The special police wing has registered 48,182 such cases and arrested 59,438 persons till Monday. Since last October, the YSRCP government has adopted various measures to implement its policy of liquor prohibition in a gradual manner, foremost being the steep rise in the alcohol price. The MRP of liquor bottles was further increased by about 75 per cent in May in view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation to dissuade public movement, crowding at the wine shops and to further discourage consumption of liquor in the state. The huge alteration in prices however led to rampant smuggling of liquor into the state, especially from Telangana and Karnataka. The forbidding prices also drove some habitual drinkers to consume sanitizers, and methyl alcoholic preparations causing over a dozen deaths in July-August. So, the government has, in September, reduced rates of ordinary segment of liquor, beer, while moderately increasing the medium and premium segments price. The SEB, in its latest report, observed that most smuggled liquor brands now are in the medium, premium category. The report points to the huge difference - prices of some liquor brands in Andhra Pradesh are more than double the MRPs in Telangana and Karnataka. So SEB suggested a reduction in MRP of such brands so as to prevent smuggling and consequent drain of the state revenues, officials said. Out of 1,211 cases of liquor smuggling into Andhra Pradesh between 15 September and 15 October, 630 are from Telangana, 546 from Karnataka, and remaining from Odisha, and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/excise-revenue-loss-jagan-government-which-vowed-total-prohibition-slashes-liquor-prices-908746.html
29-10-2020||South||Is Covid-19 an exit route for Rajini to shelve political plunge?||As a superstar, Rajinikanth has been extremely successful in creating a hype around him, be it his movie release or his entry into politics, a topic of intense debate since early 1990s, though intermittently. Almost three years after a definite announcement that he would launch his own political party to contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, due in the first half of 2021, the actor seems to have backed out, albeit for now.   But, he does not want to openly admit that politics may not be his cup of tea for he wants the attention of his fans and public towards him, albeit for the next few months as the state goes into poll mode. His admission that a “fake letter” doing rounds in his name is partially true also raises more questions than answering some of them that have been thrown at him. And Rajinikanth should remember that the “fake letter” was printed on his letterhead. Through his latest statement, Rajinikanth has yet again proved that he lacks clarity on his long-cherished dream of a career in politics. From the "open declaration" that "my entry into politics is certain" and that his party would contest all 234 assembly constituencies on the last day of 2017 to putting the onus on the people for him to launch the party in March to now citing his health to "wriggle out.” Covid-19 scare, which has confined him to his palatial bungalow in upscale Poes Garden, is just the last straw. To be fair to Rajinikanth, he is not in the best of health and he has, for the first time, admitted to having undergone a renal transplant in 2016. He suggests that it would be very difficult to keep himself immune from Covid-19 if he takes the political plunge and meets people. But the fact is Rajinikanth had enough time to galvanise the people if he was really serious about his political entry. From 2018 to October 2020, he had almost three years to build his party, spell out his ideology, hold rallies, and demonstrate his seriousness. Rajinikanth did none of this – he planned to launch the party just months ahead of the polls as his supporters were hoping for a repeat of the N T Ramarao or M G Ramachandran miracle. Little did they realise 2020 is not 1980s and Rajinikanth's popularity as an actor alone was not enough to catapult him to Fort. St. George, the seat of power of Tamil Nadu Government.   Instead of using the three years for transitioning into a politician from a superstar, Rajinikanth concentrated more on his movies – three films were released since 2018 and one more is in the making – and he consciously avoided commenting on crucial issues that were of real concern to people.   "Rajinikanth has now shrunk his responding audience from people to office-bearers of his association. They are very small in number and they will sign on the dotted line. They will blindly listen to their Thalaivar and accept his decision. It is safe to assume that Rajinikanth has backed out of politics," senior journalist R Bhagwan Singh told DH. Another political analyst put it simply. "Rajinikanth is revisiting a closed chapter." The first hint that politics may not be Rajinikanth's cup of tea came in March this year when he put the onus on the people of Tamil Nadu to “show the resurgence towards a political change” for him to take the formal plunge. The altered political situation in the state today, when compared to the 2017 scenario, may have brought the change in Rajinikanth's mind. Though many still claim the "leadership vacuum" created due to the absence of M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa has not been filled, Rajinikanth might have understood that it would be almost impossible to bring people to the polling stations just through his flamboyance and acting skills. Three years down the line, the AIADMK has remained united, and the DMK-led alliance bucked the national trend by winning 38 of the 39 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, thereby cementing DMK President M K Stalin's position within the party and in Tamil Nadu politics. Though there is a leadership tussle in AIADMK, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has managed to keep the flock united for four years and is on course to complete his term. And Rajinikanth realised first-hand the intense scrutiny that politicians are subjected to in times of social media. The very people who gave him the stardom began questioning many of his statements, and even advising him to continue to entertain them. He was heavily criticised for his comments on anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi, his support for the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, remarks on Periyar, and his infatuation towards the BJP. In the latest statement on Thursday, Rajinikanth said he will take a decision on his “political stand” at an appropriate time. The decision at an “appropriate time” as announced by Rajinikanth may take a few months.

Thunderstorms through Wednesday night that continued on Thursday morning not just marked the arrival of the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu but also the beginning of the woes of the people during the rainy season. The rains led to waterlogging on major roads of the city, including the arterial Anna Salai, causing severe inconvenience to motorists. The overnight rains also inundated almost all low-lying areas even as the posh areas in the metropolis complained of severe waterlogging. Greater Chennai Corporation said waterlogging was reported from 57 localities across the city. Photos and videos posted by residents on social media showed waterlogging was quite intense in several areas with rainwater entering houses. Anna Salai, G P Road, parts of Royapettah and other areas also reported severe waterlogging.  The government faced serious questions on its "monsoon preparedness" claims as residents wanted the civic body to explain the reason behind waterlogging if enough measures were taken to keep the canals and drainages clean.  Data released by the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TNSDMA) said the city received an average rainfall of 97.27 mm till 8 am on Thursday morning. Mylapore, one of the upscale areas in the city, received maximum rainfall recording 178 mm, while Purasaiwalkam recorded 94.40 mm, Ambattur (90 mm), and Ayanavaram recording 53 mm, the lowest. The thunderstorms began at 3 am on Thursday and continued till about 6 am in various parts of the city, though the rains continued till the later part of the morning. The civic body said it pumped out rainwater from inundated roads and railway subways in just two hours though the rainfall was heavy. The MeT Department has forecast heavy rains on Friday as well. Besides, Chennai, the neighbouring districts of Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, and Thiruvallur districts. Chennai receives nearly 63 per cent (867.4mm) and Tamil Nadu 48 per cent (438 mm) of their annual rainfall from N-E Monsoon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/overnight-rains-in-chennai-expose-tall-claims-of-monsoon-preparedness-908763.html

In his initial reactions after the embarrassing developments, Vijayan pointed out Sonia Gandhi's recent statement against the central agencies to indirectly allege that the action against his former secretary and party secretary's son are also politically motivated move. He also flayed that the Congress leadership in Kerala was not subscribing to the party high command's stand. Vijayan earlier used to state that the investigation into the gold smuggling case was progressing in the right direction. Hence he seems to be quite cautious in directly alleging any political ploy behind the ED actions at this stage. Hence, he seemed to have used Sonia Gandhi's allegation to indirectly convey his political line. Vijayan said that his government is not at all responsible for any personal unlawful acts of Sivasankar. He, however, evaded direct reply on the arrest of party secretary's son Bineesh Kodiyeri. The back to back set back for the CPM-led Left Front government in Kerala came at a time when the local body and assembly polls are approaching. Hence the CPM leaders are trying to distance themselves from the allegations against party secretary's son and CM's former secretary. CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury told a section of media that Sivasanakar being an IAS officer was appointed by the Centre. "Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has already clarified that the law would take its own course against his son if he did anything unlawful. Hence there is no crisis in the party," said Yechury. Meanwhile, the opposition parties have sharpened their protests against the government as many demonstrations turned violent. BJP women workers even tried to barge into the state secretariat after scaling the compound walls. Congress and BJP are demanding the resignation of the CM Vijayan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/amid-controversy-over-bineeshs-arrest-sonia-gandhis-allegation-aids-pinarayi-vijayan-908768.html

The issuance of the GO by the Edappadi K Palaniswami, pending assent from Governor for the Bill passed by the state assembly, paves the way for conduct of counselling for medical admission in the state for the academic year 2020-21. The 7.5 percent horizontal reservation will ensure that at least 300 students from govt schools get into medical colleges every year. "Since the NEET-Under Graduate results have now been declared and the admission process has started, there is an urgency to decide on this issue and since the power to issue executive directions under Article 162 of the Constitution of India is co-extensive with legislative powers, pending decision of the Hon'ble Governor, the Government hereby has taken the following policy decisions and issue orders accordingly," the GO signed by Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan read. The GO defined government school students as those who studied in panchayat union primary and middle schools, Adi-dravidar welfare schools, municipal/corporation/tribal welfare schools, Kallar reclamation BC/MBC/Differently-Abled Welfare/ Forest/Social Defence Schools), department schools and residential. The government was forced to use the power to issue executive directions after it was pushed to the corner by the Opposition parties, especially the DMK, that accused it of not exerting "enough pressure" on the Governor. The Governor had last week said he needs another "three to four weeks" to arrive at a decision on the Bill providing the 7.5 percent reservation prompting the DMK to hit the streets. Principal Opposition party, DMK, quickly took credit for the move saying it was the first to advice the government to take the GO route after the Governor sought more time to look into the Bill. A senior government functionary told DH that the government had no choice but to issue the GO by using special powers after it was "pushed to a corner." Noting that NEET is an emotional issue in the state, he said the government had to resort to the move to ensure that the admission happens on time, after the Governor decided to seek opinion from legal experts. "It is a very polite Government Order. It is not a confrontational order. We have issued the GO for the admissions to begin pending the assent from the Governor for the Bill. The beginning of the admission process will help end the uncertainty among students," the government functionary said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-issues-go-to-implement-75-reservation-for-govt-school-students-who-clear-neet-908841.html

Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in a letter to IT and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on October 27 raised concern over online gaming and online betting fast catching up as a severe social evil leading to youth getting involved in vices like gambling and betting from the comfort of their homes through their mobile phones and computers. The chief minister submitted a list of 132 websites and apps which the state believes are involved in offering services like gaming, betting and gambling online. The list, however, does not include Dream11, the main sponsor of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020, which also provides online gaming and gives chance to its users to win cashback. Reddy in the letter informed Prasad that the state has amended the AP Gaming Act 1974 "to include online gaming, online gambling and online betting as an offence through Andhra Pradesh (Amendment) ordinance 2020" and notified it on September 25, 2020. "The main objectives of the amendment to the Act is to ban online gaming, online betting and online gambling. It is made a cognizable offence punishable under the Act. Moreover, the managing directors of all the online gaming companies and those involved in the running of the company are liable for punishment under the Act," Reddy said. The chief minister said that online betting and gaming have led to widespread despair amongst the public suicides due to losing money, severe addiction and consequent violent behaviour in case of any restriction. He said that under the new act, those assisting the operation of online games are liable for punishment and the role of internet service providers can be termed as assisting these firms in case they do not take steps to block access of concerned websites and apps. "I would request you to direct all the internet service providers to block all online gaming, gambling and betting websites and apps from access in Andhra Pradesh," Reddy said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-bans-online-gaming-betting-asks-centre-to-block-access-to-132-apps-websites-in-state-908854.html

She said, "Covid-19 has cast a spotlight on the medical fraternity as the most valuable resources for the country in the healthcare sector. The doctors should inspire society in terms of research."  Many of the discoveries made decades ago by the Nobel Laureates in medicine are relevant even today. These discoveries have transformed medicine and health care system around the world. India needs to focus on medical research, she stressed. "The previous nine months witnessed the largest number of clinical trials, the largest medical publications and research programmes in the country. This clearly shows that we have potential in research and innovation. Clinical research is an integral part of drug development. For a country like India, the focus should be on delivering affordable innovation," Shaw said. Medical research fraternity should build public trust. The covid-19 vaccine provides an opportunity to build public trust. Sharing clinical data transparently in the public domain is essential to earn the public trust, she added. Prof Dr Arnie Purushotham, Director of the Kings Health Partners Integrated Cancer Centre, in his convocation address, urged the graduates to face all challenges and hurdles that come on their way to success.

Gowda, who dreams to become a paramedical professional, had enrolled for first year BSc in nursing at Kumareshwara College in Hanagal of Bagalkot. As his parents could not afford to pay the fees, which was around Rs 60,000, he decided to earn for himself and became a mason. "I earn Rs 550 per day for nine hours of work," Buddana declares with pride. "I have earned around Rs 20,000 now. By the time the college reopens, I am planning to earn another Rs 10,000. After earning the money, I will return to my native village to continue my studies. This is how I had earned money to study for my Pre-University course after my SSLC examinations," Buddana recollected. "I was keen on becoming a doctor.

No other metro city, except Delhi, doing so many tests per day,” it said, adding that Delhi was reporting 4,500 cases per day compared to Bengaluru Urban’s 1,800 per day in the last few days. “The presence of more active cases is an indicator of good disease surveillance and availability and utilisation of good clinical facilities in the district,” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/bengaluru-worst-hit-due-to-high-testing-rates-claims-health-dept-908805.html
29-10-2020||State||High PM 2.5 levels in winter, Diwali worsen Covid-19, say doctors||Increased particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels in the air can worsen Covid. A study by researchers at Harvard University in the US in September showed that an increase of only one microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in Covid-19 death rate. Pulmonologists in the city say fine particulate matter, both indoor and outdoor, worsen Covid-19 disease outcomes. PM 2.5 refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two-and-a-half microns or less in width. Particles in the PM 2.5 size range can travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs. This is particularly important in the context of the upcoming Deepavali festival, when air gets a lot worse. Chest medicine experts say patients have to be sensitised to this. On Thursday, Hombegowda Nagar and Jayanagar 5th Block had an Air Quality Index of 154 and 152 at noon, which is ‘unhealthy’. Particulate matter can cause inflammation in the lungs and an inflamed lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will lead to a worse outcome.  Dr Murali Mohan, pulmonologist, Narayana Health, said, “The more particles remain suspended in the air the longer the virus will remain suspended in the air and transmission is likely to be higher. When the particles do get inhaled, it will lead to more severe inflammatory reaction. These are the two main reasons why there’s an association between air pollution and complications, including mortality, in Covid-19.” Exposure to fine particulate matter is also associated with cardiovascular diseases. Dr H Paramesh, paediatric pulmonologist, environmentalist and professor at Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science, told DH, “PM 2.5 penetrates the lung parenchyma (substance of the lung outside of the circulatory system that is involved with gas exchange). Some of them cross over and reach the blood vessels causing clotting in the blood vessels. This worsens Covid.” Dr C Nagaraj, director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, said, “Healthy individuals are more likely to get respiratory infections, including Covid, when fine dust particles are more in the air. Those suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma patients are more susceptible to Covid. Especially, during winter and Deepavali, we advise them to stay at home because this exaggerates the disease process. There’s a definite correlation between contracting Covid early and PM 2.5.” Dr Satyanarayana Mysore, pulmonologist, Manipal Hospital, said, “The US Harvard study is a mathematical model and has used historical data. It is not a direct outcome study. A similar study was done in northern Italy. It is known that whenever PM 2.5 levels are more, hospital admissions for respiratory diseases are more. Covid symptoms can be severe when the lung is already inflamed. But there’s no harm in taking precautions as pre-Deepavali PM 2.5 levels drastically rise post-Deepavali.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/high-pm-25-levels-in-winter-diwali-worsen-covid-19-say-doctors-908806.html

The criminal petition was filed by Arjun, accused in a murder case in Hennur police station. The petitioner contended that the FIR should be disbelieved as the sister of the deceased gave information about the killing and she had not furnished the names of the assailants. The petitioner further contended that the two eyewitnesses to the case did not report the crime to the police. Hence, their eyewitness account cannot be believed. The petitioner sought relief of bail claiming that there was no prima facie case against him. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar observed that there is no ground to disbelieve the FIR. “First Information need not be an encyclopedia. It need not contain every detail. What is required is reporting of the crime to the police,” the courtsaid. Further, the court observed that the statements of the eyewitnesses cannot be disbelieved even though they did not inform the police about the incident. The court also said that the eyewitnesses may be subjected to cross-examination in the course of the trial to test their authenticity. In rejecting the bail petition, the court found enough materials at the present stage to adduce the involvement of the petitioner in assaulting the deceased.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/fir-need-not-be-an-encyclopedia-karnataka-high-court-908823.html

29-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||2.63 lakh farmers in Karnataka yet to get 2019 flood insurance||More than a year after the devastating floods of 2019, 2.63 lakh farmers are yet to receive insurance cover for crop loss suffered during the year under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in the state. According to government data, 4.93 lakh farmers were eligible for insurance claims for crop loss suffered during the 2019 monsoon season. However, claims were settled in only 2.3 lakh cases. Apart from these cases, over 61,000 claims between 2016-17 and 2018-19 worth Rs 110.7 crore are still pending at various government levels. Farmer organisations have accused the government of using up the funds meant for insurance claims, adding to the distress caused by floods. Authorities have assured that claims will be disbursed soon in phases. Sources, meanwhile, blame the delay in tallying crop survey data with 'Samrakshane' - crop insurance portal of the state government, as one of the main causes. For losses suffered for Khariff crop in monsoon 2019, the government calculated insurance claims of Rs 524.62 crore under the Yojana. The government has settled claims worth Rs 221.57 crore, while pending claims were worth Rs 303.04 crore. A total of 61,955 insurance claims of farmers in three years between 2016-17 and 2018-19 were yet to be released. Crop survey data of the khariff season last year is yet to be mapped with Samrakshane portal, a multi-department exercise ending in direct benefit transfer of crop insurance. In some cases, farmers had already sowed a different crop when crop survey took place, which led to complications in claiming insurance. The government has sought exemption from insurance companies for such cases, along with cases of mixed cropping, inter-cropping and others, sources told DH. Once the portal is streamlined, claims will be debited at a quicker pace. Moreover, there are also issues such as submission of wrong Aadhaar number or bank account details, which has affected the scheme, sources added. Viresh Sobaradhmath of Karnataka Rait Sena said that they had petitioned district administrations to ensure timely release of insurance claims. "Many farmers in the Krishna basin, who suffered losses during floods last year are yet to receive the insurance cover under the scheme," he said, alleging that state government had used up the funds meant for insurance claims causing the delay.

29-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Never said Covid-19 vaccine will come in January: K Sudhakar||Health and Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar clarified to DH on Wednesday that he had never said the vaccine will be out in January, as reported by a section of the media.  He told DH, "I never said the vaccine will come in January as many have reported." Asked if he can tentatively point to a month in which the vaccine can be expected, he said, "Nobody can predict that. They (University of Oxford-AstraZeneca) have completed phase 1 of the trial. Phase 2 and 3 of the trial are underway." The confusion was caused after Dr Sudhakar's office issued a release saying the vaccine will be available in early 2021 and with another reference to in the "beginning of 2021 itself" though the minister himself did not make such an announcement at the briefing. The indications in the release were interpreted by many as January. The minister, however, distanced himself from the release.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/never-said-covid-19-vaccine-will-come-in-january-k-sudhakar-908463.html

The team was dispatched recently by the Union Health Ministry to visit five states including Karnataka, after a spiral of cases, to review the state government's management of the pandemic. The expert panels also visited Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal. The copy of the report by the team, which was sent to Karnataka Chief Secretary Vijay Bhaskar, pointed out a number of loopholes in the method adopted by the state government to check the spreading of the disease. The team comprising of Joint Secretary (Nodal Officer for the State),  public health expert and clinician visited several places in the state including Bengaluru, Kalaburagi and Bellary. The expert team observed that Karnataka's surveillance and contact tracing measure not satisfactory in recent days. Though the state has made commendable works in tracing primary contact in the initial days of pandemic to till June end, subsequent days, it was negligent in tracing primary contact, particularly in Bengaluru. This was clear laxcity by BBMP, the report said. The panel also said that the concerned authorities  failed to maintain proper documentation of Covid-19 positive patients. Even the state health department did not pay any attention in finding out the post Covid-19 health problems faced by patients, said the team. Though some people died due to Covid-19 without any symptoms, the state treated many cases as non-Covid-19 cases because of confusions, the team said. The team also did not agree with the state's decision on marking containment zone only if 20 cases are reported in a particular area. "There was no need to wait for cases to increase to till 20 to declare the area as containment zone," said the report while asking the state to strengthening system to contain the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dh-exclusive-centres-expert-team-finds-loopholes-in-karnatakas-methods-to-restrict-covid-19-outbreak-908752.html

Though the project has been pending for long, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is giving a major push to the project to boost tourism facilities in Mumbai. On Thursday, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) put up e-RFP notice inviting proposals for appointment of consultant for conducting pre-feasibility study, techno-economic (TeFS) feasibility study, identification of site, preparation of detailed project report (DPR), preparation of tender and provision of project management consultancy (PMC). The last date of online submission is 6 November, according to MMRDA officials. On February 12, a pre-bid meeting of interested bidders was held at MMRDA office, which was attended by two dozen representatives from eight companies. Questions were raised about the size of the plot at Bandra Reclamation and allied facilities, among others vis-a-vis the 630-foot tall observation wheel. The subsequent bidding process had failed to elicit any response. This is not the first time Maharashtra has planned the idea of building Mumbai Eye tourist attraction. In 2014, the state had planned a ferris wheel, but it did not fructify. In 2008, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had proposed the idea of a Mumbai Eye, but it could not be taken forward.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/a-mumbai-eye-to-come-up-in-india-s-financial-capital-908554.html

"We will form a committee of 15 people who will discuss the project with me. All the issues raised by locals over the project would be addressed," said Sawant. The villagers, however, refused to withdraw their agitation, saying their single-point demand is that the state government shift the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus project from their village. Sawant told the villagers that the state government is ready to rehabilitate those who would be affected by the project and would also regularise the land titles, which has been pending since long. The Chief Minister said the villagers would benefit out of the project. "Under no circumstances, we will force the project on the people," he said.

Additional sessions judge P R Sitre granted bail to Pattanshetty on a surety of Rs 50,000, his lawyer Aniket Nikam said. Nikam earlier argued in the court that his client had not done any rigging of the Television Rating Points nor there was a rise in the TRP of the Fakth Marathi channel. The revenue of the channel had also not increased during the relevant period, he said, alleging that this was a "witch-hunt". He further submitted that during the custodial interrogation of Pattanshetty, who was arrested earlier this month, nothing was recovered and his further detention was unwarranted. The alleged fake TRP scam came to light after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint with Mumbai police through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain channels were rigging TRP numbers to lure advertisers. It was alleged that some families at whose houses meters were installed for collecting data of viewership were being bribed to tune into a particular channel. So far, at least 11 people have been arrested in connection with the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/trp-scam-court-grants-bail-to-fakt-marathi-channel-owner-908613.html

Vilasrao Deshmukh was one of the tallest politicians from the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and had also served as a minister in the Dr Manmoham Singh government. Dhiraj is an MLA from Latur Rural, while his older brother Amit Deshmukh is MLA from Latur City and is Minister of Medical Education and Culture in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Their brother and actor Riteish Deshmukh is also involved in various social projects. “Farmers are the core constituency and water scarcity is the biggest problem,” Dhiraj said.A first-time MLA, he has initiated extensive tree plantation drives in Latur to keep the green cover dense and flourishing. Besides, he is also focusing on renewable energy generation specifically in the field of solar power. “In Latur, we are countering adverse climate conditions despite the region having rain shadow characteristics. Water scarcity is a major issue in my constituency and we do not get adequate or timely seasonal rainfall. We are continually fighting the drought cycles and at times, we get untimely rains which end up creating huge crop losses. No prizes for guessing this is symptomatic of climate change. I am aware that we must on one hand ensure enough water for everyone and on the other take care of the imbalances in the environment,” he said. Dhiraj said his focus hence has remained on solving the drinking water problem in my constituency by building a network of linkages between Ujani dam in Western Maharashtra and Latur. “We are also working towards raising the height of the Medium project and when approved, this will benefit the farmers. Recently, we were able to repair Shivni Barrage at war footing and it is now safe and brimming with water,” he said. Dhiraj Deshmukh in the last one year, has got over Rs 200 crore of development funds approved for various works in the constituency which include infrastructural development and road building.  To make sure that progress does not come at the cost of land rights, he has helped farmers to get pending dues of over Rs 100 crore in lieu of the land they gave away for road development. An Independent Command Area Development Authority Office has been opened by Amit Deshmukh, who is also the Guardian Minister of Latur. “The water from the Renapur Medium Project in The taluka was also made available to the farmers. Additionally, we have been   funding various rural development schemes and distributing fertilizers and seeds to help farmers during this tough period. Latur is a very-well known commodity Market and we are also trying to boost up the agro-processing industry which will benefit the local farmers and help create new jobs for local talent,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ex-cm-vilasrao-deshmukh-s-son-leads-mission-to-make-latur-drought-free-908682.html

29-10-2020||West||Keshubhai Patel - The man who helped build BJP from scratch in Gujarat||Veteran politician and BJP's first chief minister in Gujarat Keshubhai Patel passed away here on Thursday at the age of 93. He died of multiple health complications in a private hospital where he was admitted after he complained of breathlessness. Patel was cremated with full state honour in Gandhinagar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to arrive at Kevadia at the site of the Statue of Unity on Friday, is also expected to meet the grieving family tomorrow. Family sources said that about ten days back, Patel had tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to Sterling hospital from where he was discharged. However, his condition worsened again on Thursday morning. He complained of difficulty in breathing and was rushed to hospital where he passed away. As the news of his death spread, BJP leaders including chief minister Vijay Rupani cut short their election campaigns for bypolls to eight Assembly seats. Active in public life since the mid-1940s, Patel was elected to Gujarat Legislative Assembly six times. Considered to be one of the "architects" of BJP's emergence in the state, Keshubhai, fondly called "Bapa", was unceremoniously removed from office in 2001, months after the disastrous earthquake hit the state. Often called the "grand old man" of the BJP in Gujarat, he mentored a generation of BJP leaders including Narendra Modi, who succeeded him in the state as chief minister and later went on to become the prime minister. He was succeeded by Narendra Modi, now the prime minister. "Since then Keshubhai, once the central figure of BJP in polls from the mid-1970s till 2000, remained on the fringes. He tried his luck in 2012 assembly polls riding on his caste- the dominant Patidar community- but couldn't garner much support," remembered a senior BJP leader. In the run-up to 2012 Assembly polls, Patel left BJP and floated his own "Gujarat Parivartan Party" along with Gordhan Zadaphia to challenge Modi's regime. The newly formed party couldn't dent BJP and two years later he quit and joined BJP back. He was born in Visavadar town of Junagadh district in July 1928 and said to have joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1945 and later started his political life as a member of Jan Sangh, before the birth of BJP. He won several polls from 1975 till the 2000s and became chief minister of Gujarat, the first for a BJP leader, in 1995 but was compelled to resign following a rebellion led by Shankersinh Vaghela who replaced him for a year. In 1998, he became the chief minister again but was replaced by Modi three years later in 2001. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while paying tribute to Patel, tweeted, "Keshubhai mentored and groomed many younger Karyakartas including me. Everyone loved his affable nature. His demise is an irreparable loss. We are all grieving today. My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers..." Patel was also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust, which manages the famous Somnath temple, that has Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah among others as its trustees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/keshubhai-patel-the-man-who-helped-build-bjp-from-scratch-in-gujarat-908696.html

The comparative was drawn by Goa Congress Mahila Morcha president Pratima Coutinho, who led a protest march to the Goa Police headquarters in Panaji on Thursday, demanding a probe into the porn message controversy. "When it came to Tarun Tejpal, the Goa Police filed a First Information Report based on an email by Tejpal. Here in case of the deputy CM, there is not even a simple enquiry based into a porn message sent from Kavlekar's phone on a Whatsapp group. This is sheer hypocrisy," Coutinho said. In 2013, Tejpal was accused of allegedly raping a colleague at a five-star resort in North Goa. He was subsequently charge-sheeted under sections 376 (rape), 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement) 354A (sexual harassment) and 354B (criminal assault), of the Indian Penal Code. One of the early pieces of evidence, which the police used to launch an investigation was an email, reportedly sent by Tejpal, to the victim in which the journalist expressed remorse for the action.    Several dozen women from the Congress party on Thursday had staged a dharna outside the Goa Police headquarters demanding police action in the issue. Opposition parties in Goa have been demanding the sacking of Kavlekar from the Dy. CM's post after the controversy erupted, with the officials of the Congress, as well as Goa Forward, a regional party filing a complaint against Kavlekar, accusing the latter of allegedly outraging the modesty of women, by sending the porn video. Kavlekar, however, has maintained that efforts were on to defame him and unknown persons had hacked his phone to send the porn message and that a complaint had already been filed with the Cyber Cell of the Goa Police. Coutinho has maintained that police should also probe how a mobile phone of the state's deputy Chief Minister could be hacked in the dead of the night. "At least probe how a phone of such an influential person could be hacked? This is nothing but an attempt to hoodwink the people," Coutinho said. The Goa Bharatiya Janata Party unit has however backed Kavlekar, a former Congress MLA, in the episode, with state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade claiming that high-end technology could have been used to hack the deputy CM's phone and send across the porn message, in order to defame him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-congress-demands-police-probe-dy-cm-porn-controversy-with-same-sincerity-as-tejpal-rape-case-908719.html
29-10-2020||West||Gujarat: Case against two ED officers who allegedly conspired to steal seized vehicles transferred to CID||Barely ten days after Surat district police registered an FIR against five persons including two officers of Enforcement Directorate (ED) allegedly for stealing and selling six trailers worth over Rs4 crore, which had been attached by ED in a money laundering case, the state government on Friday transferred the case to CID (crime) for investigation. On October 19, the Surat rural police had registered an FIR against two ED officers including IRS officer of 2010 batch Pravin Solunke and his junior identified only as Bheraram, who is said to be working as Assistant Enforcement Officer. Three other accused identified as Santosh Singh, Afsar Khan and Punaji Sawekar have already been arrested and currently in judicial custody. They have been booked for conspiracy, theft, among other charges. "The case has been transferred to CID (crime) for investigation as it involves multiple agencies. CID is equipped to handle such cases," Director General of Police Ashish Bhatia told DH while confirming the development.  The case came to light on October 16, when a team of Surat rural police seized six trailers at a toll plaza. The police are said to have stopped them on suspicion and later the drivers failed to produce proper documents. The drivers and cleaners informed police that they were employed by a firm identified as Mahadev Roadlines and they picked up the trailers from a parking yard. The trailers were supposed to be delivered to one Sanjay Jaiswal in neighbouring Nashik in Maharashtra. Jaiswal is suspected to the buyer of the trailers. The trailers belong to a firm Siddhi Vinayak Logistic (SVL) firm that has officers in both Mumbai and Surat. The firm and its owners are facing criminal charges for duping several banks to the tune of nearly Rs2000 crore. The CBI was investigating the firm since 2013. Based on CBI's FIR, ED officers also launched a probe under money laundering act and attached over 6000 vehicles, mostly trucks and trailers worth over Rs1,600 crore. "We don't know for sure but we suspect that over 200 trailers were not listed in the provisional attachment done by the ED and two of accused officers knew about it. I can't share more details since the case has already been transferred to CID for investigation," said a policeman in Surat district refusing to be identified. He added that "local police were surprised with the sudden transfer." Sources said that the FIR only mentions that seized trailers along with 200 similar vehicles were parked at the parking yard of a hotel and these road vehicles were not in the list of properties to be seized. Surat police's investigation has already revealed that one of the arrested accused Santosh had come to Surat last month introduced himself as ED officer to the security officials posted at the parking yard. A couple of days later, one of the accused ED officers Bheraram also came and broke open the wall of the yard with an earthmover to make way for the trailers. Police have obtained video footage from the phone of Santosh who sent them to accused ED officer Salunke.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-case-against-two-ed-officers-who-allegedly-conspired-to-steal-seized-vehicles-transferred-to-cid-908788.html

In a slight change in the original schedule, Modi is expected to visit the grieving family of former Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel in Gandhinagar after his arrival at the Ahmedabad airport. The 92-year-old BJP stalwart died here on Thursday morning due to prolonged illness. Modi paid rich tributes to Patel through a series of tweets and said the veteran leader had mentored and groomed many younger workers, including him. "Our family has been informed that PM Modi would come to our residence in Gandhinagar on Friday morning to share our pain," said Keshubhai Patel's son, BJP leader Bharat Patel. The PM will then leave for Kevadiya in Narmada district. This will be Modi's first visit to his home state since the coronavirus outbreak in Gujarat in March-end. According to the official, Modi would take a helicopter ride from the Ahmedabad airport to reach Kevadiya. During his trip, Modi would also pay tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the 'Statue of Unity' near Kevadiya on the occasion of birth anniversary of the first Home Minister of independent India on October 31, said the official. Modi would arrive at Kevadiya on the afternoon of October 30, he said. He would first inaugurate the Sardar Patel Zoological Park, popularly known as Jungle Safari, developed near the 182-metre tall "Statue of Unity" which is dedicated to the "Iron Man" of India. The zoo houses wild animals and birds brought from all over the world. Later, the PM would inaugurate a boat service which would operate in the Narmada river between the statue and Shreshth Bharat Bhavan, around 4km away, according to the schedule. The PM is expected to take a boat ride after the inauguration of the service, the official said. Modi would then inaugurate Ekta Mall near the statue where tourists can buy handicraft items brought from all over the country, he said. Other new attractions at the site which will be inaugurated include Children Nutrition Park and Unity Glow Garden. Around 30 lakh LED lights have been used to illuminate the garden during the night for tourists. In the night, Modi would inaugurate the illuminated Cactus Garden and Ekta Nursery. The official said Modi will stay overnight at Kevadiya. On the morning of October 31, Modi would first visit the Statue of Unity to pay floral tributes to Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary, he said. On the occasion, a parade, named Ekta Diwas Parade, by Central Armed Police Forces and the Gujarat police will also be organised in Modi's presence, the official said. After speaking at the parade ground near the statue, Modi would interact with civil service probationers, also called Officer Trainees (OTs), through video conferencing, he said. These trainee IAS officers would join the PM from the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie (Uttarakhand). "The Academy is gearing up for Aarmabh 2020 in which a galaxy of thought leaders are sharing their views on India @ 100, culminating in the PM's interaction with OTs from the Statue of Unity on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Patel, the Patron Saint of Indian civil services," Academy Director Sanjeev Chopra had tweeted earlier. Later in the afternoon, the PM would launch the famed seaplane service connecting Kevadiya and Ahmedabad. A water aerodrome having a floating platform has been built in a lake near the Sardar Sarovar Dam, said the official. The PM would board a seaplane from the lake and reach the Sabarmati Riverfront. He will then wind up his visit and leave for New Delhi, said the official.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pm-narendra-modi-on-2-day-gujarat-trip-from-october-30-to-visit-statue-of-unity-908801.html

As of Thursday, the state has reported a total of 16,66,668 coronavirus cases and 43,710 deaths. "...to take certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of the virus, the Government in the exercise of the powers conferred under Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, read with all other enabling provisions of The Disaster Management Act, 2005, it is expedient to extend the lockdown in the entire state of Maharashtra till midnight of November 30, 2020," said the order issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar. The state government has been easing restrictions in a phased manner. Restaurants and bars were allowed to operate at 50 per cent seating capacity from October 5. Besides essential services staff, Mumbai's dabbawalas (tiffin carriers) and women passengers were allowed to travel by the city's local trains this month. The Maharashtra government has also asked the railway authorities to allow the general public to travel by trains in Mumbai region during non-peak hours. But the state government has not yet taken a decision on reopening temples, schools and colleges.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/existing-lockdown-restrictions-extended-in-maharashtra-till-november-30-908822.html
29-10-2020||West||Maharashtra: Dharavi facelift project tender scrapped||In a development that could add to the tussle between the Maha Vikas Aghadi government and the BJP, the Maharashtra government on Thursday scrapped the tendering process of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project worth Rs 30,000 crore and decided to call for fresh bids. The decision was taken at the weekly Cabinet meeting presided over by Thackeray, following a recommendation by a committee of secretaries. The new tendering process will now be initiated after making certain amendments to the terms and conditions, which will comprise the issue of transfer of 45 acres of railway land for the redevelopment project. Dubai-based Seclink Technologies Corporation, owned by the royal family of UAE, had emerged as the highest bidder for the project. Seclinks’ bid was for Rs 7,200 crore compared with about Rs 4,500 crore of Adani Group in an H1-H2 Request For Proposal (RFP) in which the highest bidder will win the tender. The move is likely to end up in the court, as Seclinks has said that it will challenge the decision in the court of law. “We will have no option but to take legal recourse including international arbitration as per Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA) between UAE and India,” Neelang Shah, Chairman and MD, Seclinks told DH. The project aimed to redevelop the slum spread over 593 acres after the state housing department floated a Special Purpose Vehicle for the project in November 2018. Under the project, 67,000 families living in Dharavi were to get 350-sqft houses. After the committee of secretaries decided to scrap the tender process, Seclink had said it would bid afresh. The Dharavi Redevelopment Committee, a federation of 52 associations of residents, had opposed the committee’s decision, saying it would further delay the project which is pending for 16 years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-dharavi-facelift-project-tender-scrapped-908853.html
