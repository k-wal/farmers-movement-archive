Shah also said the government is taking all possible military and diplomatic steps to resolve the standoff in Ladakh with China. "We are vigilant for every inch of our land, no one can take it away...Our defence forces and leadership are capable of defending the country's sovereignty and border," he told CNN News18 when asked about the current standoff with China in Ladakh. The home minister also said that the government is committed to protecting the sovereignty and security of the country. Bihar Assembly Election Referring to the coming Bihar elections, Shah expressed confidence that the NDA will get a two-third majority. He said Nitish Kumar will be the next chief minister of the state after the polls. When asked whether the BJP will stake claim for the chief ministership in Bihar if the saffron party gets more seats than the ally JD(U) headed by Nitish Kumar, he said "There is no if or but. Nitish Kumar will be the next chief minister of Bihar. We have made a public announcement and we are committed to it." Talking about the Lok Janshakti Party breaking away from the ruling alliance in Bihar, Shah said the party was offered adequate seats but still walked away from the alliance. "It was their (LJP) decision, not ours," he said. West Bengal polls The home minister said there will be a change of government in West Bengal after next year's assembly elections and a BJP government will assume power there. "We feel we will have a determined fight in West Bengal and we will form the government," he said. He also said that the law and order situation in West Bengal is serious and political parties like the BJP have every right to seek imposition of President's rule there. "The central government will take an appropriate decision taking into account the Constitution and on the basis of the governor's report," he said. Hathras case Asked to comment about the incident of alleged gang-rape and murder of a woman at Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Shah slammed the opposition for indulging in politics over it and said all accused were arrested on the day of the incident and a CBI inquiry is already under progress. "There was a rape in Hathras and a similar incident had taken place in Rajasthan. But politics is centered around Hathras only. No one raised the incident of Rajasthan. The accused (in Hathras) were caught on the same day. A committee has been constituted to probe it...the CBI is also probing it. There should not be politics on it," he said. Abrogation of Article 370 Asked about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir a year after the abrogation of Article 370, the home minister said law and order in the Union territory is normal now even though there was a challenge due to the Covid-19 situation. "(New Lieutenant Governor) Manoj Sinha ji is there now and he will ensure that development reaches the last man. You will see major development there in 5-6 months," he said. Shah also asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi to publicly endorse party leader and former home minister P Chidambaram's statement that the special status of Jammu and Kashmir should be restored. Bollywood drug scam Asked about allegations of drug menace in Bollywood, Shah said he does not want to link the two. "I think drugs and Bollywood should not be seen together. Drugs are a menace and should be ended soon. We have taken many strong steps in the past and are going to strengthen law and infrastructure to check it. "You will see a big change in the coming days when it comes to probing infrastructure, legal provisions and manpower for eradicating the menace of drugs from the country," he said. Coronavirus outbreak in India The home minister also appealed to the people to follow the prime minister's advice on Covid-19. "Till there is a medicine, we all should follow the prime minister's advice to wash hands, keep distance and wear masks," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-vigilant-towards-each-inch-of-indias-land-no-one-can-take-it-away-amit-shah-on-ladakh-row-903515.html
18-10-2020||National||Secularism cannot be protected unless there is strict separation of religion from politics: Yechury||Unless there is a strict separation of religion from politics and government, secularism cannot be protected, defended or put into operation in a proper sense,CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Saturday. Yechury said forces like the RSS want to "take India into the darknessof the past" by changing the country's history, culture, education policy "to give a monolithic Hindu identity to India" instead of its syncretic cultural identity. Yechury was speaking while inaugurating the state-wide celebrations of the CPI(M) marking the 100th year of the founding of the Communist Party in India,through video conference. October 17 of this year is a historic day for the communist party as it marks the hundred years of the formation of the first unit of the Communist Party of India in Tashkent in the then Soviet Union. "Secularism means the separation of religion from politics and from the state. Every individual has the right to choose his own faith and it will be the duty of the state, law to protect that right which is inviolable and the communists will always stand up to protect it," Yechury said. He said thestateor the government does not have any religion and all the rights of individuals to their religion, or faith of their choice to their religious practices, need to be protected. "However, secularism in our constitution was interpreted as equality of all religions. The moment you say equality of all religions, it's only natural that the religion to which the majority of the population subscribe to, has a greater advantage over the others. And that has inherent dangers, which is what we are witnessing today.And unless there is a strict separation of religion from politics and government, secularism cannot be protected, defended or put into operation in a proper sense," the CPI(M) general secretary said. He said theentire logic of saying "my God is better than your God" is the basis for communal polarisation and communal conflicts. "Today we have forces like the RSS, whose political wing is the BJP, who want to take India into darkness and backwardness of the past. Lack of scientific temper, rewriting Indian history, changing India's education policy, changing India's cultural policy in the cultural institutions, all to give a monolithic Hindu identity to India instead of the syncretic identity with which all of us grew up," Yechury said. He appealed to the people tojoin in the "battleto stop India from going into the darkness of its past" and to take Indiato the brightness of the future by ending exploitation and moving towards socialism. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a Facebook post, saidthat the communist parties are the "voice of democracy and civil rights" which are being suppressed by "fascist forces." "Looking back over a century of the party's history is a proud experience for anyone who keeps in mind the dream of an egalitarian and peaceful social system.The communist movement survived brutal attacks and repression. It is a movement of brave martyrs who fought for their lives. An alternative political policy in favor of the people is the most important factor that makes the Communist Party relevant in the Indian context," Vijayan said. The CPI(M) in Kerala organised flaghoisting at each branchlevel adhering to COVID-19 protocol. The CPI(M) in a statement said the congruent development of neo-liberalism and the Hindutva forces have posed a serious challenge for the Communist movement and all the Left and democratic forces. "Neoliberal capitalism has brought many changes in the structure and composition of classes, some of which have had an adverse effect on the development of the working class and peasant movements.Rampant privatisation in all spheres has had its impact on the intermediate classes," CPI(M) said. It said there was a change with the assumption of power by the Modi government in 2014 and for the first time, a party based on "Hindutva ideology and controlled by the fascistic RSS has been wielding State power for the past six years." "The disastrous consequences for secularism, democracy and the well-being of the working people have been unfolding. A political force which had no role in the freedom struggle nor sharing its anti-imperialist secular ethos is now engaged in subverting the Constitution and instituting authoritarian rule all in the name of a nationalism which is regressive and reactionary," the Left party said. It said the challenge is to counter this pseudo-nationalism with an anti-imperialist, secular and inclusive nationalism and claimed the Communists are best equipped to do so because they carry forward the legacy of the anti-imperialist struggle for independence. It also said that building unity of all Communist and left forces is crucial at this juncture to rally other democratic and secular forces.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/secularism-cannot-be-protected-unless-there-is-strict-separation-of-religion-from-politics-yechury-903525.html

According to the IMF, India is set to drop below Bangladesh in terms of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the economy is projected to contract by a massive 10.3 per cent this year. IMF's forecast for India -- a huge downward revision from its previous prediction in June -- is also the biggest contraction projected among major emerging markets amid the Covid-19 pandemic. However, India is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8 per cent growth rate in 2021, thus regaining the position of the fastest-growing emerging economy, surpassing China's projected growth rate of 8.2 per cent, the IMF said in its latest 'World Economic Outlook' report.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-toon-economy-report-where-is-the-yogic-balance-903532.html

The officer said that the proposals have been received favourably by most.  The proposals were drafted after a look at the existing practices and were circulated among major establishments, command headquarters, and important directorates of the Army.  Some of the proposals include merging multiple officers’ mess of permanently located units in peace stations into one station mess. However, units that move from peace to field tenures would be able to retain their officers’ mess.  Another proposal is to discontinue individual CSD units in one station and establish one canteen in peace stations. The report also said that the measures include discontinuing the Army Day parade on January 15 and Territorial Army Day on October 9. The number of Army bands, pipes, and drums ensembles for the Republic Day parade and Beating Retreat ceremony is to be brought from 30 to 18.  Other measures include reduced fanfare for Vijay Divas and Kargil Divas celebrations. Only one investiture ceremony will be held in Delhi for awardees of Army HQs and other units in Delhi.  Cultural troupes like dance, traditional martial arts, and jazz bands will be dropped. They can instead be continued as hobbies within the unit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-proposes-to-cut-fanfare-to-do-away-with-army-day-territorial-army-day-report-903589.html

According to the police sources, the special task force (STF) apprehended Dhirendra Singh, a close aide of BJP's Ballia MLA Surendra Singh, from Polytechnic Crossing in the city. Police said that the National Security Act (NSA) would be slapped on Singh, who carried a reward of Rs 50 thousand, besides Gangster's Act. Singh had pumped four bullets into his rival Jai Prakash Pal after an altercation during the meeting convened by the officials to discuss allotment of fair price shops at Durjanpur village in the district on Thursday. As the killing sparked tension in the area, the government suspended five officials, including a sub-divisional magistrate, circle officer, and three others on charges of laxity. BJP lawmaker Surendra Singh, who had virtually justified the killing and claimed that it was in 'self-defense', has been summoned by the state BJP leadership to explain his support. The MLA had also said that he would ''stand with'' the accused as both of them hailed from the same caste. The lawmaker's remarks triggered widespread condemnation from different quarters putting the saffron party on the back foot on the issue. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanded action against the MLA and slammed the BJP for its failure to expel the lawmaker.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uttar-pradesh-main-accused-in-ballia-firing-arrested-903594.html

Power consumption in the country was recorded at 49.67 BU during October 1-15 last year, according to the power ministry data. For a full month in October last year, power consumption was 97.84 BU. Thus, the extrapolation of half-month data gives sufficient indication that power consumption may witness year-on-year double-digit growth this month, according to experts. They said double-digit growth in power consumption in the first half of this month showed that commercial and industrial demand has improved with easing of lockdown restrictions and would be better than this in the coming months. The Covid-19 situation affected power consumption for six months in a row from March to August this year. Power consumption on year-on-year basis declined 8.7 per cent in March, 23.2 per cent in April, 14.9 per cent in May, 10.9 per cent in June, 3.7 per cent in July and 1.7 per cent in August. The data showed that electricity consumption had grown by 11.73 per cent in February. Power consumption has shown an improvement post lockdown easing for economic activities after April 20. After a gap of six months, power consumption recorded a growth of 4.6 per cent in September this year at 112.43 BU from 107.51 BU in the same month last year. Earlier this month, Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh also said, "In September, our power demand was higher than September 2019. So the growth started again. Despite the fact that Covid problem lingers, the growth in our power consumption and demand has started." Peak power demand met, the highest supply of power in the country in a day, during October 1 to 15 was recorded at 170.04 GW (recorded on October 7 and 8). Peak power demand met for the month of October last year stood at 164.25 GW (recorded on October 14, 2019). Peak power demand in September this year recorded a growth of 1.8 per cent at 176.56 GW, compared to 173.45 GW a year ago, the data showed. Peak power demand met had recorded negative growth from April to August this year due to the pandemic. The peak demand met dropped to 24.9 per cent in April, 8.9 per cent in May, 9.6 in June, 2.7 per cent in July and 5.6 per cent in August. In March, it was muted at 0.8 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/power-consumption-grows-1145-in-first-half-of-october-903601.html

Paul, who is also the chief of expert coordinating efforts to tackle the pandemic in the country, in an interview to PTI, said that once the Covid-19 vaccine is available, there will be enough resources to deliver as well as make it accessible to the citizens. "In India, the new coronavirus cases and number of deaths have declined in the last three weeks and the pandemic has stabilised in most of the states "However, there are five states (Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal) and 3-4 Union Territories (UTs), where there is still a rising trend," Paul said. He is heading the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC). According to him, India is in a somewhat better position now but the country still has a long way to go because 90 per cent of the people are still susceptible to coronavirus infections. On whether India could see a second wave of coronavirus infections in the winter, Paul said that with the onset of winter, countries across Europe are seeing resurgence of Covid-19 cases. "We cannot rule out (a second coronavirus wave this winter in India). Things can happen and we are still learning about the virus," Paul noted. To a query about storage and distribution of vaccine once it is available, he said India has enough cold storage facilities to an extent and this can be readily augmented as required. "Once the vaccine is available, there will be enough resources for delivering vaccines and making vaccines accessible to the citizens and there will be no concern about resources under those circumstances," Paul said. The coronavirus death toll climbed to 1,14,031, the health ministry's data updated at 8 am showed.

18-10-2020||National||Convergence of healthcare services key to advance public nutrition delivery: Experts||Integration of quality services, convergence of healthcare services at the household level and strategic use of data could further advance public nutrition service delivery in India, experts have said. Noting that the child's first 1000 days (pregnancy to first two years of life) are often neglected, experts said the focus should be on anemia prevention, diarrhoea management, nutritional foods and WASH (water, sanitisation and hygiene). Alok Ranjan, Country Lead (Nutrition), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said that during the POSHAN Maah (Nutrition Month) there was an emphasis on maintaining the focus on basics of prevention of maternal and child undernutrition. Focus was also brought on new areas, such as children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and promotion of locally-sourced nutrient-rich foods grown in kitchen gardens, Ranjan said. "Food fortification, too, has gained good momentum in India over the last few years. I feel a larger number has been added to the people consuming fortified products in the world from India, than any other country in the last few years. India has almost everything (policies, human resource, funding and political will) in place in terms of what needs to be driven and the focus now more than ever before has to be on strengthening the implementation," he said. Ranjan said that in the maternal and child health program, globally as well as in India, quality of intervention is already a priority focus area. "There is no similar momentum around quality of nutritional intervention globally or in India. As the coverage numbers are increasing with the Poshan Abhiyaan, we need to start looking at it, right from the quality of training frontline workers, to quality in food supplementation as well as quality of counselling sessions at anganwadi centres or during home visits," he said. Ranjan also emphasises on strategic use of data, such as data from supervisor's field visit, regular MIS systems of various departments, national surveys like National Family Health Survey etc. and to use these data for identifying actionable next steps at various levels like at national, state, district, project, village and household level. He said also given the fact that most of the nutrition focused messaging is around behaviour change (like breastfeeding, diet diversity, IFA consumption etc) it is important to go beyond one-time messaging for high impact and effective social-behavioural change. "The same messaging needs to be delivered repeatedly to the household, through all touch points - mass media, radio, advertisements, local newspapers, self-help groups, opinion leaders, Anganwadi workers, helpers, ASHAs, and ANMs," he said. Thomas Forissier, Director Programs, South Asia, Alive & Thrive (FHI 360), said increasing the coverage of nutrition-related services and benefits is often the first step, but increasing the coverage of high quality services and benefits is the necessary second step. "There is no alignment on a simple definition of quality. Most experts would agree that quality involves right inputs: infrastructure, training of frontline workers, commodities, etc.; the right processes: providing key advice to families on how to nourish pregnant women and children, weight and height measurements, provision of various foods and micronutrients, etc.; and the right outputs: starting with client satisfaction," Forissier said. But none of those experts are likely to agree today on how all of those items fit together, which ones are more important. It is critical for the nutrition community to define what is the quality of nutrition services and benefits and how to measure it as soon as possible.

The missile was fired from INS Chennai, a stealth destroyer, and it hit the target with pinpoint accuracy after performing "extremely complex" manoeuvres, they said. "BrahMos as ‘prime strike weapon’ will ensure the warship’s invincibility by engaging naval surface targets at long ranges, thus making the destroyer another lethal platform of Indian Navy," the defence ministry said in a statement. BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russia joint venture, produces the supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the BrahMos Aerospace and the Indian Navy for the "successful" test firing of the missile. DRDO Chairman G Satheesh Reddy too congratulated the scientists and all personnel involved in the test firing of the missile which he said will add to the capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces in many ways. In the last few weeks, India has test fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and anti-radiation missile Rudram-1. India also carried out successful test firing of a laser guided anti-tank guided missile and nuclear capable hypersonic missile 'Shaurya'. The successful test firing of Rudram-1 was seen as a major milestone as it is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon. The flight testing of the missiles came in the midst of India's bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh. In May last year, the Indian Air Force successfully test fired the aerial version of the BrahMos missile from a Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft. On September 30, India successfully test fired a new version of the surface-to-surface version of the BrahMos. The range of the new land attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km. India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the de-facto border with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-successfully-test-fires-naval-version-of-brahmos-missile-from-ins-chennai-903681.html

The minister said this ought to serve as a good lesson for all the state governments that were being negligent in planning for the festival season. Kerala's Covid-19 tally has crossed 3.3 lakh while the toll climbed to 1,139 on Saturday. Prior to Onam (August 22), the state had reported around 54,000 cases, while the death toll was nearly 200. During an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode 'Sunday Samvaad', Vardhan reiterated his request to everyone to celebrate festivals at home with their loved ones in the traditional way to ward off the risk of Covid-19 infection. “This festive season, charity must take precedence over celebrations. My own celebrations too shall remain subdued due to the heart-rending impact of Covid-19 on lakhs of corona warriors across the world battling for us," the minister stated. He also assured that there is no shortage of medical oxygen in the country and that the government is ready to scale up the production capacity to meet any further increase in demand arising due to the pandemic. Responding to a question on Kerala recently reporting a spike in Covid-19 cases, Vardhan said that between January 30 and May 3, the state had reported just 499 cases and two deaths due to the disease. He regretted that "Kerala was paying the price of gross negligence" during the recent Onam festivities when state-wise unlocking of services, along with an increase in inter and intrastate travel for trade and tourism led to the spread of Covid-19 across various districts. “The epi curve of Kerala changed completely due to Onam festivities across the state. The daily new cases nearly doubled," Vardhan said. He exhorted the people to honour the prime minister's call for a 'jan andolan' (mass movement) to religiously follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Vardhan also said that as of yet, no mutation of coronavirus has been detected in India that is either more transmission efficient or more pathogenic. He rekindled the joy of having morning tea with the daily newspaper in a respondent by reassuring him that there is no scientific evidence that proves that novel coronavirus transmission can happen via newspapers. "Reading newspapers is completely safe even during the Covid-19 pandemic," he said. Answering a question on the discrepancy in the Covid-19 death figures, Vardhan said that the Ministry of Health has taken up the issue of correct certification of Covid-19 deaths with all states and UTs on multiple instances. It has also shared a proper modality of reporting of deaths with them to ensure consistency in reporting of Covid-19 related deaths across India, the minister said. On the availability of medical oxygen in the country, he said the current oxygen production capacity of India is around 6400 MT/Day. The government is ready to scale up the production capacity to meet any further increase in demand arising due to the pandemic, he said. The Empowered Group constituted by the home ministry is monitoring the requirement of medical oxygen across India. The health ministry is also monitoring the availability and supply of medical oxygen at the field level through regular video conferencing with state nodal officers as well as with principal secretaries or mission directors. He said 1,02,400 medical oxygen cylinders had been delivered to states and UTs. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has fixed the price of Liquid Medical Oxygen. Guidelines on 'Rational use of oxygen for management of Covid-19' have also been issued, he informed. Vardhan remarked that although there are no intranasal Covid-19 vaccines under trial in India at the moment, Serum India and Bharat Biotech are expected to pursue clinical trials of such vaccines in the country in the coming months on receipt of regulatory approval. He clarified that the Phase 3 clinical trial is generally with thousands of participants, sometimes even close to 30,000 to 40,000. It is possible that from a specific city or hospital, a couple of hundred participants are selected at a given time but, in general, the overall Phase 3 participant pool is much larger, the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kerala-paying-price-for-gross-negligence-during-onam-no-shortage-of-medical-oxygen-harsh-vardhan-903690.html
18-10-2020||National||Success of labour codes depends on how rules are framed, implemented, says expert||The recent government regulation to subsume multiple labour laws into four codes is a major reform but the overall success of the labour codes would depend on how the rules are framed and implemented on the ground, says an expert. Parliament in its just-concluded session passed three labour code bills: the Industrial Relations (IR) Code, the Social Security Code, and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (OSH). The Wage Code Bill, 2019, was passed by Parliament last year. "A delicate balance was needed to meet the needs of both employers and employees and the provisions in the Codes appear to have met that balance," said Vishal Grover, Practice Leader, Retirement Solutions, Aon India. According to Grover, some of the big reforms impacting employers include flexibility to hire fixed-term employees, relaxation in rules around retrenchment, inability of unions to go on strike without giving sixty-day notice to the employer and single licensing norms for contractors. From an employee's perspective, commitment to set up social security plans for unorganised, gig and platform workers is a step in the right direction considering the growth of aggregator platforms. Moreover, women workers have been empowered by allowing their employment during night shifts subject to safety protocols being observed, mandating pay-parity for fixed-term employees and continuing with existing rules around 8 working hours a day and paid maternity leave of 26 weeks, he said. "Overall, the success of the Codes would depend on how rules are framed and implemented on the ground over the next few months and how organisations adapt to these changes," he noted. According to Grover, the flexibility to hire workers on a fixed-term basis without any restriction could be a game-changer as it would force organisations to review their employment models and could lead to a sharp increase in hiring of fixed-term employees - both white and blue-collared. "It remains to be seen if an increase in fixed-term employees would be at the expense of the permanent workforce which would be a concern," he said. He further noted that the long-term objective of the labour reforms should be to create more employment opportunities as India is expected to surpass China to become the most populous country in the next few years and would continue to add millions of new workforce to the economy every year making it critical for the country to create new jobs. Further, India would start losing the demographic dividend over the next couple of decades and senior citizens are estimated to constitute around 20 per cent of the population by 2050 and hence, a strong social security system is the need of the hour. "Sustainable programs including life cover, health insurance, old-age protection, housing should be set up for unorganized, gig and platform workers as promised by the Code," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/success-of-labour-codes-depends-on-how-rules-are-framed-implemented-says-expert-903696.html

Of the 1,347 complaints disposed of by the Lokpal in the last fiscal, official data showed, only 195 fell under the ombudsman while the rest 1,152 or 85.52% were beyond its remit. If one takes the total number of complaints received, this would come to 80.72%. The huge proportion of complaints that do not fall under its jurisdiction shows the lack of understanding among people who approach the Lokpal with their complaints. A senior official said people were filing any kind of complaint with the Lokpal. "People appear to be unaware of the procedures. They file complaints which don't come under the jurisdiction of Lokpal. Some are sort of grievance redressal. Some others file the same complaint with several authorities," the official said. The Lokpal itself has acknowledged the problem and on its website said, “Citizens are advised that other complaints related to pension, service-related issues and public grievances should be addressed to the respective departments on the official portals or websites and not to the Lokpal unless it is related to corruption issue.” According to the Lokpal, 613 out of 1,427 complaints were related to state government officials and public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, judicial institutions and autonomous bodies at the state level. Central government officials faced 245 complaints while another 200 complaints were filed against officials at PSU's, statutory bodies, judicial institutions and autonomous bodies at the central level. A total of 135 complaints were also filed against private persons and organisations. The Lokpal also received 220 "requests/comments/suggestions".  While the Lokpal found that 1,152 complaints beyond its remit, 78 complainants were asked to file their complaints on the prescribed form while 45 were sent for a status report. Thirty-five matters were found to be under the consideration of other authorities while directions were issued to authorities in 32 complaints. Twenty-nine cases were pending with the Central Vigilance Commission - 25 for a status report and four for inquiry while four were with the Department of Higher Education out of which three awaited a status report and one inquiry. Two were pending with the Central Bureau of Investigation for the status report. One complaint was pending with the Railway Board for inquiry while the status report was pending in two cases related to the Culture Ministry, one case each of the Ministry of Water Resources, Directorate General of Income Tax, Department of School Education and Literacy, Department of Post and Ministry of Shipping. It was only in March this year that the government had notified the rules and format for filing a complaint with the Lokpal while it was dealing with all complaints in any format filed until then. According to the Act, the Lokpal has jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of corruption against anyone who is or has been Prime Minister, or a Minister in the Union government, or a Member of Parliament, as well as officials of the Union government under Groups A, B, C and D. Also covered are chairpersons, members, officers and directors of any board, corporation, society, trust or autonomous body either established by an Act of Parliament or wholly or partly funded by the Union or state government.  Complaints can also be filed against any society or trust or body that receives foreign contributions above Rs 10 lakh. While the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was passed in 2013, the government appointed the first Lokpal only in March 2019. Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose was administered the oath as chairperson of the Lokpal on March 23 last year while another eight members also took the oath.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/80-of-1427-complaints-filed-with-lokpal-in-2019-20-outside-anti-corruption-ombudsman-s-remit-903697.html

During an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode of "Sunday Samvaad", Vardhan said that the reported outbreak of Covid-19 from Wuhan in China remains recognised as the first report worldwide. Responding to a question, he said that China has claimed that there was a simultaneous outbreak of the disease across many nations. "However, to validate this claim that there were multiple focal points across the world requires data of uniform and timely reporting of the occurrence of confirmed and diagnosed cases from various countries at the very same time. No such clinching evidence is as yet available regarding this. Therefore, the reported outbreak of Covid-19 from Wuhan in China has been recognised as the first report worldwide," the minister said. Responding to another question on the market being flooded with oximeters made in China, he said, "Consumers should look for FDA or CE-approved products with ISO or IEC specifications while purchasing a pulse oximeter from the market or from online retailers." However, he made it clear that a dip in the oxygen saturation level is not a Covid-19 symptom, as it may happen due to other underlying medical conditions as well. Vardhan further said that as yet, no mutation of the coronavirus has been detected in India, which is either more transmission efficient or more pathogenic. In response to another question, the minister said that although there are no intranasal Covid-19 vaccines under trial in the country at the moment, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are expected to pursue clinical trials of such vaccines in the coming months on receiving the regulatory approval. He clarified that the phase-3 clinical trial is generally with thousands of participants, sometimes even close to 30,000 to 40,000. It is possible that from a specific city or hospital, a couple of hundred participants are selected at a given time, but in general, the overall phase-3 participant pool is much larger. Sharing details of the special Drive for Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reporting and monitoring of drugs used in Covid-19, Vardhan clarified that the drive is not because of an adverse reaction reported with an existing drug, but is part of a proactive Covid-19 preparedness programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-mutation-of-coronavirus-detected-in-india-vardhan-903703.html
18-10-2020||National||India can control Covid-19 pandemic by February 2021, says government-appointed panel||No fresh lockdowns should be imposed on district or state level to contain the spread of Covid-19 unless There is an imminent danger of healthcare facilities being overwhelmed, according to a government-appointed committee chaired by IIT Hyderabad professor M Vidyasagar. The committee has also claimed that if all protocols are followed, the pandemic can be controlled by early next year with minimal active symptomatic infections by February-end. The committee has developed an evidence-based mathematical model for Covid-19 progression. The national level 'super model' is based on various parameters such as timing of the lockdown, alternative lockdown scenarios, impact of migrant workers returning to their homes, and future course of the pandemic including impact of not following safety protocols. "If all of us follow these protocols, the pandemic can be controlled by early next year with minimal active symptomatic infections by February-end. We do not yet know the weather-specific perturbations of this pandemic (in general, viruses tend to be more active in colder environment) and the effects of possible future mutations in the virus. "Hence, the existing personal safety protocols need to continue in full measure. Otherwise we will see a sharp rise in infections. Fresh lockdowns should not be imposed on a district and state wide levels, unless there is imminent danger of the healthcare facilities being overwhelmed," Vidyasagar said. The committee including professors from IITs and IISc besides scientists, said that upcoming festival and winter seasons may increase the susceptibility to the infection but all activities can be resumed provided proper safety protocols are followed. It also noted that the imposition of an early and comprehensive lockdown pushed the peak of cases far into the future and also reduced the peak load on the system. "With no lockdown, the pandemic would have hit India very hard, with a peak load of over 140 lakh cases arriving in June. Given our lack of preparedness back then, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed, leading to many additional deaths. Had India waited until May to impose the lockdown, the peak load of active cases would have been around 50 lakhs by June," the panel report said. "In actuality, the peak of active cases came in late September at around 10 lakhs. By this time, we were far better equipped to handle the pandemic in terms of diagnostics and vital equipment inventories. Without a lockdown the number of deaths in India would have overwhelmed the system within a very short timeframe, and would eventually have crossed 26 lakhs fatalities," it added. Based on temporal profiles of analyses done for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the committee concluded that the impact of labour migration on the total number of infections in these states was minimal. The committee also asserted that the imposition of various safety protocols such as wearing masks and social distancing, together with a comprehensive lockdown has allowed India to fare better than many other countries.  "India has one-sixth of the world's population (one-fifth excluding China), and one-sixth of the reported cases. However, India accounts for only 10 pc of the world’s deaths, and its case fatality rate of less than 2 pc is among the lowest in the world," it said. The committee has recommended that the existing personal safety protocols need to continue in full measure, otherwise the country will see a sharp rise in infections. "Avoiding congestion especially in closed spaces and special care of those above 65 years and children is even more significant. Personnel with co-morbidities need to be extra cautious," it said. The Department of Science and Technology had in June constituted a committee comprising eminent scientists and academicians to evolve a national supermodel for Covid-19 progression. The mandate of the committee was to create an evidence-based mathematical model for the pandemic after taking inputs from various groups working in the domain in the country and use it to analyse past events and future trajectories of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-can-control-covid-19-pandemic-by-february-2021-says-government-appointed-panel-903708.html

The minister said this during an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode of Sunday Samvaad. He was responding to a question from a participant, who cited West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's remark that there are instances of community transmission in her state and asked the minister which are the states that have witnessed community transmission of the disease. "In different pockets across various states, including West Bengal, community transmission of Covid-19 is expected to occur, especially in densely-populated areas. "However, this is not happening across the country. Community transmission is limited to certain districts, occurring in a limited number of states," Vardhan said. He added that as yet, no mutation of the coronavirus has been detected in India that is either more transmission-efficient or more pathogenic. The Centre so far has denied community transmission of the coronavirus infection in the country. Health ministry officials had said the World Health Organization (WHO) has not given any standard definition of community transmission. It permits its member nations to assess the spread of the disease, based on their own analysis of the situation, and do their reporting, which the global body shows on its website. Broadly, if it is not possible to trace the transmission chain, it means there is community transmission, officials said. The Centre has maintained that there are clusters of cases and there are pockets of localised transmission. India's Covid-19 tally mounted to 74,94,551 on Sunday with 61,871 fresh cases reported in a day, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 1,14,031 with 1,033 more people succumbing to it in a span of 24 hours, health ministry's data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-community-transmission-limited-to-certain-districts-not-happening-across-country-harsh-vardhan-903730.html

As per the data released by the Union Ministry of Power, power consumption in the country was recorded at 49.67 BU during October 1-15 last year. Last year, in the entire month of October, power consumption stood at 97.84 BU. The officials in the Power Ministry attribute increased economic activities for the rising demand for electricity. Though electricity demand declined sharply after March 25 lockdown, imposed to check the spread of Covid-19, it started going up from April 20 onwards, as the government started easing restrictions. The Covid-19 hit power consumption severely for six months from March to August this year, said an official in the Ministry of Power. Power consumption on a year-on-year basis declined 8.7 per cent in March, 23.2 per cent in April, 14.9 per cent in May, 10.9 per cent in June, 3.7 per cent in July and 1.7 per cent in August. After a gap of six months, power consumption recorded a growth of 4.6 per cent in September this year at 112.43 BU from 107.51 BU in the same month last year. Earlier this month, Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh also said, "In September, our power demand was higher than September 2019. So the growth started again. Despite the fact that Covid problem lingers, the growth in our power consumption and demand has started." Peak power demand met, the highest supply of power in the country in a day, during October 1 to 15 was recorded at 170.04 GW (recorded on October 7 and 8). Peak power demand met for the month of October last year stood at 164.25 GW (recorded on October 14, 2019). Peak power demand met had recorded negative growth from March to August. “The peak demand and the energy requirement had dropped by around 23-24 per cent in the month of April 2020 compared to April 2019 due to the effect of the Covid pandemic,” Singh had said earlier.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/in-a-sign-of-increasing-economic-activity-indias-power-consumption-rises-1145-in-first-half-of-october-903733.html

The Centre had in August constituted the National Council for Transgender Persons (NCTP) to formulate policies, programmes, draft legislation and projects regarding members of the community for achieving equality and full participation by them. The first meeting of the NCTP was held through video conference on Thursday. It was chaired by Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot. Meera Parida, a member of the transgender community, representing the east region in the council, said discussions were held on various issues faced by the community in the hour-long meeting. "Discussions were also held on introducing a transgender identity card that will link with them the social welfare schemes for the community. There will be a transgender identity card which will be linked to social welfare schemes. The plan has not been finalised yet but deliberations were held on the identity card," Parida told PTI. Parida, the BJD's Odisha state secretary, further said making such a card is one of the demands of the community and it will help in their upliftment. "India is the first country which has taken such a step to form a department and a council for the community. The government is taking the transgender community forward and trying its best to remove the social stigma associated with the community members," Parida said. The council was established in August by the Centre in exercise of the powers conferred by the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. According to the Act, the functions of the council include advising the Centre on the formulation of policies, programmes, legislation and projects with respect to transgender persons; monitoring and evaluating the impact of policies and programmes designed for achieving equality and full participation of transgender persons. The other functions of the council are to review and coordinate the activities of all the departments of government and other governmental and non-governmental organisations dealing with matters relating to transgender persons, to redress the grievances of transgender persons, and to perform such other functions as may be prescribed by the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-mulls-over-making-special-cards-for-transgender-community-to-link-them-to-welfare-schemes-903741.html

Here are the top stories of October 18, 2020: Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said that there is no evidence that can validate claims on global multiple focal points for the Covid-19 outbreak, amid China claiming that the coronavirus broke out simultaneously in several countries last year. During an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode of "Sunday Samvaad", Vardhan said that the reported outbreak of Covid-19 from Wuhan in China remains recognised as the first report worldwide. Vardhan further said that as yet, no mutation of the coronavirus has been detected in India, which is either more transmission efficient or more pathogenic. The number of new coronavirus cases and deaths have declined in the last three weeks as the spread of the pandemic has stabilised in most of the states, Niti Aayog Member V K Paul said on Sunday but did not rule out the possibility of a second wave of infections in the winter season. Paul, who is also the chief of expert coordinating efforts to tackle the pandemic in the country, in an interview to PTI, said that once the Covid-19 vaccine is available, there will be enough resources to deliver as well as make it accessible to the citizens. A naval version of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was successfully test fired from an indigenously built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian Sea on Sunday, officials said. The missile was fired from INS Chennai, a stealth destroyer, and it hit the target with pinpoint accuracy after performing "extremely complex" manoeuvres, they said. Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan on Sunday downplayed the BJP's recent attacks on him, claiming that it was only following the "coalition dharma" as an ally of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. With the BJP working overtime to dispel the impression of having any tacit understanding with the LJP, Paswan claimed that Kumar has been trying to create distance between the saffron party and him. He said the thrust of Kumar's campaign has been on showing a distance between Modi and him. Facing the daunting task of taking on a three-time sitting MLA, Congress candidate from Bihar's Bankipur Luv Sinha on Sunday said he has decided to fight an "uphill battle" on his political debut by challenging the BJP in its bastion in order to prove his mettle. The son of Bollywood superstar and former Union minister Shatrughan Sinha, Luv Sinha also said he is not contesting from the Bankipur assembly seat that falls in the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha segment to avenge his father's defeat from there in the 2019 general elections. He asserted that he was fighting for the welfare of the people of Patna. The Central Crime Branch has told the High Court that it has found incriminating evidence in Aditya Alva’s house in the drugs case. In the statement of objections filed in response to Aditya’s petition, CCB said it found MDMA pills, marijuana and other materials while searching his house in September. The court posted the matter for November 13. The flood situation remained grim on Sunday in four districts of Karnataka with Krishna and Bhima rivers in spate as the Army, the national and state disaster response forces undertook rescue work, evacuating hundreds of marooned people, officials said. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said many villages in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Yadgir and Raichur districts were either completely or partially submerged due to floods caused by heavy rains last week and he would undertake an aerial survey of the affected areas on October 21.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-no-covid-19-mutation-detected-in-india-says-vardhan-india-test-fires-brahmos-cruise-missile-903754.html

The eighth edition of the annual SLINEX exercise will feature a series of complex drills including surface and anti-air weapon firings and cross deck flying operations with an aim to further fine-tune the "high degree" of inter-operability between the two navies, they said. The Indian Navy will deploy anti-submarine warfare corvettes INS Kamorta and INS Kiltan as well as a sizeable number of advanced light helicopters, Chetak helicopter and Dornier maritime patrol aircraft in the exercise, the officials said. The Sri Lanka Navy will be represented by offshore patrol vessel Sayura and training ship Gajabahu. The previous edition of SLINEX was conducted off Visakhapatnam in September 2019. "SLINEX series of exercise exemplifies the deep engagement between India and Sri Lanka which has strengthened mutual cooperation in the maritime domain," an Indian Navy spokesperson said. "Interaction between the two navies has also grown significantly in recent years, in consonance with India’s policy of ‘Neighbourhood First’ and the prime minister's vision of Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR)," he said. The Indian Navy has participated in a number of joint maritime exercises in the last few weeks including a three-day drill with Japanese navy from September 26-28. Last month, Indian Navy also carried out a two-day mega exercise in the Indian Ocean Region with the Australian Navy that featured a range of complex naval manoeuvres, anti-aircraft drills and helicopter operations. In July, the Indian Navy carried out a military exercise with a US Navy carrier strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship. India has significantly expanded its deployment in the Indian Ocean Region with a plethora of warships and submarines following its border row with China in eastern Ladakh, ostensibly to send across a message to Beijing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-sri-lankan-navies-to-carry-out-3-day-military-drill-beginning-october-19-903781.html

The accused identified as Munnalal Mavasi, hails from Satna district in Madhya Pradesh. The 49-year-old man is a graduate and worked as veterinary doctor in his village and later joined an International Marketing Corporation (IMC), they said. To earn a quick buck, he along with his accomplices started cheating people by creating their fake profiles on Facebook and asking money from their friends and family, citing an emergency, police said. The two mobile phones used by him to create fake IDs on Facebook has been recovered, a police officer said. According to police, the matter came to light on September 26 after an IPS officer lodged a complaint at Lodhi Colony police station, alleging that someone had created his fake account on Facebook, using his name, photo and other details. He alleged that the accused also asked his friend to send him money, citing emergency.  During investigation, the details of the Facebook account were verified and with the help of technical surveillance, location of the accused was zeroed in to Satna, Madhya Pradesh, said Atul Kumar Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South). "A police team was sent to Satna from where the accused was arrested. During questioning, he first tried to mislead the police but finally broke down and confessed to his crime. He also disclosed that he invested the cheated money in hotel business," he said, adding that till now he had created three to four fake IDs. As per his preliminary account statement, there is approximately Rs 44,000 of suspicious transactions and it is being investigated to get more details, the DCP said. The officer said they are also looking to nab his associates who were part of his racket.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/man-held-for-duping-people-including-ips-officer-by-creating-fake-ids-on-facebook-903787.html
18-10-2020||National||Delhi's air quality 'poor' as neighbouring states report season's highest farm fire count for a day||The national capital's air quality was recorded in the "poor" category on Sunday, with a central government agency reporting 1,230 farm fires in neighbouring states – the maximum in a day so far this season. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution stood at 17 per cent.  It was 19 per cent on Saturday, 18 per cent on Friday, around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday. The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 254. It was 287 on Saturday, 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320). An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. During the daytime, winds are blowing from the northwest, bringing pollutants from farm fires. At night, calm winds and low temperatures are allowing the accumulation of pollutants, according to an India Meteorological Department official. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the farm fire count around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring border regions was 1,230 on Saturday, the maximum in a day so far this season. The share of farm fires in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration stood at 17 per cent. "Though fire emission has increased and transport-level wind direction is also favourable, an increase in transport-level wind speed as well as local surface winds in Delhi are likely to keep the stubble contribution in Delhi's PM2.5 around the same level," it said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index, a product of mixing depth and average wind speed, was 11,500 metre square per second on Sunday which is favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with an average wind speed of less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersal of pollutants. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the impact of stubble burning is "restricted because of better mixing height and ventilation", but it is likely to rise by Monday. Earlier in the day, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the pollution problem cannot be resolved in a day and continuous efforts are needed to tackle each of the contributing factors. Interacting with people during a Facebook Live event, he said the major factors behind air pollution in the country are traffic, industries, waste, dust, stubble, geography and meteorology. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been "extremely unfavourable" for the dispersion of pollutants since September as compared to last year. With less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped there will be fewer stubble burning incidents this year as compared to 2019. Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it. Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to the early harvesting of paddy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhis-air-quality-poor-as-neighbouring-states-report-seasons-highest-farm-fire-count-for-a-day-903788.html

Besides, e-catering will also remain for the supply of food, said an official in the railways. At present, around 350 pairs of trains, including Mail/Express, Superfast and Premier services, have pantry cars, which prepare hot food for passengers. The railways is expecting that by replacing pantry cars with AC-3 tire, it can earn additional Rs 1,400 crore revenue. It is also planning to do away with the supplying of blankets, pillows, bedsheets, and hand towels in the post-Covid journey. Instead, it plans to supply disposable linen on payment basis at station premises. At present the railways, which runs only special trains, is not operating onboard pantry cars service and also not supplying lenin, to prevent the spreading of Covid-19. Interestingly, the suggestion to replace pantry cars with AC coaches came from two railway unions, the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen and All India Railwaymen's Federation. Accepting the suggestion, the Railway Ministry top brass were also of the opinion that pantry car catering services can be replaced by e-catering, base kitchens, train-side vending, static catering units at stations en route. "Already IRCTC (Indian Railways Catering Touring Corporation), which is responsible for catering in railways, already set up several base kitchens. In future also it will set more kitchens in different places and supply hot cooked packed food to passengers," said an official. Since the pantry cars are operated by private contractors, there was no impact on railways jobs, said the official. However, private pantry car contractors fear that the removal of pantry cars may hit around 10,000 to 13,000 jobs as each pantry car engages 30 to 40 staff.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-do-away-with-pantry-cars-903796.html

Dr Harsh Vardhan said the late stage trial generally involves thousands of participants, sometimes 30,000 to 40,000. Of the vaccines currently in Phase 3 trials, all are administered by injection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). On Saturday, India's Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said they have received renewed approval to conduct late-stage clinical trials in India of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine. India's coronavirus infections rose by another 61,871 over the past 24 hours, data released on Sunday showed, although the health ministry said it is seeing a trend of steadily declining active cases. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it will revisit its protocol for Covid-19 treatment after the WHO found some of the commonly used drugs, including remdesivir, had little or no impact on a patient's chances of surviving, local media reported earlier on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-bharat-biotech-to-begin-trial-of-intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-soon-903813.html

This is a forecast from a disease prediction model being run by a professor at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, who is tracking the pandemic from the very beginning on the basis of the epidemic’s R value – a parameter to measure how quickly the infection spreads (R is the number of persons one infected person can spread the infection to). An R value of 1.9 means that 10 infected persons will on average cause 19 new infections). The good news is R value is not only less than one for the country as a whole but it is below one and continuously declining for Maharashtra – the state with the maximum number of cases and the highest caseload. Even Karnataka has managed to bring down the R value below one in the last few days. But the eastern state with a rising R value is a worry. "West Bengal continues to have R more than one. Currently, it is the only state apart from Kerala in the top 12 states with R value greater than one. More worryingly, over the past week R has actually marginally increased to 1.07 (from 1.05 the week before that). While this may look like a very small increase, it will result in the active cases increasing exponentially which will soon make these numbers enormous,” IMSc scientist Sitabhra Sinha who is running the model told DH. “Coming at the heels of the festival when presumably people will be in public places in large numbers, this is alarming." The risk is much more in Kolkata, which reports R value of 1.11 at the moment. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan too flagged the risks. "In different pockets across various states, including West Bengal, community transmission of Covid-19 is expected to occur, especially in densely-populated areas.” "However, this is not happening across the country. Community transmission is limited to certain districts, occurring in a limited number of states," he said.  In addition, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh too are among the states that are at an increased risk. The three are among the five states – other two being Kerala and Karnataka – where central teams were sent earlier this week to beef up the containment, disease surveillance, infection prevention and clinical management efforts undertaken by the state governments. With 1,033 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours, India’s Covid-19 toll is 1,14,031 on Sunday. The number of active cases now stands at 7.83 lakhs, out of which 61,871 were added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/durga-puja-woes-rise-on-covid-19-front-as-daily-death-toll-crosses-1000-mark-again-903816.html

Besides reviewing the security challenges facing the nation, the Army commanders will attempt to finalise various reform measures recommended by separate internal committees in utilisation of resources while at the same time focusing on enhancing the operational capability of the 1.3-million-strong force, they said. The conference will be chaired by Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane and all top commanders will attend it, the sources said. Some of the proposals to be on the table at the conference include discontinuing or at least bringing down the scale of the Army Day and Territorial Army Day parades, cutting down on various ceremonial practices, and reducing the number of officers’ mess within individual peace stations, the sources said. Similarly, the top Army brass will also examine a proposal to bring down the number of guards at official residences of senior officials and another one on reducing the number of CSD canteens if several such facilities are operating within one station, they said. Another proposal on the table for discussion would be to ask various units to cut costs on celebrating Raising Day and Battle Honour Day. "These proposals have been part of overall reform initiatives in the Army. The proposals are based on several internal studies conducted by separate panels in the last few years to suggest reform in the force," said an official. "The key idea behind the proposals is to ensure efficient use of scarce resources. The exercise is aimed at ensuring the rational distribution of resources," he said. A number of other proposals will also be discussed at the commanders' conference under the transformative reforms being implemented to make the force leaner and meaner as well as to enhance its combat capabilities. Last year, the government approved the first batch of reforms in the Army which include the relocation of 229 officers from the Army headquarters, creation of a new post of deputy chief for military operations, and strategic planning. The defence ministry has already approved the creation of a new information warfare wing in keeping the needs of the future battlefield, hybrid warfare, and social media reality. The Army headquarters had instituted four studies with an aim to boost the operational and functional efficiency of the force, optimise budget expenditure, and to facilitate the modernisation process. The first study on 're-organisation and right-sizing of the Indian Army' was focused on the operational structures to make the force efficient and future-ready by taking into account the operational situation on western and northern borders. The commanders will also extensively deliberate on the situation in eastern Ladakh, where the armies of India and China have been locked in a military standoff for over five months. Both sides have held multiple rounds of talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved so far. The commanders are also expected to review the overall security scenario in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-army-commanders-to-deliberate-on-long-pending-reforms-eastern-ladakh-situation-on-october-26-903826.html

A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi rejected the plea of the additional district judge, saying that he can raise the ground of bias even after the inquiry against him gets over. “We are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the high court. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of accordingly. "However, the high court is requested to finally dispose of the writ petition when the matter is listed on October 31, along with amendment application,” the bench said in its recent order. Senior advocate P S Patwalia, who appeared for the petitioner along with advocate Sachin Sharma, argued that his client has an outstanding record and these allegations were levelled to embarrass him. He claimed that a day after his plea for a change of inquiry officer was taken up for hearing by the high court, the inquiry officer had closed the defence and started proceedings ex-parte. The bench said that it will not interfere with the inquiry but can ask the high court to decide on the plea and pass the order. “If you have a good case on bias, you will succeed. You can argue on the point of bias, even after the inquiry gets over”, the bench said. The additional district judge in his plea has contended that the inquiry officer, who is a sitting judge of the high court, is also a member of the committee that had recommended disciplinary inquiry against him, and any exercise so conducted cannot be said to be fair. He claimed that the high court on October 8, without considering the facts and circumstances of the case, by a non-speaking order gave a prima facie finding that it was too late for making the allegation of bias against the presiding officer and had rejected the stay application. “That it is a gross case of violation of the principle of natural justice wherein the petitioner, who is a member of Higher Judicial Service, imparted justice without any spot on his career for the last 16 years, having outstanding ACR throughout, is now himself rattling for the justice,” his plea said. The plea sought a stay on the order of the high court as well as on the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner. The plea said that in 2017, the petitioner was transferred from the post of registrar of the Uttarakhand High Court and was posted as First Additional District Judge and Session Judge, Haridwar. It said that on February 1, 2018, the complainant was directed to join/attach with the officer of the petitioner as a contractual employee and just after working for two days on February 1 and 2, he was directed to join at some other place. To the shock and surprise of the petitioner, he was informed after being suspended and charge-sheeted that the contractual employee had made a "false and frivolous complaint, dated March 19, 2018, to the district Judge Haridwar, alleging therein that the petitioner had tried to take undue advantage and sexually harassed him on February 1 and 2”. The plea contended that "this bare fact itself shows that complainant was planted by someone having grudges against the petitioner to defame/disable him from performing his official duties”. The petition claimed that the complainant and his mother, in their cross-examination conducted before the Inquiry Officer, had admitted that they filed the complaint dated March 19, 2018 only because they were promised that the complainant's job will be regularized. “Hence, the entire disciplinary proceeding is nothing but a gross abuse of process of law,” it said, adding that on September 21, the inquiry officer had even refused to allow the complainant to withdraw his complaint. The plea also said that the inquiry officer had dismissed the recusal application dated September 21 filed by the petitioner.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-uttarakhand-high-court-order-on-harassment-inquiry-against-judicial-officer-903832.html

The Union minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office was speaking after laying the foundation stone of a new education complex named after Pandit Madam Mohan Malviya at the Central University, Jammu. "With the constitutional changes that took place after August 5, 2019, it is hoped that the biggest impediment in attracting the best of faculty from across the country for these educational institutions will be overcome," the minister said. He said the standard of any institution can be maintained only when there is total professionalism and no compromise in the selection of scholars, and when the institution is ready to facilitate and incentivise the best of the faculty to take up teaching assignments.  Singh also noted that through the Department of Space, of which he is in-charge, north India's first Space and Research Study Centre has been started at Central University Jammu and K Radhakrishnan, a renowned space scientist who is also known as the father of Mars Mission, has been appointed as the advisor.  The Union minister said the DoPT (Department of Personnel and Training), which is also under his charge, is working out the feasibility of setting up the first of its kind Study Centre of Governance at Central University, Jammu. "For any educational institution to receive a wider recognition and identity, there are essentially two prerequisites.  Either there should be an extraordinary faculty which can produce research publications of international level or there should be exclusive departments of study which are not easily available," he said.  This is one of the first central universities in the country to have such an educational complex named after Malviya, who along with Syama Prasad Mookerjee, was among the leading academicians of the first half of 20th century but, he said, their contribution somehow did not receive the amount of recognition that it deserved. Singh added that this was a befitting tribute to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jammu-and-kashmir-emerges-as-north-indias-education-hub-union-minister-903837.html

He was in Nashik to take a review of the coronavirus situation in the district. "The rains have caused a lot of damage in the state and farmers should be given immediate assistance. If the state coffers are empty, compensate the farmers for crop damage by borrowing a loan," Athawale said in a press conference. Heavy rains and floods earlier this week have claimed at least 48 lives in Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions, while crops on lakhs of hectares have been damaged. Athawale criticised Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for "not taking any decision" on reopening temples and other religious places "due to the pressure by ruling allies Congress and NCP". "The government should respect the public sentiments and places of worship of all religions in the state should reopen under police protection," he said.

18-10-2020||National Politics||From Congress culture to BJP ‘maryada’: New lessons for Jyotiraditya Scindia||‘Shrimant’ Jyotiraditya Scindia, the head of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family, and newly-minted BJP leader is having to learn how the party hierarchy works at the age of 49. In the BJP, which he joined just as the Covid-19 pandemic was gaining ground in March this year, the Scindia name does not automatically spell prominence the way it used to in the Congress. At least not yet. So, in a list of 30-star campaigners for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly bypolls, Scindia only makes a belated entry at No. 10. Not just that, on election campaign vans, or ‘raths’ as the BJP calls them, there are photos of Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan, state BJP chief V D Sharma, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President J P Nadda. But Scindia’s face is conspicuously missing—an embarrassing fact that his former party has gleefully turned into a campaign issue. Clearly, gone are the days when Scindia could be spoken of as one of Madhya Pradesh’s biggest leaders, along with his rivals in the Congress, Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh. Ever since his crossover, Scindia has been doing the rounds of BJP offices in Bhopal and elsewhere in the districts of the Gwalior-Chambal region, where assembly by-elections are due. But by all indications, he is being sanguine about it. Much rides for him personally on the outcome of the 28 bypolls scheduled for November 3. Elections are being held in areas where he is considered an unquestioned satrap and where his supporters won a bulk of the seats in the 2018 Assembly polls. Now he has to make sure that they repeat the feat. Scindia’s exit, along with 22 MLAs loyal to him, sent shockwaves through the Congress. It plunged the Kamal Nath government into crisis and brought the three-term BJP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan back to power. The whole development was carefully plotted by the BJP. Now the BJP needs to win at least nine seats to ensure it continues to rule the state. For Congress, it is a tall task to make this election count in more than a symbolic way since it has to win all the seats to topple the Chouhan government. That said, it’s no walkover for the BJP either. Having decided to field 25 turncoats as its candidates, it has earned the wrath of the old cadre. For Scindia, it goes beyond mere win and loss. There is personal and family pride at stake. Congress leaders have been hurling abuses at him calling him ‘gaddar’, ‘be-imaan’ and ‘Shri-ant’ as opposed to the ‘Shrimant’, as he is referred to in the Gwalior region. In the Congress party, he was seen as part of the Gandhi family coterie, given his proximity to Rahul Gandhi. In the BJP, he is banking on his own family name to emerge as a serious contender in the state. Scindia’s switch has brought the entire Gwalior royal family into the BJP camp. CM Chouhan hailed this development while paying tributes to the late Vijayaraje Scindia—a key patron of the RSS, Jana Sangh and the BJP—on her birth centenary recently. A united Scindia clan under the BJP umbrella has seen the Congress launch sharp attacks on the erstwhile royals, which was unthinkable in the past. Congress leaders have not failed to visit the memorial of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi in Gwalior and to recall the proximity of the Scindia dynasty to the British. The Congress has even described the rebel MLAs now in the BJP camp as ‘Jaichands’, after the 12th-century Rajput ruler who is known to have betrayed Prithviraj Chauhan. Jyotiraditya Scindia has been considered a frontrunner for a seat in the Modi government since he walked into the BJP. But he will know that the long road to Delhi passes through Gwalior-Chambal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/from-congress-culture-to-bjp-maryada-new-lessons-for-jyotiraditya-scindia-903507.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||BJP’s expansionist ambitions drive away alliance partners: Is BJP growing too big for its own good?||Alone, aloof, and sometimes arrogant: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has antagonised ally after ally over the last six years, and seems set to continue on this path as it dreams of national dominance. But could it be setting itself up for problems in the next general elections in 2024? After the recent death of Ram Vilas Paswan of the Lok Janashakti Party (LJP) and the resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in September, the Narendra Modi government does not have a single minister of Cabinet rank from the alliance partners, and just one minister of state, Ramdas Athawale. The BJP has also parted ways, for one reason or the other, with the Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, and even ideological twin Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Smaller parties that felt slighted and voted with their feet include the Raju Shetty-led Shetkari Swahbimani Sangathana in Maharashtra, Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) in Bihar and Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP). In Bihar, which goes to the polls in a couple of weeks, two of its allies, Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) (JDU) and LJP are locked in a bitter fight and the BJP will have to choose between them at the national level in the medium-term, meaning one more exit is on the cards. It wasn’t always like this. When Modi came to power in 2014, the BJP had no fewer than 29 allies (14 now); the BJP’s first proper tryst with power, under the well-liked Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was a hydra-headed coalition. Most of the 23 allies from the Vajpayee-Advani era stuck with the party even when it was out of power for a decade starting 2004. But the party now is all-powerful: It has 302 seats in the Lok Sabha compared with 182 when Vajpayee formed a government in 1999. And the Opposition has been decimated. The BJP clearly knows it is top dog, and allies are expendable. BJP and its allies “BJP has now become the Congress of the sixties and seventies in its Parliamentary strength and nationwide reach. With its expansion, the allies who contributed to its growth have become worried,” says political analyst Rasheed Kidwai, noting that the Shiv Sena fights for the same space as the BJP in Maharashtra. “The party has to choose between expanding further or stagnating at its present strength. The natural choice is its ultimately risking the wrath of allies and charting its own course.” While the BJP can now stand on its own in Maharashtra, UP and Bihar, it cannot deny that social coalitions with regional parties contributed substantially to its strength and the break-ups will hurt. The party was edged out of power in Maharashtra by its ally; in Punjab, it piggy-backed the Akalis to power, even if it eventually lost due to the SAD’s unpopularity. Now, SAD appears to be inching closer to the Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati, a good idea in a state with a 30% Scheduled Caste population. It’s worth remembering that two years ago, SAD, along with the JDU, had made a pitch for better coordination in the NDA, pointing out bitterly that “regional parties that played a crucial role in the BJP’s victory in 2014 are now being ignored.” The oldest ally, the Shiv Sena, had, soon after the formation of the first Modi government in 2014, demanded setting up of a NDA Coordination Committee. This never happened. Indeed, there has been no convenor of the NDA since Modi came to power. The more conciliatory Vajpayee era had convenors from non-BJP parties, but Chandrababu Naidu’s interest in the job was ignored by Modi. Says Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut: “BJP will lose at least at least 100 Lok Sabha seats in 2024 if it fights minus any alliance with regional parties. Bear in mind that the BJP grew in states piggy-backing on regional parties. There is no NDA left now; JDU has been more like a paying guest.” Ironically the JDU-type alliance is one that stands the best chance of survival, even if some see a BJP design behind the LJP walking out of the alliance and putting up candidates against the JDU. Says noted social scientist Shaibal Gupta of the Bihar situation: “Here the alliance is of parties which bring together diverse support bases. They are not competing for the same space. The BJP can afford to be contemptuous (of allies) in places where they stand on their own feet.” In UP, the saffron party has made substantial inroads among non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Scheduled Castes, a space that NDA allies Apna Dal and Rajbhar’s SBSP had been claiming. And the BJP’s mentor, the RSS, has tried to cosy up to Scheduled Castes, setting alarm bells ringing for Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party, which was quick to snap ties and consolidate its own position. The fact that some dumped allies have fared badly could also reinforce the BJP’s sense that the allies need it more than it needs them: the Telegu Desam was decimated in the Andhra Pradesh assembly polls in 2019, while the RLSP and SBSP bombed in the Lok Sabha polls. The coming tests are in two states where the party has little presence: Bengal and Tamil Nadu. In Bengal, it can probably polarise its way to a strong showing, but its Hindi-Hindu-Hindutva mantra has little resonance in Tamil country, where it will have to woo the AIADMK. In a sense, the BJP there is like it was in other states before it grew into the monster it now is: a junior partner waiting for its own time in the sun. The regional party lost a chunk of minority votes in civic body elections last year due to its dalliance with the BJP so it has reason to tread carefully. Under its former president Amit Shah, the BJP showed admirable sagacity in wooing back allies when it mattered, such as the JDU, which had quit the NDA in 2013, and the Asom Gana Parishad, which had walked out briefly just before the 2019 elections. Some smaller parties in Bihar have also come back. Kidwai calls this tussle of BJP with regional parties a “cyclical phenomenon” of Indian democracy. “The Jana Sangh and many smaller parties came together to defeat Congress when it was a colossus. Now BJP is so big that the same parties which worked shoulder-to-shoulder with it are uncomfortable. So one pretext or the other, they are trying to find their own independent space. We may see some kind of gathering of smaller parties around Congress in 2024.” Even a behemoth like the BJP will have to realise that it needs friends. A sinking economy and burgeoning Covid case numbers suggest that anti-incumbency could be a big factor in every poll from here, notwithstanding Modi’s personal popularity. In 2019, the party may have struggled much more if the attack on Pulwama hadn’t happened; it would do well to keep its allies, and potential enemies, close.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-s-expansionist-ambitions-drive-away-alliance-partners-is-bjp-growing-too-big-for-its-own-good-903508.html

"How it started: 'Beti Bachao' (Save Daughters). How it’s going: 'Apradhi Bachao' (Save Criminals)'," tweeted Rahul Gandhi. Tagging a news report on the issue, Priyanka tweeted in Hindi, "Will the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister tell that this is happening under which 'mission'? 'Beti bachao' (Save Daughters) or 'Apradhi Bachao' (Save Criminals)?" The party has been attacking the UP government under Yogi Adityanath on the issue of rise in crime against women. It had organised protests and had been targeting the government particularly over the Hathras case in which a 19-year-old girl was gang-raped and murdered allegedly by four men.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-priyanka-gandhi-slam-up-govt-over-issue-safety-of-women-in-state-903604.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||Shiv Sena welcomes Amit Shah's stand on Governor-Chief Minister letter row||A day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah slammed Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government expressed its satisfaction over the Centre’s response. Koshyari's letter to Thackeray and the contents on the issue of re-opening of temples has rattled the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that Shah was the country’s Home Minister and spoke with responsibility and caution. Besides, Raj Bhavan and the office of Governor was a Constitutional post and fell under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs. “The Governor’s letter followed by the Chief Minister’s reply was an unavoidable controversy and we haven’t started it. But we are satisfied with the Union Home Minister’s stand and thank him for understanding the reason for our anger,’’ Raut said. “I have read your letter. He has made a passing reference. I believe some restraint could have been exercised,” Shah had said in a TV interview, to a question on the controversy. While Koshyari questioned whether Thackeray has left Hindutva to turn “secular”, the latter shot back saying that he does not need a “certificate” from the Governor on secularism. In a letter to Uddhav, the Governor said, "You have been a strong votary of Hindutva.  You have publicly espoused your devotion to Lord Rama by visiting Ayodhya after taking charge as Chief Minister. You visited Vitthal Rukmini Mandir in Pandharpur and performed the puja on Ashadi Ekadashi….I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turn ‘secular’ yourself, the term you hated.” In response, Thackeray had said, “I don’t need a certificate on Hindutva from anybody, nor do I have to learn it from anyone. Those giving a warm welcome to people who compare my state and its capital (Mumbai) with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir don’t fit in my Hindutva.” A couple of days ago, Raut had said, “A governor is a political agent of the President of India and the central government; a political agent in the sense that they do political work. Today, there are only two governors in the entire country -- one in Maharashtra and one in West Bengal. I do not know about the rest. Because in these two states, the government is of their opposition parties.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-welcomes-amit-shahs-stand-on-governor-chief-minister-letter-row-903701.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||Shashi Tharoor's remarks at Lahore event spark BJP-Congress spat||The BJP and the Congress were engaged in a war of words on Sunday over MP Shashi Tharoor's remarks at a Lahore event, as the ruling party accused him of "demeaning and discrediting" India and wondered if Rahul Gandhi wanted to contest elections in Pakistan. Hitting back, the opposition party said the BJP has always responded to substance and facts with "jumlebaazi" (rhetoric). The BJP attacked Tharoor after he posted a link to the comments made online at Lahore Think Fest, which his office said was held last month, in which he criticised the Modi government's handling of the coronavirus and also spoke of alleged "bigotry and prejudice" against Muslims during the pandemic. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters that it was "unbelievable" that a senior Congress leader and an MP like Tharoor can make such comments against India at a Pakistani forum. "He has demeaned India and projected the country in dim light," Patra said. Referring to Tharoor's remarks that Rahul Gandhi had warned about the severity of the Covid-19 as early as in February and that he should be getting credit for it, Patra claimed that the Kerala MP was a close friend of the former Congress president and wondered if Gandhi wanted to get credit in Pakistan and contest polls there. He is already a "hero" in China and Pakistan, Patra alleged. At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said such reactions from the ruling party "ridicule" the debate and "diminish us as a democracy". "The BJP has always responded to substance and pointed facts with 'jumlebaazi'. The BJP has always believed in rhetoric, not substance. "Yes, it does sometimes catch you by the eyeballs or the earbuds when you hear it, but, within seconds, logic takes over and tells you how empty a rhetoric the BJP is indulging in," he said. If somebody is praising a particular achievement or pointing to a particular area of activity "in which you are laggard in India, and asking such a person to stand for elections from Pakistan is to ridicule the debate and diminish us as a democracy", he said. "All that is being done is to point out that you are far stronger, far bigger, far more capable country, and yet you should not be lagging behind in this parameter," the Congress spokesperson added. Patra asserted that the Union government had imposed a timely lockdown and noted that India has a high recovery rate and a very low mortality rate in the world, as he lauded its handling of the pandemic. He also referred to Tharoor's comments about Indian citizens from the Northeast at times facing problems elsewhere in the country to target the Congress. "What was the need to discuss such matters at a Pakistani forum? There is no country in this world as democratic and just as India," he said. Patra referred to various remarks made by Congress leaders in the past that allegedly targeted the Modi government at events in Pakistan and asked if the opposition party members have ever asked Pakistan at its forum about its "bigotry and violence" against minorities in that country. In a swipe at Gandhi, Patra said he and the BJP will now call him "Rahul Lahori". Singhvi, in his reaction, also noted the recent debate about the possibility of Bangladesh taking over India in terms of per capita GDP and asked if the right response to it is that he should stand for elections from Dhaka and not be in the Indian Parliament. "These responses might have short-lived, few seconds of utility but they actually show the hollowness of your intellectual ability to deal in areas where you are a complete failure," he said, targeting the BJP. In the event, Tharoor was asked by a Pakistani journalist as to how the political fortune of the Indian government was impacted by the rising Covid numbers. He said it was paradoxical as the government was "not doing well" in dealing with the pandemic and people realise that, but polls suggest that it has not hurt the BJP politically as it should. "So we in the opposition do point out, for example, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had mentioned as early as February that Covid had to be taken more seriously than the government was taking it and preventive measures needed to be put in place immediately otherwise we would face both a health disaster and an economic catastrophe if this was allowed to run unchecked. "So he ought to be getting credit for having signalled this early on...," Tharoor said. He also said there was a contrast between the way the Covid numbers have worked out in the two countries, India and Pakistan, but the fate of the leadership has not gone in the same contrasting way. "Both seem to be doing rather well in the public eye, which, to some of us in the opposition in India, is still a bit of a mystery, but we don't discuss that outside India. We fight our battles at home," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shashi-tharoors-remarks-at-lahore-event-spark-bjp-congress-spat-903736.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi launch joint poll campaign; hit out at Lalu Prasad Yadav||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi held joint election campaign on Sunday and launched a blistering attack on rival Lalu Prasad highlighting the crime situation and lack of development during his RJD rule in the past. Reeling out comparative data during 15 years under the RJD and an equal period under the NDA now, the two leaders sought another chance from voters to speed up development work in the state in the next five years. The two started the day with a public meeting at Buxar, where BJP has fielded Parshuram Chaturvedi as its candidate. He is pitted against sitting MLA Sanjay Kumar Tiwari of the Congress. This was the constituency from where former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who took VRS and joined JD(U), was expected to enter the poll fray, but the seat went to ally BJP under the seat-sharing deal. After launching separate campaign since the beginning of this week, Kumar and Sushil Modi moved together on Sunday and sought support for BJP as well as JD(U) nominees on four seats of Buxar, Dumraon, Tarari and Jagdishpur. In the Buxar rally, former state police chief and JD(U) leader Gupteshwar Pandey was not present. But, the BJP nominee Parshuram Chaturvedi, said he enjoys his support and blessings. Chaturvedi himself had taken premature retirement as Assistant Sub Inspector in the Bihar police in 2003 and joined politics. "Gupteshwar Pandey is not only my boss in the police but also an elder brother to whom I touch feet out of respect and he has always shower blessings on me," Chaturvedi told PTI. Both the CM and Sushil Modi kept their focus on the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and highlighted the condition prevailing in the state from 1990 to 2005 which both described as "jungle raj". "What was the condition of law and order at that time. People were afraid to step out of home after sunset. We ended 'jungle raj' and established 'rule of law'," Kumar said at the Buxar rally. Both referred to corruption prevailing during the RJD regime and Prasad himself indulging in corrupt practices. "Those involved in self service are behind the bars today and many more will follow them soon," Kumar said. Prasad is in Ranchi jail after being convicted in four cases of multi-crore rupees fodder scam. While Kumar highlighted "inexperience" of the opposition chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, though he did not name him, and accused him of making "anap-sanap" (illogical) statements against him to get "publicity", Sushil Modi was more severe in criticising him. "See a man who failed in class 9th and has no history of any family business is today owner of 52 properties at an age of 31. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has long innings as chief minister of Gujarat and PM for last six years, is no match to him financially," Sushil Modi said in an apparent jibe at Tejashwi Yadav. Sushil Modi praised the Nitish Kumar ministry for effectively dealing with the Covid pandemic in Bihar and hit out at the Maharashtra government in which Congress is one of the partners for doing precious little in this regard. "More than 40,000 people lost their lives due to coronavirus in Maharashtra where Congress is part of the ruling dispensation. Whereas in Bihar the NDA government by making proper arrangements has minimised the death toll to less than 1000 so far," Sushil Modi, who is a senior BJP leader of the state, said. Kumar also made mention of high testing of samples in Bihar and over 94 per cent recovery rate of coronavirus patients in the state to drive home the point. The JD(U) president took a potshot at his bete noire, Lalu Prasad, for merely anointing wife on the chief ministerial chair but not doing anything for the upliftment of women during the RJD rule. "While the leader at that time installed wife on the chair (of CM) before going to jail but did he do anything for the welfare of the females?" he asked the crowd.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-sushil-modi-launch-joint-poll-campaign-hit-out-at-lalu-prasad-yadav-903771.html

The decision was taken at a digital meeting chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with AICC General Secretaries and state in-charges. The party’s future course of action on the anti-farmer, anti-women, anti-labour and anti-poor policies and actions of the BJP-led Central Government and State governments was discussed in the meeting, AICC General Secretary (Organisation) K C Venugopal said in a statement. The party will observe October 31, the birth anniversary of Patel and death anniversary of Indira with satyagrahas and fasts in district headquarters against anti-farmer and anti-labour laws. "It was also decided to coordinate and accelerate the month long massive signature campaign against the anti-farm laws in every state. General Secretaries and In-charges have been instructed to monitor the signature campaign on the ground level," Venugopal said. On November 5, the Congress will observe 'Mahila and Dalit Utpidan Virodhi Divas' (Stop Atrocities on Women and Dalits Day). The party will hold dharnas at every state headquarters against repeated atrocities around the country against the Dalits, particularly against the Hathras victim and her family. Protesting against the government move to sell stakes in Public Sector Units, the party has also decided to launch an online campaign "SpeakUpForPSUs" on November 14, the birth anniversary of country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, "highlighting the theme self-reliant-India built by Nehru". Keeping in mind Nehru's birth anniversary, the state units have been asked to organise symposium on 'Nehruvian Ideology and Nation building' on November 13 as Diwali falls on the next day. In this symposium, Venugopal said. the contribution of Nehruvian ideology in building a composite society and institutions that are the foundations of Modern India will be traced and deliberated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-to-observe-patels-birth-anniversary-indiras-death-anniversary-as-farmers-rights-day-903806.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||Some people malign police, administration for political gains: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, without taking names, said on Sunday that the state police and the administration -- despite toiling hard day in and day out to overcome crises -- were being maligned by some people for political gains. Banerjee, who inaugurated several Durga puja pandals here during the day, was apparently referring to BJP leaders, who had said that the police, in collusion with the government, were trying to suppress evidence in the recent cases of unnatural death of saffron camp leaders. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has also expressed concern over the law and order situation in frequent tweets, citing incidents of murder, abduction, rape and the recent custodial death of a man, who, the BJP said, was a worker of its party. Banerjee, however, said, "Some people only believe in blaming and maligning the police force and the state. "They forget the work done by the police during crisis situations, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and even at other times... If you show disrespect to someone, you will be paid back in your own coin." The CM also said if someone died of tuberculosis, "these people will point fingers towards the law and order situation of West Bengal. They will say the death was caused by (political) violence." She said such campaigns were being made to earn political brownies. Mourning the demise of a police officer, who succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday morning, Banerjee said, "Many of you ended up contracting the disease. Most recovered, while we lost others." "I am deeply pained at the loss... Please follow Covid-19 protocols while on duty, always wear a mask, use sanitisers and maintain physical distance," she said after inaugurating a pandal, set up by residents of police line at Alipore in the southern part of the city. Banerjee's remarks assume significance in the wake of the recent protests by the opposition BJP, claiming that its activists were being killed by local TMC leaders, in conspiracy with the police. Earlier in the day, Dhankhar had slammed the ruling dispensation and the police over alleged custodial death of Madan Ghorai in East Midnapore. "High time you redeem your constitutional oath and enforce rule of law, ensure democratic governance in the state, make police and administration politically neutral and accountable," Dhankhar wrote to the chief minister. Ghorai's family claimed that he died due to torture, while the police stated that the man was in judicial custody, and allegations levelled by the family and the saffron party were baseless. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in an interview to a TV channel on Saturday that "law and order have gone for a toss" in West Bengal. "And what is more worrisome...is the way opposition workers are being framed in false cases and killed. Such things don't happen in other states," he had said. Shah's claims drew sharp reaction from the TMC, which alleged that the BJP was conspiring to topple a democratically elected government. It further asserted that people in Bengal were living in peace.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/some-people-malign-police-administration-for-political-gains-west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-903818.html
18-10-2020||National Politics||Congress accuses BJP of offering inducements to MLAs in Gujarat to switch side||Days after the BJP fielded five former Congress MLAs in Gujarat by-polls, the Congress Sunday accused the saffron party of luring legislators in the state through monetary or other inducements and demanded a judicial inquiry into it. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi cited interviews of three former Congress MLAs who switched over to the BJP earlier this year after resigning as legislators, to allege the BJP had offered them monetary or other inducements to woo them to their side. They have been fielded by the saffron party in Gujarat for by-polls to their respective Assembly seats. Singhvi claimed that Akshay Patel, Pradyumnsinh Jadeja and J V Kakadiya -- who had joined the BJP in June this year after resigning from the Congress -- had purportedly accepted on camera to have been offered inducements for switching over. "The legislature, it is clear from these proofs, has become a pawn, a business plaything for the BJP, which aggressively indulges in the 3Ts -- Trading, Trafficking and Transaction-ing with MLAs and legislators," Singhvi said. Five of the eight resignees from the Congress have got tickets for the near forthcoming bypolls, he pointed out. Talking about Patel, Singhvi said, "The issue at all is not whether he accepted it or took the bribe or not. Obviously, those speaking have denied it. The issue is the true colours of the offeror, the true moral constitutional and legal level, political level at which the offeror is functioning, namely the BJP." "The true issue is about the limitless capacity of this party to offer money. I repeat- limitless capacity, matched only by their limitless greed for power by hook or by crook, more by crook, less by hook," he said. "The BJP ensures that elections that mandate, which is the constitutional, democratic mandate is actually a mandate of only 2 or 3 years, It is curtailed, interrupted, obstructed to 2-3 years by ‘A’ large sums of money, ‘B’ large number of resignation, ‘C’, re-offering of ministerships and ‘D’, offering of MLA tickets," he alleged. This is the political morality practiced by the ruling party at the Centre and in the state of Gujarat, he said. "You (BJP) create an artificial majority, an artificial majority is negation of the democracy, which functions on majority, true majorities and you do it by the naked use of monetary power," he said. He said the Congress demands that a Supreme Court sitting judge inquire into this or at least a sitting Chief Justice of a High Court at the minimum. There should be an immediate registration of a Prevention of Corruption Act, FIR and related sections of the Indian penal codes on the criminal sides, he said. Singhvi called for a swift comprehensive investigation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-accuses-bjp-of-offering-inducements-to-mlas-in-gujarat-to-switch-side-903821.html

The police reached the spot to control the crowd and accused the temple authorities of mismanagement. “The indecisive temple officials are responsible for the crowd outside the temple amid the pandemic situation,” Deputy SP Ramesh Chand Tewari said. He said the temple authorities failed to put in place a proper registration mechanism to prevent crowding of people. This has led to confusion among the devotees, the officer said. Tewari added that the police cannot lathicharge innocent devotees for the fault of the temple management. The temple manager, Munish Sharma, said it had been decided to permit a limited number of devotes into the complex every day after they register themselves online. However, we faced issues with the online system and are trying to fix the glitches, he said. Meanwhile, a war of words broke out between Sharma and the temple priest over the incident. Sharma alleged that the main priest, Shailendra Goswami, failed to open the shrine to devotees at 8 am, following which a lot of people had to wait outside. He said Goswami was busy performing special pooja for a select number of devotees inside the temple complex. The priest, however, refuted the charges. He said he was given entry into the temple at 8 am and that it usually takes two hours to adorn the deity with jewels and clothes. “We completed the ‘shringaar’ (adorning the deity with jewels) in less than two hours as it was already late,” Goswami said. He said he has lodged a complaint with civil judge (Junior division) regarding the conduct of the temple manager.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/huge-crowd-outside-banke-bihari-temple-in-up-police-pull-up-temple-officials-903520.html

The District Development Councils (DDCs) of each district shall have 14 constituencies after their delimitation by the respective deputy commissioners, the spokesman said. "The government today amended J&K Panchayati Raj Rules, 1996, to provide for establishment of elected District Development Councils in Jammu and Kashmir.

Seats for SCs, STs and women have also been reserved which will be filled by direct election to the District Development Councils, the spokesman said. The Additional District Development Commissioner shall be the chief executive officer of the DDC, he added. Meanwhile, a statutory order issued by the UT government said the Deputy Commissioner of a district shall divide the DDC area into 14 single member territorial constituencies provided that the ratio between population of the territorial area of a constituency and the number of seats in the DDC shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout. "While delimiting the constituencies of the District Development Council, Halqa Panchayat shall be a unit. The constituencies shall be delimited from the map of the District Development Council area starting from North towards East and ending towards South to West and every constituency shall be assigned a serial number and a name. "The name of the constituency may be assigned on the name of a block having the largest population in that constituency. Thereafter, the constituencies shall be arranged alphabetically on the name of such constituencies," the order said.

A doctor and a medical store employee have also been arrested for allegedly making the spirit available to bootleggers and helping in their spurious liquor business, Superintendent of Police Manoj Singh said. Besides, the stringent National Security Act (NSA) has been invoked against three bootleggers Yunus, Sikandar and Gabbar, who were arrested after the incident, he said. The victims, mostly beggars or poor labourers, died after consuming spurious liquor here on Wednesday and Thursday following which Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan ordered a high-level probe into the incident. "We arrested constables Shaikh Anwar and Nawaz of Kharakuan police station on Saturday and registered a case of criminal conspiracy against them," the official said. A doctor, named Junad, and one Irshad, working at the Golden Medical Store, have also been arrested for allegedly making the spirit available to bootleggers and helping in the spurious liquor sale, the SP said. He also said that earlier 14 deaths were reported in the incident, but after the post-mortem report, the number of fatalities due to the consumption of spurious liquor was revised to 12. Following the incident, assistant excise commissioner K C Agnihotri has been shunted out of Ujjain and deputy municipal commissioner Subodh Jain has been suspended, the official said. Jain was allegedly close to bootleggers Sikandar and Gabbar, police sources said. The SP also said the city-based houses of bootleggers Sikandar and Gabbar, who were contractual workers with the Ujjain Municipal Corporation, have been demolished as they were constructed illegally. The three accused bootleggers made the spurious liquor with spirit and some tablets at an abandoned municipal building, he said. An in-depth investigation into the incident is on and no one involved in it will be spared, he added. Ujjain Collector Ashish Singh on Thursday said there would be a crack-down against those who sell toxic liquor and they would be booked under the NSA. Chouhan ordered a probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Additional Chief Secretary Rajesh Rajora into the incident, the Chief Minister's Office earlier said. "If such a thing is being sold elsewhere, police should find it out and prosecute the offenders severely," Chouhan said on Thursday. "People selling poisonous substances are enemies of society. They should be punished severely. Efforts should be made to send such people to the gallows," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-cops-held-three-bootleggers-booked-under-nsa-in-madhya-pradesh-hooch-tragedy-case-903622.html

18-10-2020||North and Central||Air pollution may increase risk of Covid-19 infection, says experts||Air pollution may increase transmissibility of the novel coronavirus making people more vulnerable to the disease and aggravating the Covid-19 situation, experts have said, while warning that those who have had the infection in the past may also have to face new challenges. With winters approaching and easing of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Delhi-NCR is bracing for months of poor air quality. The national capital's air quality was in the 'poor' category on Sunday morning. According to doctors, respiratory illnesses like viral influenza increase with a spike in pollution levels as poor air quality leads to inflammation in the lungs making it more vulnerable for the virus to penetrate. "This year, we have Covid-19. Like the common cold, the transmission of this virus is expected to increase with a rise in pollution levels. We may see a further surge in cases. "It would be a taxing time for testing centres as they have to cater to people with coronavirus and also non-Covid patients with similar symptoms," Dr Neeraj Nischal, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, told PTI. Experts feel the worst-affected would be people in the lower socioeconomic class with no access to masks and also vulnerable to additional risk factors such as chulla smoke. "Transmission apart, the presentation of Covid-19 like other viral respiratory illnesses will be more severe in high-pollution areas. This will burden hospitals as more patients become symptomatic, requiring admission," Dr Nischal said. According to Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical care and Sleep medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, mortality has been linked with population density, the proximity of people and heavily industrialized or urbanised areas which have higher pollution levels. These factors are likely to become more effective during the festive season and winters, particularly in north India where stubble burning is common and this affects air quality severely, he said. "Italy showed a possible link between PM 2.5 concentration and excess mortality to the extent that one unit increase is associated with a 9 per cent increase in Covid-19 mortality," Dr Gupta said, adding pollution can also assist in the transmission of the novel coronavirus. During smog, particulate matters remain suspended in the air near the earth's surface for a longer period making it conducive for the transmission of the virus, he elaborated. Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant of Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals, said, "We really don't know how this virus is going to behave. But, we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, as pollution level increases and with winter setting in. It will be a dangerous combination." He cautioned that people with respiratory illness, like asthma and bronchitis, were at much higher risk of contracting coronavirus infection. "For people who have tested positive for Covid-19, it is going to be a double whammy, with pollution making things worse," he told PTI. Doctors warn that even those who have had Covid-19 in the past are not out of the woods. "Post-Covid fibrosis and immunoparalysis make their lungs more susceptible to super-added bacterial pneumonia and other viral respiratory illnesses. We urge everyone to get inoculated with the influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine to prevent additional infections in these times," Dr Nischal stressed. According to Dr Gupta, with the cohort of survivors of Covid-19 increasing, a significant number is noted to be symptomatic -- 43 per cent with respiratory complaints-- even after two months. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, which is known to cause chronic airway irritation and inflammation, affects mucus clearing, impairs immunity and acutely precipitates airway disorders like asthma, COPD, lung fibrosis or even cancer-related conditions. Dr Vivek Nangia, principal director and head of pulmonology, Max Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi's Saket said that for individuals belonging to the high-risk groups who are at extremes of ages and suffering from chronic disease are advised to stay indoors or at least restrict their movement to bare essential activities outdoors. "While outdoors, wear a mask at all times and stay away from firecrackers during Diwali. Keep inhaler handy and consult a doctor at the earliest. Even for the others, it is strongly recommended that they minimize their outdoor activities and wear a mask at all time," he said. "The number of cases will go up. There is a study which has been published by Harvard Medical School, USA, where they have shown that with every 1 micron per metre rise in PM 2.5 particles, there's an 8 per cent increase in the mortality," he said. Dr Gupta said, "Indeed, a tough time for post-Covid patients is in store."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/air-pollution-may-increase-risk-of-covid-19-infection-says-experts-903682.html
18-10-2020||North and Central||In absence of legislators, Centre to form directly elected district-level councils in Jammu and Kashmir||In the absence of legislative assembly representatives, the Centre has amended the Panchayati Raj Act in Jammu and Kashmir to strengthen local bodies under which a new power structure will be created in every district which will be directly elected by the voters to carry out various development works. The District Development Council (DDC) will have 14 territorial constituencies, each of which will have a directly elected member. Some of the seats will be reserved for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and women. The order of Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla for amendment of the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989 was issued over a year after the Centre's decision to abrogate the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate it into two Union Territories. After the August 5, 2019 development, Ladakh became a union territory. Jammu and Kashmir too was reduced from a state to a union territory but with a legislature. The Centre also announced the delimitation process to be carried out in the newly carved out union territory for reworking the constituencies. The delimitation commission, set up in March, is headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice Ranjana Desai. The latest decision, according to the officials, has been taken to ensure that development is carried out in every area with more participation of the people -- what was earlier done by the elected representatives of the assembly. This can be helpful till the delimitation commission submits its report and the Election Commission conducts polls in the newly carved out union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. As per the fresh executive order for Jammu and Kashmir, which has been under direct rule of the Centre since November 2018, every DDC shall consist of the directly elected members from territorial constituencies in the district, chairpersons of all Block Development Councils of the district. Once assembly elections are held, members of the Legislative Assembly whose constituencies lie within the district will also be DDC members. Immediately after taking oath or affirmation of allegiance, the elected members of a DDC shall, in the prescribed manner, elect from amongst themselves the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson of the Council. All members of the DDC, whether or not elected by direct election from territorial constituencies in the district, shall have the right to vote in the Council's meetings. However, in case of election or removal of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman only the directly elected members shall have the right to vote, the order said. The Additional District Development Commissioner shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the DDC. The DDC will replace the District Development Boards, which earlier, when Jammu and Kashmir was a state, were chaired by a Cabinet Minister or a Minister of State and included MLAs and MPs. The term of the DDC shall be five years except for holding common elections to all levels of the Panchayats simultaneously so that all the tiers have co-extensive terms in the district. The DDC will have jurisdiction over the entire district excluding Municipality or Municipal Corporation areas, it said.  Every DDC will have a District Development Council Fund, comprising grants by the government and its own resources. The Council will pay remuneration to its staff by using its own resources, the order elaborated. The DDC shall have powers to acquire, hold or dispose of property or enter into a contract in accordance with the rules prescribed, it said. For every district, there will be a District Planning Committee which will consider and guide the formulation of development programmes for the district and indicate priorities for various schemes and consider issues relating to the speedy development and economic upliftment of the district, to function as a working group for formulation of periodic and annual plans for the district, to formulate and finalise the plan and non-plan budget for the district. The DDC will have powers to prepare plans or monitor activities of departments like agriculture, animal, sheep, fisheries and horticulture, consumer affairs, and public distribution, education, forest, health and family welfare, industries and commerce, PWD, public health engineering, irrigation, flood control, revenue, social welfare, tourism and rural development. With the creation of the DDC, the three-tier Panchayati Raj system in Jammu and Kashmir will be completed. The other two bodies are the Halqa Panchayats and the Block Development Councils (BDCs). 'Halqa' means the area comprising a village or contiguous number of villages determined by the government. The panchayat at each level shall every year prepare a development plan for the next year in respect of the functions vested in it, for the respective panchayat area in the form and manner prescribed and it shall be submitted to the BDC before the date prescribed which shall be called the gram panchayat development plan, the MHA order explained. The planning process shall be initiated by the panchayats on October 2 every year and end on December 31. The 'Halqa' panchayat shall submit the Gram Panchayat Development Plan to the BDC before the date prescribed, and the BDC shall consolidate all plans prepared by the panchayats and submit the same to the DDC, the order said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/in-absence-of-legislators-centre-to-form-directly-elected-district-level-councils-in-jammu-and-kashmir-903691.html

18-10-2020||North and Central||National Saffron Mission ‘fails’ to achieve results||National Saffron Mission started almost a decade ago to boost the production of the prized product in Kashmir valley, has failed to achieve the desired results with the growers claiming that the Mission instead of doing any good to them has harmed their interests. The Rs 400 crore Mission, a government of India funded scheme was launched in 2011 with much fanfare with the objective of increasing saffron production, quality, and boosting the growers’ income by doubling it. The revival programme was aimed to employ scientific techniques to rejuvenate saffron bulbs, as well as to provide groundwater irrigation through borewells and sprinklers, power tillers, and a high-tech saffron park with mechanised processing as well as a testing laboratory and e-trading facility. However, according to the growers, the production has only decreased in recent years. “Earlier my annual yield was over 1000 grams of saffron but after the Mission came it declined to 500 grams or less. Crores of rupees were spent for rejuvenation but on the ground the results are nil,” said Ghulam Qadir, a grower from Pampore. Questioning the establishment of Saffron Park, he asked what is fun is when there is no seed in the field. “We have no alternative now and some growers have switched over to other types of cultivation in the saffron land’’, he said and added that growers in some villages have started cultivating vegetables in their fields as Saffron Mission has dashed their hopes to the ground. Even the former Finance Minister of J&K Haseeb Drabu while expressing his concern over the plight of saffron growers in January 2018 had advised them to shift to the traditional system of cultivation as the mission had miserably failed to achieve the desired results. An official of the J&K Agriculture Department on the condition of anonymity said that the scheme couldn’t be implemented properly as there were massive frauds in it. “Common growers didn’t get their due and it was influential people only who were beneficiaries of the scheme,” he said. However, Director Agriculture Kashmir, Altaf Andrabi while terming the Mission a ‘great success’ said that maximum growers were benefitted. “Journalists from India and abroad have come to witness the progress and results of the Mission. It is an innovative and scientific method giving good results,” he said. Andrabi said in 2017-2018 due to a dry spell some damage might have been done to corms but there was a good snowfall in 2019-20 and the yield has multiplied. “It is a scientifically designed programme so it can’t be wrong,” he added. Out of the 3715 hectares of land under saffron cultivation in Kashmir, about 3200 hectares is in Pampore Tehsil of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district while 300 hectares is in Budgam district, 165 in Srinagar, and 65 in Kishtwar district of Jammu region. Known for its special aroma, saffron is a powerful flavouring and colouring agent. Many people also use spice as an aphrodisiac. As a medicine, saffron is used to cure lower fever, help reduce cramps and enlarged livers, and to calm the nerves. It is used as a potion externally for bruises, rheumatism, and neuralgia. Although Spain is the world’s largest exporter of saffron, the best quality still comes from Kashmir. Kashmir’s climate has made it well suited to the complex growing and blooming cycle of the saffron crocus, and the region is the only one in India that produces saffron. Saffron flowers are normally harvested in October and November. Cutting the saffron flowers and hand-picking and drying the stigma and stamen are tasks traditionally done by women and children.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/national-saffron-mission-fails-to-achieve-results-903715.html

The charge sheet was filed under sections of the IPC, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and the Foreigners Act in a special NIA court in Hyderabad on Saturday. Ruhul Amin Dhali of West Bengal, Asad Hasan and Shareeful Shaik of Maharashtra have been named along with Bangladeshi nationals -- Mohd Yousuf Khan, Bithi Begum, Mohd Rana Hussain, Mohammed Al Mamun, Sojib Shaik, Suresh Kumar Das, Mohd Abdulla Munshi, Mohd Ayub Shaik and absconding accused Abdul Barik Shaik. The case was originally registered under sections of the IPC and the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act on September 21 last year at Pahadishareef police station in Hyderabad following the arrest of 10 human traffickers on the same day from two brothels in Hyderabad. Four young Bangladeshi girls were rescued from the brothels and several digital devices, fake Indian identity documents and other incriminating material were seized, the NIA spokesperson said. The NIA investigation established that the arrested accused were associates of Dhali and Abdul Barik Shaik who illegally trafficked young girls from Bangladesh to India and vice versa, according to the official. Dhali was arrested by the NIA in another case. Further probe revealed that there were money transfers between Dhali and Shaik as commission paid to Dhali for trafficking across the borders, the official said. Dhali and other 10 arrested accused had illegally entered India in the 1980s and established a prostitution racket along with Yusuf and Bithi, who are husband and wife, in various parts of India, the NIA spokesperson said. The 12 accused hatched a criminal conspiracy along with their associates in Bangladesh to look for young Bangladeshi girls in the age group of 19-25 years and traffic them to India by crossing the Sonai river via Kolkata, and then take them to various destinations in India, including Mumbai and Hyderabad, the official said. These girls are lured with the promise of lucrative jobs and better life quality. They are also provided fake Indian identity documents and are eventually forced into prostitution, the NIA official said. The rescued young girls are presently at shelter homes and the arrested accused are in judicial custody in Hyderabad.

The move to shunt out Ujjain District SP Manoj Singh and Additional SP Rupesh Dwivedi came after Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took a serious view of the incident during a review meeting at his residence in Bhopal, a government official said. Satyendra Kumar Shukla replaces Singh, who has been shifted to Bhopal as assistant inspector general at the police headquarters (PHQ), and the area city superintendent of police is suspended, said an order from the state Home department. Besides, Ujjain's Additional Superintendent of Police Dwivedi has also been transferred to the PHQ as assistant inspector general, the order said. At the review meeting, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Dr Rajesh Rajora, who heads the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which is conducting a probe into the incident, apprised Chouhan of the ground situation. Chouhan asked the officials to check the sale of illicit liquor and other intoxicants. He also said that such an incident should not reoccur at any cost and the offenders should be dealt with an iron hand, the official said. Earlier, constables Shaikh Anwar and Nawaz of Kharakuan police station in Ujjain were arrested on Saturday for their alleged involvement in the sale of spurious liquor, a police official said, adding that they were booked under sections for criminal conspiracy. A doctor, named Junad, and one Irshad, working at the Golden Medical Store in Ujjain, were also arrested for allegedly making the spirit available to bootleggers and helping in their spurious liquor business, outgoing SP Manoj Singh told PTI. Besides, the stringent National Security Act (NSA) has been invoked against three bootleggers - Yunus, Sikandar and Gabbar - who were arrested after the incident, he said.

The two special session of the state assembly is beginning on Monday, in which the state government is set to bring legislation against the farm laws. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had a detailed meeting with Congress MLAs on Sunday afternoon to discuss the farm laws and heard their views for the assembly session. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Jakhar said, "We discussed how to protect farmers from these black laws. The MLAs gave their suggestions." He said the government is clear that it will do whatever it can to protect farmers' interests. The MLAs were of the opinion that if the Centre feels Punjab's action of countering the new farm laws was not right, they can dismiss the state government, Jakhar said. “If the Narendra Modi government dismisses our government, they are free to do so. The MLAs were of the opinion, to which the Chief Minister also agreed, that if the Centre has to take such a step they can, but we will do whatever we can to protect interests of farmers,” he said. We are clear that we have to save farmers; we have to protect the peace, harmony and brotherhood, Jakhar said. “If Centre thinks Punjab is coming in way of the benefits they want to extend to big corporates through these farm laws and if they want to dismiss our government, they can,” Jakhar said. Senior Congress leader and MLA Raj Kumar Verka said Punjab will not accept the “black laws”. “The session will now be of two days instead of one-day duration. We are also bringing other bills for the benefit of landless farmers during the session,” Verka said. Punjab Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has always protected the state's interests. “During his first term as a chief minister, he had taken a bold decision to protect the state's interests on water issues. Now again, he is committed to protect farmers' interests,” the minister said. Earlier on October 14, a decision to convene special session of the assembly was taken at a meeting of the state cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh here. The chief minister had said that his government will fight the “anti-federal and vicious” farm laws tooth and nail through legislative, legal and other routes. The CM had said he would call a special session of the assembly to bring in necessary amendments to state laws to negate the “dangerous impact” of the central legislations, which are designed to “ruin” the farmers as well as the state's agriculture and economy. In the last assembly session on August 28, a resolution was passed by a majority to reject three contentious farm ordinances, which later took the shape of the laws. The farmers in the state have been holding protests demanding that the three farm laws passed by Parliament recently be repealed. They have expressed apprehension that the new laws will pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The Centre, however, has maintained that the new laws will raise farmers' income, free them from the clutches of middlemen and usher in new technology in farming. The three farm bills -- the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were passed by Parliament last month. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-do-everything-possible-to-protect-farmers-punjab-cong-chief-903762.html

"The incident took place a week back, but the police were informed about the alleged gang-rape on Sunday," Superintendent of Police (Kanpur Dehat) Keshav Kumar Choudhary said. According to a complaint filed by the victim’s parents, the accused duo barged into their house when the 22-year-old woman was alone and raped her one by one at gunpoint. They then left after threatening her of dire consequences if she dared to speak about the incident to anyone. A case has been registered under relevant sections of IPC and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 in the matter, Choudhary said. Three police teams headed by SHO Derapur, circle officer and additional SP apart from SWAT team have been formed to arrest the absconding accused, he added. The incident comes close on the heels of the gangrape-murder of another Dalit woman in Hathras that had drawn intense outrage after alleged apathy of the administration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dalit-woman-gang-raped-at-gunpoint-in-uttar-pradesh-903791.html

Addressing a poll meeting in Dabra, where the Congress is up against Imarti Devi of the BJP, Nath said his party candidate was a "simple person" unlike his opponent who is an "item". "Why should I take the name (of the opposing candidate)? You all know that person better than me. What an item," Nath said amid cheers from the crowd which kept shouting "Imarti Devi" as the remarks were being made. Hitting back, MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to Twitter to say "Imarti Devi is the daughter of a poor farmer" who rose to become a public servant after starting off as a village labourer. By referring to a woman as "item", the Congress and its and leadership have revealed its "feudal mindset", Chouhan tweeted further. Later, a BJP delegation met Election Commission officials in Bhopal and complained against Nath for "insulting women and Dalits". Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state Assembly and joined the BJP in March, in the process bringing down the Nath government. Counting of votes of the bypolls will be held on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-bjp-decries-kamal-naths-item-jibe-for-woman-candidate-903798.html

The development comes as part of the "Mission Shakti" campaign of the Uttar Pradesh government, which has faced flak over a string of rape incidents, including the alleged gangrape and death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman here, recently. "There are 11 police stations, including the Mahila Thana, in the district. There are 11 anti-Romeo squads with five police personnel in each team. One team includes three women and two men personnel. These squads would keep an eye on miscreants harassing or troubling women and girls in the district," Hathras Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal told PTI. The district police chief on Sunday held a meeting with all members of the squads and stressed on the need to put a check on crimes against women and girls. These squads would patrol public places like markets, the vicinity of schools and colleges, coaching institutes, bus stands, parks, among others, to prevent harassment of women and girls, and indecency against them by miscreants, a police spokesperson said. "The squads would also raise awareness among women and girls about the helpline numbers being operated by the state government and the state police. For example, they can dial 112, 181 and 1090 (women helpline), 1076 (chief minister's helpline), 1098 (child helpline), 102 and 108 (healthcare and ambulance)," the spokesperson said. The squads will also apprise the women and children about mobile phone apps like the UP COP and how they could be used by distressed persons, the official added. The anti-Romeo squads were constituted to check stalkers and eve-teasers in Uttar Pradesh soon after Yogi Adityanath had assumed the office of the chief minister in 2017. Facing flak over crimes against women in the state, Adityanath on Saturday had launched the 'Mission Shakti' campaign that focuses on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against females will be dealt with an iron hand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradeshs-anti-romeo-squads-back-in-action-to-check-crimes-against-women-in-hathras-903804.html

18-10-2020||North and Central||Pranab Mukherjee recalls fond memories of Sheikh Mujib in article penned days before death||In an article penned days before his death, former president Pranab Mukherjee had fondly remembered Bangladesh founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and recalled how in 1972 the then Pakistan President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had tried in vain to pressure him into issuing a joint statement to show that Pakistan remained undivided. Mukherjee, in his article that is published in the book Voice of Millions to mark the centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, also reminisced how he, as a young Rajya Sabha MP, had called in Parliament for granting recognition to the then Bangladesh government in exile, as part of a political solution. The former president quoted from Sheikh Mujib's book Unfinished Memoirs, published by his daughter 29 years after his death, to note how the Bangladeshi leader was not even aware of the independence of his country and was in exile in the Mianwali Jail near Rawalpindi at that time. He was thereafter taken to London on a special flight on the night of January 8, 1972, after Bhutto failed in his attempts to woo him. "Bhutto informed Mujib that he was the president and needed Mujib's help. During the few days between 1st and 8th January, Bhutto spoke to him at various times and pressured Mujib to sign a joint statement. He showed Mujib many drafts...," Mukherjee wrote. "Meanwhile, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made repeated appeals to Mujib to establish a relationship between Pakistan and Bangladesh. A relationship that would keep Pakistan undivided. "Mujib simply informed Bhutto that he would not be able to say anything to him without first conferring with the people of his country. "In the end, a frustrated Bhutto decided to send Mujib to Britain. In the middle of the night on 8th January 1972, a special Pak Airlines plane flew Mujib, its sole passenger, to London's Heathrow airport. When he landed at Heathrow, the local time was 6:30 am," he said, noting from his book. Mukherjee also recollected in his article how his mind was filled with memories of the events of 1971. He was 36 years old and an MP when the people of Bangladesh were engaged in their liberation struggle. "I recall that, on June 15, 1971, I had the privilege to initiate a discussion on the floor of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, when I suggested that India should accord diplomatic recognition to the Government of Bangladesh in exile in Mujibnagar. My words are on the record in the proceedings of Rajya Sabha. "When a Member sought my suggestion on how to tackle the problem, I responded by saying: 'I am talking of a political solution which means categorically recognising the sovereign democratic Government of Bangladesh. "Political solution means giving material help to the democratic, sovereign Government of Bangladesh.... I reminded the House of the many instances in world history when intervention on similar grounds had taken place in the past," Mukherjee wrote in the article which, his close associates said, was his last. He also wrote about how Mujib worked hard for creation of Pakistan, but intense disagreements arose between him and the Muslim League leadership as he began to oppose various policies and their applications. "Because of this, he was imprisoned shortly after liberation for criticizing and opposing government policies at different times. If the 9 months in 1971 are included, then Mujib's total period of imprisonment comes to 3,053 days, he said. Describing the 'Father of Bangladesh' as "a tireless statesman", Mukherjee said the legacy of 'Bangabandhu' and Bangladesh are intertwined together. "There are very few individuals in history who have a profound impact in the creation of Nations, indeed a subcontinent's identity. "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujbir Rahman stands tall amongst those few. His unbound love for his people and his struggle for them is a testament to his legacy. "As the sub-continent observes his birth centenary, we not only remember a statesman but a man who lived and died for his great nation, in the process reaffirming the culturally ingrained values of freedom and liberty, composite secularism and inclusive development," he said in his article. He wrote about the days of Sheikh Mujib's schooling, to becoming the leader of Bangladesh. The former President, who is the only one from outside Bangladesh to have written in the book, said his dream of a 'Sonar Bangla' lives on. He also talked about how Sheikh Mujib made the 'Chhatra League' a mass movement that also helped in achieving the dream of Bangladesh's independence. Mukherjee said he was in Kolkata when Sheikh Mujib was assassinated. "Of the brutal annihilation of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with his entire family (except his two daughters Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana) at the dawn of 14th /15th August 1975, the most vivid memory I have is of unbelievable shock and anger," he also said. Mukherjee died on August 31 at the age of 84.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pranab-mukherjee-recalls-fond-memories-of-sheikh-mujib-in-article-penned-days-before-death-903811.html

The flea market reopened on Sunday for shoppers as vendors put up stalls on the TRC Chowk-Batamaloo axis through the Lal Chowk city centre here, they said. The officials said the vendors maintained social distancing and followed other precautions and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The decision to throw open the market was taken after the district administration held deliberations with the stakeholders and asked them to ensure strict compliance of the pandemic guidelines, they said. The shoppers welcomed the reopening of the market after over eight months. "This market not only caters to shoppers from various sections of society but is also a means of sustenance for these vendors. So, obviously, the reopening of the market is a welcome step," Sheikh Owais, a shopper, said. However, he said, the vendors and the shoppers must ensure that social distancing norms are maintained. The market was closed in March this year as the administration imposed a lockdown here after the city recorded its first case of Covid-19 from Khanyar area. Even as the lockdown was lifted and the other markets of the valley reopened gradually, the flea market continued to remain shut as the authorities apprehended that the market -- which usually witnesses a huge rush of people -- would increase the risk of infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sunday-market-in-srinagar-reopens-after-remaining-closed-for-eight-months-903841.html

He alleged that the Kashmiri mainstream political parties have "deprived" and "deceived" Jammu and Ladakh regions for the last 70 years and looted the government resources for their own good. "The mainstream political parties of the valley have come up with a new version of 'Gupkar alliance' just to befool people of Kashmir with their cheap and misleading tactics," Gupta said in a statement here. The mainstream political parties, including the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, on Thursday held a meeting and formed the people's alliance for Gupkar Declaration for restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's special status and also to initiate a dialogue between all the stakeholders on the issue. The BJP leader said during the past over 15 months, people in the valley have ignored them (mainstream leaders who were under detention in the valley) and no one was bothered to come out on roads to seek their release. "Both NC and PDP leaders are staging drama and expressing fake sympathies for the people by forming such 'people's alliance'," he said and termed it as "anti-national". "They exploited Jammu and Kashmir's resources in the name of Article 370 and are now trying the same formula but people are aware of such tactics. They have lost their credibility and the dynastic politics has ended with the abrogation of Article 370," Gupta said. The former deputy chief minister said his party is committed to restore Jammu and Kashmir's statehood as and when the situation becomes conducive and the same has also been assured by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nc-pdp-befooling-people-in-name-of-gupkar-alliance-bjp-leader-903845.html

"We have to unitedly thwart the misleading propaganda of the opposition parties and their negative intentions and stand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji," he said. President Ram Nath Kovind had last month given his assent to the three farm bills passed by the Parliament which has triggered protests in various states, especially Punjab and Haryana. Bidhuri also accused the Congress of acquiring the land of farmers, developing commercial plots on them and earning crores by "looting" the community. “... Now, Congress has problem when the Modi government is working in farmers' interest,” he said. The BJP leader also trained guns at the ruling AAP in Delhi, claiming that the party has failed to fulfil the promises made to the farmers after coming to power. For the first time since independence, the Modi government brought the farm laws which will protect the farmers and their interests, Delhi BJP Kisan Morcha president Vinod Sehrawat said. The farmers are aware of their interests and they are with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi BJP vice president Jaiveer Rana said at the Khat panchayat. The opposition parties have been criticising the manner in which the bills were passed in the Parliament and also attacking the Centre over the minimum support price issue.

Students had complained about experiencing technical glitches, problems in paying fees during the admission in the first round. The varsity announced its second cut-off list on Saturday with many popular courses being closed for admissions and some courses seeing a minor decline in cut-offs. The admission process under the second list will end on October 21. Students will also have the option of cancelling or withdrawing their admissions and migrating to another college if they meet the cut-off. Anu Srivastava, principal of Hindu College, said, "We are all geared up and we are good to handle a huge rush. There is no such issue of any change in the process and we are coordinating with the admission branch. We still have to fill Commerce and Economics seats, while there are 10 courses which have already been filled up." Hindu College has kept the cut-off for BA (Honours) Philosophy unchanged at 97 per cent. The college principal said that they are almost full and have only one or two seats remaining. Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said they have learnt from the shortcomings of the first cut-off and the college is focussed on Science courses, where seats are still vacant. The colleges are also expecting cancellations with the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) results being announced. "We have seen seats being filled up for BSc (Honours) Zoology which would not happen earlier. Even the BSc programme combination with Electronics has been filled up in the first list which is for the first time," Khanna said. Nearly 50 per cent of the seats have been filled under the first list. Last year, nearly 24,000 admissions had happened under the first list. Officials have attributed the substantial increase in admissions this year to the process being online and giving an opportunity to many outstation students to apply sitting in the comfort of their homes. The first cut-off list was released on October 10. Almost 50 per cent of the seats have been filled under the first list. The varsity has 70,000 undergraduate seats. The admissions under the second list will commence from Monday 10 am onwards and will end on October 21. This year, the admission process is completely being held online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/du-admission-process-2nd-cut-off-to-start-on-october-19-903857.html

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on Ashfaq Ahmed alias Allah Rakha on Saturday and directed him to pay half the amount to the girl. Government lawyer Suresh Babu Sahu on Sunday said 10 years ago, Ahmed was caught red-handed trying to rape the girl, whom he had lured to the rooftop of his house. "The court sentenced Ahmed to seven years of imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on him," he said. After the incident, when the girl's father complained to Ahmed's son, the latter hurled abuses at him, following which the girl's father lodged a police complaint against the father-son duo.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/75-year-old-man-gets-7-year-jail-term-for-attempting-to-rape-3-year-old-girl-in-up-903859.html
18-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi govt directive to 12 colleges on staff salaries arbitrary, irrational: Principals||Delhi University principals on Sunday condemned the city government's directive asking 12 colleges fully funded by it to pay the salaries of staffers by using the Students' Society Fund and termed it ''arbitrary and 'irrational''. The Delhi University Principals' Association (DUPA) appealed to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to intervene and ensure that the students' money in the fund is used for the purpose it is collected. It also urged the chief minister to ensure that the Grant-In-Aid for salary and other purposes is released by the city government immediately to "mitigate the hardships faced by the teaching and non-teaching staff of the colleges in Delhi".  DUPA also appealed to DU's Vice-Chancellor to take up the matter with the Delhi government at the highest level to get the Grant in Aid released immediately so that the salary of the staff due for the last six months can be paid. The Arvind Kejriwal government on Friday had directed 12 DU colleges fully funded by it to pay outstanding salaries to staffers from the Students Society Fund. An emergent meeting of the DUPA Executive was held on Saturday.  "The DUPA is outraged and dismayed with such an irrational, arbitrary and illegal 'Order/Permission' of the Delhi government directing the college administration to exhaust the student's money accumulated over many years under the Students Society Fund meant for the activities such as campus placements, skill enhancement, career counselling and gender sensitisation, etc," DUPA said in a statement said. The direction that grants-in-aid (GIA) for the salaries will be only released after Students' Society Fund is exhausted will completely stop the activities for ability enhancement, soft skills learning and promotion of cross-cultural understanding among the students so imperative for their comprehensive personality development, it added. The government has ordered a special audit of six colleges -- Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Maharishi Valmiki B Ed College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Aditi Mahavidyalaya, Bhagini Nivedita College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies. The DUPA also condemned the linkage between the conduct of Special Audit and release of Grant-in-aid for salary.  "The audit is a routine affair and already three types of audit (Statutory audit, LFA Audit of GNCTD, and CAG) are conducted periodically and there is no linkage between the conduct of audit and release of Grant-in-aid for salary. "Therefore, the contention that the GIA will be released only after completion of the special audit is illegal," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-directive-to-12-colleges-on-staff-salaries-arbitrary-irrational-principals-903864.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Elections | Think again: Whose choice, whose will, whose responsibility?||In a couple of weeks, we’ll see two sets of elections. One is the American presidential election, of which there is a lot of coverage around the world. The other is a state election in Bihar. These are very different contests, with different stakes and consequences, but despite their wide contrasts there are some common lessons, too. The harshest truth about representative democracy everywhere is that voters often don’t think there is a big correlation between their choices and the consequences. There is a general sense that “the politicians are all the same” and that “there is not much I can do with my single vote.” Given this, the lofty ideals of this form of government are no longer at the top of our mind even on election day, let alone at other times. A number of people telling reporters that they do not plan to vote for Trump this time, although they did the last time, aren’t sure if they knew what they needed to know about him in 2016. That’s very convenient, but it’s also very revealing. They’re claiming that they are not responsible for anything he did in the last four years, even though they chose him the last time. “We did not think he would be like this,” they say. Trump is an extreme case, but that sentiment is quite common. Take the voters of Bihar. In the last 30 years, they have voted back and forth for two groups that have both kept the state among the poorest in the country. Looking at the data, if there is one thing that can be said with certainty, it is that both JD (U) and the RJD are really good at ensuring continuing last-in-the-nation status. But very few of those who voted for them will admit that this is what they expected. Some will even delude themselves to a greater extent, claiming that “in some ways, things have got better” during some years and not during others. If you set the bar low enough, any political party or leader can meet it. The other thing that dominates elections is spectacle. It’s a show, and that’s one reason why a showman like Trump can win. He understands, like several others now and before him, that if you tell the voters what they already believe, then they will vote for him, and then he can do things that they may not have thought of while choosing him. Is there a fix for this? Is there something we can do to get closer to a point where people see their votes also as their choices and accept that the consequences of their choices are also their responsibility? It’s not a new question; it’s probably as old as democracy itself. The theory of democracy is written without room for motives. The way it is worded in most Constitutions and textbooks, it works like this -- the people have a right to choose their leaders, they do this through elections, after learning about the candidates during campaigns, and the elected leaders go on to represent the choices that the majority have preferred. The practice of democracy, on the other hand, is written almost entirely with motives. Candidates contest elections with personal and other goals, too, in mind, and they tell voters only a subset of these other things they plan to do. They’re trying to win, and therefore trying to influence people to choose them. They’re not leaving it to the voters to merely pick; they’re doing everything they can to guide each pick. Does Trump really see it as a business interest for him to be President? Is he just attracted to the fact that the presidency is a bigger stage for his showman act than any other? One could ask questions like these endlessly, but unwaveringly come to the same conclusion again and again -- there’s no way to know, and the voters prefer it that way! In the process, we have made the institutions of government easy to capture. Voters don’t think they’re responsible for this, but who else could be? Our first instinct is to respond to this by saying that the candidates are the problem. But in a very literal sense, that’s not true at all. The candidates are the only ones acting with purpose. Elections are an intersection between the State and society. But they’re also a point of divergence. Until voting day, people are encouraged and inclined to think of a connection between themselves and their votes. But this is only a fleeting concession. The larger reality that both candidates and voters are comfortable with is that the people are not responsible for their choices. The price of that concession is that the winners cannot be held responsible for subsequent actions. The distance that voters maintain between their votes and their consequences becomes a tool after polling day, as whoever wins insists that everything they do represents the will of the voters who have chosen them, and it is therefore the people who are responsible.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/elections-think-again-whose-choice-whose-will-whose-responsibility-903479.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Constitution and the right to vote||Contrary to popular belief, the US presidential election does not happen only on one day -- the first Tuesday of November (November 3 this year). Early voting has already begun and foreign observers of US elections have been somewhat surprised by reports of long queues (11 hours-long in one case!) in what’s supposed to be one of the world’s most mature democracies. More so, when the right to vote is guaranteed under the Fifteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Part of the problem is that in the US, the conduct of elections is in the hands of each of the 50 states. It has no equivalent of the Election Commission of India. Each state comes up with its own rules on how one must vote and the differences between the states are large. This has not always resulted in neutral voting laws. In the southern states, African Americans were barred from voting through “literacy tests,” and these states continue to do so through myriad laws (including prohibiting anyone convicted of an offence from voting). Despite enshrining the right to vote in the Constitution itself, the US has had a long and shameful history of targeted voter suppression aimed at disenfranchising minorities and the poor. The Indian Constitution, on other hand, does not mention the right to vote at all! For a country that calls itself democratic, it must come as a surprise to know that there is no constitutional right to vote, let alone it being a fundamental right. Instead, what the Constitution provides is a right to be enrolled in an electoral roll for the purposes of a general election (Article 326), and that this right is to be extended to all adults of sound mind irrespective of gender, religion, caste, etc (Article 325). In fairness, this was a revolutionary move for its time. The Indian Constitution was one of the first to grant universal suffrage right from the start without discriminating against any citizen on the basis of landholding, literacy, race, religion, caste, gender, etc. Yet, it does not say something that the US Constitution did nearly 160 years ago -- that everyone shall have the right to vote. It seems to have been understood in the Constituent Assembly though that the right to vote was guaranteed and enshrined in the Constitution through Articles 325 and 326 and there was no serious demand to make it a fundamental right. On the other hand, there were members (such as HV Kamath and Das Bhargava) who were against universal adult franchise and wanted the right to vote to be limited to those who were literate, etc. There were also worries expressed by many members (such as Deshbandhu Gupta) that thanks to Partition and the movement of refugees, the population numbers might be skewed in certain parts of the country. Even as this was being debated, something quite remarkable was taking place outside the halls of the Constituent Assembly. The very first electoral rolls for the very first elections in independent India were being prepared. How they were prepared is discussed in a remarkable book by Israeli scholar Ornit Shani called How India Became Democratic, but what is quite noticeable is that even before the Constitution was finalised, before the provision was made for universal suffrage, efforts had already been made to ensure it was a reality even by the time of the first election. This effort was not led by the Election Commission (which did not yet exist) nor by any political party or civil society. Rather, it was the bureaucracy, both at the central level and provincial level, and also in the larger princely states, which took an active role in ensuring that every last Indian adult would find a place on the electoral rolls. This monumental effort was almost forgotten in India till Shani’s recent book and is worth reading about. Guaranteeing the right to vote is therefore not so much about putting the right words in the right part of the Constitution. It is about the political will to ensure and uphold the principle of universal suffrage, backed up by independent institutions which make it happen. Even as it fought a brutal civil war to ensure equal citizenship for African Americans and included the right to vote in the Constitution, the US lost the political will to enforce it and did not put in place until much later the institutions and laws to implement it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/constitution-and-the-right-to-vote-903482.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Could this be News TV’s nadir? Let’s hope so!||Arnab Goswami and his ilk have not just caricatured news television in the public eye, they’ve further poisoned the public’s frustrated relationship with TV news. And in doing so, they might have struck at a core pillar of the industry’s business model -- measuring viewership. The latest television ratings scandal, besides squeezing out any remaining trust that people have in news television, might hurt the television industry’s precarious financial position. News television, like most other media formats, makes nearly all its money from advertising. And advertising on TV is built on the foundation of viewership data that is currently supplied by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), a television industry-supported body that surveys 44,000 Indian households, or approximately 190,000 viewers. BARC surveys these households and tells advertisers what 197 million homes (836 million people) are likely to be watching on TV every week. This helps advertisers plan how they want to spend money on television advertising, which takes up 36.5% of total advertising spend across India. Audience measurement is the oxygen for any communication medium that depends on advertising for survival. But measuring anything in a country as complex as India isn’t simple, especially if you’re using archaic methods, tiny sample sizes, and decision-making by committee. So, naturally, there’s a growing degree of skepticism about BARC’s methodology and what it means. Does it tell us what India is really watching on TV? Sunil Lulla, BARC’s CEO, said in an interview last week that the body is looking to change the way it measures niche categories -- categories that have less than 0.5% of overall viewership. And yes, English news television is a niche category in India as per BARC. The ongoing spat between Republic TV, Mumbai Police and two more channels could have some of the makings of the Tarun Tejpal-type controversy that pushed Tehelka (and news magazine publishing in general) into the vortex of irrelevance. Or, it might have the ingredients of the ’90s match-fixing controversy that saw millions of fans fall out of love with cricket. But we needn’t look that far for comparisons with previous controversies. Eight years ago, NDTV took Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a Nielsen-Kantar company that specialises in TV viewership measurement, to court in New York state. At the heart of that dispute was what’s being alleged by Mumbai Police today -- rigged TV ratings. The difference, of course, is that then it was a TV channel accusing the measurement agency of fraud. In the Republic TV vs Mumbai Police saga, it is the channel being accused of conspiring to fix the viewership numbers by messing with the agency’s methodology. The fallout of the NDTV-TAM case was bitter. It hurt an industry that was seeing double-digit growth in an economy that was still on the upswing. It made advertisers more skeptical of legacy formats like television. And it marked the beginning of advertisers becoming enchanted with digital. They started spending a larger portion of their money on it -- websites, apps, search engines, and social networks (the last two categories are mere euphemisms for Google and Facebook). The short point is this: Money spent on digital advertising has grown to the point where it is about to become second to what is spent on television. It will overtake newspapers and magazines, radio, outdoor and any other form of sponsored communication through media. The ongoing TV ratings dispute is bludgeoning the reputation of an industry that isn’t known for its ethical business practices or professionalism. Large companies have said they will not advertise on television networks that air ‘toxic content’. Fortunately, the NDTV-TAM case led to the birth of BARC, which managed to build somewhat of a trusted reporting mechanism for advertisers. And the television industry has had a decent run since then. But with BARC numbers now being held back, a police investigation underway, and Goswami and his ilk not backing off, news TV might be seeing its nadir (at least, one should hope so!). This time, advertisers might choose to make radical shifts away from television altogether, leaving a tottering industry worse off. Will news broadcasters pause to think if it’s worth chasing TV ratings and making it the benchmark for success in news programming? Many people are clamouring to find sources of news they can trust and start to feel informed and enriched by. This is a good moment for those looking to do journalism that adds value instead of shredding the public’s trust in the medium itself. After all, are fixed television ratings really the problem or is it television programming itself?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/could-this-be-news-tv-s-nadir-let-s-hope-so-903484.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Idli is boring. Oops, did I hurt sentiments?||When I was heading to Madurai some years ago, a Tamil friend insisted I dine at Murugan Idli Shop. I wanted to like idli. I really did. So, I kept an open mind and took his advice. Sadly, rather than changing my opinion, the idli-eating expedition cemented it. I realised that the essence of a good idli is what I find most repelling -- the soft, spongy texture. As if that isn’t unappealing enough, the prospect of being served idli for breakfast quite frankly makes me want to skip the meal entirely. Let’s face it, idli is saved from its bland state by the accompanying condiments. Unfortunately, to me, consuming spicy sambar or ghee-laden gunpowder first thing in the morning is as unpalatable as idli itself. Bring on the coconut chutney. I’d much rather pair it with deliciously crispy dosa, though! I get the fact that idli isn’t just a food -- it’s part of peoples’ cultural identity. I’m Australian. Vegemite is, for better or worse, regarded as the symbol of Australia’s national identity. Yet, this icon is universally hated by people from other countries. What’s vehemently said about Vegemite makes “boring” idli seem insipid. Former US President Barack Obama didn’t hold back on his disrespect when he announced that Vegemite was “horrible”. Sweden also deemed the yeast-based spread worthy of display in its Disgusting Food Museum. It joined such delicacies as maggot-infested cheese from Sardinia and baby mouse wine from China. Oh, the honour! Mercifully, judging by the silence on Twitter, it appears no Indian foods warranted inclusion in the disgusting collection. Museum visitors are encouraged to taste the exhibits. And yes, some do vomit. Icelandic hakarl (fermented shark meat) claimed the latest victim. Nevertheless, the museum wasn’t set up with malicious intent. Instead, it aims to challenge peoples’ perceptions of what’s edible, and to show how disgust is cultural and varies from country to country. What’s appetising to one person may be objectionable to another. The end goal is to get people to embrace foods they initially considered foul. It’s a lofty ideal. I wouldn’t touch that maggoty cheese with a ten-foot pole! Alternatively, people may come across foods in the museum that they don’t consider to be disgusting at all and wonder why they’re on show. What’s certain is how subjective peoples’ tastes are. When the extent of this becomes apparent, opinions matter less. I’m not bothered by what people think of Vegemite. I’m not going to try to convince anyone of its appeal, either. In the same manner, I accept that many Indians think Western food is tasteless. My own husband decided he’d rather learn to cook than eat sandwiches for lunch when I became tired of preparing Indian meals every day during the lockdown. And then, there are those Indians who completely avoid local food when travelling. Some even have cooks along on guided group tours. They don’t want to try other cuisines. Sure, they may be inflexible, but why take offence over their preferences. Perhaps they can’t stomach cereal, toast and jam for breakfast!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/idli-is-boring-oops-did-i-hurt-sentiments-903486.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Tanishq Ad | We were un-secular before, too. We will stay secular even now||Good that jewellery-maker Tanishq pulled back that advertisement. The ad that showed a pregnant Hindu woman pleasantly taken aback by her Muslim mother-in-law who had organised a Hindu-style godh-bharai (baby shower) and had taken the young woman into a warm embrace. After all, does such a hunky-dory inter-religious marriage exist? That too with an actually mutually affectionate saas-bahu? Looks like Ekta Kapoor has to start her TV serial tutorials all over again. Jokes apart, for those who have been living under a rock all this week, here is what happened: As soon as the ad described above was out, Twitter erupted with a call to #boycottTanishq. A few thousand tweeters threatened never to buy the brand again; a few dared others to ‘retweet if you agree’. Meanwhile, some of us had to watch and re-watch the advertisement just to find out what the hell was there in it to be so angry about. Until we were asked, why was it not a Muslim woman instead, married into a Hindu household? Why was the brand promoting ‘love jihad’? Tanishq then said sorry and pulled the ad off the air. It was now the turn of the other set to get angry. Why did a brand have to bend to social media mafia? Extremism is nothing new. India has been there, seen that. For those in anguish over the slow death of the ‘secular’, a reality check: As a student, I saw pictures of mobs burning Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses; 12 people actually died in a riot in February 1989 in the then-Bombay even as Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini said the book was anti-Islam and issued a fatwa seeking Rushdie’s head. The 90s dealt a further blow to the façade of tolerance. MF Hussain was targeted; venues having his paintings were attacked because they insulted Hindu gods. I heard murmurs around back then, “An attack is bad, but would he paint the gods of his own religion too in the nude?” Thirty years on, the Fatwa on Rushdie stands, and the price for his head has been hiked; Husain never returned from exile to his country that his heart ached for. Insult -- perceived or real -- is the hardest of emotions to heal. If anything, insult hardens, adding every incident thereon to strengthen the hate for the ‘other’. Of course, social media fans flames. The news media then gives that incident – thereby the insult - the oxygen of publicity, so that you and I who had no view on it in the first place, are now forced to take sides. Within no time, there is an Us vs Them war. Labels and taunts are fired at one another: Pseudo secular, Left Liberal, Bhakt, Commie, Chaddi. More insult. Insult over insult is a saga that never ends. An insult tally is kept, each side waits to hurl back the next one. In 2017, The Insult, the first Lebanese movie to be nominated for an Oscar after almost being banned, examined the searing wounds of its country, caused by something similar to what India faces -- the animosity between the majority Lebanese community and the minorities, the Palestinians. A spat between Tony, a Lebanese Christian, and Yasser over a leaking water pipe goes on to be a fight, until a bad word hurled at Yasser hits at the heart of the Palestinian struggle and lands up becoming a national controversy, with both sides up in arms. In the gripping courtroom drama that follows, we learn of how the majority community feels equally hurt, its patience tested by the government favouring the minority over decades; and the resentment of having to let go every time builds up into anger that is stoked by politicians and leads to hate that won’t heal in a hurry. India needs that deep examining for itself. The majority, the minorities, civil society, but the media first on whether it needs to blow incidents out of proportion. Worse, why it blows only some incidents, sweeps away some under the carpet, and shames those who ask why or what about. It’s the one that you thought you swept away that comes back to bite you. Why not be fair to every religion, every community; because when you are treated unfair, you never forget...the insult. The redeeming part in the Tanishq episode was of couples who swarmed social media with pictures of their interfaith marriages, and of Hindus who lambasted the boycott call. Others served it the rightful royal ignore – like my mother who asked what I was writing about this time. I told her, to which she said without looking up from her cooking, “What controversy? That ad? It was so beautiful, what is there to fight about?”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/tanishq-ad-we-were-un-secular-before-too-we-will-stay-secular-even-now-903487.html
18-10-2020||Opinion||Out of control: When schools opened in a Covid-19 hotspot||On a Friday in mid-September, Sunny Washington got a text from another mother at her daughter’s high school in an affluent suburb of Salt Lake City. Three weeks into the school year, the number of coronavirus cases at the school was rising, and the district was considering shifting to online instruction. The text urged parents to beg the school board to keep classrooms open. Washington ignored the text — she thought the school should be taking advice from public health experts, not parents. But other parents flooded the board with messages, and the school stayed open. Within a week, the number of cases had nearly quadrupled. A teacher was hospitalized and put on a ventilator. When the board finally closed the school temporarily, 77 students and staff members, including Washington’s daughter, had tested positive. “We’re talking 30 days in, and it went completely out of control,” Washington said. Her daughter’s school, Corner Canyon High School, experienced one of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks at a school in Utah, and possibly the country, with 90 cases within two weeks — most likely an undercount, since not all students and staff who were exposed or symptomatic got tested. And Corner Canyon was not the only school in the district to have an outbreak. By September 28, Canyons School District, with roughly 33,000 students, had temporarily closed three high schools and a middle school, telling about 8,000 students to learn from home. The story of Canyons is an object lesson in what can happen when schools reopen in communities that are failing to contain the virus. In the two weeks before the district reopened, Salt Lake County had roughly 187 new cases per 100,000 people, a level at which some experts have advised against high schools opening in person; that level is 2 1/2 times higher than the standard Washington state uses to recommend distance learning for all students. Since then, with schools and colleges open, things have only worsened, as both the county and Utah have become hot spots. In the two weeks that ended Thursday, Salt Lake County had nearly 617 cases per 100,000 people. Over the last week, Utah had the sixth-highest rate of new cases per 100,000 people of any state and set a state record for the number of people hospitalized with the virus. On Tuesday, Governor Gary Herbert ordered stricter restrictions on social gatherings and mask-wearing in Salt Lake County and other hard-hit counties, calling Utah’s outbreak “one of the worst” in the country and “unacceptable.” Yet despite the conditions at the start of the school year, Canyons School District took only modest steps to prevent the virus from spreading in its buildings. The state had mandated that students and staff members wear masks in school, allowing unmasked sports practice and competition. But with nearly 80 per cent of Canyons students opting for in-person school, the district seems to have made few adjustments to accommodate social distancing in classrooms. The district also did not make coronavirus testing part of its reopening plan, leaving those decisions to families. Canyons is also an example of how the nation’s 13,000 school districts are struggling to find workable policies in the absence of clear standards from the federal government and many state governments. The result has been a patchwork of policies varying from state to state and often district to district. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has faced pressure from the White House to avoid discouraging school districts from reopening, has declined to provide specific guidance on what districts should do when infections rise in a school or the surrounding community. The Utah Department of Health advised switching to remote learning for two weeks if a school reached 15 cases within two weeks or, for a very small school, if the number of cases represented a tenth of the student population. But the guidance was only a recommendation. Over the summer, Canyons said it would adhere to the state Health Department’s standard for closing schools. But when Corner Canyon reached 15 cases the school board decided to ignore the guidance, shifting the school to a hybrid schedule instead of going fully remote. The board ultimately adopted its own standard, which stipulated that it would shift high schools to remote learning when positive cases represented 2 per cent of the students attending in-person classes — mostly, one board member suggested, because at that point the number of students quarantined from possible exposure would become unmanageable. When the board decided to close Corner Canyon, on September 18, the school’s 77 reported cases represented more than 3 per cent of the roughly 2,250 students attending in person. (By contrast, New York City, which recently reopened schools on a hybrid model, has said that in certain situations it will close schools for only two positive cases in separate classrooms.) In a Canyons board meeting Sept. 15, when Corner Canyon was at 42 cases, one board member, Steve Wrigley, said he had looked in vain for national standards. “There really is not many guidelines out there right now — everybody is sort of flying by their seat,” Wrigley said. Another board member, Clareen Arnold, cited a CDC statement about the importance of in-person school to children’s mental health and development, inserted at the behest of the White House, as an argument for keeping Corner Canyon open. In a community that parents and teachers described as deeply divided over whether the virus represents a real threat, the board’s decision left parents on both sides angry. Some were upset that the board had ignored the Health Department’s guidance, while others thought that schools should not close until 10 per cent of the students had tested positive. Before the board made its decision, parents and students gathered with signs saying things like “Keep Our Schools OPEN!!! Keep Utah FREE!!!” One mother argued that since no students were being forced to attend school in person, no students should be forced to stay home. Many parents in the district do not support any virus restrictions. After Corner Canyon canceled most homecoming events, some parents organized their own homecoming party. The mayor of Draper, where the school is, said that he wished his constituents would follow public health guidance on matters like masking and social distancing but that he could not force them to. “I don’t think people are going to respond until they see people go into the hospital,” Mayor Troy Walker said. Walker said he had heard from some Corner Canyon parents that there was an agreement among mothers at the school — he called it a “mom code” — not to get their children tested for the virus even if they became ill, to avoid adding to the school’s case count and contributing to it being shut down. (He said he told these parents he did not agree with this approach.) Many parents and teachers are still bitter that the board did not close schools sooner. “We feel like we were deceived,” said Katie Nelson, a special education math teacher at a middle school in the district. Jennifer Santos, whose older son is a freshman at Brighton High School, another of the schools that temporarily closed, said that when the school reached 19 cases and remained open, she complained on the district’s Facebook page. “The answer was, ‘You’re welcome to keep your child home,’” she said. Other parents, however, said that they believed that the academic and mental health benefits of being in school outweighed what they saw as the minimal risk posed by the virus. A board member, Amanda Oaks, said that while there was concern nationally about the risks of students or teachers becoming ill from coronavirus in school, “My honest fear and the fear of some of my fellow board members is that that could completely flip the other direction as soon as we get a teen suicide associated with quarantine isolation.” Some teachers in Canyons also feel strongly about the value of keeping schools open. The teacher who was hospitalized, Charri Jensen, who teaches sewing and design, recovered enough to go home. In an interview, she said that she wanted people to take the virus more seriously. But she also said that when she was well enough she planned to go back to work. She had become a high school teacher because she loved the social rituals of high school — “the dances and the football games and the assemblies and the extracurricular things” — and it made her sad, she said, that her students were missing out on some of those traditions. There are these things I want these kids to be able to experience in life,” she said. “But then, is it worth it — for life, you know?” In September, as the Canyons board put off closing Corner Canyon High School, district officials and board members said that a vast majority of cases in the district’s schools were the result of exposures outside of school and that there was minimal spread within schools themselves. But a spokesman for the Salt Lake County Health Department, Nicholas Rupp, said it was very difficult to determine in most cases where someone was infected. In any event, once Corner Canyon shut its doors, cases among students and staff fell sharply. After a month of being closed, the school is set to reopen Monday. As of Wednesday, according to the district’s dashboard, it had between one and five cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/out-of-control-when-schools-opened-in-a-covid-19-hotspot-903855.html

Thereafter she is made to watch online classes from her Buds school at Kasargod in Kerala. While online education options have become an alternative for lakhs of students during the lockdown days, for the hundreds of students in special schools, especially their parents, the prolonged closure of schools has become a nightmare. Though online education options have been introduced to students of Buds schools, lack of interaction with other students was pushing many students to depression as well. Activities like therapies have also been hit owing to the closure of schools. With the students with deformities being confined to homes, their parents are finding it difficult to go for work to eke out a living as the children could not be left alone at homes. On a positive note, many students were exhibiting pleasure of being with parents and siblings for quite long time during the lockdown days. Kasargod district in Kerala, which has a large number of students with mental and physical deformities affected by use of endosulfan, is severely facing this issue. Chandravathi said that even as the school authorities were trying their best to keep the children lively though online classes and demonstrating activities, it was not at all an effective as schooling where the children could interact and mingle. Moreover, teaching special needs children require special skills, which most parents may not have. And one serious issue parents face in that they could not go for job by leaving the students alone at home, she told DH. Deepa Peroor, principal of the Mahatma Model BUDS School at Pullur Periya in Kasargod, said that for students who require special attention, counselling through video calls are being conducted. "We are also trying to get nod for conducting home visits," she said. As per data available from government, Kerala has around 140 Buds schools in which around 4,800 students were enrolled, half of which are those aged above 18. More time with family A positive side of the lockdown is that many special needs children were now able to spend more time with their parents and siblings. Lathika, mother of 14 year old Anirudh of Kasargod, said that Anirudh was finding pleasure spending time with his brother as well as other children in the neighbourhood. Some other parents have also shared similar experience. Chandravathi said that though Nandana earlier used to thrown away mobile phones, now she is friendly with mobile phones as her teachers interact through the phones. Deepa said that while around five per cent of students were down owing to the lack of schooling, many students seem to be happy on spending more time with family. Ambalathara Kunhikrishnan, an activist working for welfare of endosulfan victims, said that endosulfan victims of Kasargod were also affected by the difficulties in travelling to nearby Mangaluru for treatment and the minimum treatment facilities in Kasargod being restricted to Covid patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/lockdown-makes-life-of-special-needs-children-parents-miserable-903674.html

But Covid-19 pandemic changed their lives upside down, for good. Today, these 15 trans women have come together to launch Sahi Kalai Kuzhu, the country’s first trans women group that specializes in folk art, after having learnt parai aattam, karagaattam, oyilaatam, and poikaal kuthirai in just a few months. The dramatic change in their lives came when they met M Sankar, who works as an Assistant Professor with VOC College in Thoothukudi, when they went to receive provisions and rice after having lost their livelihood at an event. Sankar, who is a trained artist himself and runs Saha Kalai Kuzhu, volunteered to help the trans women earn a living by teaching them folk art. His students not just learned the art quickly but became professionals within no time that they have already begun performing at events, some of which were broadcast live. The brand-new art group also stood first in parai aattam, a dance-play performance by beating the hand-held drums, in a virtual competition recently. In May, when Sankar began training, there were 20 trans women but five of them opted out in the middle. The remaining 15 are undergoing rigorous training for nearly three hours every day since May at a playground in Tsunami colony in Thoothukudi, 610 km from here. “I am training them everyday in the afternoon. They (trans women) found it difficult in the beginning, but they adapted sooner than later. Within months, they came to the level of performing oyilaatam for half an hour on their own. The intention is to provide them an avenue to empower themselves and to ensure they do not go back to begging,” Sankar told DH. “They (trans women) can get opportunities to teach folk art to children in schools which lay stress on extra-curricular activities. Efforts are also on to get them with the Department of Art and Culture so that they get opportunities to perform at government events. They are being taught other forms of art now,” Sankar added. Bhoomika, a transwoman trained by Sankar, told DH: “We were always interested in learning art. But the doors never opened for us. When Sankar offered to train us, we were more than willing to learn. We are not just artists today, but confident women too. The folk art that we have learnt will make us financially independent sooner than later.” Teaching the art alone was not enough, Sankar knew and that is why he helped the trans women launch Sahi Kalai Kuzhu and ensured that they got a chance to perform. “They have done six performances so far. They will get more opportunities as folk art is much loved in rural areas and preferred during religious festivals. They have parai (drums) and other instruments that they need for performing. I ensured they bought them on their own so that they have a sense of belonging,” a smiling Sankar said. Aarthi, also part of the Sahi Kalai Kuzhu, said offers to perform give them renewed confidence about life. “When we won the first prize in parai aattam, our happiness knew no bounds. That achievement gave us confidence that we can be successful in life,” she said. But Sankar will not stop at this. He has thrown up a challenge to Sahi Kalai Kuzhu. “Once I finish training the trans women, I have decided to train a group of physically-challenged people in folk arts. Life becomes interesting only when there is a challenge. They will have a competitor in the new set of people I will train,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/trans-women-beat-covid-19-blues-to-learn-folk-art-903759.html

The consul staff used to call such illegal business by a code word 'consul is eating mangoes'. This was mentioned by Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar to the Customs. "Swapna told me that the diplomats at the consulate were in the business of bringing in cosmetics and other items in diplomatic cargo and selling it in Beemapalli (a place in Thiruvananthapuram city known for shops selling foreign goods). Swapna said that the consulate staff used to call such business by code word 'consul is eating mangoes'," said Sivasankar in his statement to the Customs earlier. Sivasankar maintained he was unaware of Swapna's involvement in gold smuggling. Though Swpana requested him to call the Customs assistant commissioner for releasing the diplomatic cargo (that contained 30 kg gold) in July, he did not intervene citing that the Customs would release it after the due process. Meanwhile, the Customs are suspecting that Sivasankar was deliberately complaining of discomforts to delay steps like arrest. He may be moving anticipatory bail petition at the High Court by Monday. The court restrained ED from arresting him till Oct 23. A bank official stated to the customs that Sivasankar pressurised him to convert around Rs. 1.4 core to US dollars for Swapna. He had earlier moved an anticipatory bail petition at the High Court and the court restrained ED from arresting him till October 23.

The TTD has over Rs 12,000 crore deposited in various banks. The BJP alleges the proposed investment as to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore, from those deposits maturing soon. Citing a fall in interest rates to between 3 and 4%, the TTD’s finance committee had on August 13 recommended investment in central government securities to earn higher interest. Documents accessed by DH show that in 2019-20, TTD earned an interest of Rs 857 crore on deposits. In 2020-21, it is estimated to be Rs 706 crore. Temple money, till now, is being deposited in nationalised banks for a period of one year to 15 months, based on the interest rate predicted. The new proposal was made “since major investments (in banks) are maturing in December 2020". The TTD board of trustees meeting on August 28 approved a motion in this regard. However, the resolution authorised by TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy, added the state government securities option too, “to avail the interest advantage". This approval is seen by detractors as a plan at the behest of the Jaganmohan Reddy government to channel the huge sums to aid the state's reportedly dwindling revenues. “The state government has a Rs 3-lakh crore debt and is unable to accrue any more loans. Which is why it has now eyed Lord Venkateshwara’s money,” BJP Andhra Pradesh unit secretary Bhanu Prakash Reddy told DH.  Bhanu Prakash, who earlier served as a TTD board member, says the TTD should also not invest in central securities or deposit in scheduled banks. “TTD is not a profit-making venture to vie for 7 or 8% interest. The TTD funds would be secured, only when they are with the SBI or other nationalised banks,” he said. In a legal notice sent to the TTD board chairman and members on Friday, Bhanu Prakash threatened to approach the Andhra Pradesh high court “if they proceed with investments in government securities". He also warned of a BJP-led statewide agitation. Y V Subba Reddy, a former YSRCP Lok Sabha MP, is a close relative of CM Jaganmohan Reddy. He was made the TTD board chairman last year after Reddy assumed power. Following the furore, the TTD has issued a clarification saying, “No investment was made till now either in the central government or in different state government securities.” “The board wanted to examine the investment option in the wake of falling interest rates. Now, this may not be required to be acted upon, as the interest rates may go up, in the light of buoyancy in the economy in the wake of unlock guidelines,” a TTD statement said, adding that “the TTD may continue to invest in bank fixed deposits. However, TTD has defended the securities investments option as “not newly brought in by the (present) board but allowed under TTD provisions existing since 1990". The TTD also claimed that a lower interest offered by the banks would make the functioning of the Annaprasadam trust, Balaji Institute of Surgery Research and Rehabilitation for the Disabled (BIRRD) and Gosamrakshana, burdensome. The TTD’s plans, earlier this year, to auction some of the land parcels and other properties donated by devotees to the Lord, to accrue more income has invited nationwide criticism. In a damage control measure, the Reddy government had in May issued orders suspending the land sale proposals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ttd-trust-in-row-again-over-managing-lord-venkateshwaras-wealth-903835.html

18-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka to hit 10 lakh cases in 3 weeks, may need 50,000 beds: Experts||Karnataka might require 22,500 oxygen beds, 16,800 ICU beds and 11,200 ventilator beds over the next three to six weeks, an expert has warned. The caution comes as the state is tipped to hit the 10-lakh mark in total Covid-19 cases, and reach a total death toll of 12,800 by November 12, according to an assessment by the Jeevan Raksha project, a public-private partnership that has earned plaudits from the state government for accurately assessing Covid-19 numbers. As per available government data, there are 10,823 beds in government Covid-19 hospitals. These numbers have been augmented by a few private hospitals. An additional 11,328 beds were available in Bengaluru Urban, as per official data from the BBMP as of October 14. Out of these, 635 were ICU beds and 509 were ventilator beds. “The higher the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), the higher the demand for critical medical infrastructure. Oxygen supply, ICU beds and ventilators should be arranged based on the TPR in a district,” said Sanjeev Mysore, the convener for Jeevan Raksha. The state’s current TPR is higher than what the World Health Organisation regards as a manageable number.  Sanjeev explained that the projected bed requirements were also made as per the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare data which has determined that roughly 1% of all Covid-19 cases require ventilator support, while 2% require an ICU and another 3% require oxygen support. “The projections were made considering the expected case numbers,” he added. Just how plausible are these caseload and toll projections? Jeevan Raksha says the state will see three lakh new cases and 3,000 new deaths in the next 26 days. In comparison, in the 30 days of September, the state registered 2.59 lakh new cases and 2,982 deaths.  Health Commissioner Pankaj Pandey said the government has improved infrastructure in taluk hospitals. “We are well prepared for any surge. We have substantial numbers of ICU beds with ventilators in hospitals. Even if cases increase, we are prepared to tackle them,” he said. Another health official told DH that there are sufficient numbers of oxygenated beds at taluk hospitals, but ventilator beds were less common as they require a higher degree of trained staff to handle them. However, an independent data analyst who did not want to be named noted that there is data mismatch coming out from districts other than Bengaluru Urban. “In the rest of Karnataka, the number of active cases and daily deaths are falling but ICU use is on the rise. This is unusual,” the analyst said. The BBMP has acknowledged an ICU and ventilator bedding crisis in the city. In an order issued on October 15, the BBMP commissioner has authorised the Special Officers of the city’s eight zonal commands to oversee hospitals with 50 to 100 beds, in order to ensure that they comply with the 50% reservation of beds for government-referred Covid-19 patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-to-hit-10-lakh-cases-in-3-weeks-may-need-50000-beds-experts-903474.html

18-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Bypolls: Polls in the time of pandemic||Is a simple ‘namaste’ as effective as a handshake in establishing a connection with a voter? As Karnataka faces its first set of elections during the Covid-19 pandemic, candidates for the upcoming polls are facing such seemingly small, yet sensitive predicaments. Teachers and graduates are set to elect their representatives to the Legislative Council on October 28 and on November 3, Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar (RR Nagar) will have bypolls. There’s no getting around the fact that it’s a tricky path to tread for candidates who are campaigning amidst a steady rise in Covid-19 cases. “If we refuse a handshake in the interest of maintaining social distancing, there is a risk of the voter perceiving us as inaccessible or hostile,” says D T Srinivasa of the BJP, who is contesting the South East Graduates constituency election as an independent candidate. Unsurprisingly, not all political leaders are convinced that the polls should be held at this time. Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) is among the most vocal critics of the decision. He recently warned of a spike in cases, mentioning his own example of contracting fever after campaigning in Sira. Srinivasa says he has established one clear rule for his campaigning: No speeches or public interaction without social distancing. “If there is a crowd of more than 50-100 people, I will not turn up at the venue unless social distancing norms are strictly followed,” he said. The Election Commission has issued a comprehensive set of guidelines to be followed during the campaign and while voting. But while masks, gloves and sanitisers are all fine, controlling the crowd and reaching out to voters amidst the pandemic continue to remain causes for worry. That is not all. Leading the campaign of parties are leaders who have only recently recovered from Covid-19. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D K Shivakumar and Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan are among them. Undergoing frequent Covid-19 tests has become a requirement for many campaigners. JD(S) leader T A Saravana, who is actively taking part in campaigning for the RR Nagar bypoll, said he, like several others, was taking the Covid-19 test once a week. “We are doing meetings at the street-level by limiting the number of people. We have to be careful not to overwhelm voters when we go for door-to-door campaigning. We go in small groups with a maximum of three people. We quickly convey what is needed and exit from the premises. Not just the voters and the politicians, even managing media representatives is a challenge,” he pointed out. As per Election Commission guidelines, door-to-door campaigning should be restricted to a maximum of five people, apart from following all other precautionary measures as mandated for public spaces. In the 2018 assembly polls, the voter turnout in Sira was 84.77% and 54.34% in RR Nagar. The turnout in the upcoming bypolls is expected to be lower due to the pandemic. While political leaders have their own set of concerns, the Election Commission too has had to face its share of difficulties. Not only do they have to abide by regular electoral norms, but they also have to follow the guidelines of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). “Social distancing during polls means an increase in polling stations, EVMs and vehicles transporting all the necessary gear. As a result, the cost of conducting the polls is likely to go up by at least 50% compared with the previous years,” Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-bypolls-polls-in-the-time-of-pandemic-903506.html

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said many villages in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Yadgir and Raichur districts were either completely or partially submerged due to floods caused by heavy rains last week and he would undertake an aerial survey of the affected areas on October 21. According to the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority (KDMA), a total of 20, 269 people, including 15, 078 in badly-hit Kalaburgi, have been evacuated so far by the personnel of the Army, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) besides local police and district authorities. There was no loss to human lives anywhere in the flood-affected areas whereas two cattle died in Vijayapura, KDMA Commissioner Manoj Rajan said. A total of 111 villages in the four districts have been affected by the floods, caused by heavy rains and water released by the dams in neighbouring Maharashtra. "Two NDRF, one SDRF and one Army column have been deployed in Kalaburagi while two Indian Air Force helicopters are on standby. Similarly, the NDRF and the Army personnel are deployed in other three districts. Situation is under control," Rajan told PTI. Yediyurappa said the floods have also resulted in damage to the crops. "In the given circumstances, it has become necessary to carry out an aerial survey to understand the actual situation. Against this background, I will be carrying out an aerial survey of Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur and Vijayapura on October 21," he said in a release in Bengaluru. Officials said river Bhima continued to remain in spate in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Yadgir districts while the surging Krishna river affected villages in Raichur. Bhima, the major tributary of Krishna, has been in spate for the past one week due to the torrential rains in neighbouring Maharashtra and in parts of Karnataka. The river was flowing 4.45 metres above the danger level and 1.61 metres above its previous Highest Flood Level, the Central Water Commission in its latest update. According to the KDMA, as many as 55 villages across six taluks of Kalaburagi, thirteen villages in three taluks of Yadgir and 26 villages of Vijayapura were badly affected by the floods. The authority said it has also identified 157 villages in Kalaburagi, 45 villages in Yadgir and 26 villages in Vijayapura as vulnerable. Expressing solidarity with the flood-hit people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the state of every cooperation from the Centre. This is the third time the state has been hit by floods in the past three months following heavy monsoon rains.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/army-on-rescue-duty-in-4-flood-hit-karnataka-districts-cm-yediyurappa-to-undertake-aerial-survey-903626.html

With only his bicycle for company, Ramchandra Dandekar has been travelling barefoot for at least 10 km every day to villages in Mul, Pombhurna and Ballarshah talukas for the last 60 years, providing free doorstep treatment to people. The current health crisis has not deterred the practitioner of Homeopathy and Ayurveda from stepping out of his home. Talking to PTI, Dandekar says, "My routine is the same as before. I want to continue to provide selfless service to the poor in villages." After completing his diploma from the Nagpur College of Homeopathy in 1957-58, Dandekar worked as a lecturer at the Chandrapur Homeopathy College for a year, before shifting to rural areas to serve in villages. His elder son Jayant Dandekar says the octogenarian has a fixed timetable for his visits to villages on weekdays and carries only his medical kit and medicines with him. He does not even carry a mobile phone or a watch during his trips. "If he has to attend to patients in faraway talukas, he travels by bus and visits the homes on cycles kept in villages. And if he gets late, he chooses to stay back at someone's house," his son says. "Everyone calls him 'Doctor Sahab Mul waale', and he visits around 20 homes in each village," he says. Although his visits have now reduced a little, the doctor has continued to serve his patients amid the pandemic, despite the risk of infection. "He guides and advises people to get admitted to nearby hospitals if they are found suffering from fever or other symptoms of the virus," says his son, who is proud of his father's selfless service.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/octogenarian-doctor-in-maharashtra-braves-covid-19-to-treat-villagers-903569.html

Last year, the state recorded a drop of 8.47 per cent in all road accidents and fatalities also came down by 3.56 per cent, according to statistics of the highway police. The state recorded 39,878 road accidents in 2016, and the number dropped to 36,056 in 2017, 35,717 in 2018 and 32,925 in 2019, as per the data. The data showed that 'without injury accidents' also decreased in the state in the last three years. A total of 6,271 without injury accidents were recorded in the state in 2016 and the figure came down to 3,568 in 2019, a record drop of 43.10 per cent. The state recorded 11,787 fatal accidents last year as compared to 12,098 in 2018, a drop of 2.57 per cent. The road fatalities also came down from 13,648 in 2018 to 12,788 last year, a decrease of 3.56 per cent. In 2016, a total of 12,935 people were killed in 11,780 fatal accidents, while 12,511 people were killed in 11,454 fatal accidents in 2017, as per the data. A senior Maharashtra highway police official told PTI that the drop in number of road accidents was the result of efforts taken by the highway and state police over the years. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and Pune, Solapur, Ahmednagar and Nashik districts have been contributing around 30 per cent of the road accidents in Maharashtra, he said. "The highway police had introduced the intelligent traffic management system on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. As a result, the number fatal accidents reduced on the expressway from 96 in 2018 to 74 last year," he said. Similarly, fatalities on this expressway also came down to 92 last year as compared to 110 in 2018, he said. The official further said the number of 'black spots' also reduced to 1,000 from 1,050 with corrective measures taken by the highway police. "This helped the police in making roads safer for users," he said. 'Black spots' are the spots where five road accidents involving fatalities and grievous injuries were reported during the last three years. To check over-speeding, 96 interceptor vehicles armed with speed guns were distributed across the state last year. Of these, 66 were given to the highway police and 34 were allotted to district police units, the official said. "These vehicles helped the police in curbing the menace of over-speeding which ultimately resulted in reducing the number of road accidents," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/road-accidents-in-maharashtra-dip-in-last-3-years-highway-police-903585.html

He as speaking in Hindi through video conferencing at a function organised to mark the 101st Foundation Day of Gujarat Vidyapith here on Sunday. Gandhi called for the need to reconsider the country's economic policy as the one that encouraged industrialisation and urbanisation, causing "huge population unsettlement" and forcing farmers to migrate to the cities in large numbers, only spurred the Covid-19 pandemic. "Economic policy of liberalisation, privatisation, or globalisation, whatever we call it, caused a huge population unsettlement, and not resettlement. The way the population is growing in cities is fanning today's (Covid-19) pandemic," he said. "Will not the pandemic increase due to the movement of the population towards the city? It is more than necessary today to reconsider our economic policy," he said. "Had we followed a different policy, we should have got more hospitals, hostels for nurses, lab technicians, and not giant industrial projects at government level, and large numbers of temples, mosques, at social level. "Had we followed a different policy, we would have been much better equipped to fight the pandemic," said Gandhi, a retired diplomat who also served as West Bengal governor from 2004 till 2009. Even when this pandemic goes away, the threat of a new pandemic will remain, unless issues of massive population displacement, urban squalor, lack of hygiene and negligence of people are addressed, he further said. "This pandemic has come after 100 years, but who knows, a new virus may emerge every year," Gandhi said, adding that it is the poor who suffer because of those who during an outbreak forget the rules of social distancing, wearing masks, sanitisation etc in the name of festivals. "Our country, and the entire world is trying, and to some extent succeeding, in controlling the (Covid-19) disease. But if we forget rules in the name of festivals, then who will be affected the worst? Those who are poor, who have six to ten people living in one room, those living in slums etc. They will be the worst hit," he said. In his speech, Gandhi said farmers have addressed the issue of the country's food security, but policies adopted by the government forced them to migrate towards the cities. "We must accept we have made a huge mistake, one we are making since Independence. Who can be against industrialisation? But there is a limit to industrialisation," he said. "If there is anybody saving our country today, it is our farmers. At the medical level, our doctors, nurses, lab technicians, sanitary workers, are like gods to us. When they work by risking their lives, they are god-like. If we look at the economic, political and social level, our farmers are saving the country," he said. However, Gandhi said, a policy which claimed farmers are increasing in number and need to be shifted from agriculture has led to such a situation, and all those who did nothing to improve this policy are culprits. Gandhi said India needs to adopt policies like the one by Gujarat Vidyapith Chancellor Ela Bhatt who has empowered women through her organisation Self-Employed Women's Association. "Had we followed similar policies at the national level, we would not have been in a situation like this," he claimed. Gujarat Vidyapith was founded by Mahatma Gandhi on October 18, 1920, and was accorded the status of a deemed university in 1963. After Gandhiji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr Rajendra Prasad and Morarji Desai served as its chancellors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/poor-policy-behind-weak-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic-says-mahatmas-grandson-gopalkrishna-903655.html

"Standing crops have been destroyed and the land has been damaged. Everything needs to be rectified. The state government cannot do it alone. We will speak to the Centre as well regarding a long-term package and immediate assistance," said Pawar, whose party is a coalition partner in the Thackeray-led state government. The NCP chief asked farmers not to give up hope. "It is a huge crisis and we all will tide over it unitedly," he said. Pawar recalled how the region bravely faced the 1993 earthquake in Latur and Osmanabad, with its epicentre at Killari (in Latur), in which nearly 10,000 people died. "We overcame the problems that time and now also, we will rise to the occasion," said Pawar, who was the state's chief minister at that time. Pawar said the CM has to stay alert on many occasions, one of them being immersion of idols during the Ganesh festival. "Until the last idol is immersed, the chief minister cannot sleep. That day, there was a problem in Panvel (Navi Mumbai) during the immersion and I was busy in discussions with the local administration for resolution of the problem. "It was 3.15 am and I went to sleep. But at 4 am, the doors and windows of my house shook and I realised it was an earthquake. I found out the epicentre was Killari," he recalled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/unprecedented-agri-losses-due-to-floods-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-903726.html

According to him, the state government has limitations, however, the Centre can help them. “I have told other MPs that we will go to New Delhi in the next eight to ten days and have a meeting with the Prime Minister on this. The remedy for the issue must be found by the state and the Centre together,” he said during his tour of flood-affected areas of Osmanabad. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is slated to visit the worst-affected district of Solapur on Monday. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is also travelling in Pune and Solapur districts. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP, who is party’s campaign in-charge in poll-bound Bihar, will also be touring the flood-affected places of the state.

18-10-2020||West||Sharad Pawar’s historic rain-soaked speech marks one year||As he marked the first anniversary of his rain-soaked speech in Satara, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, who would turn 80 in just a couple of months, on Sunday hit the ground as he preferred to meet people devastated by the last week's megafloods. Pawar, the chief architect of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, flew in a helicopter from his hometown of Baramati in Pune district to the flood-affected areas. The 79-year-old Pawar, who knows the pulse, preferred to be with the affected people and discussed the damage and assured relief. The NCP, on its Twitter handle, put out a video of the October 18 2019 speech in the run-up to the Vidhan Sabha polls in Maharashtra. “Varun Raja (rain god in the Hindu mythology) has blessed the NCP. With his blessings, Satara district will now do magic in the upcoming polls,” he had said in Satara exactly a year ago – and within months changed the political situation in Maharashtra – as the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance broke and Uddhav Thackeray removed Devendra Fadnavis as the Chief Minister. Through midway to the new government, he suffered a setback when his nephew Ajit Pawar broke ranks and joined Fadnavis to establish a government that crumbled within 48 hours. The speech was made at a campaign rally for NCP's Shriniwas Dadasaheb Patil in the Satara Lok Sabha bypolls, in which he had defeated Udayanraje Bhosale, the descendent of legendary Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who quit NCP to join BJP. Pawar, a four-time Maharashtra Chief Minister, and two-time Union Agriculture Minister, once again showed and led by example – when he launched a tour of Marathwada and Western Maharashtra. Even Pawar’s daughter and Baramati MP Supriya Sule tweeted about the speech. “Against all odds, if one holds the ground and fights on is one whose name is Sharad Pawar,” she said. “This unprecedented moment will always remain an inspirational memory in the History of Maharashtra,” said NCP general secretary and former Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel, a close aide of Pawar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sharad-pawar-s-historic-rain-soaked-speech-marks-one-year-903731.html
