05-10-2020||First Edit||Never-ending lawlessness in UP||The death of a 19-year-old Dalit girl from Hathras in UP, after alleged gangrape by upper caste men and the incidents that followed, including the secret cremation of the body and the attempts at cover-up by the police and the administration, have reminded the country of the Nirbhaya episode in Delhi in 2012. The incident has touched a painful chord among people across the country, and there is widespread outrage over it. The handling of the crime by the state authorities has evoked strong protests. Everything about it went wrong and this is considered to be deliberate and part of a pattern that has been seen in the responses of the authorities to lawless actions in the state. The state’s responses to crime have themselves been lawless and they have aggravated the situation. This is at the root of the revulsion and anger among large sections of people in the country.   The mishandling of the crime, the possible destruction of evidence, the inexplicable action of cremation of the body without the consent and presence of the family, the siege of the village by the police, reports of threats by government officials and the police and prevention of the media and opposition leaders from reaching the village have all helped to create the impression that the police and the administration have much to hide about the incident. The initial response of the police was especially dubious. There are reports that forensic samples were not analysed in time and so doubts have arisen about the forensic report now. The hurried cremation is thought to have been an attempt to destroy evidence. There is suspicion that the gang rape charge may not stick, in spite of the girl’s dying declaration which said that she was raped.  The state government has suspended some police officials in a delayed response, after the uproar and the protests. It has also announced a CBI investigation and some compensation to the family. But the government should have acted immediately after the incident instead of reacting to the events. The Allahabad High Court has suo motu taken cognisance of the case as it involves ‘’allegation of high-handedness by the state authorities, resulting in violation of basic human and fundamental rights’’. The steps taken by the government have not satisfied the members of the family too, who have demanded a court-monitored investigation instead of a CBI probe. There is a case for this as the family’s sentiments and views are important in such a situation. The Hathras incident has again tellingly exposed the callous culture of highhandedness and impunity, and other faultiness in UP’s society and administration, which have steadily deepened over time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/never-ending-lawlessness-in-up-897358.html
05-10-2020||In Perspective||Integrate yoga in curricula ||The curricular content at all levels of education is heavily loaded with core subjects and skill components, to the exclusion of value education depicting the glory Indian culture and heritage. Yoga is one such glaring example.  When the entire world is admiring India for contributing yoga as a global cultural icon, it is paradoxical that our educational institutions need to be reminded about its immense potentials in moral and value education. This situation needs to be urgently corrected by affirmative action. Yoga is  one of the orthodox schools of our philosophical traditions. It is a collective of physical, mental and spiritual practices which originated in ancient India. However, it has also transcended religious barriers as its different versions were practiced by Hindu, Buddhism and Jainism.  The practice of yoga dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BCE). A mention of yoga is made in the Rigveda and also the Upanishads. Swami Vivekananda toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s to enlighten them about the rich values of Indian culture and heritage, using yoga as an effective medium of communication.  As a tribute, a dedicated university for yoga – S-VYASA (Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana) has been established near Bengaluru. This locational advantage of a renowned global resources institution needs to be harnessed by our education institutions to frame meaningful curricula. The potentials and latitude of yoga in value education are provided in a nutshell below. In the Indian epic, the Bhagavad Gita,  yoga is described as a meditative means to overcome suffering - Samadhi (concentration), find inner peace and salvation and to experience enlightened consciousness. In fact, each of the 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita is considered as a different yoga.  It is essential to understand that the true meaning of yoga lies in its cultural, religious and philosophical moorings rather than viewing it as a set of physical exercises and body postures.  Therefore, all educational institutions should incorporate the true essence of yoga with appropriate emphasis in school and higher education so that the youth are ingrained with its historical and cultural legacies, in a timeline.  Crafting a value education package comprising yoga and its benefits is urgently called for to promote holistic personality development, healthy lifestyle and at a different platitude, promote ‘Indianness’ and social leadership.  The guiding principle of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 is to conserve and promote the rich heritage of ancient Indian Knowledge and practices (section 0.7). Relevant courses in arts, history, culture and yoga should be strategically used by educational institutions for meaningful social engagements (section 12.7).  The pluralistic choices of Indians in integrative healthcare education system makes it imperative to give basic understanding of yoga with allopathic, ayurveda, sidhha, unani, homeopathy, community medicine and paramedical system of medical education (section 17.4). It has been a time-tested healthy practice to embed curricula of core subjects in the overall curricular matrix of value education/non-core subjects to ensure holistic personality development of students.  This measure along with other healthy practices such as meaningful celebration of public holidays and effective mentoring would combinatorically imbibe the students with a global outlook associated with sensitivity to Indian ethos, ethics, values, heritage and culture.  The NEP 2020 provides an excellent opportunity to revisit school and higher education curricula, including professional education, to accomplish the objective.  Cultural ecosystem Prime Minister Narendra Modi has succeeded in promoting yoga as a unique contribution of India to the global cultural ecosystem. He has also been instrumental in establishing S-VYASA, the dedicated university for yoga. In addition, integrating yoga in our lifestyle would enrich ‘Indianness’ as never before. The United Nations General Assembly has declared June 21 as International Day of yoga.  In addition, declaration of yoga as an intangible cultural heritage by Unesco has helped build yoga as an international cultural brand name.  It is noteworthy that yoga has developed into a worldwide multi-billion-dollar business, involving classes, certification of teachers, clothing, books, videos, equipment and tourism-holidays. There are ample opportunities for the Indian entrepreneurs to take yoga to new heights of international presence by crafting innovative platforms. A desirable outcome of education should be to prime the students as ambassadors of Indian culture. This objective could be accomplished only when the government as a regulatory stakeholder mandates the educational institutions, from sixth grade to PG:  To ensure that the curricula integrate yoga with appropriate emphasis in their value education packages; involve the S-VYASA University in an advisory role  To adopt innovative ways to convey the healthcare benefits of yoga in boosting immunity of the human body, especially at the testing times of pandemic lockdown.  Create opportunities to take the benefits of yoga beyond the classrooms, to involve the stakeholders in issues relating to extension work such as school complex (cluster) management.  With concerned efforts of educational institutions, yoga could transform India into an “Incredible India”. All of India is looking at the educational institutions to make this aspiration come true.

Reviewing the Covid-19 containment measures in Mysuru, Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar said that what went wrong in Kerala shall not repeat in Karnataka. Drawing an analogy between neighbouring state Kerala’s decision to throw open everything for Onam celebrations and simple meaningful celebration of Dasara in Karnataka, the minister said, “Covid-19 cases in Kerala shot up and touched seven to eight thousand every day after they opened everything for Onam celebration. The same mistake shall not happen in Mysuru and hence the health officials and experts have recommended a simple Dasara. We will take a final call after consulting with all stakeholders and the chief minister.” Elaborating on the Mysuru’s position, Dr Sudhakar said, “Even though initially Mysuru had the highest load of Covid-19 cases, mortality was under control and thereby emerging as a model to the entire country. But today, the district has failed to contain the spread. Hence, we have been reviewing the progress and the deputy commissioner has sought two weeks' time to contain the spread of the virus.” The minister also revealed that he has directed the Mysuru district administration to conduct tests on all the senior citizens of the districts. The district reportedly has 96,000 senior citizens suffering from various ailments. The minister also said that the Mysuru’s Covid-19 mortality rate has been way higher than that of the state in the last few months and the global average in the last week. “If the state’s mortality rate is 1.5%, Mysuru district has reported 1.9%. Similarly, the global mortality rate is 3.5%. However, in the last one week, Mysuru has reported a mortality rate of 3.9% which is way above the world rate. Also, the district has a 10% infection rate and has not done satisfactorily on testing parameter. It could achieve only 65% to date which is not so encouraging,” Dr Sudhakar explained. Acknowledging that vigilance on home isolation patients has been lacking, the minister said as many as 11 deaths have happened at home and the same shall not be repeated in the coming days. “The administration must draw up a plan, especially for Dasara, and work towards containing the infection in all the 65 wards. The government has deployed 68 resident doctors in Covid hospitals and yet there have been complaints on lack of treatment which can not be tolerated anymore,” the minister cautioned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-mistakes-made-during-onam-in-kerala-shall-not-be-repeated-in-mysuru-during-dasara-says-dr-k-sudhakar-897718.html

It is said that the mother elephant attempted to feed milk to it and failed as the baby male elephant could not stand on its own for two to three days. The baby elephant got separated from its mother. Later, villagers alerted the officials of the Forest Department and veterinarian Muralidhar provided treatment to the injured elephant. Finally, it was brought to Sakrebailu for additional treatment.   Speaking to DH, veterinary officer Vinay, who is treating the baby elephant, said, though intake of milk is good, the survival rate is low. At this stage, bone replacement and post-therapy are not possible. So rest is the best treatment for it now. "We are hopeful that it will recover from its defect in the coming months," he stated. He admitted that it was a challenging task as the baby elephant is suffering from a neurological disorder and it has not consumed the cholesterol milk at all from its mother. After two days of treatment, it is showing some improvement to stand on its own. With the arrival of the baby elephant, the number of elephants rose to 23 in the Sakrebailu elephants' camp.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/injured-baby-elephant-gets-treatment-at-sakrebailu-camp-897802.html

The latest CBI raid on Shivakumar's house is another attempt to derail our preparation for bypolls,” Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah said, condemning the raids.  I strongly condemn this. CBI sleuths are conducting searches in 14 locations - nine in Karnataka, four in Delhi and one in Mumbai - in connection with a disproportionate assets case.  AICC General Secretary incharge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala said the CBI should focus on the corruption in the B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government. “The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding Shivakumar won’t deter us,” he said. “CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yediyurappa government. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!” he added.  2/2Let Modi & Yeddyurappa Govts & BJP’s frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers & leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Late last year, Shivakumar was incarcerated for 50 days in connection with alleged money laundering. He was appointed Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president in March this year.  KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed said the raids were “a heinous act” as the BJP feared defeat in the November 3 bypolls to Sira and Rajarajeshwari assembly segments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-defends-d-k-shivakumar-attacks-bjp-on-cbi-raids-897453.html

05-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Arrogance will prove costly for Congress: HD Kumaraswamy||The JD(S) on Monday mounted an aggressive attack on former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah as the feud between him and the regional party’s leader HD Kumaraswamy has escalated ahead of the November 3 bypolls. The fresh trigger for the feud was Siddaramaiah’s scathing remarks against the JD(S) on Sunday during the induction of over 90 people from Sira. Siddaramaiah said the JD(S) was not a political party. “One leader who flourished and became deputy CM in the JD(S) has now spoken lightly about the JD(S). Having lured JD(S) people for lack of candidates in the bypolls, is your party a political party,” Kumaraswamy asked. “Is Congress that feeds off of its own friends, has been rejected by people and hustles with other parties, a political party anymore? If the Congress continues with its arrogance, then there’s no doubt that it will lose ground in Karnataka as well,” Kumaraswamy said. On Sunday, Siddaramaiah mocked the JD(S) saying the regional party would never come to power on its own. “They’ll always ride on someone else’s horse,” he said. Referring to Kumaraswamy’s recent emotional appeal with the people of Sira, Siddaramaiah said: “The drama isn’t new. Even HD Deve Gowda was doing that. Politics is about serving people, and not about asking votes by saying you’d die otherwise.” To this, Kumaraswamy said Congress was in dire straits. “In how many states is the Congress in power on its own strength? Who is riding on someone else’s shoulder and where? Will the leader who has tasted the salt of JD(S) answer these questions,” Kumaraswamy asked. “In the 2018 elections, this great leader who swore on fathers was defeated by people. He kept saying that ‘that party’ won’t come to power, and people showed him the importance of swearing. In the upcoming bypolls, people will teach him a lesson. Let’s wait,” Kumaraswamy said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/arrogance-will-prove-costly-for-congress-hd-kumaraswamy-897759.html

05-10-2020||Main Article||Will woes of farmers vanish?||Three important bills concerning the farm sector were passed recently amid contrasting voices of the ruling and opposition parties. Under the first bill, a farmer can sell his output anywhere outside the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), which in turn allows him to carry out intra-state and inter-state trade of agriculture and perhaps help earn better returns.  The state governments are prohibited from levying any market fee or cess outside the APMC areas which would reduce state earnings from APMCs. The second bill on the other hand provides a framework for contract farming. Here, a farmer and a contracting agency can have a prior agreement about produce and its price. In case of any disputes regarding the compliance of the contract terms at a later date, a dispute settlement mechanism will be put in place.  The third bill concerns stocking of agriculture commodities which allows the building of stocks for agriculture produce, except in times of emergencies like war or steep price rise. This bill will also have strong implications for price formation.  The ruling party considers these bills will facilitate a liberalised and competitive market structure to the agriculture sector and benefit farmers through better price realisation.  Certain issues are worth noting here. The motive behind the creation of APMC structure decades ago was to provide a better price to the farmers through an auction mechanism where buyers and sellers meet and prices are realised through competitive bids.  But economic theory tells us that a (perfectively) competitive market requires large number of buyers as well as sellers and flow of information. However, as buyers are much smaller in numbers than sellers, there are collusive agreements between the buyers and the commission agents who carry out the auction process at the APMCs. As a result, and as is well-known, prices are not favourable to the sellers, that is, the farmers.  Given the fact that 80% of Indian farmers are small and marginal and that they may not themselves be able to sell their produce in markets outside their states due to high transaction costs, it is easy to see why a trader class will continue to flourish.  The percentage of farmers benefitting through contract farming is also meagre in India. The principal question is whether allowing trade outside the premises of the mandi will be sufficient to attract a considerably large number of buyers that may bring up the price level?  There is an example of Bihar which repealed its APMC Act in 2006 with a similar objective to attract private investment in the sector and gave charge of the markets to the sub-divisional officers in that area.  The state has not only failed to attract investment for new market infrastructure, the existing infrastructure has also eroded over time due to poor care and maintenance. There are a few states where APMCs were never in existence - Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram and Sikkim. They don’t exist in some Union Territories also - Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman & Diu and Dadar and Nagar Haveli. Are these states and UTs in a better position when it comes to marketing? The market practice in most of these states happens through rural haats, weekly markets and shandis.  In Kerala, private shops exist in the vicinity of producing centres but they do not cater to all commodities and consequently, farmers have to approach different avenues for selling their commercial produce. In Sikkim, marketing takes place in kisan bazaars and weekly grameen haats which serve as rural periodical markets.  In other north-eastern states as well as Union Territories as mentioned above, there is no systematic marketing infrastructure for agricultural produce. The biggest issue in such markets is the lack of information on prices and arrival of produce.  The Committee of State Ministers, constituted in 2010 for agricultural marketing reforms, observed that complete deregulation of markets would not help in attracting adequate private investment to make substantial change.   Infrastructure development It noted that there is a need for an appropriate legal and institutional structure with a regulation having developmental thrust to ensure orderly functioning of markets and to attract investment for infrastructure development.  In this light, the existing Gramin Haats whose number is almost four times compared to APMC mandis and which are spread throughout the country, need strengthening to improve agriculture marketing and providing an appropriate price to the farmers. This was also suggested by the 62nd report of Standing Committee on Agriculture 2018-19 constituted by the 16th Lok Sabha. A better market infrastructure where more sellers, as well as buyers, participate to bring about a competitive and remunerative price to the farmers can only improve the state of the Indian farmers.  One of the major problems of agriculture produce marketing is the perishable nature of agricultural products, especially the horticulture and animal produces. Cold storage facility is crucial for farmers to store his produce to sell at a later date at a better price.  But this critical infrastructure continues to remain poor in the country. This is a major lacuna that needs to be filled if we wish to increase the income of our farmers.  A presumption that the market mechanism will bring investment to this essential infrastructure sector may not come true without a proper level-playing field for agriculture vis-a-vis rest of the economy. The role of the public sector basic investment remains the key for the same.

05-10-2020||National||Hathras incident no different than atrocities on Hindu girls in Pakistan, says Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut Sunday likened the Hathras incident in Uttar Pradesh, wherein a 19-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped and killed, to “atrocities being committed against Hindu girls in Pakistan”. In a write-up in the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut also took a veiled jibe at actress Kangana Ranaut over her “Mumbai-Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK)” remark wondering why nobody has called Hathras a Pakistan yet. “The Hathras victim was not a celebrity and she was not on drugs. She did not have any illegal construction (built by) spending crores of rupees. She was a simple girl whose dead body was illegally burnt in the dead of the night. All this happened in Yogi's (Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath’s) ‘Ramrajya’ (concept of ideal rule). “We hear that such incidents happen in Pakistan where Hindu girls are kidnapped, raped and murdered. What happened in Hathras was no different. So far no one has called Hathras a Pakistan," he said in his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’. Raut said that identity of a rape victim should never be revealed, but a photograph of the Hathras victim in a hospital was circulated. “Those who supported Kangana Ranaut's baseless comments against Mumbai and Maharashtra and demanded justice for her when her illegal construction was pulled down (by the Mumbai civic body last month), are now silent and have become invisible when it comes to demanding justice for the Hathras victim,” he wrote. He questioned the “silence” of the National Commission for Women’s chairperson Rekha Sharma, who had filed a case against Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik for his remarks against Ranaut, in the Hathras case. “Has justice eluded the Hathras victim because she was a Dalit?" Raut asked. He also criticised Union minister and Dalit leader Ramdas Athawale for “keeping mum” on the case. "The Dalit movement and Ambedkar thoughts have been destroyed," he said. Raut said 12,257 incidents of gang-rape have taken reported in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh from 2014 to 2019, “but justice is given considering caste, religion and political affiliations”. “If a Hathras-like incident had taken place in Maharashtra, demands would have been raised for dismissal of the state government and for imposition of President's rule,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-incident-no-different-than-atrocities-on-hindu-girls-in-pakistan-says-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-897310.html
05-10-2020||National||DH Deciphers | Can Congress-led state governments bypass central farm laws? ||Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi has asked state governments led by the party to consider using Article 254(2) of the Constitution to bypass the three controversial agricultural laws passed by Parliament and assented to by the President of India. The laws, as we know, have triggered large-scale protests across the country, especially in Punjab and Haryana. The union government has strongly defended the laws and there's little indication that it will go back on them. Can Congress-ruled states bypass these laws?    What does Article 254(2) say? "Where a law made by the legislature of a state with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the legislature of such state shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, prevail in that state."  What is the Concurrent List? The legislative section of the Constitution of India is divided into Union List, State List and Concurrent List. The Union List includes matters that come under the purview of the union government. For example, defence, foreign affairs, etc. The State List includes matters that come under the purview of state governments, such as law and order, public health, etc. The Concurrent List includes matters that come under the purview of both the union and state governments. Criminal law, education, etc, are some of them. While agriculture is a state subject, the Centre can also make some laws on it.  What if a central law contradicts a state law on the Concurrent List? Which will prevail? While state legislatures also have the power to make laws on the matters on the Concurrent List, the law passed by Parliament will prevail in case of any inconsistency (repugnancy) between the two laws. Article 254(1) of the Constitution states: "If any provision of a law made by the legislature of a state is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of such state, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the legislature of the state shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void."  Even Article 254(2), which empowering state legislatures to make laws on the Concurrent List, states: "Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State."  Put simply, a law passed by Parliament will prevail over a state law in a matter on the Concurrent List in case of a contradiction between the two. Parliament also has the authority to change or repeal a conflicting state law on the Concurrent List. Lastly, laws passed by Congress-ruled states are unlikely to get the President's assent, which is exercised as per the advice of the union government. So is the Congress announcement more optics than substance? The probability of state legislatures negating the three central farm laws is low. More than anything, the Congress announcement shows the party's political messaging. That the party is ready to take on the central government and try its best to counter the "anti-farmer" laws. This may well resonate in Punjab, where the Congress is in power, and Haryana, where it's a strong opposition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-can-congress-led-state-governments-bypass-central-farm-laws-897326.html
05-10-2020||National||Congress-ruled states mull convening assembly to annul central farm laws||Close on the heels of Congress president Sonia Gandhi proposing the negation of three central farm-related laws by bringing in state-specific legislations, the states ruled by her party are mulling convening special assembly sessions for the purpose. The AICC legal team last week drafted a model law for states to take reference from for passing the relevant legislations in their respective assemblies. “The Congress-ruled states will soon convene an assembly session to annul the central farm laws,” a party source said.  The chief ministers of Congress-ruled Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Puducherry have already made it clear that they will not implement the central farm laws in their respective jurisdictions. They also said they will get a new bill in their state assemblies to annul these laws. The Congress is strongly opposing the three legislations and it has launched countrywide protests against them. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had recently advised the party-ruled states to pass laws in their respective assemblies under Article 254(2) of the Constitution.  The Congress claims that rules under Article 245(2) allow a state legislature to enforce laws "repugnant to the parliament law", a provision used by the BJP earlier against the Land Acquisition Act enacted by the UPA. The sources said that while Congress-ruled states are set to pass the law, some of the non-NDA ruled states are also likely to pass it, as they are opposed to the central farm legislations. Parliament had passed The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the Monsoon Session and the president granted his assent for them. The laws seek to liberalise the agriculture sector and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. The model law brought by the Congress shall declare "null, void and inoperative" anything that is inconsistent in the three central legislations with the state law. It will also include a provision to ensure that no farmer shall be paid below the minimum support price for the price of the produce. The draft model bill seeks to ensure safeguards for farmers including the minimum support price regime and the framework under the APMC Act to protect their interests.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-ruled-states-mull-convening-assembly-to-annul-central-farm-laws-897353.html

When it comes to convicting the perpetrators, Karnataka again falters, as the state could send just ten people in nine cases – 25.7% of 35 cases in which trial ended – to the jail while 31 in 26 cases managed to get acquittal. However, it was a better show last year compared to 2018 when its conviction rate was a mere 2.3%. In 2017, not a single case ended in conviction in the state. Not this alone, according to the Crime in India 2019 report by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the rate of cases pending investigations in Karnataka is pegged at 93.1%, the charge-sheeting rate is just 8.1% while cases pending trial is 95.6%. It also tops the list of cybercrimes against women. Investigators and cybercrime experts attribute the low conviction rate to sloppy investigations by inadequately trained police personnel and flaws in collecting cyber forensics. Many times, they say, lack of credible evidence as well as the lack of expertise of investigators and judicial officers lead to acquittals. Altogether, police across the country registered 44,456 cases of cybercrime last year with Karnataka clocking 12,020 cases followed by Uttar Pradesh (11,416) and Maharashtra (3,604). Compare it with 2018 when 27,248 cybercrime cases were registered: Karnataka was placed second with 5,839 as against the topper Uttar Pradesh (6,280) while Maharashtra, which came third, registered 3,511 cases. If one takes the 2016 statistics, Karnataka has registered a nearly 11-fold rise from 1,101. The rise in cyber crimes across the country saw police last year probing 76,669 cases, including 32,099 which were pending earlier, while investigators left a pendency of 69% or 52,917 cases, the highest for any year. The three top states together accounted for 61.41% of the cases that were investigated last year, with policemen in Karnataka probing the highest number of 20,016 cases. Of the 23,752 cases in which investigations were closed in various states, charge-sheets were filed in 9,269 cases (39.1%) in which Karnataka's share was a dismal 116. Karnataka could not finish investigations in 18,638 out of the over 20,000 cases it handled last year. When it comes to court trials, only 817 cases went to trial in Karnataka of which only 35 were completed, leaving 781 cases pending at various stages of the trial. Uttar Pradesh often grabs headlines for a variety of crimes but a study says otherwise, at least when it comes to handling cybercrimes. Its rates of charge-sheeting and conviction as well as the speed with which it completes investigation is much higher than Karnataka and Maharashtra as well as the national average. While the national average for charge-sheeting was 39.1% and cybercrime cases pending investigation at 69%, Uttar Pradesh filed 3,705 charge-sheets (37.7%) while pending cases were just 37% or 5,767 of the 15,589 cases. Maharashtra filed charge-sheets in 33.4% while its pendency is at 74.1%. On cases that reached trial, 94.9% remain inconclusive across the country. Karnataka had 95.6% cases pending trial while Uttar Pradesh had 96.8% and Maharashtra 98.3%. However, when it comes to conviction, Uttar Pradesh got conviction in 201 (72.6%) out of the 277 cases in which trials were completed. Maharashtra had a dismal 13% conviction rate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/with-over-12000-cases-karnataka-tops-cybercrime-list-897268.html

Sharma said the increasing attention given by India to sharing of scientific data is evident from India's National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (INDSAP) and an open government data portal. “Scientific data sharing is being considered for inclusion in the New STIP 2020 being framed. Data is the new water, and we do want to share it as global partners,” Sharma emphasised. The online Science & Technology Ministerial Roundtable organised on Saturday and hosted by Japan, deliberated on the role of international R&D collaboration, social sciences & humanities, and open science. It saw the participation of S&T heads from about 50 countries around the world and explored the opportunities arising from international collaborations in science and technology to address the challenges posed by Covid-19. Sharma said India gives extraordinary importance to international cooperation in S&T for development and for addressing challenges of health, water, energy, environment, climate change, communication, and natural disasters. He spoke about India's active S&T collaboration with over 40 countries in the world. “We are also part of all the major multilateral and regional S&T platforms and groupings such as the EU, BRICS, ASEAN, G20, Africa Initiatives, UN and OECD S&T platform as well as international mega-science projects such as ITER, TMT, LIGO and so on. "Coalitions for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, International Solar Alliance and Mission Innovation are India's global initiatives in the management of disasters and clean energy,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-gives-highest-attention-to-sharing-of-scientific-data-dst-secretary-897389.html

According to the report, samples were received by the Forensic Science Laboratory on September 25 – 11 days after the alleged attack on Spetember 14. The 19-year-old who was alleged assaulted by four upper caste men was able to provide the details of the alleged sexual assault only after she regained consciousness at the AMU hospital on September 22, the report cited. Dr Hamza Malik, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, also termed the FSL report “unreliable”. “How will the FSL team find evidence of rape 11 days later? Sperm doesn’t survive after 2-3 days. They took samples from hair, clothes, nail bed and vaginal-anal orifice; the samples may not show presence of semen because of urination, defecation and menstruation," he told the publication. UP’s Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had on Thursday said that the forensic examination on the woman did not indicate rape. "The report of the FSL has also come. It says clearly that samples did not contain sperm. It makes clear that there was no rape or gang-rape," Kumar had said on Thursday in Lucknow. But legal experts debunked the theory, saying that the presence of sperm on the victim’s body cannot be an essential ingredient to prove the crime.

A bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan pointed out so far, no circular has been issued either by the RBI or any other authority. The court also said the Kamat committee report in the matter has so far not been brought on record or considered. It granted one week's further time to the Centre, RBI and other banks to file a consolidated response in the PIL filed by Gajendra Sharma and others. The court posted the matter for consideration on October 13. Last week, the Union government told the court that it decided to waive off "interest on interest" on loans upto Rs 2 crore during the six-month moratorium period. It also informed the court that more than 50 percent borrowers have not availed the moratorium, and if waiving interest on all loans and advances was considered then it would have to forego excess of Rs 6 lakh crore. During the hearing, senior advocate Kapil Sibal contended that a lot of figures cited in the Centre's affidavit were without any basis. He sought permission to place facts on record. Senior Counsel C A Sundaram pointed out the affidavit eliminated the real estate sector from consideration. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted ther was nothing to hide in the matter and the Kamat committee report can be put on record. Senior advocate, V Giri for the RBI, said the Kamat committee was constituted by the RBI. At the highest level, certain decisions were taken even during the pendency of the matter. A large number of people have felt that the interest of interest was hitting them hard. There are more deliberations and recommendations to be made. Senior Counsel Harish Salve for the Indian Banks Association submitted that the delay was hurting the Banks.

'Responsible AI for Social Empowerment 2020' (RAISE 2020) will be a global meeting to exchange ideas and chart a course for using AI for social transformation, inclusion and empowerment in areas such as healthcare, agriculture, education and smart mobility, the statement added. At the RAISE 2020 summit, delegates and experts in research, policy and innovation on AI will join from across the globe, it added. The statement added that keynote speeches and panel discussions will frame the summit, on cross-sector subjects like 'Leveraging AI for Pandemic Preparedness', 'The Impetus that Innovation Places on Digitisation', 'Inclusive AI', and 'Partnerships for Successful Innovation'. RAISE 2020, which will take place between October 5 and October 9, will facilitate an exchange of ideas to create mass awareness about the need to ethically develop and practice AI, the statement said. The summit will also feature start-ups working in AI-related fields. Start-ups chosen through the AI Solution Challenge will showcase their solutions in the AI Startup Pitch fest scheduled on October 6, the statement said. This is part of the Indian government's continuing support to tech entrepreneurs and start-ups by providing exposure, recognition and guidance. AI has emerged as a catalyst across industries and can play a transformative role in accelerating development, MeitY Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney said. He added that the summit will explore in-depth the role of AI in accelerating social empowerment. "RAISE 2020 has tracks like AI for health, agriculture, education, skilling, mobility, fintech, research, inclusive AI, future of work, and responsible AI, and the summit will serve as a platform for the meeting of some of the best minds in the world on AI." Industry analysts predict that AI could add up to USD 957 billion to India's economy by 2035. "India is uniquely positioned to become the AI laboratory of the world and contribute to inclusive development and growth through empowerment," NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said.

The adjuvant Alhydroxiquim-II is being used under a licensing agreement with Kansas-based ViroVax LLC. An adjuvant is a pharmacological ingredient added to enhance a vaccine’s immune response.   Covaxin, India’s first indigenously developed vaccine candidate for Covid-19 is presently undergoing Phase-II human trials across the country. Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine derived from a strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus, isolated at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The inactivated virus is formulated with ViroVax’s adjuvant to produce the vaccine candidate. “The widely used adjuvant Aluminium hydroxide in the development of SARS CoV-2 vaccines is known to induce a Th2 based response which is important for the eradication of extracellular parasites and bacterial infection,” Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech said. “The Th2 based response has a theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases (VAERD or ADE). We have used Imidazoquinoline class of adjuvants (TLR7/8 agonists), which are known to induce Th1 based response which further reduces the risk of ADE (Anti-Body Dependent Enhancement)” Dr Ella said. In our preclinical studies and animal challenge models (Syrian Hamster and Rhesus Macaques) we have shown that COVAXIN induced Th1 based response due to the use of Algel-IMDG (chemosorbed imidazoquinoline onto the aluminium hydroxide gel) as an adjuvant, Dr Ella adds. According to a press statement from Bharat Biotech, ViroVax received supplemental funding for the development of sub-unit vaccine constructs for the prevention of Covid19, and for the discovery and development of therapeutics for treating Covid-19. ViroVax is evaluating a sub-unit vaccine candidate and has identified potential antiviral therapeutics. It is currently in the process of testing the efficacy of these compounds.  Dr Ella further states that “there is a critical need for development and availability of adjuvants that elucidate mechanisms of action inducing greater antibody responses to vaccine antigens, thus resulting in long-term protection against pathogens.” “Adjuvants also enhance the sustainability of the global vaccine supply on account of their antigen-sparing effect.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covaxin-to-use-virovaxs-adjuvant-to-boost-immune-response-897507.html

The total number of cases against sitting and former lawmakers are 4,859 as per a new report, while it was 4,442 in March 2020, the top court was apprised in a report filed before it. "The number of cases pending against MPs/MLAs (sitting and former) have increased over the last two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings. "It is, therefore, submitted that strict monitoring, at a micro-level, by the High Courts is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators," said the report filed by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita. The report has been submitted in a petition filed in 2016 by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay and raised the issue of inordinately delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers. The report stated that some high courts favoured constitution of Special Courts in each District, both at Sessions and Magisterial level. "Many other High Courts have favoured trial by the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to take these cases on a priority basis. In some of the States, the High Courts have recommended constitution of zone-wise Special Courts. "The High Courts have recommended the appointment of Nodal Prosecution Officer and Special Public prosecutor for each of the court and have written to the State Governments in this regard," the report said. All the High Courts have favoured setting up of Safe and Secure Witness Examination Room with video conference facility citing lack of infrastructure facilities and non-availability of funds for this, the amicus curiae told the court. "No status report has been filed by the Union of India with respect to initiation and current stage of cases against the legislators pending before CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other central agencies, the grant of sanction and expected time for completion," the report said. There are 25 cases pending at sessions level and 62 at magistrate level in Delhi which include matters under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the like. "The High Court is considering establishing four Special Courts, two at Sessions level and two at Magistrate level. A suo motu writ petition has been registered to monitor the trials and directions have been issued to list pending matters before the respective benches of the High Court," the report said. The report suggested that one special court at Bengaluru, which includes the number of cases under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 for the trial of 165 cases is not sufficient for disposal of cases. The witnesses have to travel from long distance for participating in the trial which will affect a fair trial, it said, adding that "this court may direct the High Court to revisit its proposal to establish only one additional Court at Bengaluru". "Instead, it will be more appropriate to assign cases to the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to try the cases on a priority basis. Other cases may be allotted to such courts only having regard to the workload," the report said. Referring to West Bengal, the report said one Special Court at Barasat, 24 North Pargana is not sufficient for a trial of all 134 cases and if cases relate to different parts of the state, it will be inconvenient for witnesses to travel to Barasat to give evidence. The report suggested that the High Court may be requested to establish more number of Special Courts. With regard to Tamil Nadu, the report of the High Court shows that in 92 cases stay has been granted; however, the present action plan report does not indicate as to the steps taken for disposal of cases under stay. Regarding Uttar Pradesh, the report said that Special Court at Allahabad has 12 adjoining districts and has 300 cases and expeditious disposal may not be possible of these cases in one Special Court. "Thus, High Court may be requested to constitute Special Courts in the adjoining districts of Allahabad to lessen the burden of the Special Court at Allahabad. "There are 85 cases of stay by the High Court. The Chief Justice of the High Court may be requested to constitute a special bench(s) for these cases. The High Court has pointed out that in some cases the accused persons are in other districts/ States, which is an obstacle in speedy disposal of cases," it said. The UP government may be directed to equip these courts electronically so that trial can proceed through video conferencing without the physical presence of the accused, the report said. Pointing to Kerala High Court's submission stating that “police personnel are reluctant to arrest and produce legislators”, the report said that it may be directed that the SP of the concerned district will be personally responsible for the execution of warrants. "Similarly, if any legislator despite receipt of summons/ warrant does not appear before the court, he/ she will be liable for contempt of this Court apart from disciplinary proceedings," it said. In Punjab and Haryana, the trial of eight cases in Haryana and 10 cases in Punjab have been stayed by the High Court; however, the action plan does not show steps taken to list and dispose of such cases expeditiously, the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/criminal-cases-against-lawmakers-need-strict-monitoring-897534.html
05-10-2020||National||Suresh Prabhu launches India Bamboo Forum to promote sector's growth||Former Union Minister Suresh Prabhu has launched an independent forum with an aim to give a boost to the bamboo sector by promoting entrepreneurship, research, and trade of high-quality bamboo products in a sustainable manner. The India Bamboo Forum-- conceived and conceptualised by Prabhu -- will undertake the work by bringing together a voluntary group of 55 committed leaders in the bamboo sector. "The forum will work actively with the stakeholders from institutions from within India and abroad, policymakers and industry and identify specific thematic areas that require resolution at the state and national ecosystems," Prabhu told PTI. Prabhu added that the growth of the bamboo sector will help prevent deforestation, create jobs, and help increase farmers' income. To begin with, five areas of national importance have been identified -- the development of a dedicated knowledge dissemination portal, improving technical standards, skill development, providing mentorship to bamboo startups and creation of a platform for facilitating buyer-seller linkages of bamboo products, he said. Prabhu said the forum will work together to remove the bottlenecks in the sector and ensure an assured and well-oiled supply chain. It will ensure the availability of high-quality bamboo products not only by the use of the latest technology and superior processes but also by promoting the growth of high-quality bamboo species. The forum will also ensure availability of growing material in partnership with agricultural universities. He also underlined the importance of integrating the industry with the global economy and linking the forum to international bamboo networks. About 2.5 billion people in the world depend economically on bamboo, and international trade in bamboo is estimated at about USD 4.5 million per year. In India, bamboo has the potential to benefit more than 4 million small farmers and 1.5 million micro-entrepreneurs in the next five years, he added. Founding members of the forum include IIT- New Delhi Professor Supratic Gupta; Director-Tripura Bamboo and Cane Development Center (TRIBAC) Selim Reza; Associate Senior Faculty- National Institute of Design - Ahmedabad Pravin Singh Solanki; Maharashtra Bamboo Promotion Foundation CEO V Giriraj; Konkan Bamboo and Cane Development Center (KONBAC) Director Sanjeev Karpe. Karpe said although the government has taken several steps for promoting the growth of the sector, more needs to be done in that direction.

The two sides discussed maintenance of security and stability in the border areas and reiterated mutual commitment not to allow respective territories to be used for activities inimical to each other, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated in a press release issued in New Delhi. India’s top diplomat and the army chief visited Myanmar amid the continuing stand-off between its soldiers and the personnel of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh. New Delhi has been concerned over the possibility of a military move by the PLA through Diphu Pass – an India-China-Myanmar boundary tripoint. It has of late deployed additional troops in the area as part of its move to step up the defence along the McMahon Line, which marks India’s de facto boundary with China in the eastern sector. A source in New Delhi said that India explained to Myanmar the reason for its recent build-up and construction of military infrastructure closer to Diphu Pass – ostensible to avoid any misunderstanding between the two nations. The visit by Shringla and Gen Naravane to Nay Pyi Taw was part of India’s recent move to reach out to its neighbours and to stop them from going closer to the orbit of geopolitical influence of China. They presented 3000 vials of antiviral drug Remdesivir to Suu Kyi as a mark of India’s commitment to assist Myanmar in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Foreign Secretary also conveyed to FS indicated India’s willingness to prioritize Myanmar in sharing vaccines as and when these become available. Myanmar lauded India’s decision to provide debt service relief under the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative, for the period up to December 31, the MEA stated in a press release issued in New Delhi. Shringla inaugurated the Centre of Excellence in Software Development and Training, which was built under the ASEAN-India cooperation fund at Myitkyina in Myanmar. He also formally inaugurated a liaison office of the Embassy of India, which is currently based at Yangon, in Nay Pyi Taw. He announced New Delhi’s decision to earmark a quota of 1.5 lakh tonnes of Urad (Vigna mungo) for import from Myanmar till March 31 next year. The visit saw New Delhi announcing a grant of $2 million for the construction of the border haat bridge at Byanyu and Sarsichauk in Chin State of Myanmar to increase economic connectivity between Mizoram State of India and the neighbouring country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-and-myanmar-discuss-border-security-issue-897543.html

The former Congress President's 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' is all set to enter Haryana on Tuesday evening amid sharp protests from senior minister Anil Vij, who had declared that he would not allow Rahul to bring in a large crowd from Punjab to create disturbance in the state. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the former Congress President had the right to put forth his views, but his government will not allow Rahul to lead a big procession from Punjab. “If he wants to have his programme by having some people from the state accompany him, there is no objection,” said Khattar. Vij said that the health ministry guidelines do not permit a gathering of more than 100 persons. “The law is the same for a common man and Rahul Gandhi. We will not allow a gathering of more than 100 persons,” said Vij. Rahul is scheduled to address farmers in Pehowa town of Haryana on Tuesday and a public meeting in Karnal on Wednesday. The former Congress President embarked on the 'Kheti Bachao Yatra on Sunday. Addressing public meetings at Sangrur and Samana in Punjab on Monday, Rahul said that the three new farm laws enacted by the Modi government would not only break the back of the farmers but also make food grains costlier, as corporate giants such as Adani and Ambani would get a hold on the wholesale markets. Rahul alleged that the Modi government was paving the way for a handful of its friends to gain control over the nation's resources. He alleged that the Modi government had waived loans of big businessmen, but “finished off” small and medium enterprises, who generate maximum employment in the country. “I am saying with a guarantee that this country will not be able to give employment to its youth in the coming time because Modi has destroyed the employment providing system,” Rahul said. “After GST, demonetisation, and coronavirus, Modi ji is now into destroying our food security system,” he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahuls-rally-to-enter-haryana-cm-says-no-to-large-gathering-897548.html

A similar protest was held in Surat where around 20 Congress workers were detained, they said. Congress held protests in all major cities of Gujarat as part of the party's call for 'satyagraha' by its leaders and workers at district headquarters of states across the country against the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh to seek justice for the victim and her family. In Ahmedabad, the protest was organised outside the collectorate and was led by city Congress president Shashikant Patel and MLAs Gyasuddin Shaikh and Imran Khedawala. Apart from seeking justice for the victim, the opposition party condemned the alleged manhandling of senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra by Uttar Pradesh police. "The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh is trying to shield the culprits. And when our leaders went to Hathras to meet the victim's kin, they were manhandled by the police," Patel alleged before his detention. "As a responsible opposition party, we will not sit quietly against such lawlessness," he added. The city police said the Congressmen held the protest without permission. "We have detained around 35 Congress workers. We will release them afterwards," Ahmedabad's Deputy Commissioner of Police Vijay Patel said. A similar protest was held outside Surat district collector's office where around 20 Congress workers, including women, were detained, another police official said. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday recommended a CBI probe into the alleged gang-rape and death of the 19-year-old Dalit woman that triggered a nationwide outrage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protest-over-hathras-case-gujarat-cong-mlas-workers-detained-897550.html

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, submitted before a bench presided over by Justice U U Lalit that it was neither aware of the nature of secret proceedings, nor was it a party to it. On this, the court asked advocate Ankur Saigal, appearing for Mallya to inform it about the nature of these confidential proceedings and when it would be over. The court also asked him to inform by November 2 after seeking instructions as to when Mallya would appear before it for sentencing in a contempt case. Mallya, who evaded law enforcement authorities here on defaulting repayment of Rs 9,000 crore loan, and stayed at the United Kingdom, has suffered setbacks after the court over there in May allowed for his extradition.  His date of return, however, is still uncertain due to undisclosed legal issues. The Enforcement Directorate has invoked provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 2018 against him. The top court had in August dismissed a review petition filed by Mallya against his conviction in a contempt case in 2017, for failing to disclose the transfer of 40 million USD to his children's accounts despite an order against it. The top court had then directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5 for hearing on proposed punishment against him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/secret-proceedings-underway-to-extradite-vijay-mallya-to-india-centre-tells-sc-897572.html

The apex court's direction came after the Finance Ministry decided to grant relief to individual borrowers as well as medium and small industries by agreeing to waive compound interest (interest on interest) charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crores for a six-month moratorium period announced due to the pandemic. A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah took up the pleas alleging that banks have decided to charge interest on the EMIs which have not been paid by the borrowers from March one to August 31 after taking benefit of the loan moratorium scheme of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the hearing conducted through video conferencing, the top court took note of the grievances that various sectors such as real estate have been left out under the new proposal by the Centre. The Kamath panel had made recommendations for 26 sectors that could be factored by lending institutions while finalizing loan resolution plans and had said that banks could adopt a graded approach based on the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in a sector.  The apex court has asked the Centre and the RBI to place before it within a week the recommendations and the decisions and other notifications on loan moratorium and also "consider the issues raised by the real estate associations and the power producers". Meanwhile, Indian Banks Association (IBA), Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (CREDAI) and other parties have been granted liberty by the bench to file their responses to the affidavit of the Centre. Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for the real estate sector, said it has been completely left out which should not have been done "in this kind of scenario". Another senior lawyer Kapil Sibal said that he wanted to file a detailed affidavit to the Centre's reply as there are certain facts which need to be dealt with and sought time for it. The government, in its affidavit, had said that it will seek due authorisation from Parliament for making appropriate grants in this regard and "the endeavour shall be over and above the support of Rs 3.7 lakh crore to MSMEs, Rs 70,000 crore for home loans etc. already extended through the Garib Kalyan and Aatma Nirbhar packages announced by the government earlier". It had said that the relief to all borrowers in respect of compounding of interest during the period of the moratorium would be admissible to the categories specified irrespective of whether the borrowers had availed the moratorium or not. Initially, the RBI on March 27 had issued the circular which allowed lending institutions to grant a moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31 this year due to the pandemic. Later, the period of the moratorium was extended till August 31.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-asks-centre-rbi-to-file-kv-kamath-panel-suggestions-their-decisions-on-loan-moratorium-897583.html

It will be the longest road tunnel in the state and the third-longest in the country. The state has earmarked Rs 658 crore for the project, through Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) The Konkan Railway Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been appointed as the implementing agency for the Special Purpose Vehicle project. The Chief Minister said the plan is to complete the construction in three years. "We are also considering the impact on the environment and the state has earmarked Rs 658 crore for the project, through KIIFB," Vijayan said. The existing road connecting the two districts passes through a 13-km Wayanad ghat section road, with nine hairpin bends, known as 'Thamaraerry churam', along National Highway 212. "This narrow and landslip-prone road gets crippled quite often due to one or the other reason including minor landslides during heavy rains," Vijayan said during the inaugural speech. The proposed tunnel through the western ghat starts at Swargam Kunnu in nearby Kodenchery panchayat in Kozhikode district and will end at Kalladi near Meppadi in Wayanad district. A bridge across Iruvanjippuzha will also be constructed as part of the two-lane tunnel connected highway. The officials of the implementing agency, the KRCL, had recently held its comprehensive survey on the 6.8 km tunnel between nearby Anakampoyil and Meppadi in Wayanad, linking Kozhikode and Wayanad districts. Sanctioned as part of the 100-day special drive by the LDF government, the much-awaited project of the construction of the tunnel will provide a better and hassle-free alternative to the present Thamaraserry-Lakkidi ghat road. The new tunnel once commissioned will reduce the travelling distance between the districts by nearly 19 kms, from a present 73 kms to 54 kms, between Kalpetta and Calicut.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kerala-cm-inaugurates-work-on-construction-of-wayanad-tunnel-road-897603.html

The trial, conducted at 1145 hrs from the APJ Abdul Kalam Island, earlier known as Wheeler Island, met all the objectives flawlessly, the sources said. SMART is a missile assisted release of lightweight anti-submarine torpedo system for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations far beyond torpedo range. This launch and demonstration is significant in establishing anti-submarine warfare capabilities, a defence statement said. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) scientists for the feat which marks a major breakthrough for stand-off capability in anti-submarine warfare, a DRDO official said. The flight testing of SMART follows the successful test firing on Saturday of its indigenously developed nuclear capable hypersonic missile 'Shaurya' with a strike range of around 1,000 km from the test range. "All the mission objectives (of SMART) including missile flight upto the range and altitude, separation of the nose cone, release of torpedo and deployment of velocity reduction mechanism (VRM) have been met perfectly, the statement said. Tracking stations including radars and electro optical systems along the coast and telemetry stations, including down range ships monitored all the events. A number of Defence Research and Development (DRDO) laboratories including DRDL, RCI Hyderabad, ADRDE Agra and NSTL Visakhapatnam have developed the technologies required for SMART, the sources said. Secretary to the department of defence R&D and Chairman DRDO Dr G Satheesh Reddy, said that SMART is a game changer technology demonstration in anti-submarine warfare. The test encompasses hybrid technology which helps to upgrade the present system and also increase the striking range, the defence statement said. SMART when launched from warship or a truck- based coastal battery, takes off like a regular supersonic missile. It covers most of its flight in the air at lower altitudes with two-way data link from the warship or an airborne submarine target detection system and provides the exact location of the hostile submarine to correct its flight path midway, it said. Just when it approaches close enough to the submerged submarine, the missile will eject the torpedo system into the water and the autonomous torpedo will start moving towards its target to take out the submarine, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-successfully-tests-smart-missile-897630.html

The Standard Operating Procedures for reopening of schools, issued by the Education Ministry, asks students and teachers to arrive at schools wearing masks and continue wearing it all through, especially during classes, when involved in group activity, laboratories and library. “There will be no assessment till up to 2-3 weeks of school reopening,” Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said, adding that the use of ICT and online learning shall continue to be encouraged. The SOPs state that consent of parents should be taken before a child begins attending school and those willing to study from home should be allowed to do so with parental consent. Last week, the Home Ministry had recommended reopening of schools in a gradual manner from October 15. Universities and schools across the country were ordered shut on March 16 to contain the spread of the coronavirus. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown. The Education Ministry also asked states and union territories to frame their own Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for health and safety precautions based on their local requirements. The guidelines also ask schools to focus on the most vulnerable students such as homeless/migrated students, students with disabilities, and students directly affected by Covid-19 through a family death or hospitalisation and prioritise their needs. It said that schools may be encouraged to make their own SOPs based on the guidelines issued by states and UTs, keeping in view the safety and physical or social distancing norms, and ensuring that the notices, posters, messages, communication to parents in this regard are prominently displayed and disseminated. “Schools must arrange and implement for thorough cleaning and disinfecting of all areas, furniture, equipment, stationery, storage places, water tanks, kitchens, canteen, washroom, laboratories, libraries, on school campus and ensure air flow in indoor space,” the ministry said. The ministry recommended that schools adopt flexible attendance and sick leave policies and encourage students and staff members to stay at home when sick. “Schools should ensure smooth transition of students from home-based schooling during lockdown to formal schooling. Schools can implement re-adjusted school calendar and redesigned Annual Curriculum Plan (ACP), remedial classes or conduct back to school campaign among other steps,” the guidelines said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parental-consent-face-masks-must-no-assessment-for-3-weeks-as-schools-reopen-897656.html

The project, fully funded by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), had commenced in January 2020, but had to be suspended after the coronavirus pandemic hit the world earlier this year. After a brief disruption due to the pandemic followed by suspension of work owing to extreme weather conditions, the Indian government has restarted the restoration and conservation of pagodas in Myanmar, officials said. Located in the ancient city of Bagan, which is a UNESCO World Heritage City, the Archeological Survey of India has taken up the renovation of 12 pagodas in the first phase. Pagodas in Myanmar typically house Buddhist relics, including relics associated with Buddha. Dozens of ancient structures dotting the plains of Bagan had suffered damages when a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar in August 2016. There are more than 2,200 pagodas, temples, monasteries and other historical structures built between 11th and 13th centuries in the spectacular plains of Bagan. According to officials, during the India visit of Myanmar President Htin Kyaw, India had agreed to offer technical and financial help for the conservation and restoration of the damaged structures and paintings at the site. "A Memorandum of Understanding was subsequently signed between India and Myanmar for the conservation of earthquake-damaged Pagodas in Bagan in May 2018. The ASI identified 12 pagodas to be renovated in the first phase at (an expenditure of) Rs 21 crore, which was funded by MEA," an official said. Due to extreme weather conditions, it becomes difficult for conservation experts and workers to carry out any restoration work in Bagan for a period of four months between June and September every year as greater variation in relative humidity affects masonry elements. "The effective working condition at Bagan is from around October to May every year," the official said. The ASI had also taken up the conservation work of historical Ananda Temple, a prominent Buddhist pilgrimage centre and a masterpiece of Mon architecture built in the 12th century. While the structure had suffered damages in an earthquake in 1975, the restoration work was started in May 2012. The conservation and restoration of the Ananda Temple was completed in 2018 at a cost of Rs 11.54 crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also visited and offered prayers at this historic temple during his trip to Myanmar in 2017. Senior MEA officials said India has deep cultural ties with Southeast Asian countries and from time to time it carries out restoration work at temples overseas. Several other overseas restoration and conversation works taken up by ASI include Angkor in Cambodia, Cham Monuments in Vietnam, Thiruketeeswaram Temple in Sri Lanka, Wat Phou Temple Complex in Laos, and Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal. The MEA, as part of its diplomatic outreach, allocates funds for such projects and the Ministry of Culture implements them through ASI, which has the technical expertise for such works. The MEA had also allocated about Rs 80 lakhs for the renovation of stone inscription temples and Zayat of King Bagyidaw and King Mindon at Bodh Gaya. The project was completed in 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-funds-restoration-of-pagodas-in-myanmar-897698.html

As per the decision, autorickshaws older than 15 years won't be able to ply on roads from August 1, 2021 in the MMR, while the deadline for the same in the rest of the state is August 1, 2024. The STA chaired by state transport secretary approved the decision in its meeting held on September 24, the official told PTI. The STA, a quasi-judicial body, took the decision to cap the age of autorickshaws on the basis of a recommendation to this effect made by a panel headed by former IAS officer BC Khatua. The Khatua committee had submitted its report to the Maharashtra government in October 2017, which accepted majority of its suggestions including fixing the age of autorickshaws. Maharashtra has over 10 lakh autorickshaws. Earlier, a decision to cap the plying age of autorickshaws and taxis was taken by the STA on August 1, 2013 on the basis of recommendations made by Hakim Panel, the official said. Before 2013, autorickshaws had no age bar, though the STA had set the age limit of 25 years for taxis in 2010.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/maharashtra-to-reduce-plying-age-limit-of-autorickshaws-to-15-years-897701.html

Notably, the Uttar Pradesh government had already on Sunday recommended for the CBI probe into the incident, following a huge uproar over handling of the matter. In a related development, two fresh PILs were filed on Monday. One petition by a 76-year-old retired judicial officer Chandra Bhan Singh sought lodging of FIR against UP ADG, Law and Order, Prashant Kumar, Hathras DM Pravin Kumar, then SP Vikram Vir and others due to allegations of allegations of "inhuman treatment, insult and manhandling of the cadaver of 19-year-old girl". He said he was born and brought up in a Dalit family in the vicinity of Hathras and himself suffered and lived with discrimination and "taboo" of being a member from the Scheduled Caste. Another PIL by advocate C R Jaya Sukin sought a direction to the Uttar Pradesh government for imposition of the President's Rule due to "unlawful and arbitrary killings, restrictions on freedom of speech" and other problems in the state. The petition, coming up for hearing on Tuesday, claimed the police authorities had not performed their duties towards the victim and tried to shield the accused persons for reasons best known to them. They also contended the body of the victim, who had died on September 29 after being brutalised by upper caste men on September 14, was cremated in the middle of the night. They claimed grave injustice has been done to the victim and her family but the authorities and the system were silent on it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-case-sc-to-take-up-plea-for-cbi-or-sit-probe-897708.html

The objective of the team that won the first two phases is to design a wave energy-based desalination system to provide post-disaster drinking water supply to coastal areas. Team ‘Nalu e Wai’, a collaboration between the US, India and Sweden, is working on a rapidly-deployable, small-scale wave-powered desalination system. They feel deployment of substantial numbers of such devices in water-scarce regions could produce life-changing results for water-starved coastal communities. While the members of the team from India belong to the IIT-M, researchers from the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, and Uppsala University, Sweden are other members. Prof. Abdus Samad, Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras, said the team’s primary driver for the aforementioned submission was the water shortage in India and to supplement the country’s knowledge in the area of wave energy conversion. “We felt strongly that we could devise a system that would achieve the prize-motivated benefits of applicability to disaster-stricken areas and remote communities, while also being scalable to larger community applications such as Chennai, or in developed countries with water shortages, such as coastal California,” he said. The idea is new for portable small-scale wave-powered desalination devices, Prof. Samad said, adding that the concept that they have designed is entirely scalable and its modularity allows it to be adapted to varying deployment sites and wave regimes. “The same concept could easily be scaled to support much larger water production with increasing flap size and by deploying devices in numbers,” the professor added. The Waves to Water Prize is a five-stage, $3.3 million contest to accelerate the development of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal locations. This prize is part of the US Department of Energy’s ‘Water Security Grand Challenge,’ focused on advancing transformational technology and innovation to meet the global need for secure and affordable water, the IIT-M said in a statement. Prof. Abhijit Chaudhuri, Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras, said desalination has become imperative in order to solve the problem of global freshwater scarcity, particularly for the coastal areas. “As one of the most concentrated forms of renewable energy, wave energy offers an environmentally friendly alternative and is highly favourable for seawater desalination in coastal areas with good wave resources,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/iit-m-researchers-part-of-winning-team-in-us-competition-on-using-wave-energy-to-desalinate-water-897711.html

05-10-2020||National||India's first Rafale squadron to be formed in 2021: RKS Bhadauria||India's first Rafale squadron would be fully formed by the end of next year whereas the second squadron at Hasimara would be in place by 2023, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said here on Monday. “The first five French-origin combat jets are at Ambala airbase. Another five are in France and being used by the IAF for training its pilots. The second batch of 3-4 Rafale jets would come by the end of October-early November. Subsequently, in every three months, few aircraft would come and by the next year-end, the first squadron – being flown by the 17 Squadron (Golden Arrows) will be fully formed,” he said. With both squadrons in place by 2023, the purchase of two additional squadrons of Rafale is under the government's consideration. After the first squadron of LCA is fully formed by 2021 end, the IAF would concentrate on a batch of 83 LCA Mark-1 and the fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) that, for all practical purposes, are still very much on the drawing board. Both would come from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Asked about the declining squadron strength, the Air Chief Marshal shared a plan to augment the aircraft strength by more than 400 in the next decade. But even with all acquisition, IAF would have 36-37 squadrons in a decade – still short of its approved target of 42 squadrons. The current plan relies heavily on the induction of the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft, homegrown basic trainer HTT-40 basic trainers, and realisation of the ambitious AMCA, which he said, would be the mainstay of the IAF in the next decade. Bhadauria asserted that AMCA would come up by 2027 and from the beginning of the next decade, the indigenous fifth-generation fighter would be regularly inducted in the IAF. The plan is to induct two squadrons of the AMCA Mark-1 and five squadrons of AMCA Mk-II. “AMCA is sure to come up by 2027 as per the time-line of 5-7 years given by the DRDO chief (G Satheesh Reddy). From the first year of the next decade, we would be inducting 14-15 AMCA every year,” the IAF chief said, exuding confidence. For comparison, the research and development activities on the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft began in 1983, and India's very own fighter jet is still not fully ready after four decades. By the end of this fiscal, the IAF may sign the contract to purchase 83 LCA Mark-I from the HAL, which would start the delivery after four years and complete the loading in 7-8 years. Incidentally, the deal was sanctioned by the Defence Ministry in 2016 but the contract was yet to be signed four years later. The LCA Mark-1A would have a new generation Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability, missile warning system, an integrated advanced electronic warfare suite; advanced versions of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, and maintainability improvements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-first-rafale-squadron-to-be-formed-in-2021-rks-bhadauria-897724.html

Speaking at the Raise 2020 conference, he said AI has a big role to play in sectors like agriculture, creating next-generation urban infrastructure and making disaster management systems stronger. "It remains our collective responsibility to ensure trust in how AI is used. Algorithm transparency is key to establishing this trust. Equally important is accountability. We must protect the world against weaponisation of AI by non-state actors," he said. Modi said India has experienced that technology has improved transparency and service delivery. "The teamwork of AI with humans can do wonders for our planet." "We want India to become a global hub for AI. Many Indians are already working on this. I hope many more do so in the times to come," he said. The Prime Minister said India has recently adopted the National Education Policy 2020 which focuses on technology-based learning and skilling as a major part of education. E-courses will also be developed in various regional languages and dialects, he said. A National Educational Technology Forum is being formed to create an e-education unit to boost the digital infrastructure, digital content and capacity, he said. "We launched the 'Responsible AI for Youth' program this year in April. Under this programme, more than 11,000 students from schools completed the basic course. They are now building their AI projects," he said. "While we discuss AI, let also have no doubts that human creativity and human emotions continue to be our greatest strength. They are our unique advantage over machines," Modi added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/must-protect-world-against-weaponisation-of-artificial-intelligence-pm-modi-897729.html

The Ghormara Island in South 24 Paraganas district’s Sagar block is yet to record a single Covid-19 case. A visit to the island which has a population of about 3000 shows that life is going on as usual with shops, panchayat office, post office, and ration outlets functioning as if nothing happened. So how did this unique feet was achieved? Speaking to DH Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA from Sagar constituency Bankim Hazra said that intense awareness drive by the state government and timely isolation of people arriving from outside after the pandemic broke out ensured that the island remains free of the deadly virus. He said that the reason behind the state administration’s special focus to keep Ghoramara free from the outbreak was if community transmission takes place on an island it would be extremely difficult to control. The fact that there is rarely any large crowd or congested areas has also contributed to keeping it free from the virus. Hazra said that they have visited the island several times to raise awareness among locals. “Block administration, police, panchayat and elected representatives across party lines have worked as a team. Because if someone gets infected with Covid-19 at Ghoramara it will be very difficult to bring to the mainland in Kakdwip and then get him tested along with proper treatment. If a community transmission takes place on an island it will be a disaster,” said Hazra. Although one resident of the island had died of Covid-19 he was outside Ghoramara when he got infected and succumbed to the virus, said Hazra. However, sources in the district administration said that there was no scope for complacency as the pandemic is far from over. Their concern becomes evident as there is no hospital on the island and the local infrastructure comprises only a health center.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sundarban-island-in-west-bengal-still-free-from-covid-19-897750.html

Nepal in May released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the three strategically important areas in Uttarakhand, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019. India has already termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of the territorial claims by Nepal after its Parliament unanimously approved the new political map of the country featuring Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belongs to it. New Delhi has also said that Kathmandu's action violated an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in May said that the revised map of Nepal included parts of the Indian territory and asked Kathmandu to respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. "This unilateral act is not based on historical facts and evidence. It is contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue. Such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India," it had said, adding that Nepal is well aware of India’s consistent position on the matter. "We urge the government of Nepal to refrain from such unjustified cartographic assertion and respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We hope that the Nepalese leadership will create a positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue to resolve the outstanding boundary issues," the MEA had said. Foreign Minister Gyawali told reporters that as per the expert committee report, the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1816 between Nepal and the East India Company has been considered the main basis for the demarcation of Nepal’s boundary with India. “The objective of the committee was to prepare Nepal’s position paper in boundary negotiations and they have done this job well,” the minister told Republica daily. The committee has gathered a number of pieces of evidence to prove Nepal’s long-held position that the land east of the Kali river, which originates in Limpiyadhura, falls within the Nepalese territories. Gyawali said that the Nepal government is ready to hold talks with the Indian side anytime. In the course of its study, the panel interviewed eminent personalities from various fields including historians, former government officials, diplomats, heads of security agencies, bureaucrats, politicians and journalists. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nepal-s-expert-panel-submits-report-to-govt-on-border-issue-with-india-897760.html

An EOFP is 50 per cent of personnel's last emoluments and is payable for 10 years from the date of the death of the personnel in service, the ministry said in the statement. "The requirement of continuous qualifying service of 7 years (to get EOFP) is done away with effect from October 1, 2019," it said. If the service personnel dies after his or her release, retirement, discharge or invalidment, the EOFP is given for seven years from the date of death or up to the time when the personnel would have reached 67 years of age, whichever is earlier, the ministry noted. Further, the family of armed forces personnel who died within 10 years before October 1, 2019, without completing continuous service of seven years, would be getting the EOFP, it noted. As per the rules till date, "there is a requirement of continuous qualifying service of 7 years for grant of the EOFP to the next of kin of defence forces personnel", it stated. While the EOFP is 50 per cent of last emoluments of the personnel, the ordinary family pension (OFP) is 30 per cent of last emoluments of the personnel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/defence-ministry-scraps-requirement-of-minimum-7-year-continuous-service-for-enhanced-family-pension-897766.html

The medical board has ruled out murder in the death of Rajput, terming it "a case of hanging and death by suicide", the premier institute's forensic chief Dr Sudhir Gupta had said last week. In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, the six-member team dismissed the claims of "poisoning and strangling", with Dr Gupta saying the panel did not find any trace of poison and drugs in the viscera. However, on Monday, the AIIMS said in a statement, "A medical board was constituted by Dr Sudhir Gupta, Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology AIIMS, New Delhi as per request received by him from CBI for providing expert opinion in the case relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput." "The medical board has submitted the report directly to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as required. Being a legal matter, any inputs on the report submitted by the medical board would have to be obtained from the CBI," it said. The statement follows certain media reports questioning the outcome of the medical board's examination and Dr Gupta's comments ruling out murder. Rajput's family lawyer Vikas Singh said on Sunday that he was highly perturbed by the AIIMS' medico-legal opinion submitted to the CBI and would request the probe agency's chief to constitute a fresh forensic team in the case. "How could AIIMS team give a conclusive report in the absence of the body, that too on such a shoddy post mortem done by the Cooper hospital (in Mumbai) wherein the time of death is also not mentioned," he tweeted. On Saturday, Dr Gupta had said, "It is a case of hanging and death by suicide. We have submitted our conclusive report to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)," There was no injury on the body other than that of hanging. Also, there was no mark of struggle and scuffle. The ligature mark on the neck was consistent with hanging, he had said. The doctors' panel did not find any trace of poison and drugs in the viscera, Dr Gupta had told PTI, but refused to divulge any further details stating the case is subjudice. Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed 'Kai Po Che' seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor's father K K Singh in Patna against Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/inputs-about-medical-panels-report-on-sushants-death-should-be-obtained-from-cbi-aiims-897767.html

Modi and Xi will join President Vladimir Putin of Russia, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa in the annual BRICS summit, which will be held virtually in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Putin has convened the summit as he presently holds the chair of the BRICS – a bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. A statement issued by the Russian Government said that the conclave would focus on the “BRICS Partnership for Global Stability, Shared Security and Innovative Growth”. An extraordinary G20 summit convened by the 20-nation-bloc’s current chair Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud on March 26 was the last multilateral event both the Prime Minister and the Chinese President had participated – weeks before the soldiers of the two neighbouring nations got engaged in a standoff. Modi and Xi had an “informal summit” in a seaside resort in Tamil Nadu in October 2019. It was the second “informal summit” and the last bilateral engagement between the two leaders before the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s aggressive moves to unilaterally alter the status quo along the disputed boundary between the two nations and the Indian Army’s additional deployment in response resulted in the standoff. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, however, had meetings with their counterparts in the Chinese Government, Wei Fenghe and Wang Yi respectively, on the side-line of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s meetings in Moscow last month. The standoff, which started five months back, however, is yet to be resolved, notwithstanding regular talks between the diplomats and the military commanders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/virtual-brics-summit-to-see-modi-xi-participate-in-first-plurilateral-conclave-after-ladakh-standoff-897768.html

BJP spokesperson and MLA Ramlal Sharma said that in view of the increasing cases of rape, atrocities against women and Dalit in the state, the BJP will hold dharna and demonstrations at all district headquarters on Monday. “We need to wake this government up and ensure that such incidents are curbed and strict action is taken against the accused involved,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gehlot-attacks-bjp-over-late-night-cremation-of-hathras-rape-victim-897421.html
05-10-2020||National Politics||BJP calls Congress protests over CBI searches 'meaningless'||The BJP described as "ridiculous and meaningless" protests by the Congress over CBI conducting searches at multiple premises on Monday in a corruption case related to party leader D K Shivakumar. Karnataka BJP spokesperson, Captain Ganesh Karnik said CBI, ED & IT are institutions with functional autonomy to investigate and bring to justice financial & criminal fraudsters. "They are always on their job. The present raid is in continuation of investigations started by ED in 2017," he said. Stating that the BJP respects the functional autonomy granted to these institutions for probity, Captain Karnik said: "the politically motivated protests (by Congress) are ridiculous & meaningless." "The party (Congress) which was in power for such a long time both at Centre & State should know the functioning of these institutions better," Captain Karnik said. The CBI said it is carrying out searches at 14 locations in Karnataka, Delhi and Maharashtra in the case that pertains to amassing of disproportionate assets. The CBI said it has registered a case against the then Minister of Karnataka Government (Shivakumar who is now President of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee) and others on the allegations of acquisition of disproportionate assets. "Searches are being conducted today at 14 locations including 9 in Karnataka, 4 in Delhi, one in Mumbai," a CBI statement said. According to sources, these locations being searched include properties of Shivakumar's brother and MP from Bengaluru Rural, D K Suresh. Congress leaders have hit out at the ruling BJP governments at the State and the Centre following the searches, questioning their timing ahead of November 3 bypolls to Sira and R R Nagar Assembly segments. Congress General Secretary in charge of Karnataka Affairs, Randeep Singh Surjewala said, "The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar wont deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt". CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’ !1/2 Congress Legislature Party leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said: "The latest CBI raid on @KPCCPresident@DKShivakumar's house is another attempt to derail our preparation for bypolls. I strongly condemn this." I strongly condemn this.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-calls-congress-protests-over-cbi-searches-meaningless-897491.html

Chowdhury, the Leader of the Congress party in Lok Sabha, wondered why the Prime Minister is silent on the killing and alleged gang-rape of a young woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh when he is "vocal on every issue from local to global". "Modi Ji used to remain vocal in each and every issue from Local to Global but still remains mute on the heart- wrenching incident of Hathras, What is happened to u (you) Modi Ji? Where is your "Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikash Sabka Viswash?" Hypocracy (hypocrisy) has been exposed after Hathras," Chowdhury wrote on Twitter. The West Bengal Congress president also said, "Modi Ji better a new slogan "Shut up India, Hush up India" be coined. (2/2) Modi ji better a new slogan be contrived."Shut up India, Hush up India." Last week, the Prime Minister had spoken to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and sought strict action against the accused in the Hathras gang-rape case. Meanwhile, West Bengal Congress unit on Monday staged a sit-in in front of the party's state headquarters in protest against the incident, which has triggered a nation-wide outrage. The 19-year-old woman was attacked and allegedly raped by four men in Hathras on September 14. She was referred to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi with spinal cord injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She died around 3 am on Tuesday last week. Her "forceful" cremation at an ungodly hour by police also drew criticism from the opposition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/hypocrisy-exposed-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-questions-pm-modis-silence-over-hathras-rape-case-897519.html

Addressing a gathering in this Punjab town, Gandhi also asked the BJP-led Centre why it was in a hurry to bring the laws when there was a pandemic on. “Like he (Modi) finished small shopkeepers and small medium businesses with GST (Goods and Services Tax) and demonetisation, he is finishing farmers and labourers the same way and slashing your throats with these three laws,” he said. Gandhi underscored the need for improving the food procurement and Public Distribution System and acknowledged that they had shortcomings. “There is a need to strengthen this system. More mandis need to be set up. There is need to guarantee MSP (minimum support price). There is need to give infrastructure to farmers. there is need to set up silos,” he said. “Narendra Modi is not doing this. Modi is not strengthening the system... If Modi gives better PDS and guarantees MSP and gives more mandis, then Ambani and Adani cannot make money,” the Congress leader alleged. Gandhi, who is holding a series of tractor rallies named 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' across the state to protest the Centre's new farm laws, accused the prime minister of “destroying” the system. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also addressed the gathering and hit out at the Centre over the new farm laws.           Terming them "black laws", Singh said his government would take the fight forward and take every step to safeguard the interest of the farming community. “It is total injustice with farmers,” said Singh while referring to the three laws.       AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab Harish Rawat, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, ministers Balbir Sidhu, Vijay Inder Singla, Rana Gurmit Sodhi and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda were among the leaders present on the occasion.         However, MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was not there.           President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which were passed by the Parliament last month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/modi-finishing-farmers-and-labourers-with-new-farms-laws-says-rahul-gandhi-897525.html
05-10-2020||National Politics||Middlemen, not farmers, agitating in Punjab over farm laws: G Kishan Reddy||It is only agents or middlemen in agricultural market yards in Punjab who are agitating against the new farm laws as they tend to lose crores of rupees as commission with the new legislations, not farmers, Union Minister G Kishan Reddy said on Monday. Reddy said the new farm laws will ensure that farmers are not exploited by anyone and allow them to sell their produce wherever they get a good price. His comments come even as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is holding a series of tractor rallies named 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' across Punjab to protest the Centre's new farm laws. "These are not anti-farmers bills. There is only political opposition to these bills. Nowhere farmers are participating (in the protests). Even in Punjab, only agents in mandis (marketyards) are doing it. They get huge commissions. They get hundreds and thousands of crores of rupees as commission from farmers in the form of various cesses.Now the middlemen will go away with this laws," Reddy told reporters. He said these new laws are part of the reforms being brought out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the welfare of farmers. "Congress, Communists and some other regional parties are undertaking malicious campaigns against the new laws," he said. According to Reddy, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi then admitted that if the Centre releases Rs 100 to poor people, only Rs 15 reached them. "Today Narendra Modi wants every rupee of the Rs 100 should reach the poor people's bank accounts," he said. According to Reddy, the aim of the new laws is to remove middlemen for agricultural produce so that farmers are benefitted. The Minister of State for Home said there was never any attempt to undermine Minimum Support Price (MSP) with the promulgation of the ordinance and subsequent law. "MSP will be efficiently implemented by this government. If farmers do not get good market price, the centre will purchase their produce by paying MSP," he said drawing a parallel between MSPs during UPA and NDA rule. President Ram Nath Kovind has given his assent to the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which were passed by Parliament last month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/middlemen-not-farmers-agitating-in-punjab-over-farm-laws-g-kishan-reddy-897547.html

The FIR has been registered against Congress' Gautam Buddh Nagar unit president Manoj Chaudhary, Noida unit chief Shahabuddin and 500 unnamed party workers, the police officials said. Hundreds of Congress workers and leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, were on their way to Hathras on Saturday afternoon to meet the family of a woman who died after an alleged gangrape. There were scuffles involving Congress workers and the Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida) Police at the DND toll plaza during which police personnel had baton charged the crowd. Some party leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi, were manhandled, while some policemen were also hurt. According to the FIR lodged a little earlier before midnight on October 3, the Congress workers have been booked under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (unlawfully or negligently spreading infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and under section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act. The FIR has been lodged on a complaint by Rakesh Kumar Singh, the SHO of the Sector 20 police station. On October 2 also, the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police had lodged an FIR against around 200 Congress workers and leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, under the Epidemic Diseases Act for not maintaining social distancing and not wearing face masks. The party workers were detained while they were on foot on the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida in a bid to go to Hathras. Gautam Buddh Nagar is currently under CrPC section 144, which restricts assembly of more than four people, in view of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/hathras-rape-case-fir-against-over-500-congress-workers-over-october-3-ruckus-at-dnd-flyway-897563.html

Chaudhary said they also prayed that good sense prevails on UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the state police. "The way the UP government and its police has treated the victim and her family and tried to stop our leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra and misbehaved with them, we prayed for 'sadbuddhi' (good sense) to them also," he said. Chaudhary said Congress will continue to struggle for justice for the Hathras victim and her family without giving up the twin principles of non-violence and truth. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/delhi-congress-demands-justice-for-hathras-victim-with-silent-protest-897593.html
05-10-2020||National Politics||BJP-led NDA winning in Bihar due to RJD: Asaduddin Owaisi||Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi whose AIMIM has formed a separate front with former union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav for Bihar elections dismissed the charge of fighting the state polls to help BJP and said rather it's because of the RJD that the saffron party-led NDA has been winning in the state. Owaisi also hit out at the Congress, saying in Maharashtra it contested polls with All India Majlis-e- Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) but later joined hands with Shiv Sena "demolishers of the Babri mosque" to form a coalition government in the western state. "Congress shall not teach us secularism," the Hyderabad MP told PTI-Bhasha in an interview here. Owaisi left Patna Sunday after spending two days during which he discussed the strategy of his front for the state elections. Making a scathing attack on the RJD for dubbing him "vote katua" (spoiler) of secular votes, the AIMIM chief asked how his party was responsible for their complete rout in the 2019 general election in Bihar which it claims as its "garh" (fort). Owaisi and Yadav, who is heading Samajwadi Janata Dal (D), have formed UDSA (United Democratic Secular Alliance) for October-November state polls. "What happened to these so called 'thekedars' (feudal lords) of the anti-BJP votes in the 2019 general elections in Bihar?" he asked while scoffing at the RJD-Congress for claiming themselves as the champions of minorities and secular votes in Bihar. "I fail to understand as on what basis they claim sole ownership of Muslims votes in Bihar," he said taking a swipe at the RJD and the grand old party, allies in Mahagathbandhan. The Grand Alliance comprising RJD, Congress, and some smaller regional parties had received a drubbing in the last Parliamentary polls in Bihar in the hands of the NDA which won all but one seat of Kisanganj out of total 40 seats in the state. Congress had bagged Kisanganj seat, while Lalu Prasad's party for the first time had failed to even open its account in the Lok Sabha elections in the state. Ahead of current Bihar elections, Hindustani Awam Morcha of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, RLSP, and just two days back Vikashheel Insaan Party (VIP) have parted company with the grand alliance. Owaisi said they are in touch with several other anti- NDA and anti-grand alliance parties to fight the state elections with greater strength. Asked if they were holding talks with Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) president Upendra Kushwaha, who has floated a three-party front with Mayawati's BSP for the Bihar polls, the AIMIM chief said USDA convenor Devendra Yadav is holding parleys with other parties. He said people of Bihar saw 15 years of "misrule" of RJD and an equal period under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who "failed" to bring any substantial change in the state. "People of Bihar are feeling suffocated today due to misrule of the two major alliances in the past and looking for a better alternative...we will try to fulfill their hope with a strong coalition of secular forces," the AIMIM chief said. After winning a Muslims dominated Kisanganj assembly seat in by-poll early this year, Owaisi's party is keen on fighting some seats in the Seemanchal areas having large population of members of the minority community to increase its footprint in Bihar||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-led-nda-winning-in-bihar-due-to-rjd-asaduddin-owaisi-897618.html
05-10-2020||National Politics||Ahead of Bihar Assembly polls, LJP asks people to not vote for JD(U)||A day after ruling out any truce with JD(U) for the Assembly polls in Bihar starting this month, LJP chief Chirag Paswan on Monday wrote an open letter asking people not to vote for NDA ally JD(U), saying a vote given to that party will only encourage more migration of Bihari youths for jobs outside Bihar. In what increasingly appeared a hatchet job, Paswan who has repeatedly professed his commitment to the BJP and had on Sunday even gone to the extent of saying that it will be BJP-LJP alliance that will come to power in Bihar after the polls, said on Monday "this is the most decisive moment in the history of Bihar. This is a question of life an death of 12 crore people of Bihar because we do not have with us any more time to lose. Even a single vote given to the JD(U) candidate, will force your kid towards migration (for livelihood)". This was a day after Chirag announced his party’s decision not to fight the Bihar polls in the leadership of Nitish Kumar and to field candidates on seats being contested by JD(U). Seeking support for his party candidates in the three-phase poll starting October 28, Chirag also sought to create an emotional chord recalling to people the connect of his father and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and said, “I am the part (ansh) of my father. I will never accept defeat in any circumstances and will not allow the thinking of 'Bihar First and Bihari First' to be obliterated.” Indicating that his party is ready for a long haul and take big risks, Chirag said this decision (to contest alone) has not been taken to rule Bihar but to honour its pride. “My father has always told me never to be frightened of walking alone on the path and that lakhs of people will back me if my direction and purpose are correct. I have to traverse a long path and gain more experience with your blessings” Paswan’s assertion to be ready to go alone comes in the wake of JD(U) mounting pressure on BJP to show LJP the exit door from the alliance at NDA at the central level as well. BJP and JD(U) have reached a 50: 50 formula of seat-sharing for the state polls and LJP had to be accommodated from the BJP, a proposal which the LJP did not accept. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been named the face of NDA alliance in Bihar. LJP on Sunday, however, said it wanted the BJP to head the future government in the state and that LJP MLAs will work towards this goal. LJP's move could substantially damage the JD(U)'s prospects in several seats as besides losing the Dalit votes, JD(U) runs the risk of even losing the support of BJP sympathisers in those constituencies, which may end up voting for LJP. By default, it can also boost the prospects of the opposition alliance of the RJD, Congress and the Left.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ahead-of-bihar-assembly-polls-ljp-asks-people-to-not-vote-for-jdu-897641.html

According to estimates, the state's population comprises around 20 per cent Dalits. With their support, the BSP had formed the government in the state in 2007. In 2017, BJP formed a majority government and in 2012 the SP had formed the government by denting the BSP's Dalit vote bank, post-election analysis had revealed. Of the 84 seats reserved in UP for SC and ST candidates, the BJP won 69 seats in the 2017 assembly elections, in the 2012 polls the SP had got 58 of these seats and in 2007 the BSP had secured 62 reserved seats. Ashok Chowdhury, a Dalit politics expert said, "BJP had impressed the Dalits in 2014, 2017 and 2019 elections, but it's difficult to retain them now". The deaths following the alleged gang rape in Hathras and Balrampur have become a political issue in the state. Even after the suspension of Hathras Superintendent of Police and the recommendation of a CBI probe by the state government, the opposition is taking up these issues in a big way. While Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and BSP supremo Mayawati have demanded action against the Hathras District Magistrate, SP president Akhilesh Yadav has demanded a narco analysis test of the officers deployed in Hathras at the time of the incident. For damage control, BJP's Dalit leader and minister Ramapati Shastri has alleged that the opposition did not want the truth about the Hathras incident to come to the fore and wanted "caste and communal violence there". Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also said those who do not like development are trying to orchestrate "cast and communal" riots in the state and playing politics and doing conspiracies. In a bid to maintain its hold on the Dalit vote, BJP roped in Republican Party of India (RPI) leader Ramdas Athawale, who visited Lucknow on Saturday and justified action taken by the CM and attacked the opposition. Dalit academic Badri Narayan said, "Those in power should act and those in opposition should raise their voice. Those who were seen on the ground will get the benefit. If government did not take timely action, it will have to face losses (in future elections)." SP spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhry said, "The people of the state have understood that SP is the only alternative in the state. BJP will get to know about its position in the bypolls." The by-polls are scheduled to be held on November 3 for seven assembly seats out of which six were held by the BJP in 2017 after the last assembly elections in the state. The Samajwadi Party had won the seventh seat, Malhani (in Jaunpur). The Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in the state in 2022. Among seven seats going to the polls, Naugaon (Amroha) seat got vacated due to the death of minister Chetan Chauhan,  Ghatampur (Kanpur) due to death of minister Kamal Rani Varun,  Bulandshahr due to the death of Virendra Singh Sirohi, Tundla (seat) on Firozabad due to election of MLA SP Singh Baghel as MP,  Bangarmau (Unnao) seat due to conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar, Deoria seat due to the death of Janmejay Singh. Malhani seath (in Jaunpur) got vacated due to the death of SP MLA Parasnath Yadav. Congress state President Ajay Kumar Lallu said his party would contest all seven seats. BJP State President Swatantra Dev Singh, however, said the ruling party's workers were helping people during the coronavirus pandemic and the people will keep that in mind while voting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/hathras-balrampur-incidents-to-be-highlights-of-campaign-for-nov-3-bypolls-for-7-up-seats-897647.html

The ruling Congress made the comparison after staging a two-hour-long silent demonstration in protest against the Hathras incident even as the opposition BJP staged a ‘halla bol’ (raising cries) protest to highlight the “worsening” law and order in Rajasthan. After observing the silent protest at Shahid Smarkar here, the government’s chief whip in Rajasthan assembly, Mahesh Joshi, compared Adityanath with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. “UP CM Yogi Adityanath is acting like North Korea's dictator Kim Jong. The victim's family is being suppressed and such things have never happened in the country's history,” Joshi told reporters after the protest. “We have no hopes from the UP police. The way they are working cannot be trusted,” he said. Joshi said the BJP has no moral right to raise questions. “They should demonstrate to get justice for the Hathras victim and against the Yogi Government instead. I pray God to create circumstances for the accused in the Hathras case to get the harshest possible punishment.” Industry Minister Parsadi Lal Meena said probably no government in the history committed such a crime. “The body was not given to the family. Which Indian culture is this, where the body is cremated late at night? What compulsion the government had to do such a thing? The way UP police misbehaved with media and Congress leaders is condemnable,” Meena said. On the other hand, opposition BJP took out a protest march and held a demonstration near Civil Lines railway crossing. “The state government has been sleeping for 20 months and we had to do this 'Halla Bol' protest to wake up the government. The crime rate is increasing in the state and the law and order situation has deteriorated,” Poonia said. He said Rajasthan has become the Crime capital of the country. BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who holds the Home Ministry’s portfolio, has failed to keep crime under control.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rajasthan-congress-compares-yogi-adityanath-with-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-897649.html

It is 'protest tourism' to misguide our farmers who are educated and intelligent to see through this facade,” Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said. Union Minister Smriti Irani, who defeated Rahul in the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi, described the former Congress president as a 'VIP Kisan'. “He is someone who uses a sofa to sit on a tractor. A VIP Kisan like him can never support a system which is meant to free small and marginal farmers from the clutches of middlemen,” said Irani. On Sunday, Rahul kick-started a three-day tractor rally from Punjab's Moga to protest farm sector laws enacted by the Modi government. Photographs from the tractor rally showed Rahul and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh seated on cream-coloured cushions, on either side of Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, who was driving the tractor. Irani hit out at Rahul over his comment that the Congress if voted to power, would scrap the three farm sector legislations. “His dream of coming to power will never be fulfilled,” she said, adding it was not in his nature to respect parliamentary traditions. Irani recalled that Rahul had torn an ordinance to protect convicted lawmakers brought in by the Congress-led UPA government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-a-vip-kisan-sits-on-sofa-on-tractor-smriti-irani-897699.html
05-10-2020||National Politics||OPS hints at 'decision', EPS replies by rallying ministers around him||If Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam hinted at a “decision” in the battle between him and the Chief Minister for the control of AIADMK, Edappadi K Palaniswami responded to the message by holding a meeting with at least 10 of his cabinet colleagues in an apparent show of strength. With just two days to go for the self-imposed deadline of October 7 for naming the party’s Chief Ministerial face, no resolution was in sight even as both the leaders stuck to their known stands, raising questions whether the announcement can be made as announced.   Monday also saw hectic discussions on both sides of the spectrum with Panneerselvam beginning the day by posting a terse message on his verified Twitter page, hinting at a “decision.” Hours after the Twitter post, Panneerselvam left his native district of Theni for Chennai, where interlocutors will meet him on Tuesday and push for resolving differences that he has with Palaniswami over several issues related to the AIADMK. Panneerselvam will also meet his supporters on Tuesday. “All my decisions so far have been in the interests of the people of Tamil Nadu and cadre of the AIADMK. It will continue to remain so even in the future,” Panneerselvam wrote, in his first reaction after his demands were rejected by the AIADMK Executive Committee meeting on September 28. Quoting from Bhagavad Gita, Panneerselvam further wrote, “Whatever happened, it happened for the good. Whatever is happening, it is also happening for the good. Whatever will happen, will also happen for the good.” In what is being interpreted as a strong response from his side, Palaniswami demonstrated his show of strength within the AIADMK by convening a meeting in which at least 10 cabinet ministers participated and are understood to have owed allegiance to him. Later, he also met with the party’s strongman from Madurai, Rajan Chellappa, at his official residence. Highly-placed sources said the Chief Minister is still reluctant towards conceding to Panneerselvam’s demand for a steering committee to run the party affairs as he feels it would create another power centre within the AIADMK. However, OPS is adamant on the constitution of the committee and wants the decision on the CM nominee to be postponed. “The fight is now for the control of the AIADMK. By getting the steering committee appointed, OPS thought he could have a greater say in the party. But EPS is in no mood to give in to the demand as OPS might become powerful,” a senior leader told Deccan Herald. Though Palaniswami seems to enjoy majority both in the party and in the government, Panneerselvam has managed to stop a decision on the issue twice in the past two months. Panneerselvam though sidelined and having lost majority of his supporters, trying to assert his authority is significant given that he has opened a line of communication with AIADMK rebel T T V Dhinakaran, nephew of V K Sasikala, for a patch-up.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ops-hints-at-decision-eps-replies-by-rallying-ministers-around-him-897740.html

He said they were open for a discussion on joining the NDA if the Centre fulfilled all promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act and accords Special Category Status which were promised by during the bifurcation of the state in 2014 to carve out Telangana. Our joining the NDA is pure speculation. We have said (earlier) without fulfilling the long-standing demands of Special Status, we cannot think about it (joining the NDA). "We are more concerned about the welfare of our state. If they consider all issues that are mentioned in the bifurcation (AP Reorganisation Act) act and announce special category status, then we will try to discuss that. We will start a dialogue, Srikanth Reddy told PTI. He, however, said there was neither any invitation from the NDA nor any proposal from YSRCP to join the alliance. Replying to a query, he said Jagan's meeting with the PM was purely for discussing development issues concerning the state and nothing to do with politics. The apex council constituted as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, comprises the Chief Ministers of the two states as members and is headed by the Union Water Resources Minister. Differences have cropped up between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in recent months over the construction of projects in both the states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ysr-congress-open-to-talks-on-joining-nda-if-andhra-pradesh-gets-special-status-senior-leader-897779.html

Senior party leaders, including state president Ripun Bora, Nagaon MP Pradyut Bordoloi, former state minister and MLA Rakibul Hussain, led the protests in different district headquarters. Bora, who led a protest march in Tezpur, alleged that many important persons were involved in the incident and a judicial probe must be ordered into it immediately. The Congress workers got into scuffles with police in several areas, leaving many with injuries. The party's Dhubri unit chief Uttam Sarkar was admitted to a hospital after being injured in one such incident. The Congress workers marched from their respective party offices towards the office of the district police chiefs. In most of the districts, several of them were taken into custody, officials said. On September 20, the question paper of the written examination for 597 posts of unarmed sub-inspectors in Assam Police was leaked and the State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB) cancelled the test minutes after it had commenced. So far 32 people have been arrested in the case, officials said. Among them are prime accused BJP leader Bibon Deka and Congress leader Atab Ali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-demands-assam-cms-resignation-over-paper-leak-897789.html

He also sought security for the family of the victim. Azad, who visited the family in Hathras, told reporters that a CBI inquiry would be time-consuming and delay the process of justice. The Bhim Army chief was initially prevented by police from proceeding to Hathras. He was, however, later allowed to visit the family. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Azad said the family members of the victim should be provided with Y category security as they were feeling "insecure". He said an atmosphere of fear and insecurity was being created in the victim’s village and that the kin of the woman wanted to leave the place. "If the state authorities do not provide adequate security to the victim's family, then I would have no option but to take them out of the village and keep them in my own house," he asserted. Heavy security arrangements were made in the village during the Bhim Army chief’s visit. "… under this government, CBI is only meant for suppressing the voice of opposition, and create fear,” Azad added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-demands-y-category-security-for-hathras-victim-s-family-897298.html

Speaking to reporters here, Adityanath said, "Those who do not like development, they want to trigger communal and caste riots in the state and in the country." "They will derive political mileage from the riots, hence they are indulging in newer conspiracies. We have to be alert against all these conspiracies and accelerate the process of development," he said. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, while addressing party workers virtually, said, "The Congress along with other political parties are using lies and deceit to hatch conspiracies to mislead people.” “People have seen their rule in the state and how they indulged in loot of the public wealth (which was their sole agenda)," he said. Singh urged the party workers to gear up for the upcoming bypolls in the state and demolish the confidence of those “indulging in hatching these conspiracies”, the party said in a statement here. Opposition parties, especially the Congress, have been attacking the BJP government over the alleged gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-Dalit girl in Hathras. The Congress has also demanded the chief minister's resignation over the issue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/those-who-dont-like-development-want-to-trigger-communal-caste-riots-says-yogi-897299.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Hathras case: Congress to hold 'satyagraha' across states on Monday||A day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the family of the Hathras victim, the party announced it will stage 'satyagraha' in the district headquarters of states across the country on Monday to demand justice for them. "The Pradesh Congress Committees will be organising silent Satyagraha sit-in, at Mahatma Gandhi/Ambedkar statues and any other place of significance, against the brutal and arbitrary actions of the UP Government, demanding justice for the victim and her family," AICC general secretary, Organisation, KC Venugopal said in a statement. He said senior leaders, MPs, MLAs, office bearers, party functionaries and ordinary workers will participate in full strength in the 'satyagraha'. "The brutal gangrape and murder of a Dalit girl from  Hathras in Uttar Pradesh has shaken the conscience of the nation," Venugopal said. He alleged that the "casual and cavalier attitude" in taking cognisance of her complaints and delay in providing her immediate medical attention "smacks of attempts at brushing under the carpet" as well as "complicity" on part of the UP administration. Venugopal alleged that the 19-year-old girl was denied justice and dignity in both life and death, as her body was cremated without the consent of the family in the dead of night.   "The brazen inhumanity and illegal high handedness shown by the BJP government of UP in denying basic dignity to the victim even in death and afterward towards the family has left everyone beyond shock," he said.  The Congress leader also criticised the UP government for the events of October 1 when Rahul Gandhi and the party's UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi along with other leaders tried to go to Hathras to meet the victim's family and the delegation was stopped at the UP border itself.  "Most convolutedly, the police manhandled Shri Rahul Gandhi in a most heinous way and arrested Shri Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka ji and other leaders. The police brutally lathicharged on the Congress party workers and other party functionaries. The leaders were not only forcibly stopped but FIR was also lodged against them," he said in the statement. He said it was only after continued pressure from the Congress party on October 3 when thousands of party workers, MPs and senior leaders led by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi announced to leave for Hathras, that the UP administration relented and allowed five leaders to meet the victim's family.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-case-congress-to-hold-satyagraha-across-states-on-monday-897304.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh vows not to stop fight till farm laws amended||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Sunday that he would not back out of the fight against the new agriculture laws till they were amended to give a written constitutional guarantee on the minimum support price. Singh said his government would take whatever steps needed against the "anti-farmer" laws and also expose the Shiromani Akali Dal's "double standards" over the issue. Led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the party is holding tractor rallies from October 4-6 across the state in protest against the three contentious legislations that were passed by Parliament the last month and got presidential assent. "Till they amend these laws and incorporate the MSP and continuation of the FCI (Food Corporation of India) under it, their (Centre's) verbal assurances cannot be trusted," Singh said while addressing a public gathering at Badhni Kalan in Moga district. Terming it "black laws", Singh lashed out at the Akali Dal for "selling off" the interests of the farmers as part of the Union government, as he accused Harsimrat Kaur Badal being party to the decision as a cabinet minister. He warned the farmers that the Centre might pay the MSP for a couple of crops, but eventually would scrap the system completely. Attempts are being made to "stifle the collective voice" of the farmers who had come together in this fight to protect their livelihood and future, the chief minister said. "The farmers of Punjab have been responsible for giving India food security and feeding the nation for six decades, and their interests have to be protected at all costs," he added. Addressing another public rally at Jattpura in Ludhiana district at the culmination of the first day of Gandhi's 'Kheti Bachao Yatra', Singh underscored that the Congress was with the farmers in every step of the battle against the farm laws that was being fought across the country. Taking on the Akalis over their "treachery" with Punjab, Singh said the people of the state would take care of these "traitors", but the real fight was with the BJP-led central government that out to "destroy" the farmers with their "draconian" farm laws. "We will handle the Akalis here, but I urge Rahul to fight the central government and to scrap the new laws by becoming the prime minister," he said, hailing Gandhi for standing with Punjab's farmers in these "tough" times. The Modi government "does not know" what agriculture is, and they want to "break" the centuries-old relations between 'arhtiyas' (commission agents) and the farmers for the benefit of their "capitalist friends", according to the chief minister. Taking a dig at SAD president Sukhbir Badal's claim of "sacrificing" for the farmers by quitting the National Democratic Alliance, Singh said the Akalis "don't know what sacrifice is". "They (SAD) did what they did only for political survival when faced with the farmers' angst and resentment," he said. At the rally, a 'Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Flag' was released by Gandhi, Amarinder and other leaders. Later, the Congress leaders took off on a tractor rally via Lopon (Moga) and Chakar, Lekha, Manoke (in Jagraon), culminating in Jattpura in Raikot area. At Jattpura, Gandhi and Singh were handed over resolutions passed against the laws by panchayats of all Raikot constituencies. Earlier, travelling on tractors through Chakkar, Lakha and Manoke, Gandhi and Singh met the farmers and assured them of the full support of the Congress to their fight. In Lopon village, Gandhi was presented a 'siropa' (robe of honour) by 'Sant Darbar Sampradaya Lopon'. In Manuke, he walked around interacting with maize cultivating farmers Bhupinder Singh Pappu and Ranjit Singh, who gifted corn to him as a token of the farmers' gratitude.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-chief-minister-amarinder-singh-vows-not-to-stop-fight-till-farm-laws-amended-897313.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||15 lakh govt officials to boycott work against privatisation of UP power discom||Fifteen lakh electricity department employees including junior engineers, sub-divisional officers, executive engineers and superintending engineers will go on a day-long boycott of work on Monday to oppose the proposal of privatising power distribution company Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited. In case the central government does not take back its decision, the boycott would be extended for an indefinite period, they warned. The district convener of Vidhyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti Avdhesh Kumar told PTI on Sunday that the central government is bent upon privatising the power sector. The protest would be held from morning to evening on Monday and would continue till the demand is not fulfilled. "The privatisation of the power sector remained unsuccessful in Orissa, Delhi, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Jalgaon, Ujjain, Gwalior, Bhagalpur, Gaya and Muzaffarpur including other places of the country. Privatisation is against the masses because electricity would become costlier. Only business houses would be benefitted.  Almost all associations of engineers would participate in the protest," Kumar said. The district administration has chalked out a plan to address any problem related to power supply, Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said, adding that 24 hours uninterrupted supply would be ensured at any cost. The district has been divided into six zones with deputy collectors along with technical officers deployed to observe the situation in all 149 electricity sub-stations and 22 distribution stations. The additional district magistrate (ADM) city and ADM (executive) officials would monitor the situation in the city and rural area, respectively. Police have also been alerted to check any untoward situation at all the sub-stations of the district. The district's chief development officer (CDO) has been appointed as the nodal official to look after the whole district during the boycott. Also, diploma graduate technicians have been deputed in all sub-stations to keep power supply going without any disruptions, DM Pandey added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/15-lakh-govt-officials-to-boycott-work-against-privatisation-of-up-power-discom-897315.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Opposition leaders meet Hathras victim's family, continue attack on UP govt||The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh faced more heat on Sunday over the Hathras incident from leaders of several opposition parties, many of whom met the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped and later died. A Samajwadi Party delegation, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar Azaad visited the victim’s house in a village in Hathras district and assured her family of all possible help. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra continued their attack on the UP government for its failure to take action against the accused, while their party announced that it will hold 'satyagraha' sit-ins across the country on Monday. BSP supremo Mayawati accused the state government of "maintaining silence" rather than providing relief to the victim's family. DMK President M K Stalin alleged that the safety of minorities, woman and the members of SC/ST community in UP was "generally a question mark". The party said its Women's Wing led by its chief Kanimozhi will take out a candle light march towards the Raj Bhavan in Chennai on Monday to demand justice for the Hathras victim. Earlier during the day, SP alleged that its delegation members were stopped briefly at a toll plaza near Agra by police at the state government's behest when they were on their way to meet the family. In a tweet in Hindi, the party described the "forcible stoppage" as "murder of democracy". "Samajwadi(s) will stand with the aggrieved family in their fight for justice," it said. The RLD in a press statement alleged that Chaudhary and party workers were lathicharged by police when they were on their way to Hathras to meet the victim’s family. Condemning the police action, RLD's UP unit president Masood Ahmed accused the BJP of trying to "suppress the opposition's voice”. RLD activists staged protests and blocked roads in different places in UP's Muzaffarnagar district against the police's baton charge on Chaudhary. After meeting the aggrieved family, the Bhim Army chief demanded a time-bound inquiry by a retired Supreme Court judge into the alleged sexual assault, saying a CBI inquiry would be time consuming and would delay the process of justice. "Whenever the voice of the opposition has to be suppressed, then the key of CBI is turned on. Under this government, the CBI is meant only for suppressing the voice of the opposition and create fear,” Azaad told reporters. He too was initially prevented by police from reaching Hathras. But later senior district officials allowed him to proceed with a few of his followers. Azaad said the woman’s family members should be provided with Y category security as they were feeling "very insecure" amid the atmosphere of "fear" in their village. "If the state authorities do not provide adequate security to the victim's family, then I would have no option but to take them out of the village and keep them in my own house," he said. Heavy security arrangements were made in the village as a precautionary measure keeping in view the caste tensions that prevail in the area. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped in a Hathras village by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family”. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Sunday expressed concern over allegations that the Hathras district magistrate had threatened the Dalit victim’s family. "There have been serious allegations of the Hathras DM threatening the family of the victim. Despite this, the UP Government is maintaining silence, which is sad and extremely worrying,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi. "The government has agreed for a CBI probe but with the DM staying there (Hathras), how can the matter be impartially probed? People are feeling apprehensive," she said. Congress party announced that it will stage 'satyagraha' in the district headquarters of states across the country on Monday to demand justice for the victim. Rahul Gandhi also attacked the BJP government in UP alleging no action was taken against those responsible for the woman's death. While leading a tractor rally in Punjab against the three recently cleared farm legislations, Rahul said, “I was in UP yesterday. A daughter of India was killed there and no action was taken against those responsible for her death. And the family of the victim was confined to their house”. He claimed that the victims were being targeted. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi demanded removal of the DM and a probe into his role in the matter. In a tweet in Hindi, the she said, "According to the aggrieved family, the worst treatment meted out to them was by the district magistrate. Who is trying to save him? He should be immediately suspended, and his role in the entire matter should be probed. When the family is demanding a judicial probe, then why is noise over CBI probe and SIT probe is going on.” Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi had on Saturday visited the woman’s family, two days after they were detained along with party leaders and workers and sent back to Delhi by the police that prevented them from reaching Hathras.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/opposition-leaders-meet-hathras-victims-family-continue-attack-on-up-govt-897327.html

Priyanka along with other Congress leaders including her brother Rahul Gandhi was on their way to Hathras on Saturday afternoon to meet the family of a woman who died after an alleged gangrape, when the incident occurred at the Delhi-UP border. There were scuffles involving Congress workers and the Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida) police during which she was manhandled. In the melee, a helmet-wearing policeman had held the 48-year-old Congress general secretary by her kurta at the DND toll plaza while a crowd surrounded them. “Noida Police profoundly regrets the incident with Priyanka Gandhi while handling an unruly crowd at the DND. We also apologise to Priyanka Gandhi. "The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters) has taken suo motu cognizance of the incident and ordered an inquiry to be conducted by a senior lady officer. We, at Noida Police, are committed to ensuring the safety and dignity of women,” the district police said in a statement.

05-10-2020||North and Central||Hathras case: Editors Guild slams UP govt for 'obstructing' media coverage||The Editors Guild of India on Sunday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that the law enforcement agencies under it "prevented" media persons from reporting on developments in and around Hathras in connection with the alleged sexual assault and murder of a Dalit woman. In a statement, the Guild said not allowing the media to visit the incident spots and tapping the phone conversations of journalists undermine and obstruct the functioning of the media. The Guild demanded that the government create conditions in Hathras that do not obstruct journalists in any way. "The Editors Guild Of India condemns the manner in which the law enforcement agencies of the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, have prevented media persons from reporting on developments in and around Hathras after a brutal assault on a woman leading to her death and the hurried cremation of her body by the authorities without the presence of the family of the deceased," the statement said. Equally "reprehensible" is the way the government has tapped the telephones of journalists engaged in covering the Hathras incidents, the Guild said. "Worse, the tapped conversation of the journalists has been selectively leaked, leading to a social media calumny against them," it said. "Hathras is the worst such case in the scale of interference but the Guild also notes with concern that such attacks against the media are becoming part of a growing trend seen in recent months, in which a few other state governments have also indulged in such harassment of journalists," the statement said. The Guild condemns these and demands corrective action, it said. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday.

05-10-2020||North and Central||Congress misleading farmers on farm laws, says Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday accused the opposition Congress of “misleading” the farmers on new agriculture laws and claimed that the reforms were in the larger interest of the farm community. He assured the farmers that the MSP regime will continue and not go away as claimed by the Congress. “The Congress remained in power at the Centre as well as the state on different occasions between 1966 (when Haryana was carved as a separate state) to 2014. Why did it not bring any Act to give a legal guarantee to MSP?” the chief minister asked. “The Congress is misleading the farmers for its vested interests,” he alleged. Khattar claimed that the new farm laws are in the larger interest of farmers and the “positive impact” of these reforms in the agriculture sector will be visible in the “near future”. He was addressing "progressive farmers" during the “Progressive Farmers Conference and Discussion on Agriculture Acts” organised by the Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department and the Haryana State Agriculture and Marketing Board (HSAMB) in Karnal, according to an official statement. Taking a dig at the Congress, Khattar said that if the opposition party is truly a well-wisher of the farmers, it should ask its governments in Rajasthan and Punjab to purchase bajra, sunflower seeds and moong on MSP as is already being done in Haryana. “This time the Haryana government has also decided to purchase maize on MSP in the state,” he added. The chief minister said recently he held a meeting with the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and upon his initiative, the CCI has agreed to procure 100 per cent cotton from Haryana on fulfilling the permissible parameter of moisture content up to 12 per cent. Earlier, only 25 per cent cotton was being purchased by the CCI from the state, he added. Khattar said agriculture and farmers form the basis of all welfare policies and programmes of the Central and state governments. He said the new farm laws will give farmers the freedom to sell their crop anywhere. The chief minister said as land holdings in the state are continuously shrinking, schemes are being prepared to assist those farmers who have small land holdings and are completely dependent on agriculture by encouraging them to venture into agro-allied activities like dairy farming, bee-keeping, fisheries etc so that their income could be increased. Apart from this, such farmers would also be provided guidance for the marketing of their produce, he added. Speaking on the occasion, Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister J P Dalal said the Congress has no concerns for the welfare of farmers. “During their tenures, the Congress governments, be it at the Centre or in the state, did nothing to safeguard farmers' interests and never paid any heed to their concerns." Meanwhile, Khattar said with a view to further encourage the “progressive farmers” and motivate them to help other farmers in enhancing their agriculture production through the latest farm practices and better financial management, the state government has decided to launch three new schemes namely 'Pragatishil Kisan Samman Yojana', 'Pragatishil Kisan Trainer' and 'Kisan Mitra Yojana'. He said under the 'Pragatishil Kisan Samman Yojana', awards of Rs 16 lakh would be given to eight progressive farmers in the category of farmers having cultivable land of 10 acres or above. While the first prize will carry Rs 5 lakh, second and third prizes will carry Rs 3 lakh each. The remaining fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth awards would carry Rs 1 lakh each, he added. For the progressive farmers of five to 10 acres of land, 100 awards of Rs 50,000 each would be given. Likewise, for the farmers of less than five acres of land, awards of Rs 10,000 per acre would be given, Khattar said. The chief minister said eligible farmers will be required to apply for the awards before a committee to be constituted for this purpose. Progressive farmers will also be included in the committee, he added. He said a directory of progressive farmers of the state would be published soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-misleading-farmers-on-farm-laws-says-haryana-chief-minister-manohar-lal-khattar-897344.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Shiromani Akali Dal dismisses Rahul Gandhi's tractor rallies in Punjab as 'drama'||The Shiromani Akali Dal on Sunday dubbed Rahul Gandhi's tractor rallies as “drama” and accused the Congress leader of “striking a deal to sell off the interests of farmers” by facilitating the passage of the new farm laws. Gandhi is in Punjab for leading tractor rallies, from October 4 to October 6, across the state in protest against the recently enacted agriculture laws by the Centre. “You (Rahul Gandhi) did not only run away from the country when the agriculture bills were to be tabled in Parliament in the most cowardly manner, but also facilitated their passage by refusing to issue a whip to your MPs to vote against them and even preventing senior leaders from speaking against the bills in the House,” senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra said. “But you chose to help the BJP government rather than standing with the farmers of the country,” he alleged. Chandumajra, in a statement here, said the Congress leader had now been brought to Punjab to stage a “sham protest” after the party realised that the farmers would now turn against it. Questioning the timing of Gandhi’s visit, the SAD leader said it was strange that the Gandhi scion remembered Punjab and its farmers after a spate of years only because his party was in doldrums with only a little over a year left before the assembly polls. “You seem to be in the habit of remembering farmers only when a particular state goes to polls, as happened during your pre-poll visit to Madhya Pradesh. You never visited Punjab when hundreds of farmers committed suicide after your government refused to waive their agricultural loans,” he said. Chandumajra also asked Gandhi to direct Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to fulfil the poll promises made during the 2017 assembly polls. Vowing to scrap the new farm laws once the Congress returns to power at the Centre, Rahul Gandhi on Sunday alleged that the BJP-led government was acting at the behest of select corporates to "destroy” farmers. Leading a tractor rally in Punjab against the farm legislations, the Congress leader launched a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and questioned the need for bringing in the new laws at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shiromani-akali-dal-dismisses-rahul-gandhis-tractor-rallies-in-punjab-as-drama-897346.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh emerging as capital of rape, unemployment, farm woes, says Congress leader Kamal Nath||Slamming the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath on Sunday alleged that the state was passing through turbulent times and emerging as the country’s “capital of rape, unemployment and farmers suffering”. The ruling BJP, however, hit back at Nath, saying he should stop making “irresponsible” statements. It also said the Chouhan government was sternly acting against the perpetrators of crime against women in the state. “Madhya Pradesh is becoming the national capital of rape, unemployed people and farmers’ suffering. All of us are witnessing it,” Nath told reporters. He was responding to a query about rising incidents of rape in the state, where a Dalit woman committed suicide in Narsinghpur district in Jabalpur division earlier this week after allegedly being gang-raped. Nath said the condition of the state was “worrisome” as all sections of the society were in trouble. “Young people are in trouble. Farmers and businessmen are also troubled. Women are insecure. Madhya Pradesh has never ever witnessed such a chaotic scene,” he added. When asked about the possibility of the Congress returning to power in Madhya Pradesh after the November 3 bypolls to 28 constituencies, the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly said he had complete faith in the people. “They will give a befitting reply to the BJP. People of MP are simple but not fools,” Nath said. “The people of the state had voted the BJP out of power (in December 2018) and Shivraj Singh Chouhan was sent back home after 15 years (of BJP rule),” the veteran Congress leader said. “It (the mandate) came as a response to his lies… Shivraj ji has been telling lies since the last seven months,” he added. Over his government’s ouster in March, he said, “Madhya Pradesh stands witness to the deals struck… offers by way of which the government was formed. The democracy is sinking, the Constitution is sinking and MP is sinking,” he added. When asked about his visit to the famous Baglamukhi temple here, the former Union minister said he was there to seek the blessings of the deity for the well-being and peace in Madhya Pradesh. He said the state was passing through turbulent times. State BJP chief spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya, however, criticised Nath. “Nath should stop making irresponsible statements,” he said. “Rape is a social evil and such incidents pose a challenge to the society. MP CM Chouhan is dealing with crimes against women with iron hands.

Badal's principal advisor Harcharan Singh Bains said the high-powered panel would be chaired by the party's Secretary General Balwidner Singh Bhunder and would also include Prem Singh Chandumajra, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Naresh Gujral as members. The panel would coordinate with the leaders of other regional parties as well as those which have been consistently advocating more fiscal and political autonomy to the states. Badal told the core committee that the need for strengthening the federal structure of the country has become more pronounced in the wake of “threats” being posed to it in recent times. The SAD has always been at the forefront of the fight against “authoritarian” tendencies in the country, he said in a statement here. “We are a country with a rich regional, cultural, religious and lingual diversity and our strength lies in realizing the full potential of the creative synergy of cooperative federalism as envisioned by the founding fathers of Constitution,” said Badal. He also formed a special committee to fight for getting official language status to the Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir. The committee has Nirmal Singh Kahlon, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Manjinder Singh Sirsa as its members. Meanwhile, the SAD also urged the central government to immediately convene a joint meeting of all stakeholders in the ongoing farmers' struggle including representatives of farmers, farm labourers, shopkeepers and all political parties to resolve the crisis arising out of the “controversial” Acts passed recently by Parliament. A meeting of the core committee of the party also set up a three-member committee to coordinate with farmers organisations and others on the future course of action and strategy on getting the farmers' demands fulfilled. The Shiromani Akali Dal had quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the farm bills issue, the third major party to walk out of the BJP-led coalition in the last couple of years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-nda-exit-sad-decides-to-coordinate-with-regional-parties-for-more-fiscal-political-autonomy-897352.html

05-10-2020||North and Central||Opposition leaders spreading disinformation about farm laws amounts to criminal conduct: Kailash Vijayvargiya||BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Sunday said opposition leaders spreading "disinformation" about the new farm laws amounts to "criminal conduct". On the exit of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) from the NDA over the controversial farm laws, he said the party could not explain to farmers in Punjab the agricultural reforms and bowed to pressure. "I am of the view that with the President signing the three farm bills, spreading disinformation against them falls in the category of criminal conduct, even if it is Congress leader Rahul Gandhi or West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee," Vijayvargiya told reporters here. If the opposition is misleading people on these laws, it also amounts to criminal conduct, he said. "People won't forgive you," he added. On SAD's exit from the NDA, Vijayvargiya said, "They could not properly explain to farmers of their state about the bills and bowed to pressure. Had they explained properly to farmers about the bills, the unrest in the Punjab farm sector could have been avoided." Parliament passed The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the recently concluded Monsoon Session. Soon after, the President granted his assent to the bills. The laws seek to liberalise the agriculture sector and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. Targeting West Bengal's ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), Vijayvargiya, who is also the BJP general secretary in-charge for the state, said the party will not win even 100 seats in the assembly elections next year. "Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is only concerned about her chair and her party and doesn't care about the country," he said. On the Hathras incident, the BJP leader exuded confidence that the truth will be brought out in the case. It was a shameful incident, he said. "I have full faith in (UP CM) Yogi Adityanath. He will never give protection to criminals in his state," Vijayvargiya said, adding that politics should not be done over this incident. He said the CBI probe into the incident will bring out the truth. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped in a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/opposition-leaders-spreading-disinformation-about-farm-laws-amounts-to-criminal-conduct-kailash-vijayvargiya-897424.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Jammu and Kashmir continues to top list in issuance of gun licences||Despite the arrest of several high profile officials by the CBI in fake gun licences scam, Jammu and Kashmir still tops the list of states/UTs where arms licences with all India permission, were issued during the past three years. Official data reveals that of the 22,805 fresh arms licences issued across the country between 2018 and September 15 this year, 17,905 were issued in J&K, which accounts for 78.51% of the licenses. In the same period a total of 94,400 arms licences with all India permission across the country, out of which, 14,172 were done in J&K. A total of 2,435 licenses were cancelled nationwide between January 1, 2018 and September 15, 2020 and most of these (1,911) were in Uttar Pradesh while J&K accounted for just three licenses. The CBI is already investigating alleged irregularities in the grant of over two lakh arms licenses in different districts of Jammu and Kashmir from 2012-2016. In March this year the probe agency had arrested former district magistrates Rajiv Ranjan (IAS) and Itrit Hussain Rafiqui in the case. The two officers were allegedly involved in issuance of a large number of gun licenses on the basis of forged documents. The J&K government had in 2018 recommended a CBI probe into the gun license racket after names of public officials, especially some IAS officers, surfaced during investigations carried out by Rajasthan police's Anti-Terror Squad (ATS). The unholy nexus between bureaucrats-middlemen-arms dealers was unraveled by the Rajasthan police's ATS in 2017. The probe agency is investigating alleged irregularities in the grant of over two lakh arms licenses in different districts of Jammu and Kashmir. In December last year, the CBI had conducted simultaneous raids at 17 locations in Srinagar, Jammu and three other cities including Gurgaon (Haryana), Mohali (Punjab) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh) covering houses and offices of eight former district magistrates/deputy commissioners in connection with the scam. A senior police officer while expressing surprise over issuance of new licenses with all-India permission from J&K, said, “If some of these licenses go into the hands of anti-national elements, it could prove costly. It is high time that issuance of gun licenses in J&K are streamlined.” “Some big players are making a fortune by selling fake arms licenses and supplying sophisticated weapons to businessmen, builders and even to certain journalists based outside J&K which needs to be stopped at once,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-continues-to-top-list-in-issuance-of-gun-licences-897466.html

The former UP Chief Minister also said that a BSP delegation spoke to the family members of the Dalit woman killed in Hathras and the report she received after the talks was "sad". "After the Hathras gang-rape case, the BSP delegation went there on September 28 to meet the victim's family and to know the correct facts. The delegation was called to the police station and were held to talk to them (family members). The report received after the talks was very sad, which forced me to go to the media," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.  "After this, there was misbehaviour with media and lathi-charge on opposition leaders on Saturday and Sunday. This is shameful and condemnable. The government should change its arrogant and dictatorial attitude otherwise it will weaken the roots of democracy," she added. Samajwadi Party workers were on Friday lathi-charged by the police in Hazratganj area here while they were taking out a protest march against the Hathras case and farm laws. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment. The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged that they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family". The state government has already recommended a CBI probe in the matter and quoting FSL reports, it has denied the rape charges.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-govt-should-change-arrogant-attitude-mayawati-897475.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Two CRPF men killed, three injured in Jammu and Kashmir's Pampore||Two paramilitary CRPF men were killed and three others injured after militants attacked a joint security forces’ party in Pampore area of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Monday. “Two militants from Lashkar-e-Toiba came on a motorbike and fired indiscriminately at the CRFP Road Opening Party (ROP) at Kandizal near Pampore. Two CRPF men died in the incident and three others sustained injuries who are stable,” Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, told reporters at the site of the incident. He identified the attackers as Saifullah, a Pakistani militant and another one a local. “Hunt is on to track them down and I am hopeful they will be neutralized soon,” the IGP said and added, the attackers managed to flee from the spot. While Srinagar-Jammu national highway is 270 km long, it is the 35-km stretch between Bijbehera town to Pampore in south Kashmir that is turning out to be a death trap for security forces. In the last five years, militants have targeted security forces frequently on this segment, resulting in dozens of casualties to security forces. The IGP Kashmir said that militants find it easy to target security forces on the highway. “The highway is a busy place where hundreds of civilian vehicles pass every day. If we retaliate, there will be civilian causality,” he said. The highway connects the Valley with the rest of the country and is used to carry supplies to the Srinagar-based 15 Corps. Adil Ahmad Dar, a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant had rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying troops of the CRPF, killing over 40 paramilitary men on February 14 last year on the national highway in Pulwama. In the backdrop of the deadly attack, the J&K government had barred civilian traffic to ply on the national highway from Baramulla to Udhampur for two days every week. The restrictions raised hue-and-cry across Kashmir and the ban was revoked after nearly two months in May last year. Counterinsurgency experts say that militants have reasons to choose the stretch of the highway as an attacking base. One of the reasons they say is that River Jhelum runs close to the national highway which helps militants to leave the area soon after the attack.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-crpf-men-killed-three-injured-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-pampore-897501.html

The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the city air quality index (AQI) will remain in the “moderate” category on Tuesday and Wednesday as high-velocity local winds are preventing accumulation of pollutants. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 169 at 10 am which falls in the “moderate” category. On Sunday, the 24-hour average AQI was 184. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had earlier said that air quality is likely to deteriorate to the lower end of poor quality on Monday.   It said an increase in farm fires was observed around Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions on Sunday but "only a marginal impact" is likely on Delhi in the coming days. Pawan Gupta, a senior scientist at Universities Space Research Association, NASA, said farm fires were observed in more districts of Punjab. Fires in Uttar Pradesh have also started showing up, he said. Also, there is a marked dip in minimum temperatures recorded in Delhi. On Monday, it settled at 19.3 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. The minimum temperature is likely to drop to 18 degrees Celsius by Wednesday. Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-to-be-moderate-for-two-days-897516.html

The decision to ease the limit was taken on Sunday by the Uttarakhand Chardham Devasthanam Board which manages the affairs of the temples. It was prompted by a steep rise in the number of people applying for e-passes to visit the shrines ever since the mandatory requirement of bringing a negative RT-PCR test report was done away with, the board's CEO Ravinath Raman said.          Now 3,000 devotees each can visit Kedarnath and Badrinath temples daily while 900 can offer prayers at Gangotri and 700 at Yamunotri, he said. This does not include the number of pilgrims visiting the temples by heli services daily, Raman said. Earlier, the daily limit for the number of pilgrims visiting chardham was 800 for Kedarnath, 1,200 for Badrinath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-daily-limit-for-pilgrims-visiting-chardham-eased-897522.html

I will get a daily report about resolved and pending grievances," the Chief Minister said. Kejriwal has also issued directions to departments concerned to fill potholes to reduce dust emissions, which, he said, is a major contributor to air pollution in the city. "Teams have been inspecting construction sites to check dust pollution," he said. The Chief Minister said one of the major reasons for high levels of pollution in Delhi and nearby areas is stubble burning. "Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute here have found an economical way to deal with the problem. They have prepared a solution which can turn stubble into manure," he said. "We are going to prepare this solution at a large scale from Tuesday under the supervision of experts from the institute. This solution will be used in Delhi this year. Next year, we will urge other states to use it," Kejriwal said. He also said that 11 thermal power plants within 300 km of Delhi have missed the December 2019 deadline to meet new emission norms. "We shut down our two thermal power plants. These 11 plants need to reduce their emissions," Kejriwal said. The Chief Minister said that action is also needed against a large number of brick kilns using outdated technology in nearby areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/arvind-kejriwal-launches-anti-air-pollution-campaign-in-delhi-897538.html

The child was killed on September 29 by her two aunts, who had then covered his body in a blanket and hid it in a wardrobe inside their house, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Noida, Harish Chander said. "The child had gone missing and on September 29, the family had approached the local Surajpur police station where a case for 'missing' was lodged in connection with the matter and probe taken up," Chander said. Later that night, the toddler's body was recovered from the wardrobe and taken to a hospital where doctors confirmed death and stated asphyxiation as the cause, the officer said. "The matter was investigated and the two aunts were interrogated based on evidence suggesting their role. The two women have confessed to killing the child and have been arrested," he claimed. The incident took place when accused Pinki, who is married and is the elder sister of co-accused Rinki, had visited her parent's house, the police said. Both siblings, around 30 years of age, told police that they were upset with the child's mother Sapna, wife of their brother, over her attitude towards them, according to the police. They were also "jealous" of Sapna as their brother took her side and often taunted the sisters on various issues, giving rise to hatred among them that led to the extreme step by the duo, the police said. An FIR has been lodged against them at the Surajpur police station under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), the police added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-aunts-smother-toddler-hide-body-in-wardrobe-arrested-897542.html

As Covid-19 continues to spread, it’s a question that haunts all sectors of society but perhaps sex workers most of all with the fear of being pushed further into the shadows in an age of social distancing darkening their present and clouding the future. Eating one day, going hungry the next, their children turfed out of school because of lack of devices needed for online education and unable to make rent, the last six months have been a nightmare and one that shows no signs of ending, say several community members and those who fight for their rights. “When the lockdown happened, each and every community was affected. The government seemed to care about all and offered them some form of relief but there has been nothing for us,” Lalita Harijan, who has been working as a sex worker in Karnataka’s Belgavi district for over two decades, told PTI. It’s about immediate relief but also revival for a line of work that involves physical proximity and may have led to social stigma but also a livelihood on which their families depend, she said. There have been efforts to increase awareness about sanitising their premises and also innovations such virtual ways of servicing clients, but to little avail. Lalita would make between Rs 400-Rs 1,000 a day before the pandemic struck but hasn’t earned a rupee since the nationwide lockdown that came into effect in March. With no income and a family of nine people to feed — mother, son and daughter and their spouses, their three children and herself -- survival is almost impossible, she said. “My son and son-in-law worked in a cloth factory but their employer stopped paying them during the lockdown. Initially, we got some help from NGOs etc, but now mostly it is about eating one day, and going hungry the next day," she said.  Lalita added that she has also not been able to pay the monthly rent of Rs 2,500 for her house in the last few months, and fears eviction in the near future.    Organised under various groups, the future stretches bleak for women like Lalita, one of the estimated eight lakh sex workers in the country With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, their livelihoods based on physical contact are in peril. On September 29, the Supreme Court directed all states to provide dry rations to sex workers identified by the National AIDS Control Organisation and legal service authorities without insisting on any proof of identity. The states were asked to file compliance reports within four weeks. The bench, comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Ajay Rastogi, said it would deal later with the aspect of whether financial assistance could be provided to them during the period of the pandemic. A week earlier, on September 22, the apex court had directed the Centre and state governments to help out the community. This was a few days after the Kolkata-based Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee approached the apex court for support in the face of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. But there are hurdles aplenty with many sex workers not being documented, said rights activist Meena Seshu. “Sex workers move frequently to escape identification by family or for better earning opportunities. They also hide their identity due to the stigma attached to their work. This makes it very difficult to provide relief work though government channels that ask for ration cards and other identity and address proof,” Seshu said. “Recognition of sex workers as informal workers and their registration is important so they are able to get worker benefits. They should be provided with at least temporary documents that enable them to access welfare measures such as PDS and insurance benefits,” Seshu, who founded SANGRAM, a Maharashtra-based NGO empowering sex workers, added. The loss of livelihood is also affecting the lives of the sex workers’ families, especially their children, after schools started online classes.  “Most of these women can barely afford electricity in their homes… They can’t afford internet connectivity or the smartphones needed to attend classes," Bharati Dey, mentor at the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, told PTI. With the lockdown being lifted in phases across the country, professionals in most sectors have gradually started returning to work with proper social distancing measures in place. However, the situation remains unchanged for sex workers.  According to Kusum, president of the All India Network of Sex Workers (AINSW), a majority of the client base of sex workers comprises migrant labourers. “We have made women in brothels across the country aware of the need for sanitisation, and servicing the clients with minimum physical contact, but there are barely any clients coming. Most of them left during the migrant exodus, and those who stayed back are too afraid of contracting the virus. “Besides, with unsteady incomes at the moment, the labourers cannot really afford to spend money on sex workers,” Kusum said. Going online has more problems than advantages, said Kiran Deshmukh, who has been working  out of a brothel in Sangli, Maharashtra, for 27 years.   “Initially, we thought like everything else, we too can go online. but we realised that it carried the risk of being recorded and our videos could be leaked on the internet. So we tried to complete the job over text chats. But the problem with doing the work online or through phone is that clients often refuse to pay,” added Deshmukh, who is also president of the National Network of Sex Workers. The shame associated with the profession only adds to the burden for those who kept their work a secret.  A 34-year-old working in Warangal, for instance, kept the fact that she was a sex worker hidden from her family for eight years. But now questions are being raised. “My family knew I was working at some company… But because I haven’t been working since the lockdown got over and they see other people returning to work, the question have started. I am not sure how long I can keep up with this,” she said. Her family of five — mother, brother, two children and herself (her husband died a few years back) -- survives on a Rs 5,000 from her brother’s handicap and her widow pension. Before the pandemic, she would make Rs 15,000 a month. “Maybe the government can provide skill development programmes for us so we can have an alternative livelihood. I have lost complete hope of being able to return to work anytime soon,” she said. While relief is essential, it is the recovery of their profession that worries the community the most. Unlike other professions where social distancing and sanitisation is enough to reopen offices, it will be more than just a while before sex workers can return to work. “The government has been saying that we need to learn to live with Covid-19, but how? I am clueless about when we will be able to return to work. And, honestly, even I am scared. What if I catch the infection and then spread it to my family?” said Lalita.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/eating-one-day-going-hungry-the-next-sex-workers-fight-for-survival-in-age-of-social-distancing-897568.html

Till now, the government's policy required agencies to plant 10 saplings for each tree felled during their construction work, Kejriwal said during a digital press conference. "No one knows how much time these 10 saplings would take to grow. So, we are soon going to approve a new policy under which agencies will have to transplant 80 per cent of the trees affected by their projects to a new location," he said.   "They will still have to plant 10 saplings each for every tree felled... The number of trees won't reduce this way," he said.   Ten saplings will have to be planted for each tree being transplanted too, according to officials. The government will also come out with a list of empanelled technical agencies, which will be doing the transplantation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-soon-approve-tree-transplantation-policy-arvind-kejriwal-897591.html

Since the man warned her against approaching police in connection with the alleged offence that took place in the Uttar Pradesh capital, the woman fled from there and somehow managed to reach Nagpur, located over 800 km from Lucknow. She came to a friend here who helped her in lodging a zero FIR, they said. A zero First Information Report (FIR) can be filed in any police station and it can be later transferred to the appropriate police station having competent jurisdiction. As per the woman's complaint, she came to India from Nepal in 2018 for a job. Since March this year, she was staying with a woman friend in the latter's rented flat on Faizabad Road in Lucknow, senior police inspector Wazeer Sheikh, from Nagpur's Koradi police station, told PTI. The friend introduced the victim to the accused, Pravin Rajpal Yadav, a Lucknow native who worked as software engineer in Dubai, on a video call. According to the victim, she had kept Rs 1.5 lakh with her friend and when she asked for it, the latter did not return the money and started beating and harassing her. The victim complained about this to Yadav, who then booked a room for the victim at a hotel in Lucknow and asked her to shift there, the official said. After a couple of days, the accused also came to Lucknow from Dubai. He met the victim at the hotel, where he allegedly drugged her and raped her, the official said. The accused also shot some objectionable photographs and videos of the victim. He also took her to a friend's place in Lucknow where he allegedly again gave her drugs and raped her, the official said. The accused later uploaded the victim's photos on her social media accounts and threatened to make them viral if she did not listen to him or approached police, the official said. The woman somehow managed to escape from Lucknow and came to a Nepalese friendin Nagpur on September 30. They went to Koradi police station here and lodged a complaint against Yadav and the victim's woman friend from Lucknow, the official said. Based on the complaint, the police on Saturday lodged a zero FIR against the accused under Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (rape), 354 (molestation), 392 (robbery), 342 (wrongful confinement), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating), he said.

The couple got married on February 7, 2016. However, the woman left her husband's house in the state's Dewas district after the wedding due to alleged dowry harassment. The couple's ailing son also died during treatment some days back, Sadar Bazar police station in-charge Ajay Verma said. According to the complainant, her 30-year-old husband was planning to get married for the second time to marry a woman from Harda.

UP police also lodged an FIR listing as many as 19 charges, including those of sedition and promoting enmity between different groups in this regard. A senior UP police official here claimed that there was a conspiracy to foment trouble in the state on the lines of 'Black Lives Matter' (BLM) with foreign funding. "Several websites came up suddenly after the Hathras incident...they started uploading fake videos, pictures and provocative content in a bid to instigate violence," the official said. The police singled out a website, which they claimed had also prepared a site for BLM protests in the USA. The cops said that some organisations, which had helped the protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), were also trying to foment trouble after Hathras incident. "Many such websites have disappeared...we are trying to track them..we will take strict action against them...we have some audio tapes also in our possession, which support the conspiracy charge," the official said. An FIR was registered at Chandapa police station in Hathras on Monday under sections 124 A (sedition), 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups) and 505 (Intending to cause Public Alarm), among others. Senior Congress leader P L Punia, however, termed the conspiracy charge as an "imaginary story" put forth by the BJP to divert attention from the case. The SC teen had been brutally assaulted by four youths and died in the hospital. The family members alleged that she was gang raped. The police allegedly held her family and hostage and cremated the body at midnight on Tuesday. All the four accused have been arrested The police claimed that the postmortem report and forensic examination of the Hathras victim did not confirm 'rape or gang rape' and that she had died owing to injury on her neck. UP government has already recommended a CBI inquiry into the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/yogi-adityanath-claims-hathras-protest-an-international-conspiracy-sedition-charges-included-in-fir-897660.html

A large number of JKNPP activists including women led by party chairman and former minister Harsh Dev Singh assembled outside party headquarters at Gandhi Nagar and raised slogans demanding capital punishment to the culprits involved in the gang-rape. They also shouted slogans against the BJP and claimed that the law and order situation in the country had crumbled under the saffron party's rule with an increase in the cases of rapes, murders and kidnappings. “The bizarre spine chilling rape and murder incident of Hathras had not only put a mark of disgrace upon our society but also exposed the presence of fearless and cold-blooded misogynist criminals posing grave insecurity to the womenfolk in view of the anarchy running in the country,” Singh told reporters. He said the bestiality faced by the innocent girl followed by her unreligious despicable cremation in a hush-hush manner during early hours has raised millions of eyebrows over the credibility and integrity of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. “What happened to your tall slogans 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao?

The alleged incidents had taken place on September 20 and September 25, a police officer said quoting the FIR lodged by the woman on Sunday. The complainant is a resident of a village under Piparia police station area in Hoshangabad district. "The woman stated that she was sleeping inside her house with her sister and parents, but on the next day (September 20) she found herself in a farmhouse in Silwani village where four men allegedly raped her," said the police station incharge Umesh Tiwari. The woman also claimed three more men raped her before dropping her back to her village on September 25, he said, adding that all the accused are residents of the woman's village. When asked how the victim reached Silwani from her village, district Superintendent of Police Santosh Singh Gaur said it was a matter of investigation. "The complainant claimed she was sleeping inside her house and that she found herself at a farm house in Silwani the next day (September 20)," he said.

His visit prompted a strong reaction from the Congress which said it was “most objectionable” for the MP to do so. Talking to newspersons after his visit to the jail, Diler said he had gone to meet the Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), but on finding that the officer was down with Covid-19 he did not meet him. “I had gone to the SSP’s residence for some works of my supporters,” Diler said. The MP claimed when he was returning, he was stopped by some people of his constituency and when he was talking to them the jailor invited him to his office for a cup of tea. “I had tea in his office. I had not gone there to meet anyone .Opposition parties are just raking up the issue. This charge (that I met the accused) is wrong," he said. The Aligarh jail, which houses prisoners from the neighbouring Hathras district as well, is on the same road as the SSP’s residence. When asked if he had gone to meet the four accused in the jail, the MP said he should not be dragged into any controversy. Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra said the BJP MP’s visit to a jail where the gang rape accused are lodged is “most objectionable”. The Hathras incident is being watched by the entire country and under such circumstances a visit by an MP to the jail where the accused are lodged is not a small issue, she said. He should not have gone there under the prevailing circumstances, she said. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-mp-visits-jail-where-hathras-accused-are-lodged-says-jailor-invited-him-for-tea-897745.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Hathras case: Police register 19 FIRs, say attempts made to trigger caste conflict||Amid outrage over the alleged gang-rape and the death of a Dalit woman, Uttar Pradesh police have lodged at least 19 FIRs across the state on charges ranging from attempt to trigger caste conflict to sedition. As protests over the Yogi Adityanath government’s handling of the case continued, an AAP delegation to the victim’s village was confronted by a man who hurled ink at party MP Sanjay Singh. The UN in India also commented on the Hathras incident and the recent death of another Dalit woman after alleged gang-rape in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur, provoking a strong reaction from the Ministry of External Affairs. The FIR lodged at Chandpa police station in Hathras district against “unknown persons” mentioned alleged attempts to foment cast conflict, promoting enmity between groups and tarnish the image of the government and invoked section 124A of the Indian Penal Code -- the serious charge of sedition. Eighteen other sections of the Indian Penal Code and one under the IT Act were also listed in the FIR on Sunday afternoon. In Lucknow on Monday, state’s Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said there are FIRs registered on similar lines in other UP districts as well. Besides six cases at different police stations in Hathras, 13 more FIRs have been filed in Bijnor, Saharanpur, Bulandshahar, Allahabad, Ayodhya and Lucknow for vitiating the atmosphere, he said. The FIRs also deal with matter posted on social media. In his remarks to BJP workers, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath referred to “recent incidents” and said “anarchist elements” are trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state. A 19-year-old girl was allegedly raped on September 14 in a village in Hathras and succumbed to her injuries a fortnight later at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Her hurried cremation in the dead of the night, allegedly without the parents’ consent, created further outrage. An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) group that travelled to Hathras Monday to meet her family was confronted by a man who hurled ink at MP Sanjay Singh, smudging the leader's white kurta just as he was about to speak with the media. "PFI dalal wapas jao" (PFI agents, go back), he shouted. The reference was to Popular Front of India, which has been accused in the past – including by the Adityanath government -- of being an extremist group. The man was immediately taken into custody by police. Singh later posted a photo on Twitter, purportedly showing the man who threw ink at him with ADGP (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar. Apart from the sedition charge, the FIR lodged at Chandpa police station also lists sections related to conspiracy and intention to cause public alarm. Police also included section 67 of the IT Act, which deals with transmitting obscene material in electronic form. In a statement in Delhi, UN Resident Coordinator Renata Dessallien said, “The UN in India is profoundly saddened and concerned at the continuing cases of sexual violence against women and girls in India.” The MEA called the comment “unwarranted”. “UN Resident Coordinator in India should be aware that these cases have been taken extremely seriously by the government," a statement, adding that the investigation is still underway. In Lucknow, poet Munawwar Rana's daughter Sumaiya Rana claimed she was put under house arrest for several hours, with police stopping her from going out to paste posters related to the Hathras episode. Police denied the allegation. Police also said they have tightened security around the Hathras victim’s house. In the past, however, the family members have claimed they have faced intimidation from police officials around them. While Adityanath accused the opposition of fomenting trouble between communities, senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Govind Chowdhury hurled the same charge at Adityanath.

The Pakistan Army initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing from small arms and intense shelling of mortars along the LoC in the Nowshera sector of Rajouri, a defence spokesperson said. The Indian Army retaliated in a befitting manner, he said and added a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) identified as S Singh was killed in the firing from across the border. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC in J&K frequently. Three army soldiers were killed and four others were injured on October 1 as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire along the LoC in Kupwara and Poonch districts. Over the last eight months, more than 3,000 ceasefire violations by Pakistan have been reported, the most in 17 years. Over 3,200 ceasefire violations by Pakistan troops were recorded in 2019. In September, there were 47 violations by Pakistan of the ceasefire agreed upon by both sides in 2003. The Indian Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. There is a 198 km International Border and over 510 km of LoC with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-officer-killed-as-pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-rajouri-897782.html

While the two of the accused were picked up on Sunday, the two others were nabbed on Monday, said Bhadohi Superintendent of Police Ram Badan Singh. The accused were produced before a Bhadohi court which remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days, he added. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four men in Gyanpur police station area of the Bhadohi city on Saturday. Singh said the case of gang-rape was registered on Sunday on the complaint of the victim woman's husband. Citing the complaint, Singh said, "On Saturday, the woman was returning from a bank after withdrawing money, when her husband's two friends told her that they would drop her home. But, they allegedly raped her. The husband accused four men of raping his wife," he said. "A case was registered at Gyanpur police station on Sunday against the four men.

05-10-2020||North and Central||Punjab CM asks farmers to ease rail roko agitation||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday urged protesting farmers to ease their ongoing 'rail roko' agitation and allow goods trains to pass through, in the larger interest of the state. However, he reiterated his government's complete support to the farmers in their fight against the Centre's new farm laws. Different farmers' bodies had stepped up their agitation by resorting to blocking rail tracks for an indefinite period from October 1 in the state to protest the new farm legislations. Although farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been squatting at rail tracks in Amritsar and Ferozepur since September 24. In an appeal to the protesting farmers, the chief minister urged them to ease their rail blockade in order to ensure that the state is able to meet its critical needs and ensure that the citizens, including the farming community, are not put to any serious inconvenience in the coming days. In a statement here, the chief minister pointed out that due to the prolonged blockade of goods trains, the situation at Punjab's coal plants is critical and they are left with only five to six days' supply of coal. Once the supplies run out, the government will be forced to shut down these plants, which will severely impact the state's electricity supply and cause immense hardship to the citizens, he said. Further with not a single fertilizer rake entering Punjab for the last one week, there could be a severe shortage of fertilizers for use by farmers for the sowing of the wheat crop, he said. There is, therefore, an urgent need to allow inflow of fertilizer rakes into the state to ensure that there are sufficient stocks for the Rabi season, he said.           Singh also pointed to the need to create space for the storage of rice and wheat, to be harvested by Punjab's farmers in the coming seasons. For this, the existing stocks of these foodgrains would have to be lifted and dispatched by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to other parts of the country, he said.         Singh asked the farmers to take cognisance of these grave concerns and let goods trains to ply through Punjab in order to allow movement of coal, fertilizers and food grains. Such movement was essential to prevent any serious inconvenience to the farmers and other Punjabis, he said, exhorting the Kisan Unions to heed his personal request in the larger interest of the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-cm-asks-farmers-to-ease-rail-roko-agitation-897812.html
05-10-2020||North and Central||Comparison of Hathras, Baran cases 'totally unfair', says Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot||Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused the BJP of using the incident of the alleged rape of two minor sisters from Rajasthan's Baran district to divert attention from the Hathras gang-rape case and said a comparison between the two is "totally unfair". The state government is open to BJP leaders visiting Baran so that they know what the truth is, Gehlot told PTI. Two minor sisters from Baran went missing on September 19 and were found in Kota on September 22. The girls were handed over to their families after recording their statements, according to police. The police said both the girls, in their statements, made it clear that they were not raped and had gone to Kota on their own without being forced. In Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, a 19-year-old woman was brutally assaulted and allegedly raped by four men on September 14. She succumbed to her injuries a fortnight later in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her hurried cremation in the dead of the night, allegedly without her parents' consent, created further outrage. "The barbaric and shameful incident in Hathras has shocked the entire country and it has also exposed the reality of the BJP once again. The country saw what happened in Hathras. No government in the country has ever behaved the way the UP government has behaved," Gehlot said. "Every crime, be it in any state, is condemnable. There can be no compromise on women's safety but the comparison of the Hathras incident with the Baran incident is totally unfair. We are open to BJP leaders visiting Baran so that they can know what the truth is. On the other hand, what happened in Hathras is known to all," he said. The BJP has been targeting the Rajasthan government over the Baran incident. The opposition party has raised questions as to why Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra did not visit Baran. The two Congress leaders had visited Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old woman. Gehlot alleged that the BJP is trying to divert public attention from the gruesome crime which took place in Hathras. "The victim's mother kept crying to be able to see her daughter for the last time but she was cremated forcibly. Which Hindu culture does the BJP talk about when the cremation was done at night? Why was it done? This raises serious questions on the Yogi government and what happened later also exposes the reality of the BJP," he said. The brutality of the Hathras incident has triggered widespread outrage. The victim had suffered spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. Gehlot also demanded that the Centre make it compulsory for all states to register an FIR every time a crime is reported and said he will write a letter to the Union home minister putting forth his views. He said the measure, which was implemented in Rajasthan last year, will ensure that there is no under-reporting of crime. "I am writing a letter to the union home minister saying that the registration of FIRs should be compulsory in every state. We made it mandatory last year that FIR will be registered in the SP's office if the SHO refuses to lodge a case and people are quite satisfied with this arrangement," Gehlot said. "It is a step towards good governance and should be implemented across the country for providing relief to people who face hardship in registering cases," he said. Gehlot said the registration of crimes has increased in Rajasthan because of this arrangement. "We knew that the number of cases will increase and questions will be raised but the government took the decision. Now FIRs are registered in police stations in Rajasthan and no complaint goes unreported," he said. He said people often complain that police did not register their FIRs or misbehaved with them. There has been a decline in such complaints in Rajasthan after the registration of FIRs was made compulsory. The chief minister said the National Crime Records Bureau also pointed out in its crime report for 2019 that 'rise in crime' and 'increase in registration of crime by police' are two different things, a fact that is often confused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/comparison-of-hathras-baran-cases-totally-unfair-says-rajasthan-chief-minister-ashok-gehlot-897842.html
05-10-2020||Opinion||How to get more youth in parliament and legislatures||The economy is struggling to sustain jobs. The upset over the harsh lockdown and ill-timed engineering and medical entrance exams is fresh. Leading two important parties, the largest opposition outfit and a potential king-making one, into the state election are young men. Yet, the new Bihar assembly may not have many more youth than the outgoing one, where an estimated two-thirds of the legislators were over 45, the International Parliamentary Union’s definition of a young parliamentarian. After all, Indian youth shape political fortunes – they have played a key role in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ascendance, and dwindling support for the Congress and the Left has been traced, among other things, to their disconnect with youth – and political parties, without exception, speak of the need for greater youth participation in politics. And then there is the larger case for youth in positions of power: Because they have more reason to imagine a better future and the energy to chase it. Skeptics can argue against this, citing our young politicians’ failures to look beyond jaded party lines and associated rhetoric and methods, but disillusionment will lead nowhere. If we are to entertain the possibility of any meaningful change, there is little option but to repose faith in the youth to realise it. Chances of old warhorses shifting needles are slimmer. Hurdles to youth participation So, how can we have more young people in parliament and legislatures? Engaging with that question requires us to first address another: What stops young people from making it to these fora? There can be three conceivable reasons for the reluctance among political parties. One: they believe the youth, having not seen enough of life, are unprepared for the demands of top-flight politics. Two: they fear that Indian electors, raised to respect grey, will not take young candidates seriously. Three: key party decision makers, typically veterans, do not want to yield space. Since neither inexperience nor perceived elector attitude stops parties from awarding tickets to young political scions, it is primarily the insecurities of entrenched seniors that needs tackling. Looking for solutions One option to nudge political parties into backing young candidates amidst such pushbacks is to consider legally-backed youth quotas. These could be in the form of either seats exclusively (and rotationally) reserved for youth or a specified proportion of young candidates all registered parties contesting an election must field. A second option is to promote inner party democracy. If it unfolds in the manner it should, one can expect more youth to rise through the party ranks, assert themselves in party fora, and lay stronger claims on party tickets. A radical option is to consider the proportional representation (PR) system, a system that is associated with, among other things, better youth representation. The PR system idea has implications for the wider electoral system, needs many complex angles to be debated and resolved, and has little traction currently. Tying youth participation to the PR system idea then is risky. Inner party democracy, given the coercive whiff quotas can carry, is the more desirable option, but we have seen how difficult it is to achieve in the Indian context. Rahul Gandhi, for all the clout he is said to enjoy within his party, had limited success in getting young leaders to the fore. The BJP now has its own version of the High Command in place. Other parties, with the possible exception of the Left (which has its own challenges in engaging the youth), cannot honestly claim to be functioning democratically either. That said, the push for inner party democracy must remain, no matter what the challenges. The principle underlying it is too strong to forsake in the face of realpolitik. Quotas are a red flag issue in India, and, given the history of the Women’s Reservation bill, there are few chances of proposals for constituency-based reservations for youth fructifying. Parties agreeing to field a certain proportion of youth candidates is more realistic. (This, of course, will need strong clauses to check gaming by political families.) We may not even need legal back-up if one or two large political parties set the ball rolling on youth quotas and make some clever noise about it!  (Manish Dubey is a policy analyst and writer) The views expressed above are the author’s own.

05-10-2020||Panorama||Environmental outcome as a risk factor||Environment-related risk is a source of financial risk. In 2018, demonstrations such as wildfires in Amazon basin, tropical storms in Asia besides average temperature increase in America and Europe led to $80 billion worth of insured losses. Reportedly, financial markets may experience a quick drop in asset prices (known as Minsky moment) due to climate risks worth of $20 trillion.  There is an urgent need for massive re-allocation for financing the transition towards climate risk management, net-zero world, and improving resilience and adaptative capacity of the underprivileged.   Climate change can be deeply felt by people of poor nations due to high exposure to natural resources, high susceptibility to changes and low resilience to recover from those changes. This will be perilous for India due to vulnerable climatic zones and climate-sensitive livelihoods.  To unleash resilient and sustainable development, there is a need to de-risk and encourage conversations on integrating environmental and social factors into businesses. In this context, environment, social and governance (ESG)-based financial system will play an important role in steering development on green frontier pathway as businesses that rely for investments and advances can be nudged for sincere response towards climate change.   Sustainable investment derives strengths from three key developments: Corporate social responsibility (CSR); ESG-based investing; and impact investing.  Globally, CSR investing evolved from merely philanthropic aids to corporate social performance, leading to linkages with earnings and brand value. ESG-based investing provides a better alternate for sustainability reporting and strengthening financial stability.  ESG principles include identifying and quantifying non-financial values, and integrating them into corporate governance. Impact investing intends to optimise three-dimensional metric – risk, return and impact – unlike usual investment decisions based on financial risks and returns only.   In India, non-financial reporting started in 2007, followed by National Voluntary Guidelines on ESG in 2009 and subsequently joining the UN Sustainable Stock Exchange. In 2014, impetus on intangible values relating to environmental and social factors are pushed further with mandatory CSR investing for qualified businesses. Presently, there is nearly $28 billion worth of assets in sustainable investment, though comprising of 0.1% of global share.   The consequences of climate change in South Asia such as melting glacial and coastline erosions, stand at 2,30,000 deaths and $45 billion worth of financial loss, with 50% population exposed to at least one calamity. Poor communities living in these zones and relying on climate-sensitive livelihoods become highly vulnerable.  In India, climate change such as bad air quality, dying rivers and land degradation are causing further troubles to health and wellbeing, and incurring losses in agriculture and industrial regions.   In the present world order, disruption seldom occurs in isolation. The Covid-19 pandemic is the latest disruption in everyone’s daily life as well as world economy. On the brink of global recession and setbacks to productivity, world is still counting on the increasing costs of the pandemic.  In India, illustrations such as large-scale migration, poor healthcare management and severe economic contraction in Q1 2020-21 expose the fault-lines of development, tribulations of businesses and significance of social factors for economy. In such an evolving risk landscape, ascertaining sustainability of growth process requires climatic and equity considerations.  The Indian way towards ESG Policy: The recent RBI Report suggests increasing emphasis on climate and socio-economic factors, and the ESG Policy. The key idea behind this shift is to identify businesses which are less volatile and have less chances of mishaps.  While India’s political economy supports business decisions on socio-economic factors like boosting rural credit, situation gets murkier in addressing the issues of climate change.  For instance, Environmental Impact Assessment notification 2020 draws resentment and debates on several suggested policy changes such as post-facto clearances and various exemptions. It is intriguing why there has been muddle in the policy stance at the intersection of ‘ease of doing business’ and sustainability of businesses.  Shelving projects The recent incidents of gas leak in LG Polymers and gas well fire in Oil India reflect on debilitated environmental orientation of businesses. It is correct that shelving projects in the name of environmental concerns has nothing scrupulous. But, arbitrary will of businesses to continue on their own terms and overlook the implications of environmental negligence is also deplorable.  There should be a system that encourages integration of environmental and social factors in business decisions and ensures sustainable development. In this regard, non-financial reporting should become a tool to assess corporate performance and emphasis should be given on triple bottom-line framework – profit, people and planet – for investment decisions. With ESG policy in place, financial institutions can be able to monitor resource usage and efficiency, and impact on environment. Furthermore, financial system driven by ESG principles will act as a catalyst for growing impact investing and leverage on mandatory CSR. Adoption of ESG policy at the MSMEs and social business level may mitigate India’s biggest problem of access to finance. That way, social and governance factors can also be better tackled by empowering social businesses and adopting non-financial disclosures.    There are challenges in integrating the ESG criteria such as high-cost of reporting, complicated review process and credibility. In 2018, for example, the Yes Bank Ltd was one of the top 10 stocks in NIFTY-100 ESG indices. However, the Minsky moment came soon when the stock price crashed by 90% within 14 months due to serious concerns in corporate governance.   Growth process without climatic and equity considerations cannot be resilient and sustainable. Time has come to factor environmental outcomes into the risk calculus and develop a system where even if the businesses don’t care about climate change, they have to pay attention to it.    (The writer is Research Scholar, IIM-Shillong)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/environmental-outcome-as-a-risk-factor-897361.html
05-10-2020||Second Edit||Strides in life expectancy||The improvement in average life expectancy at birth for the country for the period 2014-18, as shown by the Sample Registration System, was expected – there was steady progress in this over the past decades. According to the latest figures, life expectancy is 69.4 years, which marks an increase of 0.4 years from 2013-17. Big strides have been made in life expectancy in the past, with an increase of about 20 years from 49.7 during the 1970-75 period. But the last decade did not see an advancement of the same pace as in previous years. This may be because the factors that influence longevity have suffered a setback. The pace of economic development has slowed down in recent years and the public health facilities which have a crucial role in maintaining and improving life expectancy have not grown to the extent needed. Other factors like the growth in inequality may also have had an impact.   The correlation between life expectancy and economic and social factors and circumstances is important. One notable feature is the longer life expectancy of women, who live for 70.7 years while males can expect to live for 68.2 years. Women have lived longer than men since 1981-85, but this trend is not uniform across the country. There are wide disparities between states in life expectancy of both males and females. People in Delhi, Kerala, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where there is no extreme poverty, live longer than the national average. But in poorer states like Chhattisgarh, UP, MP, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar and Jharkhand it is below the national average. A male in a Chhattisgarh village has a life expectancy of 63 years while that of an urban female in Himachal Pradesh is around 81 years. The highest life expectancy for males is in Delhi (73.8 years), and the highest for females is in Kerala (77.9 years). The figures show that there is much more to be done to ensure better health and longevity of people. Infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are important factors. While Kerala’s infant mortality rate is seven per 1,000 live births, it is 48 in MP and 43 in UP. Apart from addressing issues like poverty, social and educational backwardness and inadequacy of health facilities all over the country, special attention should be paid to reducing the disparities among states and social and economic groups. The country has lagged in all these areas. China reached India’s life expectancy levels in the 1990s and Nepal and Bangladesh, which were behind India, have gone ahead of us.  While the improvement in life expectancy is welcome, it is also reminder of the need for greater efforts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/strides-in-life-expectancy-897357.html

E T B Sivapriyan: DMK has been out of power in Tamil Nadu for the past 10 years and the assembly elections are less than seven months away in the state. What are the chances for the DMK this election, according to you? A Raja: The chances for DMK are very bright this time on two counts. First reason is that the DMK has proved that it is the only party that is concerned about people’s issues, the needs of the people and highlighting the errors of the governments. All the issues that concern the people have been democratically, legally and legitimately debated within the Parliament and outside the Parliament and hence the DMK has proved under the able leadership of our leader M K Stalin that it is a real democratic party that has stood by issues of the people. In 2011, one of the reasons for a government change was 2G spectrum allocation and in 2016 everyone knew money played a major role. Right or wrong, the government changed in 2011 and admittedly the DMK has not been in power for the past 10 years. The 10 years of AIADMK government has been marred by corruption, misrule, commission, and people’s aspirations were not reflected both inside and outside the Assembly. The Edappadi Government has miserably failed to fulfill the aspirations and expectations of the people. Even if you compare the leadership of Edappadi and Stalin, our leader was not a crisis-made or time-made leader. Edappadi was elevated because of the crisis and because of the vacuum. Stalin climbed up the ladder in the party by proving he was a good mayor (of Chennai), good MLA, good minister, good deputy chief minister and good leader of Opposition. The position that Stalin has attained is evolution-based and not based on crises. The government will change and DMK will come to power. To know more about the conversation, tune in to the podcast.

05-10-2020||South||Panneerselvam breaks silence; says his decisions were always in the interests of TN||Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam on Monday broke his silence on the stand-off between him and Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, saying he always took decisions in the interests of the people of the state and party cadre. A terse 240-character statement posted on Panneerselvam’s verified Twitter page can be interpreted as a direct message to Palaniswami that he was prepared to go any length in the fight for the control of the AIADMK. Palaniswami and Panneerselvam are locked in an intense battle – though it appears that the fight is to announce the Chief Ministerial candidate, but it is for the greater control of the party. “All my decisions so far have been in the interests of the people of Tamil Nadu and cadre of the AIADMK. It will continue to remain so even in the future,” Panneerselvam wrote, in his first reaction after his demands were rejected by the AIADMK Executive Committee meeting on September 28. தமிழக மக்கள் மற்றும் அஇஅதிமுக கழகத் தொண்டர்களின் நலனை கருத்தில் கொண்டே எனது முடிவுகள் இதுவரை இருந்துள்ளன. இனியும் அவ்வாறே இருக்கும். எது நடந்ததோ அது நன்றாகவே நடந்தது! எது நடக்கிறதோ அது நன்றாகவே நடக்கிறது!! எது நடக்கவிருக்கிறதோ அதுவும் நன்றாகவே நடக்கும்!! Quoting from Bhagavad Gita, Panneerselvam further wrote, “Whatever happened, it happened for the good. Whatever is happening, it is also happening for the good. Whatever will happen, will also happen for the good.” Panneerselvam’s message to Palaniswami comes two days ahead of the AIADMK’s self-imposed deadline to announce the Chief Ministerial face for the assembly polls due in the first half of 2021. Though Palaniswami seems to enjoy majority, Panneerselvam has managed to stop a decision on the issue twice in the past two months. The message is also being interpreted as a method to postpone the decision for the third time. While Panneerselvam is questioning the need to announce the CM candidate before elections and is insisting on strengthening his powers in the party and constitution of a committee to run day-today affairs of the party, Palaniswami is opposed to any such move. Panneerselvam, though sidelined and having lost majority of his supporters, trying to assert his authority is significant given that he has opened a line of communication with AIADMK rebel T T V Dhinakaran, nephew of V K Sasikala, for a patch-up. Deccan Herald had on September 24 reported that Panneerselvam, who rebelled against Sasikala in February 2017 before she surrendered before authorities at the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bengaluru, has dialed Dhinakaran in a bid to contain Palaniswami.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/panneerselvam-breaks-silence-says-his-decisions-were-always-in-the-interests-of-tn-897433.html

P U Sanoop, a branch secretary of ruling CPI(M), was attacked at around 10.30 pm on Sunday after aminor scuffle, police said. "Three others, who were with Sanoop were also stabbed and the condition of one person is serious," police officials told P T I. A case has been registered under various provisions of the India Penal Code including Section 302. Police have identified four accused in the case and the investigation is on. Senior minister A C Moideen, who visited the area told the media that the prime accused in the case are associated with the RSS and the Bajrang Dal. "The prime accused and others are associated with the RSS and Bajrang Dal. Police are probing thematter. Those in hospital have suffered multiple stab wounds. This is a stronghold of CPI(M). The party has been fighting gangs involved in drug peddling. We suspect the RSS is engaged in protecting these peddlers," Minister said. CPI(M) state chief Kodiyeri Balakrishnan lashed out at the RSS-BJP and the Congress and asked the parties not to engage in violent politics. "The murder of Sanoop at Kunnamkulam was done by Sangh Parivar members, including a former Congress worker, who joined the BJP recently. The BJP and the Congress have become a safe haven for criminals. The leaders of those parties are using theircriminal activists to eliminate political enemies," Balakrishnan said in a statement.

Party President M K Stalin made the promise while launching a candle light march organised by the Women’s Wing here seeking justice for the 19-year-old Dalit girl from Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped and assaulted by a group of men belonging to an upper caste. The march from Rajiv Gandhi statue in Guindy to Raj Bhawan, a distance of about 2 km, was led by Thoothukudi Lok Sabha MP Kanimozhi, also the president of the DMK’s Women’s Wing. However, Kanimozhi and others were taken into custody for trying to march towards the Raj Bhawan. In his address, Stalin demanded a court-monitored probe to get to the bottom of the alleged gang-rape of the Dalit girl in Uttar Pradesh. “Let them order any probe, but it needs to be monitored by a court. Unless and until the probe is monitored by a court, how can we expect that truth will come out?” he asked. The DMK chief also condemned the police action against former Congress President Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi during their visit to Hathras to meet the family of the girl. He also utilised the opportunity to take a dig at the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu saying women are not safe under the current dispensation. "Tamil Nadu will face elections very soon and you all know DMK will win the elections. Once we are in power, the DMK government will set up special courts to try cases relating to women in every district,” Stalin said. Kanimozhi alleged that the Tamil Nadu government was not allowing a “democratic protest” and demanded a court-monitored probe in Hathras incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-promises-special-courts-in-every-district-to-try-cases-of-violence-against-women-897696.html

The court had, in its interim orders, put a stay, barring the Jaganmohan Reddy government from any movement on the capital change. Chief Minister Reddy is keen on relocating the executive capital to Visakhapatnam and later the judiciary to Kurnool, leaving Amaravati only as the legislative capital. Amaravati was planned as a grand, greenfield capital by Reddy’s predecessor N Chandrababu Naidu. The contentious Andhra Pradesh Decentralization and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 and another one to repeal the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014 which rips the sole mega capital status of Amaravati, were approved by the YSRCP-dominated assembly twice - on January 20 and June 16. Following Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan’s assent to the capital decentralization Bills; gazette notifications of the Acts were issued by the Reddy government on July 31. However, hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the three-capital structure, the HC had, in August, put a freeze on any executive move to relocate the capital. The number of petitions – from farmers, locals, and political leaders - challenging the capital relocation has gone up to about 230 now. The Supreme Court had, in August, declined to examine the YSRCP government’s special leave petition challenging the high court’s orders. The high court will reportedly deal with the capital case both in virtual and conventional modes depending on the required scrutiny.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/three-capitals-row-andhra-pradesh-high-court-to-begin-daily-hearing-from-october-6-897786.html

05-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||SC told to direct Karnataka HC to set up more special courts to deal with cases against MPs, MLAs||The Supreme Court was on Monday told that one special court set up in Bengaluru to decide 165 pending cases against former and sitting MPs and MLAs was not sufficient as witnesses have to travel from far off places, affecting fair trials. In a fresh report, amicus curiae, senior advocate Vijay Hansaria and advocate Sneha Kalita said the number of cases pending against the legislators have increased over the last two years. They sought strict monitoring, at micro level, by the High Courts to ensure expeditious disposal of such cases. The amicus submitted before the top court that one court each in West Bengal's 24 North Pargana and Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad district was not adequate to dispose of 134 and 300 cases respectively. Hansaria gave a slew of suggestions, including taking steps for establishment of ‘safe and secure witness examination room’, video conferencing facility for each court, and creating a special website to show status of cases. He also pointed out that the total number of cases as per the latest reports have risen to 4,859, whereas, as per earlier reports filed in March, 2020, the cases were 4,442.  Hansaria's report filed in a pending PIL by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay said the Karnataka and Calcutta High Courts have insisted for continuing with one special court in the states. "Instead, it will be more appropriate to assign cases to the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to try the cases on priority basis. Other cases may be allotted to such courts only having regard to the workload," his report stated. In the case of West Bengal also, he said the High Court may be requested to establish more number of Special Courts having regard to the geographical area of the place of occurrence. In the case, Kerala, the amicus pointed out that High Court was faced with an unusual problem as it stated that “police personnel are reluctant to arrest and produce the accused legislators”. "It may be directed that the Superintendent of Police of concerned district will be personally responsible for execution of warrants and service of summons to the legislators and any breach thereof will be treated as contempt of the orders of this court," he suggested. Similarly, he said, if any legislator despite receipt of summons or warrant does not appear before the court, he or she will be liable for contempt of this court, apart from disciplinary proceedings. The top court is scheduled to take up the matter on Tuesday. The court had earlier on September 17 asked Chief Justices of all High Court to decide within two months all those cases where stay has been granted in trial against sitting and former MPs and MLAs. Holding that ensuring the purity of democratically elected institutions is the hallmark of the present proceedings, the court then said the legislators are the repositories of the faith and trust of their electorate, there is a necessity to be aware of the antecedents of the elected person.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/sc-told-to-direct-karnataka-hc-to-set-up-more-special-courts-to-deal-with-cases-against-mps-mlas-897617.html

The CBI action, the first against Shivakumar, also came days after a businessman Iqbal Hussain who is considered close to the Congress leader, was questioned by the ED on properties and business dealings of the former Karnataka Minister. Shivakumar, a trouble-shooter for the Congress, has denied all allegations against him. The ED had registered a case under the Pention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Shivakumar and four of his associates, including an employee of the Karnataka Bhavan in Delhi, in September 2018 on the basis of an Income Tax Department charge-sheet, claiming that he evaded tax and indulged in hawala deals. After several rounds of questioning, Shivakumar was arrested by the ED on September 3 last year, days after former Finance Minister P Chidambaram was arrested by the CBI in the INX Media case. The Opposition had then alleged a "witch-hunt" of Opposition leaders by the Narendra Modi government using central investigative agencies.  He spent 50 days in ED and judicial custody before he was granted bail by the Delhi High Court. According to the ED, Shivakumar is accused of transporting huge amounts of unaccounted cash regularly through ‘hawala’ channels with the help of his associate S K Sharma, who runs a transport firm. Anjaneya Hanumanthaiah, the Karnataka Bhavan employee is accused of handling unaccounted cash of Shivakumar in Delhi while another associate Rajendra deals with Shivakumar’s immovable properties. Narayan, a business partner, is also named by the ED in its case. The I-T Department had claimed that it had seized unaccounted cash of around Rs 8.5 crore from Shivakumar. It had claimed that Shivakumar had set up "an extensive network" of persons and premises across Delhi and Bengaluru in order to transport and utilise unaccounted cash. Sources said that the CBI registering a case against Shivakumar was based on source information from another agency and it related to assets amassed during Shivakumar's tenure as a minister in Karnataka.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cbi-case-comes-two-years-after-ed-booked-shivakumar-on-money-laundering-charges-897626.html

Searches are underway by the CBI at 14 locations linked to Shivakumar in connection with allegations of acquisition of disproportionate assets. According to sources, places that are being searched included properties of Suresh. Congress leaders have hit out at the BJP governments at the Centre and the state for the CBI searches, questioning its timing ahead of November 3 bypolls to Sira and R R Nagar Assembly segments. Party workers are holding demonstrations in front of Shivakumar's residence and various places, against the CBI search, calling the agency as an "agent of BJP."  CBI has registered a fresh case against the Congress leader based on source information from another agency. The information relates to assets amassed during Shivakumar's tenure as a minister in Karnataka, officials said. "CBI has registered a case against the then Minister of Karnataka Government and others on the allegations of acquisition of Disproportionate Assets. Searches are being conducted today at 14 locations including 9 in Karnataka, 4 in Delhi, one in Mumbai," a statement by CBI said. Earlier, Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the money laundering case and was lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody. He was released from the jail on October 23 after the Delhi High Court order granted him bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bjps-hollow-threats-will-not-shake-us-nor-will-we-bow-down-to-pressure-tactics-d-k-suresh-897640.html
05-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka govt prohibits public servants and health personnel from strikes, refusal to work amid Covid-19||Karnataka on Monday invoked several legal provisions to prohibit public servants and health personnel from “strikes, non-cooperation, disobeying or refusal to work” and other things, keeping the Covid-19 pandemic in mind. This diktat will apply to “any public servant, health personnel, regular, contractual and outsourced employees of the Health Department in the interest of public health,” Chief Secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar said in a notification. The government has invoked provisions under the Disaster Management Act and the Karnataka Epidemic Disease Ordinance to keep employees from “strikes, non-cooperation, disobeying or refusal to work related to health services, non-submission of reports, non-compliance to the orders issued by higher authorities,” the notification said. The notification also pointed out that disobeying or refusing work entrusted by a superior officer on Covid-19 would amount to a violation of the provisions of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Prevention of Strikes) Act. Last month, more than 5,000 government doctors launched an indefinite strike threatening to shut outpatient services and stop releasing daily Covid-19 data. They rescinded after senior ministers intervened. The government hopes that the notification barring health personnel from striking work would help contain the Covid-19 pandemic even as cases continue to rise.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-prohibits-public-servants-and-health-personnel-from-strikes-refusal-to-work-amid-covid-19-897741.html

05-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka seeks immediate release of GST compensation||Karnataka on Monday asked the GST Council for “immediate release” of compensation due to “acute financial stress”. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who represents Karnataka in the GST Council, said capital and revenue expenditure of the state was adversely affected due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The budget proposals have to be immediately implemented and six months have already lapsed in the financial year. The immediate release of compensation would result in more spending by the states leading to a boost in the overall demand for goods and services,” Bommai said in a statement. The Centre should release the cess amount collected up to September 2020 “to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore,” he said. Karnataka welcomed the Centre’s suggestion that the cess collection would be extended beyond 2022. “This was the suggestion of Karnataka in the previous meeting of the GST Council,” Bommai said. The state has already accepted Option-1 for compensation under which the government will borrow Rs 11,324 crore. Bommai said the Centre proposed reducing the assumed growth rate from 10% to 7% while calculating the loan amount. “Karnataka welcomes this since the amount available for loan will increase to Rs 1.10 lakh crore from the present Rs 97,000 crore for all states and to Rs 12,400 crore from Rs 11,324 crore for Karnataka up to January 2021,” he said. Bommai also said that the Centre should bargain a special reduced rate of interest for the states and that “the loan facility should be allowed to be taken in a flexible manner as per the requirements of the states, even extending it to the next year if required.” Further, the minister said ‘confrontationist’ approach should be shed in the interest of ‘cooperative federalism’ and all states and the Centre should come to a consensus. “The finance should be provided as per the state’s option in the form of loan immediately under Option-1,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-seeks-immediate-release-of-gst-compensation-897777.html

05-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Officials fear major drop in APMC numbers in Karnataka||The number of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) in Karnataka could shrink from 162 to 30, officials fear, after the government freed up farm trading that will lead to a revenue loss of some Rs 600 crore annually. Sources in the cooperation department told DH that the implementation of the new legislation, passed by the Centre, will have an “adverse effect” on 60,000 traders and middlemen dependent on APMCs for livelihood. “The number of markets will come down to around 30, along with a proportional effect on employment,” a source said.  Meanwhile, several companies which used to procure agricultural produce under the terms of Direct Purchase Centre (DPC) licence regulated by the cooperaton department, have now sought cancellation of the same as DPCs will be unnecessary under new law. While such move will have a disastrous effect on APMCs, sources in the department fear that it would also effect the procurement prices fixed for DPCs based on trading at APMCs, apart from paving way for monopoly markets of agro produce. Eager to make use of the provisions of new APMC legislation, seven firms have sought cancellation of DPC licences “to get away from the regulations - such as minimum support price - mandated under DPC licensing. While the seven are small to medium firms, even large companies have enquired about cancelling the licences,” the sources added. When contacted, Cooperation Minister S T Somashekar said that anyone willing procure produce need not apply for a licence nor register with the department. “Deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners of the district will be the regulatory authority,” he said, adding that anyone with a PAN card can procure crops. On the new legislation’s effect on price-fixing mechanism, he said that the state would continue to insist on procuring goods based on the average price of in APMC yards. “There will be no problem for farmers with regard to price,” he said. Change in legislation also forced the government to reduce market fee for APMCs, as Centre levied zero per cent market fee for new DPCs. The state government, due to pressure from farmer groups, reduced market fee of APMCs from 1.5%  to 0.35%. Sources added that it would hit the revenue of APMC department by Rs 500-600 crore. The department generated around Rs 618 crore last year and around Rs 590 crore in 2018-19. Due to the new fees, the department will shore up only Rs 120 cr, seriously affecting the maintenance of APMCs, sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/officials-fear-major-drop-in-apmc-numbers-in-karnataka-897833.html

State Congress unit president Balasaheb Thorat said the Hathras incident has “made India hang its head in shame”. “The Yogi Adityanath government continues to remain insensitive to the issue. This case was handled in a very irresponsible and dictatorial manner. Instead of giving justice to the victim's family, the Uttar Pradesh government threatened them. “The Congress party is fighting for justice for the victim's family and a statewide ‘satyagraha’ will be held on Monday. The fight will continue till the victim's family gets justice,” Thorat, who is also the Revenue minister in the state government, said in a statement. He said demonstrations will be held at all the district headquarters in the state. “There should be a judicial inquiry by the Supreme Court into the Hathras incident. The Collector of Hathras should be suspended. "Why did the police burn the body of the victim by dousing it in petrol? Why was the victim's family threatened and misled by the UP administration? And what is the guarantee that the body that was burnt was that of the victim?

He said the incident galvanised Congress workers in the country, leading to the UP government coming to “its senses” and allowing Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to visit the victim's family on Saturday. “But on their way, Congress workers were beaten with sticks and male police officers went to the extent of touching the clothes of Priyanka Gandhi. This shows the cheap mentality of the Yogi Adityanath government towards women. People will not forget this incident and will pull the BJP and its arrogance down,” Thorat added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-congress-to-hold-protests-against-hathras-incident-on-monday-897296.html

On a day that the women's draw lost top seed Simona Halep and fifth seed Kiki Bertens, Svitolina, who reached the last eight in 2015 and 2017, put in a solid performance to be the highest-ranked player remaining in the claycourt Grand Slam. Garcia had come from a set and a break down to win her past three meetings against fellow 26-year-old Svitolina, but there was no such repeat as the Ukrainian broke her opponent's serve six times to complete victory in just 63 minutes. Svitolina converted six of her 13 breakpoint opportunities as Garcia struggled with her serve on a windy day at Court Philippe Chatrier. Garcia, who also reached the last eight at her home Grand Slam, only managed to hold serve twice in the match. The Ukrainian hit six winners less than Garcia but was much more disciplined, making 20 fewer unforced errors than her opponent. "Definitely, it was not easy for both of us," Svitolina said in her courtside interview. "I think it was really important to get into the consideration that it's really windy and try to adjust the game as quick as possible and the person who adjusted the quickest would win, so I'm happy that it's me today." Svitolina converted her first match point when Garcia sent a forehand wide, and she will play Argentine qualifier Nadia Podoroska, who defeated Czech Barbora Krejcikova 2-6 6-2 6-3, for a place in the semi-finals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/svitolina-breezes-past-garcia-into-quarter-finals-897306.html

05-10-2020||West||Why did Mumbai police ignore the drug angle in Sushant Singh Rajput case, asks BJP||The BJP on Sunday questioned as to why the Mumbai Police, which was earlier probing actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, ignored the drugs angle in the case and whether it was done deliberately to “safeguard the interests of powerful people”. The party said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government should take full responsibility for this “failure”, and accused it of allowing the alleged Bollywood-drugs nexus to blossom. The allegations were made in a letter BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. In the letters, Kadam said the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has initiated a massive crackdown to expose the Bollywood-drug mafia nexus. “More than 20 persons have been arrested, whereas several prominent personalities have been summoned by the NCB. This drug link with Bollywood seems one of the significant aspects in the murder mystery of the late actor,” Kadam said. He claimed that the actor’s family and close friends had highlighted this alleged drugs link before as well as after his death. “The question is why this link was conveniently ignored by the Mumbai Police, which was clearly acting as per the instructions of the state government. Was this cover-up done to safeguard the interests of powerful people?” he asked. Kadam claimed that the probe into the case was with the Mumbai Police for 65 days and the drug chats were available on Rhea Chakraborty’s mobile phone. Rhea is facing a probe in the actor’s death case. Kadam said that Bollywood personalities are idols of the youth and "rendering a blind eye to the dangerous nexus seems to have a detrimental effect on many youths and young actors like Sushant". "The Maharashtra government should take full responsibility for the failure and allowing the Bollywood-drugs nexus to blossom,” Kadam alleged. State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, however, hit back at Kadam, saying it was “shameless” on the part of the BJP to say such things. “Rajput’s death case and the NCB probe have no connection. In fact, the BJP’s drugs links should be probed. Devendra Fadnavis was chief minister for five years, why wasn’t the drug angle probed?” he asked. “What is the connection of (film producer) Sandeep Ssingh with the BJP? These people enjoy Mumbai Police’s security, but at the same time don’t hesitate to malign the image of the force. People of Maharashtra will not forgive them,” Sawant said. Rajput was found hanging in his Bandra apartment on June 14. The Mumbai Police had earlier registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and launched an investigation. However, the CBI took over the probe into the high-profile case in August following the Supreme Court's nod. Rajput's father K K Singh had on July 25 lodged a complaint with the Bihar police against his son's rumoured girlfriend and actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members accusing them of abetting his suicide.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/why-did-mumbai-police-ignore-the-drug-angle-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-asks-bjp-897332.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in a written submission to the court on Monday denied allegations of malice and personal vendetta, and said Ranaut's claim of Rs 2 crore as damages from the BMC for partial demolition of her bungalow cannot not be "entertained". It said after being served a stop work notice, Ranaut submitted a "false and evasive reply" denying that any illegal construction work was going on at the site. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla conducted hearings on the plea last week. On Monday, the court accepted written submissions from counsels of Ranaut and the BMC summing up their arguments before closing the matter for orders. Ranaut approached the high court September 9 after the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Pali Hill area here by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). She had sought that the demolition be declared illegal and the court direct BMC to pay her Rs 2 crore as damages. In its written submission to the HC, the BMC said it was disputing the actor's claims of several movable property and articles having been damaged during such demolition. There was no proof that any movable property or articles were damaged during the demolition carried out at Ranaut's bungalow. Therefore, paying any compensation for the same was not warranted, it said. "The petitioner's claim for Rs 2 crore compensation for movables/ articles allegedly damaged or destroyed during the demolition cannot beadjudicated in the present proceedings," the BMC said. "The fact that such movables were in fact destroyed during the demolition has been denied and is disputed. The alleged value of such movables is also disputed," it said. "It is respectfully submitted that in the absence of proper proof, such allegations and claims for compensation for loss allegedly caused cannot be entertained," the BMC said in the submission filed through its counsels Joel Carlos, Anil Sakhre and Aspi Chinoy. It reiterated that Ranaut had "brazenly and unlawfully" carried out extensive alterations and additions to the bungalow in breach of its approved building plan. The BMC said after being served a stop work notice under section 354 (A) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, Ranaut submitted a "false and evasive reply" denying that any illegal construction work was ongoing at the site. It is because of such false reply that the BMC had to take the next step of issuing a demolition notice and carrying out the demolition work, the civic body said. Both the BMC, and its H-ward officer Bhagyawant Late, who is also a party in the case, submitted that the civic body and its officials had been performing their statutory duty in carrying out the demolition work. They denied all allegations of malice and personal vendetta that Ranaut had made in her plea. Ranaut, through her counsel Dr Birendra Saraf, had alleged that the BMC carried out the demolition out of malice following a comment she made against the Mumbai Police that irked the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra. She had also cited an alleged threat given to her by Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut in an interview. Saraf told the HC during previous hearings that the demolition was carried out on September 9, the same day as the interview. The BMC's counsels, had, however, denied the actor's allegations. They said the BMC had simply been performing its statutory duty in demolishing such portions of the bungalow that Ranaut had altered illegally. In an affidavit filed through Carlos, the civic body alleged that despite making illegal structural changes, Ranaut had approached court for relief. This was an abuse of the process of law, the BMC said and urged the HC to dismiss her plea and impose a cost on her. Raut also told the court through his counsel Pradeep Thorat that the BMC's action had nothing to do with his interview or any other comments made on Ranaut. During the previous hearings, the bench questioned the BMC's swiftness in demolishing Ranaut's property. It also stayed the demolition through an interim order and noted that had the BMC shown similar swiftness in all cases of illegal construction, Mumbai would have been a very different city. The court had also asked Raut if it befitted a parliamentarian to use ungraceful language against a citizen? "Don't you have any grace?" the HC asked after viewing a clip of the interview where Raut asked "what is law," responding to a question on if he would take legal action against Ranaut for having compared Mumbai to PoK in a tweet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bombay-high-court-reserves-order-on-kangana-ranauts-plea-against-demolition-of-part-of-her-bungalow-bmc-897462.html

The blaze erupted around 4.30 pm on Sunday in the ground-plus-three-storey structure, located near Juma mosque in South Mumbai, but fire fighting operation was on even after 30 hours, officials said on Monday. It was initially tagged as a 'level-3' (major) fire, but was later escalated to 'level-4' ((massive), the officials said. Seventeen fire vehicles, as many jumbo water tankers along with three turn-table ladders and an ambulance were involved in the operation, they said. Firefighters were at the spot and efforts were still underway to douse the flames, a fire official said, adding the area is enveloped in a thick layer of smoke. During the operation, two firefighters received injuries and were rushed to the government-run J J Hospital located nearby, he said. Both of them were later discharged from the hospital, the official said. The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained, he said. According to another Fire Brigade official, as the building has godowns housing garments, cutlery and chemicals, thick smoke was emanating from it, making it difficult to put out the inferno. The official said this is probably the first time after the 2012 blaze in Mantralaya (state secretariat) that a fire fighting operation has gone on for so long in the metropolis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/30-hours-on-fire-fighting-still-underway-at-mumbai-market-897530.html

According to him, since the beginning there has been a ploy to defame Maharashtra. The 34-year-old Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead on 14 June at his Bandra duplex flat. Now, the AIIMS medical board that worked with the CBI in the case has concluded that Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide, and was not strangulated or murdered – thus concurring with the findings of the Mumbai Police probe. “It (AIIMS report) is as per the reports of Dr Sudhir Gupta, who is the head of AIIMS Forensic Medical Board in Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Dr Sudhir Gupta is not a Shiv Sainik,” said Raut. “Now the CBI probe is not being trusted…the AIIMS report is being questioned,” said Raut, a Rajya Sabha member. “Highly perturbed with AIIMS report. Going to request the CBI Director to constitute a fresh forensic team. How could AIIMS team give a conclusive report in the absence of the body, that too on such a shoddy post-mortem done by Cooper hospital wherein time of death also not mentioned,” Vikas Singh, the lawyer of Sushant’s father Krishna Kishore Singh, wrote on Twitter. Maharashtra BJP has targeted the Maha Vikas Aghadi government by alleging that the Mumbai Police was told to ignore the drug angle in the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sushant-singh-rajput-case-now-cbi-probe-aiims-report-being-questioned-says-sanjay-raut-897537.html

In an editorial of its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said truth finally prevailed in the actor's death case, and alleged that it was a conspiracy to malign Maharashtras image using the episode. It also said the Maharashtra government should file a defamation case against those who were part of the conspiracy. The medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) last week ruled out murder in Rajput's death, and termed it "a case of hanging and death by suicide". Referring to it, the Sena publication said, "Are the blind devotees going to reject the report of AIIMS in connection with Sushants death? It has been 110 days since Sushants unfortunate death." "The politicians and news channels which bark like dogs, who defamed the Mumbai Police and questioned its probe, must apologise to Maharashtra now," the editorial said. Without naming anyone or any party, it said those who remained tight-lipped in connection with the alleged gang-rape incident in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras should not test the manliness of Maharashtra. The Mumbai Police observed ethics and maintained secrecy during its probe to see one is not defamed after Rajput's death, but the CBI dug out the actors drugs episode within 24 hours of its investigation, it said. It also accused Nitish Kumar and other Bihar politicians of raising the issue since they allegedly lacked campaign issues for the upcoming Assembly polls there. Those who had pitched for probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into Rajput's death case have not questioned the central agency what it has been doing over the past 40 to 50 days, the Marathi publication said. It also asked where the actress who made capital out of Rajputs death and likened Mumbai to Pakistan is hiding now -- an apparent reference to film star Kangana Ranaut. "The actress did not shed two tears even using glycerine after a young woman was allegedly raped and killed in Hathras and her body was cremated in the dead of the night by police there," the editorial said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/those-who-defamed-mumbai-police-should-apologise-shiv-sena-on-ssr-case-row-897565.html

Raut said this when some reporters pointed out that restaurants have been allowed to operate again with their capacity not exceeding 50 per cent or as prescribed by local authorities, but temples have not been reopened in the state. "The chief minister has maintained from the beginning that things will be unlocked in a phased manner...you can impose 50 per cent restrictions on restaurants while reopening them, but it is not possible in the case of temples," he said. "The states chief minister is speaking to organisations representing all religions. Soon, the chief minister will take a decision on it," Raut said. The Rajya Sabha member also said the decision on the number of seats to be contested by the Shiv Sena in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections is expected to be taken in a day or two. "Discussion is on about contesting the Bihar polls. Our people in Bihar want us to fight 50 seats. But, we are saying that we should contest 30 to 40 seats. A decision on it will be taken today or tomorrow," he said. Asked if the Shiv Sena will field a candidate against former Bihar director general of police Gupteshwar Pandey (if he contests), Raut cryptically said, "Keep watching." "I will go to Bihar. Will answer this when I will go there, he added. Pandey, while heading the Bihar Police force, had pitched for a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case. He took voluntary retirement from service last month and joined the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U). The Bihar Assembly polls will be held in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7, and the counting of votes will take place on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-cm-to-decide-upon-reopening-places-of-worship-soon-sanjay-raut-897598.html

A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla conducted hearings on the plea last week before closing it for orders on Monday. Ranaut approached the high court September 9 after the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Pali Hill area here by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). She had sought that the demolition be declared illegal and the court direct BMC to pay her Rs 2 crore as damages. Ranaut, through her counsel Dr Birendra Saraf, had alleged that the BMC carried out the demolition out of malice following a comment she made against the Mumbai Police that irked the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra. She also cited an alleged threat given to her by Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut in an interview. Saraf told the HC during previous hearings that the demolition was carried out on September 9, the same day as the interview. The BMC's counsels, Anil Sakhre, Joel Carlos and Aspi Chinoy, had, however, denied the actor's allegations. They said the BMC had simply been performing its statutory duty in demolishing such portions of the bungalow that Ranaut had altered illegally. In an affidavit filed through Carlos, the civic body alleged that despite making illegal structural changes, Ranaut had approached court for relief. This was an abuse of the process of law, the BMC said and urged the HC to dismiss her plea and impose a cost on her. Raut also told the court through his counsel Pradeep Thorat that the BMC's action had nothing to do with his interview or any other comments made on Ranaut. During the previous hearings, the bench questioned the BMC's swiftness in demolishing Ranaut's property. It also stayed the demolition through an interim order and noted that had the BMC shown similar swiftness in all cases of illegal construction, Mumbai would have been a very different city. The court had also asked Raut if it befitted a parliamentarian to use ungraceful language against a citizen? "Don't you have any grace?" the HC asked after viewing a clip of the interview where Raut asked "what is law," responding to a question on if he would take legal action against Ranaut for having compared Mumbai to PoK in a tweet. The HC on Monday also accepted written submissions from Dr Saraf and the BMC summing up their arguments before closing the matter for orders.

Speaking during the protest, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said the incident was unfortunate and a "blot on humanity and alleged that the Uttar Pradesh governments role in the episode has been suspicious.   Thorat, who is Maharashtra's revenue minister, and other Congress leaders, including Mumbai unit president Eknath Gaikwad, staged the satyagrah (insistence on truth) protest near Mahatma Gandhi's statue close to the secretariat here. The protest was in line with the party's call for 'satyagraha' by its leaders and workers at district headquarters of various states across the country on Monday to demand justice for the family. "The Hathras incident was unfortunate and a blot on humanity. The Uttar Pradesh governments behaviour in this case has been suspicious, Thorat said. "This (behaviour) will not give justice to the woman and her family. We are seeking justice for her, he added. The minister said the 19-year-old woman was not given proper medical treatment required after the alleged atrocity was committed against her. He alleged that the woman's body was cremated in the dead of the night and her family members were not allowed to attend her funeral. "We all think it is suspicious. Hence, Priyankaji (Congress general secretary) has raised some questions and we need answers from the Uttar Pradesh government, he said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday demanded removal of the Hathras district magistrate and an investigation into his role in the entire matter. According to the victim's family, the district magistrate meted out the worst treatment to them, she had said, and asked who was protecting the officer. Thorat said the Centre and the UP government are keeping mum on the issue. "Nobody, including the media, is being allowed to meet the family. The family has been kept confined to their home, their phones have been taken away. All this is suspicious and we condemn it, he said. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday recommended a CBI probe into the alleged gang-rape and death of the 19-year-old Dalit woman that triggered a nationwide outrage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-congress-protests-seeks-justice-for-hathras-victims-kin-897615.html

Speaking to reporters here, the Water Resources Minister said the AIIMS report has also proved the Mumbai Police handled the case properly before it was taken over by the CBI. It (the AIIMS report) is a slap for those who had defamed the Maharashtra government over the entire episode, said Patil, who is also state president of the NCP, the second largest constituent in the Shiv Sena-led MVA government. He said the main objective before the Mumbai Police was to find out who was responsible for the actors suicide and the city cops were probing that angle. The New Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences' (AIIMS) medical board last week ruled out murder in the death of Rajput, terming it "a case of hanging and death by suicide". Rajput (34) was found hanging in his suburban Bandra apartment on June 14. The Mumbai Police probed the matter initially before the CBI began its investigation into the case in August following a ruling by the Supreme Court. The high-profile case also saw a tussle between the Maharashtra-Bihar cops.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/aiims-sushant-report-slap-on-those-defaming-maharashtra-minister-jayant-patil-897645.html

"The option to re-open restaurants comes as a big relief to restaurateurs. Although it is a good development, not all restaurants are geared up to re-open immediately. We expect only around 30 per cent of the restaurants to open starting Monday and the rest will re-open gradually through the month," Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty said in a statement. He said Mumbai restaurants are allowed to operate with only 33 per cent capacity and a lot of them are facing a shortage of staff due to the problem of mobility. "Also, restaurants were shut completely for over six months so, therefore, interiors and other premises may need some renovation or maintenance. There is also the problem of finance. Over the last six months, restaurants had to dip into their savings for salary and utility payments," Shetty added. Echoing the view, Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) president Shivanand Shetty said customers were supportive and patient as the standard operating procedures (SOP) were carried out to ensure their, as well as the staff's safety. "We are overwhelmed by the support extended by our customers who chose to step out and gave us a chance to serve them again after a long time. As expected only 30-35 per cent restaurants reopened with most of them with only 30-40 per cent staff, limited menus, reduced timings, but we are hopeful that in 15 days things would be back to normal," he said. All restaurant owners, who re-opened their properties for business, ensured compliance of the SOPs in maintaining temperature checking, social distancing, wearing of masks, noting down customer contact details among others. "We are thankful to the state government for this day and look forward to more support to help us get back on track," Shetty added. On September 30, the Maharashtra government issued guidelines that allowed further relaxations outside containment zones, while extending the lockdown in the state till end of October. The state government guidelines hotels, food, restaurants and bars were allowed to operate from October 5, with capacity not exceeding 50 per cent of the total staff.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/30-restaurants-bars-in-maharashtra-to-re-open-immediately-rest-will-open-gradually-897731.html

There is no pressure on us from the Centre. There will be no injustice on Goa from the Centre. For me the Mahadayi (Mhadei in Goa) is not a political issue, it is an issue linked to my heart," Sawant said.  The Chief Minister also said that Congress-led dispensations in the past had facilitated attempts by Karnataka and Maharashtra to divert water from the Mahadayi and Virdi river basins respectively, which he said, was detrimental to Goa's interests.  Sawant also said that the award given by the Mahadayi Interstate Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018, which allowed Karnataka to divert 13.42 TMC water from the river was "damaging to Goa".  He also said that due to the ill-health of Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar at the time, the Goa government was unable to contest the award. Sawant succeeded Parrikar after the later died in office in 2019.  After Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar on Sunday dodged questions related to the ongoing river water-sharing controversy, Sawant has been in the crosshairs of the Opposition in Goa, which has demanded a white-paper on the issue.  Goa and Karnataka are battling out a two-decade-long dispute over the sharing of the Mahadayi river in the Supreme Court after both parties expressed reservations about the award by the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Bhandura project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa. Apart from the contempt petition, the Goa government has also filed a special leave petition in the apex court challenging the award given by the Tribunal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/will-file-contempt-plea-against-karnataka-on-mahadayi-goa-cm-897771.html
