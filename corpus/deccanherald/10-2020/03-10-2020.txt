03-10-2020||First Edit||Telling commentary on Modi regime||The decision of the Indian wing of Amnesty International to cease its operations in the country is a result of the relentless pressure brought on it by the government through various policies, decisions and actions. Governments have generally been unfriendly to non-government organisations (NGOs) but the Modi government has been particularly hostile to and harsh on them. NGOs with foreign origin that operate in India and others which receive contributions from abroad have been special targets. Amnesty has said that its accounts were frozen by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), and it has faced continuous harassment by central agencies. The government has wielded the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) regularly against NGOs, and the law was recently amended to make it more stringent and draconian. Other laws have also been used indiscriminately against NGOs to constrain them or to put an end to their activities. The CBI has filed an FIR against Amnesty, the ED has raised charges of money laundering and the Income Tax (IT) department has been sending “investigative letters’’ to even small donors who have made contributions to the organisation.  The Nobel Prize-winning human rights organisation has operated in India for the past eight years and has championed the cause of democratic rights and civil liberties. It is known the world over for its advocacy on issues relating to the rights of minorities, refugees and prisoners, abolition of the death penalty, the conduct of the police and other official forces and many other commendable causes. It has highlighted many issues relating to the violation of civil rights and denial of justice in Kashmir and the dubious conduct of Delhi police during the communal riots in the city this year. It is clear that the organisation was being hounded for its advocacy of such issues, and the charges made against it are only excuses.  Advocacy and championing of the rights of people has a legitimate place in any democratic society. NGOs do grassroots work among sections of population like women, farmers, workers and many marginalised groups whose rights and needs need to be highlighted and fought for. They have done yeoman service in these areas and reach out to areas where governments usually do not go. They form an important part of civil society. To restrain and strangle them, especially those with high credentials like Amnesty, is wrong. The closure of Amnesty has attracted adverse attention from the UK, European Union and a number of international organisations. India is now in the company of authoritarian regimes like Russia from which human rights organisations have been forced to withdraw. Amnesty’s exit is a telling commentary on the state of democracy in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/telling-commentary-on-modi-regime-896517.html
03-10-2020||In Perspective||When a titan falls, the tennis world quakes ||A 16th century painting hangs in the Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels. Titled “The fall of Icarus,” it shows a boy falling from the sky while the rest of life goes on, uninterrupted and unconcerned. Borrowed from Greek mythology, it describes the perils of hubris while relating the story of Icarus whose father created wings out of wax for him with a warning not to fly too close to the sun. But the child did not heed his father’s advice and flew higher and higher until his wings melted and he crashed to the ground. The painting conveys the sad truth that every man’s tragedy is his own. It does not disturb other peoples’ lives. The terrifying message of Pieter Bruegel’s painting stared at us recently in Flushing Meadows, New York, where the US Open tennis matches were played. A world champion, winner of 17 grand slams and the wonder boy of 21st century tennis, was unceremoniously disqualified from the tournament. His crime? He smashed the ball in a fit of pique and accidentally injured a lineswoman. Djokovic left the stadium, the city, and fled. The matches continued as if nothing had happened. The winners took home their trophies. Everything became normal again. The world’s Number One tennis star was the ultimate loser in this drama. The US Open, conducted by the International Tennis Federation, is a major sports event. This year, it was decided to conduct the tournament without spectators due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The players entering the city were quarantined, tested for the virus and had to continue testing throughout the tournament. They also had to wear a face mask, except while playing, according to CDC regulations. One can imagine the stress and frustration of players who also had to play to empty seats. For champions used to the cheering of 50,000 spectators, this bare scenario must have been disheartening. Tennis is a peoples’ game, involving not just players, umpires, linemen and ball boys but an arena of cheering/booing spectators. It cannot be reduced to a cerebral activity like a game of chess. Players, especially champions of Djokovic material, do need public participation and support. He may not have enjoyed much of the latter recently, but the lack of physical spectators may have altered his mood while playing, despite a worldwide virtual audience watching.     The 33-year-old champion had also come to this prestigious tournament with a lot of baggage. He had recently formed a rival professional tennis players association that was publicly opposed by both Nadal and Federer. Earlier to this, he had arranged a series of exhibition matches which bypassed social distancing and other safety measures. This resulted in four players, including himself, contracting the coronavirus. Weekend nightclub parties, where all safeguards were thrown to the wind, did not help improve his image. Yet, he came with full confidence that he would win this tournament and was playing exceptionally well until that unfortunate episode.         Novak Djokovic has always been a maverick. Sadly, mavericks are never popular. An ardent advocate of natural healing, he refused to be vaccinated against Covid-19 (when a vaccine does become available), fought against surgery to correct sports injuries and prescribed his own diet and medication during matches. He has not behaved like a world-class champion on court, either. He is known to have aimed a ball once at his own coaching team sitting in the front row of the spectators’ gallery. He made an angry swipe in the French Open last year and almost hit a line judge when the racquet flew out of his hand. Even this time, before his disqualification, he smashed the advertisement hoarding to add to his other misdemeanours on court. As the unanimous reaction to this incident showed, he had few supporters for his unprofessional behaviour. A world champion has to show greater restraint to be a role model for younger players. Yet -- and there is always a yet – it is impossible not to feel sad that a player of his calibre lost a prestigious title, another Grand Slam, and the goodwill of tennis enthusiasts the world over. There is a certain naivete about this unconventional genius who sits on the mud and chews the grass in Wimbledon after winning a tournament. An oddball who throws his perspiration drenched shirt at the spectators after a gruelling match. A clown who mimics his rivals in the locker room. A tennis virtuoso who wonders why the crowds cheer the loser when he is winning! This joker is a complete foil to the elegant Roger Federer who only has to swing his racquet to have the crowds swooning. Whether he likes it or not, Djokovic will always be in the shadow of his rivals, no matter how well he plays the game.          He did not even play the rules of the game well this time. Instead of apologising to the organisers and spectators for his rude behaviour, he argued “It’s not an issue for me. It’s not the first time I did it!” Again, running away from the stadium and the situation was a bad move. He is said to have sent an online apology afterwards. But it was too late. He had irrevocably damaged his reputation. Let us hope that the ongoing French Open will restore it. The world expects not just good tennis but good manners from its champions. This player must know that reputations become fragile with fame, and a little humility is not a bad thing. Sadly, the higher such reputations soar, the greater their fall. Bruegel’s painting said it all.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/when-a-titan-falls-the-tennis-world-quakes-896519.html
03-10-2020||In Perspective||The Babri verdict is cause for worry||For those of us who were present in Ayodhya on that fateful morning of December 6, 1992, and have observed the case wind through the criminal justice system over the 28 years since, the acquittal by the special CBI court of all 32 accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case has come as no surprise. The case has dragged on for nearly three decades and several of the prominent people who were accused have died in that time. Some others have done extremely well post-Babri demolition -- L K Advani went on to become deputy prime minister, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharati became cabinet ministers. Narendra Modi who was Advani’s ‘charioteer’ (but not an accused in the case) has gone on to become prime minster. It was unlikely that under the prevailing over- riding majoritarian sentiment, the CBI special judge SK Yadav would give a contrarian point of view. The CBI court judge S K Yadav found that there  Yadav chose to hide behind semantics emphasising in hiswas not enough proof to conclude that there was a conspiracy and that the audio and video evidences submitted were unclear and did not provide clinching evidence. For the journalists who were present at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992 and who travelled to UP to give evidence before this special court, a sense of foreboding and disquiet has prevailed throughout this saga. Former BBC correspondent Mark Tully, who was present in Ayodhya 28 years ago, saw large numbers of young men with saffron bands around their heads break three police cordons in the area around the mosque, with the policemen making no attempt to control them. Tully realised that the mosque was going to be broken down and he slipped away to Faizabad to break the story to the rest of the world. Tully was one of the several journalists contacted by the CBI to depose before Yadav the Old High Court Building at Kesar Bagh in Lucknow, and he recounted what he had witnessed before and after the demolition.  Ace photographer Praveen Jain, then working for The Pioneer newspaper, had arrived in Ayodhya on the night of December 4, 1992, to find lakhs of kar sevaks already gathered there. On the evening of December 5, Jain saw them carry hammers, pick-axes and crowbars to a ‘rehearsal’ of exactly how they planned to demolish the mosque, and he had several photographs that reinforced his account of what he had witnessed. These photographs were also presented to the special court in Lucknow. Obviously, these carried little weight. The key question before us is, will this judgement bring closure to this sorry saga of masjid demolition? It does not seem so. Even during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, for instance, has chosen to rake up the issue of other mosques by asking the Centre to acquire land for “renovation” of the Kashi Vishwanath temple and the Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura. The people of the country, Swamy maintained, were anxiously waiting for the expansion of these two places of worship. He expressed confidence that the campaigns to liberate these shrines would be launched by the RSS and the VHP at the earliest. Swamy also recently wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an amendment to the Places of Worship Act, 1991 which stipulates maintaining the “religious character” of all holy structures as they existed on August 15, 1947. A quick rebuttal of such a move has come from the Mathura-based All-India Teerath  Purohit Mahasabha who pointed out that there is no dispute at the Krishna Janmabhoomi and Idgah site and that this so-called ‘dispute’ had been resolved amicably by the two managements over 50 years ago. They did not want a heightening of tensions as this would affect the pilgrim traffic to Braj Bhumi, which is famous the world over for its syncretic culture. Already a repeat of the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi Andolan’ seems to be taking place in Mathura where six litigants have filed a case in the Lucknow court stating that the mosque be removed as it has been built at the exact place where Krishna was born. These litigants are demanding ownership of this entire area and a cancellation of the earlier compromise decree. A similar dispute has been ignited in Varanasi. Of course, during the build-up of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, one of the slogans often bandied about by the Sangh Parivar was “Ayodhya-Babri sirf jhanki hai, Mathura Kashi bhaki hai” (Ayodhya-Babri is just the start, Mathura and Kashi are next). The Kashi Vishwanath temple (repeatedly brought down by Muslim invaders and rulers, but also rebuilt with funding from Mughal Emperor Akbar, only to be destroyed once again by Aurangzeb) was last re-built in the 18th century by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of the Maratha Malwa kingdom. She helped broker a peace between the two sides, ensuring that while the Hindus conducted their prayers in the temple, the Muslims could perform their prayers inside the mosque. This peace has continued uninterrupted for the last two centuries. The average Benarasi citizen does not want a build-up of tension on this issue. But is legal sanctity enough to protect religious structures is a question that many concerned people are now asking. The demolition of the Babri Masjid and the judgement given by the CBI court on the Ayodhya conspiracy case seem to say it is not.

03-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Will support Karnataka federation if they decide to protest over caste census: Siddaramaiah||Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Saturday demanded action on the Social and Educational Survey, known otherwise as the caste census, which he commissioned when in power. He said this while lending his voice to the Karnataka State Backward Castes Federation, a group seeking to protect the interests of the OBCs. “If the (BJP) government fails to accept the survey report, then the federation will be forced to hit the streets in protest. I will support such a protest,” Siddaramaiah told reporters. The controversial census, which was the first since 1931, was carried out by Karnataka Backward Classes Commission in 2015 when the Siddaramaiah-led Congress was in power. The government spent Rs 162.77 crore, said Siddaramaiah, who belongs to the backward Kuruba community. “Till the time I was in office, the report wasn’t ready. Then, the coalition government came to power. The Commission tried to submit the report then. After Yediyurappa became the CM, he removed the Commission chairperson H Kantharaj and its members, let alone accepting the report. Kantharaj submitted the report to the Commission’s secretary,” Siddaramaiah said. “We know that the population of SC is 17.15% and ST is 6.95%, totalling to 24.1%. If we have data on all communities, it will help formulate programmes,” Siddaramaiah said. “On various occasions, the High Court and Supreme Court sought reports on castes and their population, but there was no information. That’s why I decided to get a survey done,” he added. It is said that successive governments chose not to make the survey results public fearing political backlash, especially after some leaked findings indicated that Lingayats and Vokkaligas were not the dominant castes, contrary to popular belief. Siddaramaiah’s support to a pro-OBC group comes at a time when his political archrival AH Vishwanath, also a Kuruba, has identified with an organization called Shepherds India International to consolidate the community. Siddaramaiah did not attend an event organized by the organization on Friday although fellow Congressman HM Revanna went there. Vishwanath, now with the BJP, is rallying for the inclusion of Kurubas in the ST list.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/will-support-karnataka-federation-if-they-decide-to-protest-over-caste-census-siddaramaiah-896732.html
03-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||BJP inducts radiologist CM Rajesh Gowda ahead of Sira bypoll||The BJP on Saturday inducted radiologist Dr. CM Rajesh Gowda amid speculation that he will be the party’s candidate for the November 3 Sira bypoll. Gowda is the son of Congress leader CP Mudalagiriyappa, who represented the Chitradurga Lok Sabha constituency under which the Sira assembly segment is located. “I’ve joined the BJP as a loyal party worker and not as a ticket aspirant,” Gowda told reporters. “Whoever gets the ticket, I will work for the party,” he said, adding that he had not approached any other political party seeking the Sira bypoll ticket. According to sources, the BJP core committee has recommended three names for the Sira ticket - BK Manjunath, SR Gowda, and Rajesh Gowda. Manjunath and SR Gowda were the BJP's candidates who contested unsuccessfully from Sira in the past. Rajesh Gowda is the founder-director at Matrix Imaging Solutions, where Congress leader Siddaramaiah’s son Dr. Yathindra was a director. In 2016, Yathindra resigned as a director following controversy after the company won a tender floated by the state-run PMSSY Hospital when Siddaramaiah was in office. Yathindra was replaced by Gowda’s wife Tejaswini as a director. Sira, located in Tumakuru district, has witnessed a direct fight between the JD(S) and the Congress thus far. The bypoll was necessitated following the death of JD(S) MLA B Sathyanarayana. The BJP has deployed Deputy Chief Ministers Govind Karjol and CN Ashwath Narayan, party vice-president BY Vijayendra, general secretary N Ravikumar and Bangalore Central MP PC Mohan as in-charges for the Sira bypoll. “The party’s organisation in Sira is better than what it was in KR Pet,” Vijayendra told DH. “The BJP had once polled nearly 25,000 votes here. We have leaders from all communities and we hope to encash our presence,” he said. According to Ravikumar, the BJP has formed 264 booth-level committees and WhatsApp groups to mobilize support for the party in Sira. Speaking after inducting Gowda and other local Sira leaders, BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said “hundreds” of Congress and JD(S) leaders were waiting to join the saffron party . “The BJP will win the Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar bypolls,” Kateel said. Chitradurga MP A Narayanaswamy said that a few Tumakuru Zilla Panchayat members would join the BJP soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-inducts-radiologist-cm-rajesh-gowda-ahead-of-sira-bypoll-896762.html

03-10-2020||Main Article||Advocating life of restraint||This year witnessed alarming outcries against Mahatma Gandhi that were expressed in the defacement of his statues in the United Kingdom, the United States and Africa. Yet this is not new and ever since his time, Gandhi has been targeted by a mindboggling number of groups across the spectrum. This includes Marxists, feminists, liberals and Hindu political and religious groups—who simply view him either as an incurable idealist or far too radical for his time. But how is it possible that his critics do not tally into any neat order and belong to contradictory ideological hues? Are we missing something here? Even his most passionate defenders hide their shame and instead show alternative textual evidence to settle what they see as part of his personal evolution, especially his views on race and caste. However, this conflict is caught up in the business of reassembling Gandhi’s words and ignores his comprehensive account of living when assessed from the narrow frame of modern equality. I suggest here a different mode of ethical conduct where it is impossible to separate equality from ahimsa and its application in spheres of living such as religion, diet and sexuality. The starting point of Gandhi’s thinking about equality was the grave disparities in Indian society in all walks of life. While everyone was born equal and entitled to equal opportunity, not everyone has the same capacity. Equality for Gandhi could not be turned into a “dead uniformity” because it would take out the very initiative of individuals to utilise their talents. Further, a blind adherence to notions of equality posed a graver problem of equating all desires on the same plane and becoming incapable of discerning good and bad.   The theory of socialism was an irresistible panacea for all evils during his time. It advocated a classless society by forcibly abolishing private property and maintaining collective ownership of all resources. Its insistence on “to each according to his need” made a great impression on Gandhi. But what puzzled him was how a theory without adherence to a spiritual force or the inexhaustible power within, could seek to effect such a large-scale transformation. In other words, the problem as he understood, was that social change could not be brought without individual transformation. So, equality should be analysed in terms of individual conduct (and role) in the social system. In his search, Gandhi sought answers to difficult questions that took him far beyond the economic realm to the practical. The resolution of how much is enough for each lay in self-restraint, which was a way of life in Indian ethical and moral traditions. Gandhi never used the term “equality” with any systematic or doctrinal seriousness in mind. Instead, he developed his ideas of sarvodaya (welfare for all) and trusteeship that stressed on the relationship between material laws and morality. He emphasised the importance of sharing tasks of society such as physical labour and local government. The rich were not owners of their riches but were trustees who held their wealth on behalf of the poor. Equal distribution It was based on the idea of non-possession, implying that each individual shall have only that much as he needs and there would be an equal distribution of all resources for satisfaction of basic wants. The model was founded on common aims of both the individual and society. It sought voluntary and non-violent conversion of people into trustees and rejected outright any class war.   Critics who have dubbed his ideas as naive have failed to recognise his insights into social life. First, it is true that he does not do enough about social relations of power by dismantling existing hierarchies within society. The reason for this is that Gandhi found such a radical form of revolution merely temporary, as it was an act of force. His central and profound emphasis was in giving people an ability to act irrespective of their status in the social hierarchy. For instance, when he spoke about the co-dependence of labour and capital on each other, he did so by stressing that labour must realise its indispensability without which the capital class cannot survive in the first place. Second, each class possessed know-how and skill which was ignored by those radical calls that altogether demanded abolishing the capital-owning class. Gandhi was aware that just as labour possessed a special skill about its tasks, the capital-owing class also had an expertise that could not be done away with. Accordingly, he argued for seeing both classes as equal partners and without superior interests. He did not discard the option of non-cooperation or civil disobedience if any class failed to cooperate. In sum, he did not seek to pull down social structures but give everybody an agency within it. A deeper dimension of this issue for Gandhi is linked to the spiritual plane, tenets of which hold a fundamental spiritual reality underlying all objects, and individuals had to realise their connection with other beings. For Gandhi, this could not be gained through theory but making adjustments in living. His vows of voluntary poverty and non-possession were linked to practices of self-control in spheres of diet and sexuality. Put this way, the notion of possession included the body which, while could not be done away with, had to be restrained. Gandhi astonishingly reversed modern political ideas whose latent aim was prosperity, which surely enough lapsed into pure greed. He overturned this into voluntarily seeking poverty, or in other words, implying a life of restraint. The question, in the end, is not whether Gandhi had a theory of equality, but rather, do we need to be fastened to a normative doctrine of “equality” to assess his ethical practices? In the final, for him, equality was an ethos or a certain way of living, and inequality was a state of violence conditioned by enslavement to appetites and desires.

Waving placards and raising slogans against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s government in Uttar Pradesh, protestors at Jantar Mantar rekindled the memories of agitation against the Delhi gang-rape case in 2012 that had put the then UPA-II government in the dock. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra participated in a prayer meet for the Hathras gang-rape victim at the Valmiki Temple at Panchkuia Road, where Mahatma Gandhi had stayed for 214 days. “We will ensure that justice for our sister. We will not sit quiet till justice is done,” Priyanka said at the prayer meet. “We will put pressure on the government. The family was kept away from the last rites. It is not our tradition to perform last rites after sundown,” she said.  Left leaders like Brinda Karat, Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Jignesh Mewani, Bhim Army leader Chandrashekar Azad and actor Swara Bhasker joined the protests. Bhim Army chief Azad demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi break his silence on the issue. “The PM washes the feet of Dalits before elections but remains quiet when a Dalit daughter of Uttar Pradesh is brutally raped,” Azad said. The AAP, JNU Students Union, Youth Congress, Bhim Army and some other outfits had given a call for protests at India Gate, but the venue was shifted to Jantar Mantar after police imposed prohibitory orders at India Gate. As crowds swelled at Jantar Mantar, Delhi Metro shut down the exit gates at Patel Chowk, Janpath and Rajiv Chowk stations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protests-break-out-in-delhi-over-hathras-gang-rape-896475.html

The Congress state units observed the day as “Kisan Mazdoor Bachao Divas”, party general secretary in-charge organization, K C Venugopal, said in a statement. 'Dharnas', marches and protests were held on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Congress workers held dharnas and protests across the country seeking the immediate withdrawal of the "anti-farmers" and "anti-labour" bills, the statement said. These protests, carried out in consonance with the Covid-related safety guidelines, were aimed at rallying farmers, farmworkers and other stakeholders against the legislations enacted in gross disregard of the interests of farmers and labour with the sole aim of benefitting crony corporates, the party alleged. The crony capitalists will stand to gain even as the farmers are subjugated without the basic security of the Minimum Support Price and labour will lose out on basic minimum job security, it claimed. Friday also marked the beginning of a signature campaign by PCCs to reach out to farmers, farm labourers, Mandi workers, industrial labour and sundry employees of APMCs, the party said. This month-long signature campaign will collect signatures from two crore farmers and labourers across the country, it said. A substantive memorandum along with the signature of two crore farmers will then be submitted to the President of India on November 14, the birth anniversary of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-holds-marches-to-protest-agriculture-labour-laws-896493.html

"(Opposition say) farmers won't be able to sell their produce in markets. MSP won't be there. False information. On behalf of the Central government, I am challenging either the Chief Minister of this state or leaders who oppose this," he said. "We, in the Central government, are not at all thinking of abolishing MSP. I am submitting to you as Union Minister. Not abolishing MSP, we increased (it)," he further said. Reddy, who was speaking at a round table organised here by BJPs Kisan Morcha on the new agriculture legislations recently enacted in Parliament by the NDA government, alleged that Congress and Communists and the farmers' unions affiliated to them had on several occasions talked about farmers not being able to sell their produce wherever they wanted to sell. The Communists should say why they are opposing it now, he said. Without naming the Congress, he asked why the party, when in power for long, did not think of supplying neem-coated urea to prevent its black marketing. Reddy, who stressed that the NDA government is sincere in working for farmers' welfare and to increase their income, asserted that market yards and MSP would continue to exist the same way. The farmers' unions can directly engage with the NDA government on their problems, he said. The Congress and other opposition parties and also the ruling TRS in Telangana are opposed to the new farm legislations enacted by the NDA government recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/opposition-spreading-false-info-on-farm-laws-union-minister-g-kishan-reddy-896495.html

They are members of the Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Congress, the police said. According to the police, the protesters assembled near Vigyan Bhawan and then moved towards the house of BJP president J P Nadda. Around 12.15 pm, 12-15 members of the outfit led by Surendra Solanki started moving towards the house of the BJP president from Vigyan Bhawan, a senior police officer said. They were stopped and informed about prohibitory orders imposed under section 144 of CrPC and directed to disperse immediately and maintain social distancing, the officer said. However, they started protesting, following which they were removed from the area, and a case under section 188 of IPC and provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act was registered against them, he said. They were identified as Surinder Solanki (35), Uday Chand Jha (37), Surinder Kumar (34), Jogesh Nehra (41), Bhupesh Kumar (43), Mukesh Sharma (29), Ajit Rai (34) and Rajbir Solanki (50), the officer added. Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi were on Thursday briefly detained by UP Police in Greater Noida, just outside Delhi, when they insisted on marching to Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh to meet the family of a 19-year-old woman, who died after being allegedly gang-raped and assaulted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-police-register-case-against-8-for-protesting-farm-laws-hathras-rape-case-896547.html
03-10-2020||National||Only 1 of 30 sedition cases ended in conviction last year; Karnataka tops list||Police across the country are rushing to file more sedition cases -- 2019 witnessed a 25% jump with Karnataka topping the list -- but the investigators could manage to get a conviction in just one out of the 30 cases whose trials were completed last year. Two people were sent to jail in the lone case that ended in conviction last year, while 29 people in as many cases were let off as the charges did not stand in a court of law. The figures for five years tell the story: 283 cases of sedition were filed between 2015 and 2019, 56 cases went to trial and at least 55 were people acquitted in 51 cases. Only nine people in five cases were sentenced to jail term during this period. In 2019 alone, trial was completed while in 2018 it was 13, six in 2017, three in 2016 and four in 2015. There was no conviction in 2015 while there was one each in the next two years and two in 2018. Last year also recorded the lowest conviction rate at 3.33% in the past four years while it was 15.40% in 2018, 16.70% in 2017 and 33.30% in 2016. In 2014, when the NCRB started providing data on offences against the state in its Crime in India report, there were 47 cases of sedition in which 58 people were arrested. Karnataka witnessed a sharp jump in registration of cases under the "draconian" provisions of sedition -- from two in 2018 to 22 last year -- as the country-wide numbers rose by around 25% to 93. According to the Crime in India 2019 report released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Assam with 17 cases of sedition, Jammu and Kashmir (11) and Uttar Pradesh (10) followed Karnataka. In 2018 when 70 cases were registered, Jharkhand topped the list with 18 cases followed by Bihar (17) and Jammu and Kashmir (12). Altogether 229 cases of sedition, including those carried over from previous years, were investigated by police across the country, while police could conclude investigations only in 70 cases, leaving a pendency of 69.43%. In courts, 116 sedition cases went for trial while only 30 saw completion leaving a pendency of 74.1% at the end of last year. Among those sedition cases filed last year, only 40 were sent for trial. The courts reported 89.7% pendency in sedition cases in 2017 as against 85.6% in 2018. Activists have been demanding the repealing of Section 124(A) of the Indian Penal Code that deals with sedition but the government has made it clear in Parliament repeatedly that it is not taking any steps to repeal the law at present. It says the provision is needed to "effectively combat anti-national, secessionist and terrorist" elements. "There is no proposal to scrap the provision under the IPC dealing with the offence of sedition. There is a need to retain the provision to effectively combat anti-national, secessionist and terrorist elements," the Ministry of Home Affairs told Parliament last year. In March 2016 in Rajya Sabha, the Narendra Modi government had admitted that the sedition law was "very wide" while acknowledging the need for "some amendments". Then Home Minister Rajnath Singh had agreed to a suggestion by then JD(U) MP Sharad Yadav for consulting all parties on the scrapping of the issue but he wanted all of them to wait till the Law Commission submits its recommendations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/only-1-of-30-sedition-cases-ended-in-conviction-last-year-karnataka-tops-list-896585.html

According to party spokesperson Anshu Awasthi, police personnel have been stationed outside Lallu's house here and he is not being allowed to venture outside. The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu has been placed under house arrest at his residence in the state capital, Awasthi said. The step has been taken to prevent Lallu from joining Rahul Gandhi who is scheduled to visit Hathras, he added. By doing so, the state government is only exposing itself. It has removed all doubts from people's mind that it has resorted to 'gundagardi' and is blatantly standing with the criminals of Hathras, he said. A tweet by Uttar Pradesh Congress said, "Our state president Shri Ajay Kumar Lalluji, our district heads and more than 500 workers have been placed under house arrest.

Reacting to the Hathras incident and other cases of sexual assaults on women in the country, Satyarthi said he implores the Prime Minister to lead the “war on rape”. “What is happening to our daughters across India is a matter of national shame. It is my humble appeal to our Hon'ble Prime Minister — the nation looks to you — to end this crisis of justice for our women and children. I implore you to lead the war on rape. Our daughters need you, and we are all with you," he told PTI. Calling for a people's movement to break "this mindset" of violence, Satyarthi said “we need both compassionate political will and people's action” to bring an end to the culture of rape. “We are lacking in a basic sense of humanity and compassion. We have failed to protect our daughters and hold our sons accountable for their actions. Our daughters can no longer continue to pay the price of our failure to bring up our sons right. It will take a people's movement to break this mindset of violence,” he said. “In 2017, we led the Bharat Yatra across over 11,000 km and 24 States and UTs where lakhs marched to demand a Rape-Free India. Since then we have seen the government take strong steps with stringent punishment being introduced. The Supreme Court passed directions for setting up of exclusive fast-track courts. But to bring an end to this culture of rape, we need both compassionate political will and people's action,” the Nobel laureate said. The recent case of violence and alleged sexual assault of a Dalit woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh has led to nationwide protests and agitations. The 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14 and referred on Monday to a Delhi hospital in an extremely critical condition with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She breathed her last on Tuesday at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her body was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging that the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kailash-satyarthi-urges-pm-modi-to-lead-war-on-rape-end-crisis-of-justice-for-women-896635.html

He also alleged that there were political interests of parties like Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) behind the protests in Punjab. Javadekar was addressing a group of farmers in Chorao village of North Goa as a part of the ruling BJP's initiative to create awareness about the farm laws. "There is no agitation against the farm laws anywhere in India except Punjab. You should not hold agitations as a part of political agenda," the Environment Minister said in his brief address to farmers. "These laws have received an overwhelming response from the farming community across the country," he claimed. "The Narendra Modi government aims to give justice to each and every farmer, who were denied their dues in the past," he said. He also accused NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar of failing to implement the Swaminathan Committee report, which had several recommendations in favour of farmers. "I had raised the issue of Swaminathan Committee recommendations in the Rajya Sabha when Pawar was agriculture minister.

India has also maintained its global position with one of the lowest Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFR) when compared to several other countries. While the global CFR stands at 2.97 per cent as on date, the comparative figure for India is 1.56 per cent, it said. “The deaths per million population in India is one of the lowest in the world. While the global average is 130 deaths per million population, India is reporting 73 deaths per million population,” the ministry said. The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 54,27,706, with 75,628 recovering in a span of 24 hours, pushing the national recovery rate to 83.84 per cent, according to the ministry data updated at 8 am on Saturday. "India continues to occupy the top global position as the country with the maximum number of recoveries. It accounts for 21 per cent of the global recovered cases, while its share in the total cases stands at 18.6 per cent," the ministry said. It said 74.36 per cent of the recovered cases reported in a span of 24 hours are from 10 states and Union territories (UTs). Maharashtra has contributed the highest number to these followed by Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. There are 9,44,996 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country which comprises only 14.60 per cent of the total caseload, it said. "For the 12th successive day, India has sustained its steady trend of maintaining the active cases below the 10-lakh mark," the ministry underlined. Nearly 77 per cent of the active cases are in 10 states and UTs, it said. Maharashtra leads the tally with more than 2.6 lakh cases. Further, 79,476 confirmed cases have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country, while 78.2 per cent of the new cases are concentrated in ten states/UTs, the ministry said. Maharashtra contributed close to 16,000 to the new cases, lower than the day before. Kerala surged to the second place with 9,258 new cases, while Karnataka reported more than 8,000 daily new cases.

The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay seeks directions to the Union home and law ministries to take appropriate steps to remove the prevailing anomalies in the grounds of maintenance and alimony and make them uniform for all citizens without discrimination on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. The petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said that despite the eloquent provisions in the Constitution, the central government has totally failed to provide even gender-neutral, religion-neutral uniform grounds of maintenance and alimony for all citizens. Maintenance and alimony is the only source of livelihood hence discrimination on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth is a direct attack on the right to life, liberty and dignity, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, it said. "Even after 73 years of Independence and 70 years of India becoming a socialist secular democratic republic, laws relating to maintenance and alimony are not only complex and cumbersome but also against the constitutional mandate of being equal, rational and just," it said. "Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act 1956. Muslims are dealt as per status of valid marriage & prenuptial agreement and governed under the Muslim Women Act 1986. Christians are governed under the Indian Divorce Act 1869 and Parsis under the Parsi Marriage & Divorce Act 1936, but none of these laws are gender neutral," it said. The PIL stated that discriminatory maintenance and alimony reinforce patriarchal and stereotypical notions about women and thus any provision that perpetrates or reinforces discriminatory stereotypes against women is manifestly arbitrary. The plea has sought directions to declare that the discriminatory grounds of maintenance and alimony are violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 of the Constitution. It has also sought directions to the Law Commission to examine domestic and international laws and prepare a report on "uniform grounds of maintenance and alimony" within three months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-in-sc-seeks-uniform-grounds-of-alimony-for-all-citizens-896650.html

Amar Singh and Ram Dev, sons of Arjun Gopal alias Tshidawa, said their father had suggested the construction of the tunnel to the former prime minister. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours. Atal Tunnel is the longest highway tunnel in the world above 10,000 ft, and the 9.02 km long tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year. The valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall. The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur had earlier said, “Vajpayee got the idea for constructing the tunnel on a suggestion from his friend Arjun Gopal of Tashi Dobhe village in Lahaul.” Talking to PTI in their native village Tholang in Lahaul-Spiti district, Amar Singh (75) said his father met Vajpayee in 1998 in Delhi, seeking the construction of the strategically significant tunnel beneath Rohtang Pass for the benefit of the residents of Lahaul-Spiti district. “My father passed away in 2008. Today, his decades-long dream came true and my joy knows no bound,” he said. Singh, who retired as state deputy director (education), said the former prime minister and his father came close during an officers' training camp (OTC) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1942 in Gujarat's Vadodara. “When Vajpayee became the prime minister in 1998, my father met him through a prominent RSS activist Chaman Lal…,” he said. Singh said ‘Lahaul-Spiti-Pangi Janjaati Sewa Samiti’ was formed with Gopal as its founder president to pursue the construction of the tunnel. He said Vajpayee sent copies of the memorandum submitted to him for construction of the tunnel to defence, finance and surface transport ministries. Following initial objection by the defence ministry, the Union government gave its approval for constructing the tunnel in 2000, Singh claimed, adding that Vajpayee himself announced about the project during a public meeting at Keylong in June, 2000. Gopal’s other son, Ram Dev (61), a retired officer of the state information department, said the economy of Lahaul-Spiti district would see a drastic change after the opening of the tunnel. He also travelled in a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus which was flagged off by Modi from north portal in Lahaul to south portal in Manali of Kullu district. “The agriculture, horticulture and tourism sectors of the tribal district will witness a positive sea change in the coming days. The tribal district used to remain cut off for about five months due to snow-laden roads during winters,” Dev added. Residents of the tribal district also hailed the construction of the tunnel. Pushpa Devi of Kirting village of the district said there was no longer the need for rushing to other districts for medical help. She said earlier pregnant women were shifted from the district to Kullu-Manali for safe delivery. Similarly, Sanjay Yarpa of Gahar valley said critical patients had to suffer a lot as they could not be airlifted to Kullu-Manali for better healthcare as helicopters failed to land here due to bad weather during winters. “This problem will now cease to exist as road connectivity through the tunnel will remain in operation almost throughout the year,” he rejoiced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dream-comes-true-for-vajpayees-friend-after-opening-of-atal-tunnel-896666.html

The government has been under attack for bringing in new farm laws which are aimed at providing marketing freedom to farmers for selling their produce. However, there are apprehensions that farmers would not get minimum support price (MSP) ensured by the government for their produce. The increase in the agriculture ministry budget indicates a considerable rise in government spending on procurement of foodgrain and other farm produce at crop support price. The MSP insulates farmers from market fluctuations. "There has been continuous progress of villages, farmers, poor and agriculture since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken over charge in 2014. "The budget of the agriculture ministry was just Rs 12,000 crore in 2009-10, which has been increased 11 fold to Rs 1.34 lakh crore because of the commitment of the Prime Minister towards farmers and agriculture," the minister said. He was speaking at 4th Annual Convention - Virtual on Capital Market & Commodity Market: Role of Financial Markets in Building Aatmanirbhar Bharat by PHDCCI. He was of the view that farmers would benefit immensely from the new farm laws as they would be able to sell their produce at better prices in other states as well. The minister also brushed aside the apprehensions about scrapping of MSP saying there has been considerable increase in the crops' support price compared to the UPA regime's. He also spoke about three major labour codes on social security, industrial relations and occupational safety health and working conditions passed by Parliament, saying these reforms would help workers become self-reliant in coming days. Gangwar also said the President has given his assent to the three labour codes. He opined that these labour codes would also help increase ease of doing business adding that industry and worker complement each other and therefore they have to work together in tandem with changing times. He appealed to the industry leaders to provide support to the government for economic progress for achieving ultimate goal of making India a USD 5 trillion economy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farm-budget-increased-11-fold-to-rs-134-lakh-crore-from-2010-says-labour-minister-gangwar-896682.html

It is the longest highway tunnel in the world. The strategically important tunnel is 9.02 km long and it connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year. The valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall. The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). The south portal (SP) of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the north portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres.  It is a horse shoe shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and has an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres, officials said. The tunnel, built at a cost of about Rs 3,300 crore, is extremely significant from the point of view of the country's defence, they said. The BRO worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault Zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017. Talking about the tunnel, a BRO official said it provides a telephone facility at every 150 metre of its stretch, a fire hydrant every 60 metre, emergency exits every 500 metre, turning cavern every 2.2 km, air quality monitors every 1 km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection system with CCTV cameras every 250 metre. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. Vajpayee got the idea for constructing the tunnel on a suggestion from his friend Arjun Gopal of Tashi Dobhe village in Lahaul, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur had said. The Modi government decided to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel in December 2019 to honour the former prime minister who had passed away the previous year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/atal-tunnel-worlds-longest-highway-tunnel-to-reduce-distance-between-manali-leh-by-46-km-896694.html

The apex court said that the ingredient of "mens rea" (intention) cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be "visible and conspicuous". A bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said this while setting aside the March 2010 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had upheld the trial court's verdict convicting the man for the offence under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. "As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under sec 107 of the IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to determine the culpability," said the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy. The top court said that in order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the man had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of his wife. The bench delivered its verdict on a plea filed by the man against the order of the high court which had dismissed his appeal and upheld the four-year jail term awarded to him by the trial court in the case. An FIR was lodged in the matter in August 1997 at Barnala on the basis of the statement of the deceased's father and the prosecution had alleged that the woman was harassed after marriage for insufficient dowry. The apex court noted that there is no direct evidence of cruelty against the husband or the in-laws in the case. "Insofar as the possible reason for a young married lady with two minor children committing suicide, in the absence of evidence, conjectures cannot be drawn that she was pushed to take her life by the circumstances and atmosphere in the matrimonial home," the bench said. "In view of the foregoing, we are persuaded to conclude that the decisions under challenge cannot be legally sustained. Consequently, interfering with the impugned judgment of the high court and the trial court, the appellant's conviction under section 306 IPC is set aside and quashed," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/state-of-mind-to-commit-crime-must-be-visible-to-prove-offence-of-abetment-supreme-court-896696.html

Barricades were installed at the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway, where scores of policemen, including senior officers, were present in anti-riot gears since noon, even as CrPC section 144 remained imposed in Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddh Nagar. "The border is not sealed but checks have been intensified at the Delhi-Noida border," according to a local police official. Scores of Congress and the party's youth wing workers reached the DND flyway around 2 pm, even as some party workers were allegedly detained by the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police. "Some of Congress and Youth Congress workers have been detained in Gautam Buddh Nagar and put under house arrest, including our district president Manoj Chaudhary. But we have gathered here at DND and would go to Hathras with our leaders today," Indian Youth Congress (IYC) national secretary Deepak Bhati told PTI. When contacted, police officials, however, refuted the allegations of detention. Dozens of vehicles has been caught up in the traffic snag on the DND route, causing inconvenience to commuters. A delegation of Congress MPs led by former party chief Rahul Gandhi has decided to go to Hathras on Saturday afternoon to meet the family of the young woman who died after she was assaulted and allegedly gang-raped, a senior party leader said. On Thursday, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra along with several party leaders and workers were detained by the Uttar Pradesh police in Greater Noida and sent back to Delhi, after they tried to reach Hathras to meet the family of the young woman. Congress leaders and workers were also booked in multiple cases for allegedly violating restrictions imposed under the CrPC section 144 because of COVID-19 outbreak and under the Epidemic Diseases Act, among others, according to officials. The Congress has alleged that the woman and her family have been "denied justice" and "severely traumatised" by the BJP government in its attempt to "hide the truth" of the heinous crime perpetrated on her. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police had forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uttar-pradesh-police-deployed-at-dnd-ahead-of-congress-visit-to-hathras-896697.html

'Shaurya', which is the land variant of Indias K-15 missile, has a strike range of 700 km to 1000 km and is capable of carrying payloads of 200 kg tO 1000 kg, the sources said. The surface-to-surface tactical missile was blasted off from a canister strapped to the ground launcher from launch complex 4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in the APJ Abdul Kalam Island around 12.10 pm and covered the desired range, they said. It is 10 metres long, 74 cm in diameter and weighs 6.2 tonnes. Its two stages use solid propellants. Describing the trial as successful, the sources said that the state-of-the-art missile performed a manoeuvre in the closing stages of its flight and hit the impact point in the Bay of Bengal with precision and accuracy. A gas generator at the bottom of the canister pushed the missile out it. Its first stage ignited then and fell off. The second stage went into action after this, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) official said. During the test flight, the missile was tracked by various telemetry stations and radars and performed well, he said. DRDO officials rate Shaurya as one of the top 10 missiles in the world in its class with its high performance navigation and guidance systems, efficient propulsion systems, sophisticated control technologies and canisterised launch," sources said. The missile can be launched from silos and canisters mounted on a truck and fixed on the ground, they said adding that it can be easily moved around. A truck itself can become a launching platform. "Shaurya" missiles can kept in locations where the enemies would not be able to detect them. Besides, it cannot be detected by satellite imaging, the sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/missile-shaurya-successfully-test-fired-896700.html

The Narendra Modi government ensured a better future to farmers by reforming the agriculture sector and passing two legislations that empowerfarmers and strengthens supply chains, he told a press conference here. "The Modi government relieved farmers from the limitations on sale-points and created a farmework to ensure assured returns on farm produce. Our government is committed to making agriculture self- reliant and remunerative. We are for an empowered farmer", the Minister of state for External Affairs said. Rubbishing charges of the ruling LDF and opposition Congress-led UDF in Kerala on the Farm bills, the minister said agri-reforms freed farmers from the shackles of middlemen and vested interests at mandis, eased restrictions on the sale, storage, transport facilities and harvesting of produce. Describing as "baseless" the "false propaganda" of the Left alliance and their "irresponsible behaviour" in Parliament, he said CPI(M) MPs opposition to reforms was a "stunt" to compete withCongress as the Bills have no impact on farmers in Kerala, where there is no APMC. The Indian farmer is not influenced by the "gimmicks" of the Congress and the Left, he said, adding farmers have understood the intentions of the reforms and welcomed them. The opposition's attempt to divert attention by falsely claiming about the "disappearance of MSP" had fallen flat when government announced the new Minimum Support Price, he added. Muraleedharan also reminded the Congress about the increase in Agriculture budget from Rs 12,000 crore in 2009- 10 to a whopping Rs 1,34,399 crore in 2020-21. The Agreement of Price Assurance and FarmServices Bill, 2020, aims ataddressing the price fluctuations of crops and ensures assured price to the farmer from the sponsor even before sowing of crops. By transferringthe risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor,the minister said the reform measure acts as insurance and saves farmers from price fluctuations. Allaying fears of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Muraleedharan said farmers would enjoy the freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce and carry out inter-state or intra-state trade without restrictions. In addition to mandis, farmers will have the freedom to do trading at farm gate, cold storage, warehouse, processing units and be able to engage in direct marketing, thereby eliminating intermediaries, ensuring full realisation of price, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/v-muraleedharan-slams-congress-left-parties-vicious-campaign-against-farm-bills-896701.html

He blamed Congress for the delay in border infrastructure development. Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours, built by the Border Roads Organisation, is the longest highway tunnel in the world. The 9.02-km tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year. The valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall. The project will be a major relief to armed forces for quick troop movement to Ladakh amid heightened tensions between India and China. The work began in 2010 during the UPA regime. After inaugurating the tunnel, the PM launched an attack on the Congress, saying India's defence interests were compromised under its rule and asserted nothing is more important to his government than protecting the country. The PM cited a number of strategically important projects, from Atal Tunnel to the airstrip at Daulat Beg Oldi in Ladakh and Tejas fighter aircraft production, which he said were delayed under the UPA rule, to substantiate his arguments. "I can talk about dozens of projects that are important strategically, but for years they were neglected," he said, hitting out at the previous Congress-led governments. "We have put our entire energy in developing our border infrastructure. The country hasn't seen roads, bridges and tunnels built at this scale," the prime minister said after inaugurating the tunnel Saturday. "Besides locals, this (infrastructure) will also hugely benefit the men and women in our army," Modi added. New Delhi hopes such projects will promote tourism and spur economic activity. "Nothing more important to us than the national interest and protecting the country, but the nation has seen an era when defence interests were compromised," he said, in an apparent swipe at the opposition party. Claiming that his government has deployed all its might to develop border infrastructure, the PM said earlier, border projects remained either planning stage or in the backburner. He said only 1,300 meters were completed by 2013-14, and at that speed, the project would have been completed by 2040. "Our government increased the pace of construction from 300 meters/year to 1,400 meters/year and completed it," he said. In just six years the government completed the work of 26 years, he said. He referred to the Kosi mega-bridge in Bihar envisaged by the Vajpayee government and inaugurated by him last month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/atal-tunnel-pm-modi-opens-tunnel-route-to-tense-china-border-attacks-congress-896703.html
03-10-2020||National||Previous governments lacked courage to implement farm reforms due to poll-focused mindset: PM||Taking a swipe at the opposition's protest against farm reform laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday those parties also had the same idea but lacked the courage to implement these measures because they focussed on elections while his government looked at the country's and farmers' welfare. Addressing his second public meeting after inaugurating Atal Tunnel in Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh, Modi said those protesting against the laws wanted farmers to live in the previous century, and are now jolted by his government's attack on middlemen. The ruling BJP has cited the Congress manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls to assert that the opposition party had also promised the same laws which the Modi government has enacted to allow farmers to sell their produce outside state-controlled 'mandi' but is now criticising them for political reasons. Modi also spoke of the benefits of new labour sector laws and said reforms will continue as his government works to realise its goal of "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" (Self-Reliant India), asserting that regulations of the previous century will not work in a new century. Our reforms have troubled those who have always worked for political benefits, he said, adding that new labour reforms have given women same salary and opportunities as men had so far. Their mindset remained the same while the century changed, he said, attacking the opposition. "You can't enter the next century with the mindset of the past century," he said. Modi said his government's reforms, including digitisation of services and direct transfer of money, have saved time and money while rooting out corruption. The government is constantly trying to reduce problems of the masses, he said. Modi stopped his address twice when he saw a person having some medical issues and directed officials to attend to him. The prime minister also addressed a public meeting at Sissu village in Lahaul-Spiti region earlier in the day, where he asserted that a major transformation has been effected in the government's way of functioning and new schemes are no more based on the quantum of votes from an area as the only focus now is 'development for all'. This was his first public rally in more than six months ever since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown in March. People were seated far from each other as per social distancing protocols at both the public meetings. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur and Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur were also present at the public meetings. Singh highlighted the strategic importance of the tunnel, saying it will make soldiers' deployment and movement of weapons and ration easier. Earlier in the day, Modi inaugurated the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel and lashed out at the Congress-led previous governments, saying strategic projects were neglected and defence interests were compromised for years. The tunnel, built at a cost of about Rs 3,300 crore, is extremely significant from the point of view of the country's defence. Built by the Border Roads Organisation, it has been billed as the longest highway tunnel in the world and reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km. It also reduces travel time by four to five hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/previous-governments-lacked-courage-to-implement-farm-reforms-due-to-poll-focused-mindset-pm-896705.html

The NCB has dismissed these allegations as "false and baseless". Interestingly, Prasad's lawyer Satish Maneshinde had earlier told the court that the accused was being harassed and blackmailed to make a statement against filmmaker Karan Johar by NCB officials. The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court on Saturday remanded Prasad to judicial custody till October 6. In his latest statement before the court, the accused said, "Subsequent to my earlier statement, I have been repeatedly harassed and coerced into falsely implicating Ranbir Kapoor, Dino Morea and Arjun Rampal in the present proceedings. "Despite me repeatedly stating that I don't said persons...and have no knowledge of allegations against them (sic)," Prasad stated. He stated since he refused to writesuch false (statement mentioning Kapoor, Morea and Rampal) in his own handwriting, "the complainant (NCB) has been preparing various false statements as per their wishes and trying to coerce me into signing them". Prasad further stated he was being harassed "mentally, emotionally, and psychologically by the probe agency (sic)". Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande told the court that Prasad's allegations were completely baseless and false. "Neither had we taken these names nor the accused (Prasad) ever mentioned them (during his questioning). We have shown his statement to the court," he said. According to the NCB, Prasad had procured drugs from another accused Karmjeet and his associates. The agency had earlier arrested actor and late Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik and others in connection with the Bollywood-drugs probe. The CBI is separately investigating Rajput's death case, in which Chakrabortys were booked by Bihar police under the charge of abetment to suicide.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ncb-trying-to-frame-ranbir-rampal-morea-kshitij-ravi-prasad-896722.html

Leaders from neighbouring countries as well as Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are expected to attend the ceremony in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. The accord will be inked by the transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), a coalition of rebel groups from the war-ravaged western Darfur region, as well as the southern states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. However, two other well-established rebel groups will not sign, reflecting the challenges still facing the peace process. "This signing means we left the war now behind us. This agreement means democracy, justice, it means freedom in Sudan so we are very happy. This is the end of the war... by this peace agreement the economy in Sudan will boom again," Ismail Jalab, a senior member of the SRF told AFP. Entertainers from South Sudan and Sudan performed as thousands of guests waited for proceedings to begin. "This is a very historical day to us Sudanese because this peace is going to end the protracted conflict in Darfur, Blue Nile, and South Kordofan... it is well known since the independence of Sudan there is no stability, there is no social-economic development because of marginalisation," said 32-year-old Abdal Aziz who fled Darfur six years ago and has been living as a refugee in South Sudan. Ending Sudan's internal conflicts has been a top priority of the transitional government, in power since last year's ouster of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in a popular pro-democracy uprising. The peace talks were mediated by South Sudan whose leaders themselves battled Khartoum as rebels for decades before achieving independence in 2011. Sudan's leaders, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, head of the transitional sovereign council General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and General Hamdan Dagalo, deputy chief of Sudan's joint military-civilian sovereign council, will attend the ceremony. In a statement on his arrival, Hamdok said that "peace will open broad horizons for development, progress and prosperity. "The peace building process faces various challenges and pitfalls that we can overcome through concerted efforts and joint action," he said. Mini Arko Minawi, leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement which is a member of the SRF, said Sudan's troubled economy and "fragile political situation" were challenges facing the agreement. The economy has suffered from the country's inclusion on Washington's terror blacklist, decades-long US sanctions, and the 2011 secession of the country's oil-rich south which deprived the north of three-quarters of its oil reserves. Economic hardship triggered the anti-Bashir protests and remains a pressing challenge -- food prices have tripled in the past year and the Sudanese pound has depreciated dramatically. Sudan has been torn by multiple conflicts between the Arab-dominated government that was led by Bashir for three decades and rebels drawn from non-Arab ethnic groups in its far-flung regions. In Sudan's vast rural areas, settled ethnic minority farmers have frequently competed for scarce resources with Arab herders, who have often been backed by Khartoum. Multiple civil wars have raged since independence in 1956, including the 1983-2005 war that led to the secession of the south. The devastating war in Darfur from 2003 left at least 300,000 people dead and 2.5 million displaced in its early years, according to the UN. The peace agreement covers a number of tricky issues, from land ownership, reparations, and compensation to wealth and power-sharing and the return of refugees and internally displaced people. Under the deal, SRF fighters are to be slowly incorporated into joint units with government security forces. One of the holdout groups, the Darfur-based Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) faction led by Abdelwahid Nour, launched an attack on Monday, the army said. Another, the South Kordofan-based wing of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, has signed a separate ceasefire. It allows rebels to keep their guns for "self-protection" until Sudan's constitution is changed to guarantee the separation of state and religion. South Kordofan and to a lesser extent Blue Nile state have significant Christian populations who have fought for decades to end the imposition of Islamic law by Khartoum.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/singing-dancing-ahead-of-landmark-sudan-peace-deal-896725.html

Such orders are passed on proposals moved by concerned police based on FIRs and complaints against the person. These orders are also sent to the advisory board of PASA for their opinion. Pir had challenged his detention before a single bench which rejected the plea saying that his case was being looked into by the advisory board and he should have waited for final outcome. The board is the final authority that rejects or accepts the proposal for detention. The petitioner challenged the single judge’s order before the division bench which granted him relief. The division bench led by justice Nath held that high court should not reject writ petition that challenges legality and validity of an order of preventive detention on the ground that the detenue has “an alternative remedy of preferring a representation addressed to the Advisory Board.” The bench stated that “The right to challenge the detention by a person cannot be abridged or curtailed by saying that until such time the Advisory Board gives its opinion, the challenge thereto has to wait.” The bench cited the person who is detained without being produced before the magistrate (within 24 hours), can’t be told to wait till the board gives its opinion. “The right to challenge the detention order is an independent right which accrues to a detained person and is not circumscribed by any statutory provision providing for safeguard,” the judgement states. It adds that “To classify the detenue as a dangerous person, effecting public order because of registration of two cases, referred to above, is a gross abuse of the constitutional power of preventive detention.” These observations came barely ten days after the Gujarat government passed a bill in the Assembly widening the ambit of PASA by including repeat sexual offenders, cybercriminals and gambling under it. The division bench also made a suggestion that hearing of a petition challenging preventive decisions should be treated as Habeas Corpus petition and to be heard by division bench rather than a single bench.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/right-to-challenge-detention-an-independent-right-not-circumscribed-by-statutory-provision-gujarat-hc-896745.html

AIIMS handed over its findings to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The apex investigation over abetment to suicide still continues. “There were no marks of struggle/scuffle on the body and clothes of the deceased," Dr Sudhir Gupta, Chairman of AIIMS Forensic Medical Board was quoted. The AIIMS Forensic Medical Board was formed in the death case of Sushant Singh Rajput after CBI took over the probe "The presence of any seductive material was not detected by the Forensic Science Laboratory in Mumbai and the AIIMS toxicology lab. The complete examination of the ligature mark over the neck was consistent with hanging," he added. Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead on June 14, in his duplex flat in the Mont Blanc building at Carter Road in Bandra. The Dr R N Cooper Municipal General Hospital in Vile Parle where the autopsy was conducted had found "asphyxia due to hanging" as the cause of death. The Bandra police station in Mumbai registered an accidental death report (ADR) and had recorded 56 statements during the investigation under Section 174 of the CrPC. However, the investigations were handed over to the CBI following an order of the Supreme Court based on the plea of the Bihar government which has registered an FIR in Patna against Sushant Singh Rajput’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty and others for abetment to suicide and swindling off the actor’s money.   Sushant’s father Krishna Kishore Singh has lodged the FIR and later also asked the murder charge to be probed. The statement of Dr Gupta comes as a major relief to the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, which was in the firing line of the BJP and political parties from Bihar. As soon as the statement of Dr Gupta came, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said that he would not like to comment. “Nothing official has come to -…when it comes, I will surely say on this,” he said. Deshmukh, a senior NCP leader, went on to add that the CBI report should come now. “Whether it is suicide or murder, people must know,” he said. Meanwhile, Sushant’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde too stated that the CBI report must be tabled. "I have seen the statement of the doctors from AIIMS concerning the Sushant Singh Rajput case. The official papers and report are only with AIIMS and CBI which will be submitted in court once investigations are over. We await the official version of CBI,” Maneshinde said. "We on behalf of Rhea Chakraborty have always said that truth cannot be changed under any circumstances. The speculations against Rhea in some quarters of the media are motivated and mischievous. We remain committed to truth alone," he added. The Congress also mounted an attack on the BJP-led Centre. “After the official confirmation by AIIMS panel head Dr Sudhir Gupta that Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide, it is proved that investigation by the  Mumbai police was honest and forthright. It is also clear that it was a conspiracy of the Modi govt with help of their fake media allies, state Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aiims-panel-says-sushant-singh-rajput-died-by-suicide-submits-report-to-cbi-896746.html

While high drama unfolded in the national capital and the case continued to find wide resonance, a Hathras administration official said the Special Investigation Team had completed its probe into the death and alleged gangrape of the 19-year-old woman. Ending a two-day standoff, the administration removed barricades outside her village to allow the media to meet her family. But scores of police personnel in riot gear lined up at the Delhi-Noida Direct flyway to prevent the Congress convoy from moving to Hathras, about 180 km away. Eventually, as swarms of Congress workers and others jostled with each other amid loud honking, slogans and Congress flags fluttering in the air, the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police finally allowed five people, including Rahul Gandhi, to go to Hathras. Congress workers – some who described what happened as “brutal repression” -- claimed police used batons to disperse the crowd. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were detained on Thursday when they tried to go to Hathras. “CrPC Section 144 has been imposed in Noida, Greater Noida as well as in Hathras and some other districts in Uttar Pradesh due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Considering social distancing and other related norms, permission has been granted for five people, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra," Noida Police Commissioner Alok Singh told PTI. All roads it seemed led to Hathras with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sending senior officials, including Additional Chief Secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi and Director General of Police H C Awasthy, to the village to meet the woman's family. Several journalists, including those from TV channels, also made their way to the village where various family members spoke of their grief and trauma since September 14 when she was brutally assaulted and allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men Awanish Awasthi told reporters that “any group with no more than five people" is allowed to meet the victim's family, marking a departure from the last few days when media and politicians, including from the Congress and Trinamool Congress, were turned away from the village. “After returning (from Hathras) we will be submitting a report on the entire incident to the chief minister,” Awanish Awasthi said. The Dalit teen died of her grievous injuries in the early hours of Tuesday in a Delhi hospital, a fortnight after she was attacked, and cremated in the dead of night near her home on Wednesday. Her family alleged they were forced by local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites, triggering outrage nationwide and protests in several places. On Thursday, the Hathras administration had clamped prohibitory orders and scuffles broke out as politicians, including from the Congress and the TMC, as well as the media tried to access the village. About 300 police personnel stood on guard to prevent anybody from entering. The death of the young woman, whose brutal assault recalled for many the horrors of the Nirbhaya case, continued to snowball into a major political issue As the Congress delegation from Delhi prepared to make its way to Hathras, its Uttar Pradesh unit president Ajay Kumar Lallu and more than 500 workers were put under house arrest, the party alleged. In Varanasi, a group of Congress workers blocked the Union minister Smriti Irani’s cavalcade. Congress spokesperson Lalan Kumar said protesting party workers, who raised anti-government slogans and demanded justice for the woman’s family, were later arrested. Addressing a press conference, the Women and Child Development minister accused the opposition of playing politics on the Hathras issue. “The victim will get justice. I have spoken to the chief minister. Once the SIT submits its report, the chief minister will take action against the accused,” Irani told reporters. Adityanath had set up three-member Special Investigation Team on Wednesday and instructed that it submit its report by October 14. In a tweet in Hindi using the hashtag 'Hathrashorror', Rahul Gandhi said the behaviour of the UP government and police with the woman and her family "is unacceptable”. Hitting out at the Adityanath dispensation, Priyanka Gandhi described the UP government as "morally corrupt" and said, "The victim did not get treatment, her complaint was not registered on time, her body was forcibly cremated, the family is in captivity, they are being suppressed -- now they are being threatened that they will have to undergo a narco test." The party also alleged that the woman and her family had been denied justice and "severely traumatised" by the BJP government. BSP president Mayawati demanded a CBI or a Supreme Court monitored probe into the incident and said people were not satisfied with the initial investigations in the matter. “There is tremendous resentment in the entire country over the Hathras heinous gangrape case. The public does not seem satisfied with the initial probe report. Therefore, this matter should be investigated by the CBI or under the supervision of the honourable Supreme Court. This is the demand of the BSP,” Mayawati tweeted in Hindi. “Also, the honourable president of the country, who also comes from UP and is a Dalit, it is a strong appeal to him to intervene in this case, keeping in mind the inhuman attitude of the government, to bring justice to the victim family,” she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-on-way-to-hathras-after-high-drama-sit-completes-probe-into-dalit-teen-s-death-896748.html

"What has happened in Hathras is most terrible. The incident of rape on a Dalit girl is a very serious issue,” he said. Athawale, who said he will be meeting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, stated, “On the Hathras case, I have to say that there should not be politics in the name of atrocities on Dalits. It is not right to propagate about atrocities on Dalits during the Yogi government." "It is right that atrocities are taking place but it had been so during the Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Akhilesh (Yadav) governments also," he added. Backing CM Adityanath on the steps taken by him in the case, the Union minister said the manner in which the woman's body was cremated was wrong and he would be taking up the issue of action on other officials. He said the reason behind such atrocities on Dalits is casteism and it will continue till people have a casteist mindset. Athawale said he wanted to go to Hathras on Friday but could not do so as the district administration had barred the entry of outsiders while adding that he would try to go next week if allowed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-do-politics-on-dalit-atrocities-ramdas-athawale-on-hathras-case-896752.html

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo also said that the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh secretly burnt the body of the Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped under the cover of night. Addressing the gathering at the conclusion of a protest march by TMC against the incident at Hathras the Chief Minister accused BJP of using Dalits for publicity ahead of elections. “When elections are near they (BJP) bring food from outside and eat it at Dalits’ home for publicity. But after elections are over then Dalits are subjected to atrocities. They only pretend to be Dalits’ friend,” said Mamata. Criticising Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Mamata said that instead of taking swift action after the woman was brutalised his government locked her family members in their house and burnt her body secretly at night. “Even after she was brutalised, her family members were locked in their house and the Yogi Government burnt her body undercover of the darkness of night. For how long such things will go on?” said Mamata. Alleging that Dalits, minorities, and farmers were being subjected to suffering Mamata said that there was no democracy in the country and dubbed the BJP government at the Centre as an “ of the dictatorship, by the dictatorship and for the dictatorship". "One nation, one leader and political party. The country is heading towards a presidential form of government. There is no democracy in India,” said Mamata. Indicating that she will go all out against BJP over the issue the TMC supremo instructed party workers to campaign in Scheduled Caste dominated villages. TMC will also hold protest demonstrations at every block in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dalits-facing-most-atrocities-bjp-using-them-for-votes-mamata-banerjee-896782.html

The order by IRCTC also barred dine-ins at food courts, plazas on the stations. Earlier, railways allowed the catering vending units to sell only packaged food due to Covid-19. For the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, the railways allowed to sell cooked food as takeaways. The latest order will help passengers during the festive season. The Railways is planning to operate 200 more special trains between October 15 and November 30 to cater to passengers during the festive rush. The Railways also said that contracts that have expired after March 23 may also be allowed to operate up to October 31 on payment of a license fee of 20%.  Though earlier the railways asked vendors to open all stalls at platforms and station premises, not many vendors had opened their units because of low footfall and restrictions on items they could sell. Vendors associations had written to the Railways stating that they were not ready to begin services on platforms due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and urged officials not to pressure them into opening the stalls Stalls on platforms have been shut throughout the novel coronavirus-induced lockdown, which was imposed on March 24 to check the spread of the infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-allows-sale-of-cooked-food-at-catering-vending-units-on-platforms-as-takeaway-896784.html

Rahul’s 20 live engagements and videos on Facebook on the Hathras incident had garnered 1.89 crore views during the week from September 25 to October 2, Congress functionaries claimed. Most of the live engagements and videos were related to the former Congress president’s attempts to visit Hathras on October 1 to meet the grieving parents of the gang-rape victim. During the week under review, Rahul’s Facebook engagements were almost double that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signalling that the Congress is making a strong comeback in the virtual space where the BJP once was the unquestioned ruler. According to the Congress, Rahul’s Facebook engagements between September 25 and October 2 topped 11.5 million against Modi’s six million. Rahul’s popularity on the medium also rubbed off on his organisation as the Congress notched up 3.4 million engagements on its Facebook page against 2.2 million of the BJP.

It said, if such a request is allowed by one of the innumerable followers, it would lead to total collapse and breakdown of the judicial and social system.  The five-page copy of September 30 judgment, made available on Saturday, said that the plea cannot be entertained on the ground of having been filed by merely a follower. "Such a plea by followers of Sanathan Hindu Dharma is not permissible in the eyes of law," the court said as it also termed the plaint as not justifiable and reasonable.  In charge Civil Judge (senior division) Chhaya Sharma declared that the petitioners next friend, Ranjana Agnihotri and the devotees, including advocate Karunesh Kumar Shukla, did not have right to sue in the matter.  Such kind of plea can be filed by 'Shebait', in service of deity and managing its affairs, and not by those who claimed to be the next friend of Sri Krishna Virajman, the deity, the court said. The petitioners, through their advocates Hari Shankar Jain and Vishnu Shankar Jain claimed army of Aurangzeb who ruled between 1658 and 1707 partly succeeded to demolish Keshav Dev temple and construction was raised as Idgah masjid. They quoted historian Jadu Nath Sarkar who wrote Keshav Dev temple was razed to the ground on 1670 and a mosque was built over there. They sought complete control of 13.73 acres of land in Mathura with the temple complex area at Katra Keshav Dev.  The plaintiffs claimed that Shri Krishna Jamnasthan Sewa Sansthan worked against interests of deity and devotees and fraudulently entered into a compromise with the Committee of Management Trust Masjid Idgah in years 1967 and 1968 conceding a considerable portion of the property to the trust.  The court, however, said the petitioners cannot question the validity of the compromise deed as none of them were trustees of Shri Krishna Janmasthan Trust.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/admitting-plea-by-followers-in-mathura-case-would-lead-to-breakdown-of-judicial-and-social-system-court-896789.html

Besides Rahul and Priyanka, Congress leaders K C Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Mukul Wasnik were closeted with the victim’s family for 35-minutes, sharing their agony and pain of losing their daughter. Television screens showed visuals of Priyanka hugging the victim’s mother and assuring them of every support to ensure that justice was done to the perpetrators of the heinous crime. “No one can stop us till justice is being done,” Priyanka told reporters emerging out of the meeting. This was the second attempt by Congress leaders to visit Hathras. A similar attempt on Thursday was unsuccessful as Rahul, Priyanka and other leaders were detained near Greater Noida and escorted back to Delhi, with police claiming that their visit was in violation of the prohibitory orders in Hathras. Mediapersons too were barred from visiting Hathras on Friday, but the UP government made a U-turn after facing all-round criticism of their strong-arm tactics, including from BJP leaders Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti. Earlier, Rahul and Priyanka, accompanied by more than 50 parliamentarians, made their way for Hathras, only to be stopped by the police at the Delhi-Noida-Delhi Flyway on the Delhi-UP border. After a brief stand-off at the inter-state border, the UP government allowed a delegation of five leaders to proceed to Hathras instead of the huge Congress delegation. Dramatic scenes were witnessed at the UP-Delhi border where Congress supporters had gathered in large numbers, raising slogans demanding justice for the victim. As police caned Congress workers, Priyanka was seen getting out of her vehicle to rush to the aid of former MP Kamal Kishore and Delhi unit chief Anil Chaudhary, who were at the receiving end of the police action.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-case-rahul-priyanka-meet-victims-family-yogi-orders-cbi-probe-896791.html

The senior Congress leader said the state should transform to a knowledge-based economy by embracing Information and Communications Technology, Artificial Intelligence of Robotics and a highly networked world. "These are the concepts which Malayalees can easily absorb because of their high literacy," Chidambaram said, inaugurating a virtual summit on development of Kerala, titled Pratheeksha 2030, organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies (RGIDS). Emphasising the need for building a knowledge-based economy, he said the school education system in Kerala must jump into the syllabus and curriculum that are adopted today in European countries, in Singapore and in China. "That is the curriculum you should adopt," he said. The Congress leader urged the people and policymakers in the state to pay sufficient attention for "re-imagining Kerala which becomes an advanced state within India." He said only a handful states in India can imagine, leapfrogging from today into a new world which is based on an advanced knowledge-based economy, advanced ICT- enabled economy and an advanced economy. "China, for example, in the last 5 to 10 years has leapfrogged into that new world.Most European countries are already in that new world. You have the strength, you have the ability, you have the capacity to leapfrog into a world that embraces a knowledge-based economy by 2030," Chidambaram said at the virtual programme attended by Keralites based in UAE on October 2. Besides Kerala, other states which can aspire to do that include Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu and perhaps one or two other states, Chidambaram said. He said Kerala must continue to invest in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry, traditional industries and tourism. "But you should not stop there.You have to imagine a new Kerala beyond the conventional bounds," Chidambaram added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kerala-can-leapfrog-into-new-world-by-2030-if-it-transforms-economy-p-chidambaram-896795.html

The issue was raised by Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Narasingha Mishra as the House assembled for the day at 10.30 am. The Congress MLAs shouted slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, protesting against the incident. They also condemned the BJP-led government in UP for the "misbehaviour" towards Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Unable to run the House, Speaker S N Patro adjourned the proceeding thrice, first for 10 minutes at 10.58 am, then for 15 minutes and finally from around 11.30 am till 3 pm. The speaker invited CLP leader Mishra, Leader of Opposition PK Naik, Parliamentary Affairs Minister B K Arukha and Jajpur MLA PP Das for an all-party meeting in his chamber. During the protest, Congress members led by Taraprasad Bahinipati and Suresh Routray rushed to the well of the House and shouted slogans. As Bahinipati attempted to climb the speaker's podium, the House was adjourned till 3 pm. Mishra termed the 'high-handedness' of the UP Police as unfortunate. Opposition leader Naik of the BJP said that there is no point in disrupting the proceedings of the Odisha Assembly over an incident in Uttar Pradesh. He said similar incidents have also taken place during the Congress rule. Naiks statement was not audible enough due to the pandemonium in the House. The Congress MLAs' protest in the House followed the party's agitation outside the Assembly for two days over the alleged manhandling of the Gandhis. Outside the Assembly, BJD MLA and former minister Snehangini Chhuria said that her party strongly condemns the Hathras incident. The police and the administration are functioning under the direction of the government there, she said, adding that the BJD demands justice for the Dalit woman and her family. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ruckus-in-odisha-assembly-over-hathras-incident-896796.html

In November last year, the two countries threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative. "As you are aware, the movement was suspended in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. We remain in touch with all concerned authorities including ministries of home affairs and health and family welfare," Srivastava said, responding to a media query on the issue. "A decision on re-opening of the corridor would be taken in accordance with the Covid-19 protocols and easing of restrictions," he said. Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur. In his comments, Srivastava also said that Pakistan is yet to construct a bridge at Budhi Ravi channel as promised last year. "At the time of opening of the Kartarpur corridor last year and in the bilateral agreement signed in October 2019, it was decided that both sides shall establish requisite infrastructure including construction of a bridge at Budhi Ravi channel at the earliest for safe and hassle-free movement of pilgrims," he said. "One year hence, Pakistan is yet to construct the bridge while it is ready at our end. A technical meeting with Pakistan was also facilitated and two teams met on August 27. There is, however, no progress on part of Pakistan," the MEA spokesperson said. The Kartarpur corridor was thrown open in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. The relations between the two countries nosedived after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two union territories.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/decision-on-reopening-kartarpur-corridor-to-be-taken-considering-covid-19-protocols-mea-896805.html

He said the party's 2019 poll manifesto clearly reads that "Congress will repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act and make trade in agricultural produce -- including exports and inter-state trade-- free from all restrictions".  "But now when the Modi government has amended the Act to strengthen farmers, the Congress is misleading them," he said at a press conference here. Accusing the Congress of doing nothing for farmers despite being in power for 55 years, Nishank said now when “real steps” aimed at strengthening them are being taken by the Centre, the party is feeling uneasy. Taking a dig at the opposition party, he said it did once announce a farm loan waiver for farmers “but that ended up in a scam”.  Terming the prime minister's concern for farmers “real”, Nishank said Rs 92,000 crore has been transferred directly to the accounts of farmers across the country so far under the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. "Rahul Gandhi had himself said in 2013 that Congress-ruled states will remove fruits and vegetables from the ambit of the APMC Act. And now his party is opposing the amendment in the APMC Act. It has exposed its dual character," he said.  The Union Education Minister said be it the farm laws or the new education policy, all of them are steps taken towards building a self-reliant India as envisioned by the prime minister. Giving the details of the three farm laws passed by Parliament recently, Nishank said the MSP regime will continue and so will the mandis but the farmers will also have the freedom to sell their produce outside the mandis if they so liked. Under the new farm laws, farmers will also have the freedom to withdraw from a contract with a firm if they found something wrong with it, he said, claiming that the farm laws will also help double the income of farmers by 2022.  Accusing the Congress of “spreading lies and misleading” farmers about the new legislations, Nishank said if the party is sympathetic to farmers as it claims, it should explain why it did not implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission which was finally done by the Modi government||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-opposition-to-farm-laws-exposes-its-dual-character-ramesh-pokhriyal-896809.html

Tata, who has accepted fewer awards over the last few years, received the honour as he believed that these awards inspire future global leaders and strengthen bilateral economic ties between India and the US. "We believe Tata was the first Indian to recognise and tap the potential of the US market. Under his leadership, the TATA group had transformed into the largest Indian employer in the US in a matter of three decades," IACC West India Council, Regional President Naushad Panjwani said. The group is deeply entrenched in multiple industries globally, from heavy steel (TATA Steel), automobiles (TATA Motors), ITES (TATA Consultancy Services), among others.

The Air Force Day is celebrated to mark the day the IAF was established in 1932. The force will celebrate its 88th anniversary this year with the annual parade at the Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad which includes air display of various aircraft. "Along with other aircraft, the Rafale aircraft will also take part in the Air Force Day parade on October 8," the IAF official said. In a tweet, the IAF said, "#AFDay2020: Rafale - The Rafale is a 4.5 generation, twin-engine omnirole, air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship, and nuclear deterrence fighter aircraft, equipped with a wide range of weapons." Five Rafale fighter jets were formally inducted into the IAF on September 10, in a major boost to India's air power capability at a time when the country is engaged in a tense border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh. The multi-role Rafale jets, built by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are known for air superiority and precision strikes. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore. The second batch of four to five Rafale jets is likely to arrive in India by November. The Rafale jets are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia. The Rafale jet is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rafale-fighter-aircraft-to-feature-in-air-force-day-parade-896828.html

Two minor sisters of Baran district went missing on September 19 and were found in Kota on September 22. After recording their statements, girls were handed over to their families. According to police, both the girls in their statements made it clear that they were not raped and had gone to Kota on their own without being forced. "I saw the chief minister's statement that the girls in their statement admitted that they had gone with their own will, but a legal point arises here because the girls are minor and minor's consent is not consent in the language of the law,” Rajulben Desai, member of the commission, told reporters here. "Why can't we take action in this case?" she asked. On Thursday, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had hit out at a section of the opposition and media for “misleading” the public by comparing an incident in Baran district of the state to the gruesome gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras. Desai, along with another NCW member Shyamala S Kundar, was in the city to meet the DGP and other officials to discuss the cases of violence against women. When asked about the NCW's stand on the Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh, Desai said the commission had taken a cognisance of the matter when the girl was admitted to Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi. "The commission held a video conference with the DGP and also wrote to the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh over the issue," she said. When asked why the members of the commission decided to visit Rajasthan instead of Hathras, she said, "We have girls alive here and we do not want that what happened there should take place here also. We will go to other states as well." Shyamala S Kundar said the commission received 764 complaints last year and 61 of them are related to rape and attempt to rape. She said the Rajasthan Police is yet to submit action-taken reports in 55 of the 61 cases. "We raised the matter with the DGP and he has assured us that the ATRs will be submitted soon," Kundar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/consent-does-not-matter-when-minors-are-involved-ncw-member-on-baran-rape-case-896830.html

In a statement, the police said the accused were nabbed from central Delhi's ITO area and were carrying four sophisticated pistols and over 120 rounds of ammunition. The accused have been identified as Altaf Ahmad Dar (25), a resident of Pulwama, and Mushtaq Ahmad Gani (27), Ishfaq Majeed Koka (28), and Aqib Safi (22), all residents of Shopian, the statement said. "Ishfaq is the elder brother of slain terrorist Burhan Koka, ex-chief of Ansar Ghajwat Ul Hind, an off-shoot of Al Qaeda in Jammu and Kashmir," police said. They said Burhan Koka was killed in an encounter in Shopian's Melhora area on April 29 this year along with two other associates. After his death, his elder brother Ishfaq Majeed Koka was approached by the cadres of Ansar Ghajwat Ul Hind to work for the terrorist outfit, police stated. "On Friday, police received information that a group of radicalised Kashmiri youth had collected a huge cache of arms and ammunition and will come to ITO and Daryaganj. "Thereafter, a trap was laid near ITO and the accused were apprehended," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said. Preliminary interrogation revealed that Ishfaq was allegedly indoctrinated by the present chief of Ansar Ghajwat Ul Hind to work for the cause of Jihad.

A dog crematorium spread over 700 sqm is to be built in Dwarka, a project that had made canine lovers very happy. It was initially proposed that the rates shall be in two categories for pet dogs cremation -- Rs 2,500 for a dog weighing up to 30 kg biomass and Rs 4,000 for over 30 kg category, the panel's chief Rajdutt Gehlot said. However, after deliberations, the rates were reduced for both the categories. "So, Rs 2,000 for a dog weighing up to 30 kg biomass and Rs 3,000 for over 30 kg category, were the rates finally approved by the standing committee," he said. Stray dogs will, however, be cremated free of cost at the facility, which will be developed on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis, a civic official said. 'Two units will be there, one of capacity 150 kg to handle heavy dog biomass and another one of 100 kg capacity, primarily for stray dogs," the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/crematorium-for-dogs-to-be-set-up-in-delhi-896835.html

So, if you are a numismatist and has a habit of collecting coins and the above-mentioned coins are present in your collection, then you are in luck.  Because as per reports, if anyone has coins in the denomination of Rs 5 and Rs 10 with Mata Vaishno Devi engraved on them, the individual can put them up for auction. These coins are in high demand even now. Mata Vaishno Devi is a widely worshipped Goddess in the Hindu religion, and that is why people are ready to spend lakhs to own one such coin. Well, you should start looking for such coins in your drawers now.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/heres-how-old-rs-5-and-rs-10-coins-can-make-you-millionaire-896837.html

After being turned away on Thursday, Rahul postponed the tractor rally in Punjab by a day and set off on Saturday afternoon to share the grief of the victim’s family in Boolgarhi village near Hathras with a busload of Congress MPs in tow. Apprehending a face-off with Uttar Pradesh police, Priyanka was seen in the driver’s seat of an SUV with Rahul seated next to her and party MPs following in separate vehicles and minibusses. The delegation was stopped on the Delhi-Noida-Delhi flyway on the Delhi-UP border, where party workers had gathered in huge numbers to support their leaders. Waving the national tri-colour and raising slogans against UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the party workers clashed with the police who stopped the Congress leaders from travelling to Hathras. “Happy to see the Congress hit the streets under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. The party has always stood for the rights of the marginalised and the oppressed. Wish I was there,” senior Congress leader Margaret Alva said. After a brief stand-off at the inter-state border, the UP government allowed a delegation of five leaders to proceed to Hathras instead of the huge Congress delegation. As police caned Congress workers, Priyanka was seen getting out of her vehicle to rush to the aid former MP Kamal Kishore and Delhi unit chief Anil Chaudhary, who were at the receiving end of the police action. Priyanka was seen telling the policemen not to resort to cane charge and also urging party workers to return, before joining her brother to proceed to Hathras. The mobilisation by the Congress was also visible in Hathras, where Seva Dal members and party workers had lined up on either side of the road as Rahul and Priyanka reached the village late Saturday evening.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-mps-hit-the-streets-seeking-justice-for-hathras-victim-896848.html

Delhi's 24-hour average air quality index was recorded at 189 on Saturday. It was 180 on Friday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. "As predicted, the PM2.5 contribution (in pollution) is increasing, which is a characteristic of winters. The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the lower end of poor quality on Monday," the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said.  PM2.5 is tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. It can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.   It said an increase in farm fires was observed on Friday around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions and it is likely to impact Delhi in the coming days. Also, there is a marked dip in minimum temperatures recorded in Delhi. On Saturday, it settled at 20.3 degrees Celsius, which was a notch below normal. The minimum temperature is likely to drop to 19 degrees Celsius by Wednesday. Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in the accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhis-air-quality-moderate-may-turn-poor-on-monday-896852.html

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will also be part of the delegation that will meet the family to hear their grievances and demand justice for them, sources said. "Congress MPs under the leadership of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi will go to Hathras today afternoon to meet the grieving family of the 19-year old-daughter of Uttar Pradesh, who was brutally assaulted & murdered," Congress general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal tweeted. On Thursday, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi along with several party leaders and workers were detained by the police and sent back to Delhi, after they tried to reach Hathras to meet the family of the Dalit woman. In a tweet in Hindi using the hashtag 'Hathrashorror', Rahul Gandhi said the behaviour of the UP government and police with the woman and her family "is unacceptable to me. No Indian should accept this." Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath dispensation, Priyanka Gandhi said the UP government is "morally corrupt". "The victim did not get treatment, her complaint was not registered on time, her body was forcibly cremated, the family is in captivity, they are being suppressed -- now they are being threatened that they will have to undergo a narco test," she said in a tweet in Hindi. "This behaviour is not acceptable to the country. Stop threatening the victim's family," she said. The party alleged that the woman and her family have been denied justice and "severely traumatised" by the BJP government in their attempt to hide the truth of the heinous crime perpetrated on her. The Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-priyanka-gandhi-to-head-to-hathras-again-today-to-meet-victims-family-896580.html

Atal Tunnel, built by the Border Roads Organisation, is the longest highway tunnel in the world above 10,000 ft and reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km. It also reduces travel time by four to five hours. Speaking on the occasion, Modi said Atal Bihari Vajpayee laid the foundation of the approach road for this tunnel, but after his government left, the project was all but forgotten. Experts say that the pace at which Atal Tunnel was being constructed after the Vajpayee-led NDA government were to continue, the tunnel would have been completed by 2040, he said. "Our govt increased the pace of construction from 300 meters per year to 1,400 meters per year and completed the project in 2020," Modi said. The work on Atal Tunnel was accelerated after 2014 and in just six years the government completed the work of 26 years, he said. Just like the Atal Tunnel similar treatment was meted out to several such projects. "There was no political will. I can talk about dozens of projects that are important from the strategic point of view, but for years they were neglected," he said, hitting out at the previous Congress-led governments. "Nothing more important to us than protecting country, but there was an era when defence interests were compromised," he said, in an apparent swipe at the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/defence-interests-compromised-for-years-pm-modi-targets-congress-896626.html

The ruling party in Maharashtra alleged that the recent incidents of atrocities against women in UP have failed to move the government in that state as well as the Centre. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. But there is no 'Ram rajya' (ideal governance) in Uttar Pradesh. 'Jungle raj' is prevailing in UP in terms of the law and order situation," the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana. "Atrocities against women continue to happen and the incidents of rape and murder of young women are on the rise in that state," it said. "A 19-year-old woman in Hathras was raped and murdered, which triggered an outrage across the country. In her dying declaration, the victim said that she had been raped. But the UP government now says that she was not raped. Soon after, an incident of gang-rape also took place in UP's Balrampur," the Sena added. "But despite all this, neither the rulers in Delhi nor the Yogi Adityanath government were moved. The government itself says that when there was no rape, why is the opposition crying hoarse. But if the woman was not raped, why did the police cremate her in the dead of the night?" it asked. "Earlier, when the UP government led by Akhilesh Yadav withdrew Yogi Adityanath's security cover, the latter had cried in the Parliament. Now he himself is the chief minister, but women in his state are not safe," the party said. The UP police stopped Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting the grieving family in Hathras, it said. "Gandhi was caught by collar and pushed to the ground. Humiliating a leader of a prominent political party in such a manner is a gang-rape of democracy," it said. "The body of Hathras victim was burnt by the police by pouring petrol on it. In which Hindu tradition does this inhuman act fit?" it asked. "When two sadhus were lynched in Palghar (in Maharashtra in April this year), we saw the statements of Yogi Adityanath and the BJP blew the conch of Hindutva. But why is it silent now?" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party asked. It said that BJP spokespersons went to town over TV channel debates in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. "But the same people are now saying that the Hathras victim was not raped. The victim's dying declaration has no value!" it said. The Sena said that the country was never so "lifeless and helpless" in the past.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ram-temple-foundation-laid-but-jungle-raj-reigns-in-up-shiv-sena-hits-out-at-yogi-adityanath-government-896628.html

Barricades were installed at the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway where scores of policemen, including senior officers, were present at 12.30 pm, even as CrPC section 144 remained imposed in UP's Gautam Buddh Nagar. “The border is not sealed but checks have been intensified at the Delhi-Noida border,” according to a local police officer.

The seat-sharing exercise gained pace after RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's emissary Bhola Yadav returned to Patna from Ranchi on Thursday with his message on the distribution of seats among different partners, they said. "Seat-sharing has been finalised and an announcement will be made in all likelihood today evening," RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari told PTI. Apart from the RJD, which is spearheading the opposition coalition, the Congress, Left parties CPI-ML, CPI and the CPI(M), the Vikasheel Insan Party (VIP) and Jharkhand's ruling party JMM will unitedly fight the Bihar elections scheduled in October-November. The Congress has been offered 58-60 seats, CPI-ML 13- 15, CPI and CPI(M) altogether 8-10, Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni's VIP 8-10 and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha two, while the remaining seats in the 243-strong assembly will be contested by Lalu Prasad's party, sources said. RJD chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav is expected to make public the seat-sharing deal here at a press conference in the presence of leaders of the coalition, they said. Sources in Congress, however, said they are not happy with the seat-sharing pact and no senior leader of the party is expected at the presser. Congress general secretary and Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil has returned to Delhi on Friday night. The party's state unit chief Madan Mohan Jha and CLP leader Sadanand Singh are also expected to reach the national capital by evening. Sources in the Congress said the grand old party is not happy with the distribution of the seats because besides being offered a lesser number of seats, it is being given constituencies where the party has never won. The CPI-ML, which has three MLAs in the assembly and had earlier issued a list of 30 seats for the first phase of polling on October 28 without waiting for a formal announcement, has reached an understanding after a meeting of its top leader Deepankar Bhattacharya with Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday night and confirmed it will be a part of the Mahagathbandhan, sources said. "Our party leader will be present at the press conference where the seat-sharing will be formally announced," CPI-ML secretary Kunal told PTI. No leader of the JMM is expected to be present at the press meet. "We will comment only after a formal announcement of seats is made in the Grand Alliance," JMM national general secretary and spokesperson Vinod Pandey told PTI in Ranchi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bihars-grand-alliance-clinches-seat-sharing-deal-for-assembly-polls-announcement-likely-today-896672.html

After Congress MP from Thrissur T N Prathapan and DMK Rajya Sabha member from Tamil Nadu Tiruchi Siva, Jha becomes the third lawmaker who has filed the petition in the top court. He claimed the laws are "unconstitutional, discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary". Parliament has recently passed the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. These laws have come into effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent. Among others, he claimed the laws have been passed by Parliament "in breach of the Parliamentary rules and convention".   "The impugned Acts primarily intends to sacrifice the interest of the farmers and leave them at the mercy of the sponsors without any proper dispute resolution mechanism. The Acts provide for 'farming agreements' between the farmers (of whom 85% are marginal farmers owning up to 2 acres) and the Corporate entities," his plea said. The Acts enabled the sponsors to deprive the Market Committees of their market fee on the transaction within the specified Market Yards under the State Mandi Laws, he said.  "This completely destroys the market regulatory environment under the State Market Laws and the revenue generated by the State in the form of mandi fee. The farmers currently have the freedom to sell their farm produce to anyone anywhere. The freedom, however, is not real but is bereft of any safety or guarantees, to protect them against the superior bargaining force of the buyers," his petition claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rjd-mp-moves-sc-challenging-validity-of-new-farm-laws-896688.html

Addressing his first public rally in more than six months ever since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Modi said the inauguration of the Atal Tunnel is part of the central government's resolve that the benefit of development should reach every part of the country and to every person.       Taking a dig at previous Congress-led governments, he said recall what the earlier situation was like as there were several places like Lahaul Spiti that were left to struggle on their own. "The reason was that some districts did not serve the political benefit of some people. Now work is being done with new thinking of 'Sabke saath se, sabke vishvaas se, sabka vikaas ho raha hai' (Development for all is happening with help of everyone and with the trust of everyone)," Modi said at the public meeting in Sissu village of Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh. "There has been a transformation in the government's way of work. Now, schemes are not made based on how many votes are there in an area. Now the effort is that no Indian is left out," he said. The government is committed to providing basic amenities to Dalits, exploited, deprived, adivasis and everyone else, he said. The Atal Tunnel will connect the youth of this region with several employment opportunities, he said. "Some will run homestays or hotels, and some will work as guides. The tunnel will also open the world to the handicrafts, and other products produced in the region," he said. Earlier in the day, Modi inaugurated the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel in Rohtang and lashed out at the Congress-led previous governments, saying strategic projects were neglected and defence interests were compromised for years. Atal Tunnel, built by the Border Roads Organisation, is the longest highway tunnel in the world and reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km.

Announcing the seat-sharing formula in presence of leaders of Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPI(M), Yadav said his party will accommodate old alliance partner Vikashheel Insaan Party (VIP) and JMM its ally in adjoining Jharkhand from its quota of 144 seats in the 243-strong assembly. Among other allies, Congress has been given 70 seats, nearly twice as many as it had contested in the 2015 assembly polls in alliance with the RJD and Chief Minister Nitish Kumars JD(U). The Congress will also be fielding its candidate in Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat where by-poll will be held on November 07. Among the Left parties, the CPI(ML) has been given 19 seats, followed by CPI (six) and CPI(M). Yadav vowed to dislodge the government headed by Nitish Kumar, whom Congress leader Avinash Pandey in his address accused of "apharan" (hijacking) of the mandate in the previous elections. The JD(U) chief had fought 2015 elections opposing the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but ended up re- aligning with the saffron party, Pandey said. The disjointed formation, however, continued to be in disarray as VIP president Mukesh Sahni a Bollywood set designer-turned-politician announced soon after the press conference that he was quitting the grand alliance since he did not get "a respectable offer".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rjds-tejashwi-yadav-to-be-cm-face-for-grand-alliance-in-bihar-polls-896734.html

"It is not only my hope but confidence that you will bless me to make Bihar first and restore its pride so that all my candidates could strengthen the hands of the prime minister," he posted a message on Twitter with a picture of Modi talking to him and keeping his hand on Paswan's shoulders.   The LJP may contest on 143 seats in the elections to the 243-seat state assembly while not putting up its candidates against BJP nominees, party sources said.  A party meeting to deliberate on the Bihar polls was postponed after Paswan rushed to the hospital to see his ailing father and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan. Chirag Paswan has met BJP president J P Nadda a few times and had also spoken to Home Minister Amit Shah as the saffron party leadership worked to keep the alliance intact.  The LJP, the sources said, is also unhappy with the seat-sharing arrangement offered to it and is hoping to inflict damage on poll prospects of the JD(U), which has maintained that the LJP is a BJP ally and not its.  The Bihar assembly polls will be held in three phases on October 28, November 3, and November 7, and the counting of votes will take place on November 10. The nomination process for the first phase, under which 71 of the total 243 seats will go to polls, began from October 1 and will end on October 8. In 2015, the LJP had contested 42 seats and won two. The JD(U) was then part of the opposition alliance which decisively defeated the NDA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ljps-chirag-paswan-may-fight-bihar-assembly-elections-independently-896788.html

The 74-year-old leader has been hospitalised for medical complications since August 24, arising out of a heart surgery that was done three years back, and has been shifted to the ICU recently. The senior Paswan’s aide said that Chirag had to leave the meeting of the LJP Parliamentary Board midway as a doctor from Chennai had flown in specially for an hour to examine the minister. “The minister is stable, but in ICU,” the aide said.  Paswan’s illness comes ahead of the crucial Assembly elections in Bihar and at a time when the NDA allies are grappling with the seat-sharing formula. Last month, Paswan had said that he would stand by every decision related to elections taken by his son Chirag. “I stand firmly with every decision of his. I am confident that with his youthful thinking, Chirag will take the party and Bihar to new heights,” Paswan senior had said on September 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/chirag-paswan-leaves-ljp-meet-to-be-with-ailing-father-896812.html

Hundreds of civil society members, students, women, political leaders and NGOs reached the protest site on Friday evening, calling for harsh punishment for the accused in the Hathras gang rape case, while some demanded a fair investigation into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the police said. "As the protestors violated orders under section 144 of CrPC and other restrictions imposed to combat Covid-19, a case under sections 188 of IPC and provisions of the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act has been registered against them at the Parliament Street police station," a senior police officer said. Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, actor Swara Bhasker, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Aazad, AAP legislator Saurabh Bhardwaj and Left leaders Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury, Brinda Karat and D Raja were among those who attended the protest. Social distancing norms went for a toss and some protesters were seen raising slogans without wearing masks. The police said they kept on asking participants to keep their masks on and maintain distance even as the number of protesters swelled. On Thursday, the Delhi Police had said that no gathering would be allowed around India Gate due to imposition of section 144 of CrPC. They also said that gathering of up to 100 people was permissible at Jantar Mantar and that too with prior permission of the competent authority.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-police-registers-case-against-protesters-at-jantar-mantar-for-violating-prohibitory-orders-896488.html

While confirming the development an official said the bodies of the three were exhumed in north Kashmir’s Baramulla. On Thursday, District Magistrate Rajouri in Jammu region forwarded an application of the families to his counterpart in Baramulla. In the application, the families had demanded bodies of their kin. Jammu and Kashmir Police had buried the bodies of the trio in Baramulla on July 18 after claiming that those killed were “unidentified militants killed in a gunfight.”’ On July 18, the Army had claimed that three unidentified militants were killed in Amshipora village in the higher reaches of Shopian. However, the Amshipora encounter came under scrutiny after three families from the Rajouri claimed that the trio killed were their kin and labourers by profession. Following these claims, the Army and the Police ordered separate inquiries into the matter. The DNA samples of the families were lifted on August 13 and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination and comparison with the “three unidentified slain militants”. On September 25, the DNA sample reports of the three slain persons matched with their parents. On September 18, the Army initiated disciplinary action against unnamed soldiers and officers involved in the Amshipora encounter. In a brief statement, the Army accepted that its men ‘prima facie’ violated powers under Armed Forces Special Powers Acts (AFSPA). Soon after the army’s statement, the families of slain youth had demanded immediate exhumation of the bodies of their loved ones for proper burial at Rajouri. The three families from Rajouri had identified their sons through pictures that went viral on social media. This is the first such case after the Machhil fake encounter of 2010 when authorities allowed exhumation of the bodies. Earlier in 2006, the authorities had also allowed exhumation in the infamous Ganderbal fake encounter case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shopian-fake-encounter-bodies-of-civilians-exhumed-handed-over-to-families-896548.html
03-10-2020||North and Central||Despite travel advisories, Kashmir safe destination for foreign tourists||Despite most of the European countries and the US posting adverse travel advisories on Kashmir, the region continues to be a safe destination for foreign tourists. A National Crime Record Bureau report reveals that no case of crime against foreigners emerged in J&K during 2016, 2017 and 2018. “There was no case of violence, sexual assault, rape, forgery, theft and cheating reported from Jammu and Kashmir against the foreigners who visited the region in these years,” it says. The tourism data shows that most of the foreigners, who visited J&K, had stayed only in the Kashmir division. However, the report reveals that on the contrary, there have been 13 cases registered against foreigners who have committed crimes in J&K in two years. The NCRB report also reveals there was no crime against solo women travellers in Kashmir during the period. Countries like Germany, UK, US and Canada had issued advisories against travelling to Jammu & Kashmir to their citizens soon after New Delhi on August 5, 2019, revoked J&K’s special status under Article 370 and announced bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two separate union territories. Tourism officials say the NCRB report should serve as an eye-opener to foreign countries which have barred their citizens from visiting Kashmir. “Tourism department has a very limited role in getting the advisories lifted as we can only request the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the issue with the foreign countries,” he said. Tour operators, hoteliers and houseboat owners -- who have already lost hundreds of crores as tourist inflows fell to a 17-year low in 2020 – say the stories about Kashmir being unsafe for tourists are exaggerated. “Unfortunately, several media organisations only portray a negative image of Kashmir. Political conflict and the impact of the incidents on J&K borders is being projected in such a way that tourists outside Kashmir start thinking about their safety. However, the reality is entirely different,” said Parvez Ahmad, owner of a three-star hotel in Srinagar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/despite-travel-advisories-kashmir-safe-destination-for-foreign-tourists-896565.html
03-10-2020||North and Central||PM Modi inaugurates strategic Atal Tunnel, says it'll strengthen border infrastructure||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours, at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh.  Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur were present. "Atal Tunnel will give new strength to India's border infrastructure. It is an example of world-class border connectivity. There have been demands to improve border infrastructure but for a long time, such projects either couldn't get out of the planning stage or they got stuck midway," said PM Modi.  Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours, built by the Border Roads Organisation. Stating that connectivity has a direct connection with the development, the prime minister said, "Connectivity in border areas is directly related to security issues." Speaking during the inauguration, the Prime Minister said that it was a historic day and that not only Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s dream was realised today, but also the decades-long wait of the people of Himachal Pradesh came to an end. PM Modi stated that there is "nothing more important for us than protecting the country."  "Experts say if the tunnel was constructed with the pace it was being built at that time, it would probably be completed in 2040. We completed the work in just six years that would have taken 26 years," PM Narendra Modi said. Taking swipe at previous UPA governments, the PM said that after the Vajpayee government laid the foundation for the tunnel, the consequent governments at the centre neglected the project. Atal Tunnel is the longest highway tunnel in the world above 10,000 feet, and the 9.02 km long tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year, the PMO said, noting that the valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall. "Atal tunnel will give new strength to India's border infrastructure. It is an example of world-class border connectivity. There have been demands to improve border infrastructure but for a long time, such projects either couldn't get out of planning stage or got stuck midway," PM said. The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL). The south portal (SP) of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the north portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres.  It is a horseshoe-shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and has an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres, the PMO said.  Atal Tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1,500 trucks per day with a maximum speed of 80 kmph.  The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. The Modi government decided to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel in December 2019 to honour the former prime minister who had passed away the previous year.  The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault Zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-inaugurates-strategic-atal-tunnel-says-itll-strengthen-border-infrastructure-896587.html

The administration has also lifted restrictions on the media's entry into the village, a day after outsiders, including politicians, were barred from meeting the victim's family due to the ongoing SIT probe, the official said. “Only the entry of media has been allowed into the village of the victim as the probe of the SIT has completed,” Joint Magistrate Prem Prakash Meena told reporters. He also refuted allegations that the administration had confined the victim's family and confiscated their phones. Amid country-wide outrage over the incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Wednesday formed a three-member SIT which was instructed to submit its report by October 14, according to officials. The Hathras administration had on Thursday clamped prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144, which bars assembly of more than four people, in the district where political parties had reached and staged protest to demand justice for the young woman, who died earlier this week, a fortnight after her alleged gangrape here.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-rape-case-sit-probe-completed-media-allowed-to-enter-victims-village-896613.html

The 24-hour average AQI was 180 on Friday.   An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.   "The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the lower end of poor quality on Sunday," the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said.    It said an increase in farm fires was observed on Friday around Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions and it is likely to impact Delhi in the coming days. Also, there is a marked dip in minimum temperatures recorded in Delhi. On Friday, it settled at 20.6 degrees Celsius, which was two notches below normal and is likely to drop to 19 degrees Celsius by Wednesday.

While Chowdhury had used "Himachal ka Chhokra", a colloquial reference meaning the lad from Himachal, as a jibe to attack Thakur, the prime minister seemed to be using the similar words endearingly. At Rohtang where he inaugurated Atal Tunnel, Modi smilingly referred to Thakur, who was at dais, as his colleague from union council of ministers and "Himachal nu chhokro", while at a public meeting in Sissu village he called him "Himachal ka Chhokra (Himachal's boy)". Later at his Solang Valley public meeting also, Modi again referred to Thakur as 'Himachal ka Chhokra', making the union minister smile. Chowdhury had used this phrase to take a swipe at Thakur after the Union minister had hit out at the Nehru-Gandhi family of the Congress, sparking protests from opposition members.

03-10-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh policemen held for not registering complaint of rape victim||A policeman has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh's Narsinghpur district for allegedly not registering a Dalit rape victim's complaint for four days, following which she ended her life, a top officer said on Saturday. The arrest was made after Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took serious cognisance of the alleged lapse and ordered that a case be registered against the local police official. Two senior officials were also shunted out as per the orders. The woman, who was allegedly raped by three men four days ago, committed suicide on Friday, police said. An official in Bhopal said that Chouhan had ordered on Friday night that Assistant Inspector of Police (ASI) Mishrilal Kodapa of Gotitoriya police outpost in Gadarwara tehsil, some 50 kms from Narsinghpur district headquarters, should be booked and arrested for not registering the victim's complaint of gang-rape. Besides, as per the orders, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Rajesh Tiwari and Gadarwara Sub Divisional Officer of Police (SDOP) S R Yadav were shunted out from Narsinghpur, he said. "A case was registered against Kodapa and he was arrested under 166 (c) (public servant failing to record information) of IPC on Friday night," Jabalpur Zone Inspector General of Police Bhagwat Singh Chauhan told PTI. The ASP and the SDOP have been transferred from Narsinghpur, he added. Kodapa had been suspended on Friday after a video went viral in social media, in which the husband of the deceased woman accused the policeman of not registering a complaint of rape, police said. The man was purportedly heard saying in the audio-visual clip that instead of taking action in the case, he was held based on a complaint lodged by the accused and had to cough up Rs 50,000 as a bribe for his release. "Three men identified as Arvind and Parsu Choudhary, who belonged to the same community as the victim, and another accused Anil Rai, allegedly gang-raped the 32-year old woman on Monday. The trio has been arrested," Narsinghpur SP Ajay Singh said. According to police, the accused allegedly raped the woman when she was in a field cutting grass for the cattle. The police, however, said on Friday that the woman's two nieces said that the accused caught hold of her and teased her, but did not confirm that she was raped. As per the girls' version, when they raised an alarm, the accused fled from the spot, police added. SDOP Yadav, who has been shunted out, had said on Friday that the woman and her husband had orally complained to the police on the same day but there was no clarity in the complaint. On Friday, when the victim went to fetch water from a tap, a local woman had allegedly taunted her, after which the victim returned home and hanged herself, police said. Police said they have already arrested that woman. "Besides, Motilal, Arvind's father, too, was arrested under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) as he had said something insulting to the woman," Yadav had said. After the Dalit woman hanged herself, the police registered a case of gang rape against the three accused on Friday after four days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-policemen-held-for-not-registering-complaint-of-rape-victim-896674.html

RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav gave members of the party to the BSP leader. Yadav released a picture admitting Bind into the party on his twitter and also the party's social media platform. Yadav, the younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, wrote on his twitter handle that the Bahujan Samaj Party Bihar president joined them to lend support in making a new Bihar and remove anti-youth NDA. After being spurned by the NDA and discarded by the RJD-helmed mahagathbandhan, Kushwaha has forged an alliance with the BSP and a non-descript Janatantrik Party (Socialist) for the Bihar elections. BSP supremo Mayawati has also announced that her party would be supporting Kushwaha as the "Chief Ministerial" candidate in Bihar, an assertion that is being ridiculed at by the ruling NDA well as the grand alliance comprising RJD, Congress, and others. Mayawati's party had faced desertions in Bihar in 2010 too when its three MLAs had switched sides to Lalu Prasad's party after cross-voting for the then RJD-LJP nominees for the Rajya Sabha election- Ramvilas Paswan and Ramkripal Yadav.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bihar-bsp-president-quits-party-joins-rjd-896686.html

In a letter to the home department, it said the emergency parole can be given considering the current pandemic situation. According to the officials, there are currently 4,250 such inmates, comprising 3,100 undertrials on interim bail and 1,150 convicts on emergency parole, who are out of jails as part of the prisons department's recent decongestion drive. "We have written to the government to extend emergency parole of convicts by one month," a senior jail official said. The Delhi Prisons are overcrowded. Before the process of decongesting jails began in March, the population in jails was 180 per cent of the capacity -- the three jails were housing 18,000 inmates against the capacity of 10,000. After the decongestion drive, the number of inmates has reduced to over 13,000. The official said Delhi's home department can take a decision on extension of parole given by it. Another official said that due to overcrowding of the city jails, it is very difficult to maintain social distancing inside the prisons to contain the spread of coronavirus. Recently, 260 inmates and jail staff had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. According to the data shared by the prison authorities on September 13, the number of active COVID-19 cases in Delhi Prisons stood at 25, including 20 jail staff. Director General of Delhi Prisons Sandeep Goel had also tested positive for COVID-19. He is currently under isolation. Among prisons in the national capital, the first case of the coronavirus was reported in Rohini Jail on May 13. Two coronavirus positive inmates of Mandoli Jail had died on June 15 and July 4.

He also said the Narendra Modi government was committed to safeguarding the interest of farmers and said the minimum support price (MSP) system would continue. "Misinformation, disinformation and outright lies that the Central government intended to dismantle the MSP system and open the agriculture sector whereby our farming community will be the losers," Puri said while addressing the media here. The minister further said "lies" were being spread that farmers' land would be "snatched" by big corporates. Sale, lease or mortgage of farmers' land is prohibited. Farmers' land is also protected against any recovery,” Puri said adding it was mentioned in the Bills. The Union minister for housing and urban affairs, and civil aviation, sought to know from Congress and other opposition parties if they were opposing the farm bills then why their 33 out total 107 MPs in Rajya Sabha remained absent on September 20. Puri claimed that former prime minister Manmohan Singh and Montek Singh Ahluwalia former deputy chairman of the erstwhile Planning Commission had said that "these things" should be implemented, apparently referring to the new farm laws. "These ordinances were promulgated in May. Read Congress manifestoes of 2017 (Punjab Assembly polls) and 2019 (Lok Sabha). Read statements of the two highly accomplished economists -- former PM Manmohan Singh and Montek Singh Ahluwalia. They have said these things should be implemented. But no one implemented it," he said. Stating that every political party had a right to oppose or dissent, Puri described the ruckus created by the opposition in Rajya Sabha as "political hooliganism". "That was not a parliamentary democracy. That's not dissent. That's political hooliganism," he said. Claiming that the new farm laws were a win-win situation for everyone, he said that the BJP-led government wanted to put money in farmers' pockets by liberating them. When pointed out that agriculture was a state subject, Puri said that it was mentioned in the Constitution that the union government can legislate in this domain in the national interest. Farmers will be the real beneficiaries as they will get better prices, he said. To a question about the Shiromani Akali Dal quitting the NDA over the farm laws, Puri, without naming ex-Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, said that till September 6, she had said that these bills were good for farmers. About the SAD's claim that they had raised their concerns over the farm reform laws with the Centre, He said, "Where and when it was raised, I do not know. Som Parkash ji (union minister) and I also sit in the council of ministers." Harsimrat Kaur Badal in her resignation letter had said that she kept trying to persuade the Union Cabinet to take farmers on board and deal with their concerns over the farm ordinances, which preceded the bills. Union minister Som Parkash said the SAD had earlier supported the ordinances. Even former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal also spoke in favour of these bills. Thereafter they suddenly changed their stand, Som Parkash alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/oppn-spreading-misinformation-outright-lies-union-minister-hardeep-singh-puri-on-farm-laws-896763.html
03-10-2020||North and Central||Congress plans protests in MP on October 5 against 'rising' crimes||Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath on Saturday said that women were unsafe in BJP-ruled states while refereeing to the Hathras incident in Uttar Pradesh. The opposition party said it would hold "silent demonstrations" near statues of Mahatma Gandhi and B R Ambedkar in Madhya Pradesh on October 5, state Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta told reporters. Nath stated that the Hathras incident of alleged gang-rape, death and forced cremation of a 19-year-old Dalit girl, and suicide by a Dalit woman after alleged gang rape in Narsinghpur in MP reveals that women were insecure in the BJP- ruled states. A Dalit woman in Narsinghpur district killed herself on Friday after the police failed to register her complaint of rape by three men. Nath said a string of crimes had taken place against women in Khargone, Satna, Jabalpur, Khandwa, Seoni, and Katni in the state, which is "shocking". Terming the Hathras and Narsinghpur incidents "unfortunate and disturbing", state BJP chief spokesman Deepak Vijayavargiya said the accused are being dealt strictly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-plans-protests-in-mp-on-october-5-against-rising-crimes-896786.html

A decision has also been taken for providing security permanently in the village, the senior officer, who along with DGP H C Awasthy rushed to meet the victim's family on the instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said. He said orders for the suspension of police personnel, including the Superintendent of Police and the Circle Officer of the area, were issued on Friday within two hours of receiving the first report from the Special Investigation Team (SIT). "It is an extremely sad incident. We met everyone in the family. We spoke to them and assured them that the strictest action would be taken against all those found guilty,” Awasthi told reporters. "The SIT inquiry is on and it will continue to do its work. The family members have raised certain issues. Whatever points and the complaints they have raised, the SIT will note them, and we will make all efforts to ensure that each of them is addressed," Awasthi said, without elaborating. The officer said that they would submit a report to the chief minister. The visit by the two top officials came as a massive controversy raged over the incident with the opposition targeting the Adityanath government. "The first report of the SIT was received yesterday evening and within two hours orders were issued for the suspension of the then SP, CO, inspector, senior sub-inspector and constable," Awasthi said. The victim, who was assaulted and allegedly gang-raped on September 14, died of her grievous injuries in the early hours of Tuesday in a Delhi hospital and was cremated in the dead of night near her home on Wednesday with her family alleging that they were hurried into carrying out her last rites by local police. The incident triggered widespread outrage and protests. On Thursday, the Hathras administration clamped prohibitory orders barring the assembly of more than four people in the district, where scuffles broke out as politicians, including from the Congress and the TMC, as well as the media persons tried to access the village. About 300 police personnel stood on guard to prevent anybody from entering. Today, however, the administration lifted restrictions on the entry of media persons. To a query, Awasthi said, "If people's representatives want to come, five people will be allowed". "We also met some people's representatives and requested them to help maintain social harmony," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sit-will-look-into-all-issues-raised-by-victims-family-says-up-additional-chief-secretary-896787.html

The protesters pelted stones at the policemen and official vehicles. Police personnel were deployed at the clash site outside a municipal corporation office in Kothi Meena Bazaar area of the Taj city, officials said.

03-10-2020||North and Central||Tejashwi Yadav has stabbed me in the back, says Vikassheel Insaan Party chief||The Mahagatbandhan in Bihar suffered a jolt on Saturday evening when one of its alliance partner, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) walked out of the Press conference being addressed by the Opposition’s chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav. “We always backed the RJD. But Tejashwi has today stabbed me in the back. There is something wrong in his DNA,” said a fuming VIP president Mukesh Sahni before walking off and breaking ties with the Mahagatbandhan. Sahni’s angst stemmed from the fact that RJD leader Tejashwi, while announcing the number of seats for all the alliance partners, avoided VIP and said he would “accommodate VIP from the RJD quota of 144 seats.” The Congress will contest 70 seats, the CPI-ML in 19, while the CPI and the CPM will jointly contest 10 seats, as reported by DH earlier. The RJD and the Congress functionaries, followed by the Left leaders, had to beat a hasty retreat after the VIP created a ruckus at the Press meet and shouted slogans against Tejashwi Yadav. The JDU was quick to respond to the VIP's charge. “Lalu was adept at backstabbing those who supported him. The Congress party is a classic example of getting ditched by the RJD (in 2009). Now, Mukesh Sahni (of VIP) has learnt it the hard way as there is hardly any difference between Lalu and his sons,” said JD (U) spokesperson Dr Ajay Alok. VIP is the third ally which has dumped Mahagatbandhan in the last one month. Earlier, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha had deserted the RJD-led alliance making similar charges against Tejashwi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/tejashwi-yadav-has-stabbed-me-in-the-back-says-vikassheel-insaan-party-chief-896802.html

The ‘hit list’ mostly comprises Valley-based journalists, some political workers and activists, whom the militant group have alleged are on the payrolls of Indian agencies. The 39 people on the list have also been categorised as A+, A, B and C. This categorisation is similar to how the J&K police slots militants based on the level of their involvement in militants activities. He said not only this, the list of political/media persons and public figures and also posts of Lashkar-I-Islam are uploaded with the intention to create fear psychosis among individuals. “Police have taken cognizance into the matter and case FIR No. 82/2020 U/S 13 of UA(P) Act r/w 506 IPC has been registered and investigation has been set into motion,” he said. Earlier on Friday, Kashmir journalists including editors and reporters regretted the continued vilification of individuals representing the institution of media. “It has become a routine for diverse elements across all the political and ideological thoughts to pass judgment on the Kashmir media and eventually, make it the punching bag to suit their ends,” a joint statement by most of the journalists' bodies said. A senior police officer told DH that such ‘hit lists’ were uploaded in the past as well with the help of cyber over-ground-workers (OGWs). “They are circulated widely on social media to instil a sense of fear among the civilians and also pass a direction to other militants operating elsewhere and their associates to target these persons,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-police-files-fir-after-hit-list-appears-on-social-media-896810.html

03-10-2020||North and Central||Indian Army chief Naravane, Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla to visit Myanmar amid stand-off with China||Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Chief of Army Staff General M M Naravane will on Sunday and Monday visit Myanmar, which not only shares boundaries with India and China but also has a tripoint with the two nations. New Delhi is reaching out to Nay Pyi Taw at a time when the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are engaged in a military stand-off along the disputed boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh. The five-month-long stand-off not only took India-China relations to a new low but also brought under focus the competition between the two nations for geopolitical influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region.   Shringla and Gen Naravane will call on Myanmar’s State Counsellor and de facto Head of Government, Aung San Suu Kyi, during the two-day visit to Nay Pyi Taw. They will also have a meeting with Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, before returning to New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated in a press release on Saturday. New Delhi is sending the high-level delegation to Nay Pyi Taw amid signs of stress in Myanmar’s relations with China. Nay Pyi Taw is purportedly upset over the continued flow of arms originating in China to the militant organizations in Myanmar. The Royal Thai Army a few months back intercepted a huge consignment of illegal arms and ammunition, which had its origin in China and which was being smuggled into Myanmar. Besides, Suu Kyi’s government is also re-assessing some of the infrastructure projects Beijing is keen to bankroll under the proposed China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), apparently out of concerns over debt-trap the Belt-and-Road Initiative – the ambitious cross-continental connectivity project launched by the communist country a few years back – entails. Shringla on Thursday had a virtual meeting with his counterpart in the Myanmar Government, U Soe Han, and reviewed the development and connectivity projects funded by New Delhi in the neighbouring country. With several insurgent organizations operating in northeast India having bases in Myanmar, New Delhi has been maintaining close security cooperation with the neighbouring country. The two nations in July 2019 inked a pact to step up bilateral defence cooperation. Sources said that New Delhi would convey to Nay Pyi Taw during the visit of the Foreign Secretary and the chief of the Indian Army and New Delhi remained committed to help the Myanmar Army in capacity building apart from enhancing cooperation to address mutual security concerns.  India is also keen to ink a MoU on Maritime Security Cooperation with Myanmar, apart from starting exchanging data on the movement of commercial and non-military ships in the maritime neighbourhood of the two nations. The Indian Navy is also likely to provide the Myanmar Navy one of its submarines.  With no sign of an early end to the India-China military stand-off in eastern Ladakh, Gen Naravane and Senior Gen Aung Hlaing are also likely to discuss the security of the India-Myanmar-China boundary tripoint in Diphu Pass. Myanmar and China in 1960 demarcated the boundary between the two nations in the tripoint. New Delhi, however, has not yet accepted it and it remains unsettled, just as the rest of the boundary between India and China.  “India-Myanmar relations are historic, multifaceted and marked by mutual trust and respect,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said. “India attaches high priority to its relationship with Myanmar in accordance with its Neighborhood First and Act East policies.”   He said that both sides had strengthened cooperation in several areas, including connectivity and trade, development projects, energy, capacity building, defence and security and culture and people to people links.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/indian-army-chief-naravane-foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla-to-visit-myanmar-amid-stand-off-with-china-896816.html

Delhi was at number two but now has come down to the sixth spot in the country in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases, he told reporters. The minister reiterated that the city government had significantly ramped up testing capacity due to which a rise in Covid-19cases was recorded for a long period in September. "But now cases have begun to come down and it's sort of stabilised. Also, the positivity rate has fallen to less than 5.5 per cent from 8.5-9 per cent recorded earlier. So the situation is far better now," he said. The national capital recorded 37 more Covid-19 fatalities on Friday as the toll climbed to 5,438, while 2,920 fresh cases took the tally to over 2.85 lakh, authorities said. The number of containment zones in Delhi jumped to 2,648 on Friday from 2,615 on Thursday. On Friday, the positivity rate stood at 5.19 per cent while the recovery rate was over 88 per cent, the bulletin said, adding that the fatality rate was 1.9 per cent. The Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days. The number of tests conducted and corresponding fresh cases reported, ranged from 24198 (2,312) on September 1 to 61,973 (4,071) on September 19. On India crossing the one lakh-mark in terms of Covid-19 deaths, Jain said it is a "grim milestone". Asked about the protests over the Hathras incident, he said, toughest punishment should be meted out to culprits so that "such people have fear of the law and think ten times before taking such a step".  On the BJP-led civic bodies claiming crores of money due from the city government in terms of property tax to them, the AAP leader said "all payments have been done". "BJP has been ruling the MCD for over a decade. It will get done only if they go out of MCD," Jain said when asked about the mitigation in the level of landfill sites in Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-situation-in-delhi-better-cases-showing-downward-trend-satyendar-jain-896817.html
03-10-2020||North and Central||Former BJP office-bearer among five held for running sex racket in Rajasthan||Five people including former BJP Mahila Morcha district president and three government employees have been arrested in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur for allegedly running a sex racket, police said on Saturday. Three others including a former office-bearer of the Congress-affiliated Seva Dal, Poonam Chaudhary alias Pooja, are absconding and searches are being carried out to nab them, they said. The sex racket came to light after the parents of a 17-year-old girl lodged a complaint at Mahila Thana, Sawai Madhopur, last month alleging that the accused forced her to have sexual intercourse with several people, the police said. Investigating Officer and Deputy Superintendent of Police, Women's Cell, Omprakash Solanki said so far five people -- Sunita Verma alias Sampat Bai, Sandeep Sharma, Rajulal Raiger, Shyoram Meena and Heeralal Meena -- have been arrested. The accused women used to send girls to government employees in exchange for money or getting work done, he said. Verma, who is the former district president of BJP Mahila Morcha, was sacked from the post after her arrest on September 26, the party said. The victim alleged that Verma forced her to have sexual intercourse with several people. She was raped and the act was filmed. The video was later used by the accused to blackmail the girl and force her yield to their demands, according to police. Solanki said the minor was sexually assault several times between October 2019 and May 2020. "The accused were allegedly running the racket and we are investigating the matter to ascertain how many other girls were in their trap," Solanki said. Verma and Heeralal Meena are under police custody till October 6 and are being interrogated, he said. A case has been registered at the Mahila Thana under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including that of gang rape, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the police said. BJP district president Bharat Lal Mathuria said Verma was sacked from the post after the matter came to light and she has also been expelled from the party. "Sunita Verma was the district president of Mahila Morcha but the party has expelled her for her involvement in the case," he said. "She was in the party for the last three years and was given the post due to her work. She used to work for the poor but when and how she got involved in such activities is not known to us," he said. Mathuria said the Mahila Morcha's executive committee will be dissolved and a new one constituted soon. Hem Singh Shekhawat, district president of the Seva Dal, a grassroots front organisation of the Congress, said Poonam Chaudhary's appointment as the district president of the women's wing in February 2019 by the then Seva Dal district president was "unauthorised". Only the state chief of women's wing can appoint a district president, he said. "District president of Seva Dal cannot appoint a district president of the women's wing. Therefore, the appointment was unauthorised. Secondly, the woman was never seen in any function (of Seva Dal) and hence her affiliation is under doubt," he said. Shekhawat said, "I have apprised the Seva Dal office-bearers in New Delhi about the matter." The National Commission for Women has asked the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to look into the matter, NCW member Rajulben Desai said. Desai along with another NCW member Shyamala S Kundar was in Jaipur to meet government officials to discuss the status of crime against women in Rajasthan. "We came to know about the matter today and have asked the NCPCR to look into the matter and submit a report to the government," Desai told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/former-bjp-office-bearer-among-five-held-for-running-sex-racket-in-rajasthan-896822.html

The accused has been identified as Arjun, a resident of Madangir, they said. On Thursday, a police team patrolling Nitya Nand Marg near Kashmere Gate metro station noticed two bike-borne men behaving suspiciously. They were signalled to stop, but the suspects approached aggressively towards the policemen in order to intimidate them, a senior police officer said. "Their bike slipped and they tried to escape from the spot. However, one suspect managed to flee by running in the opposite direction of traffic coming on Yudhister Setu, whereas Arjun was caught after around one-kilometer chase," Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse said. He tried to use pepper spray on police but could not succeed. In order to escape from police's clutches, he took out faeces from his trousers and applied all over his body and even smeared it on the uniform of a policeman. Notwithstanding the bizarre trick, the policeman caught hold of the accused and apprehended him, they said. Arjun, along with his accomplice, used to commit robbery. When they did not get an easy target, they used to spill oil over car to divert the attention of its driver and steal belongings from the vehicle, police said. He kept a knife and a pepper spray for threatening people and police. Raids were conducted to nab his accomplice, he said. A gold chain, one bike, one pepper spray, one bottle automobile oil used for spilling on car engines, ball bearing used for breaking glass and a knife were recovered from his possession, police added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/robber-applies-poop-on-his-body-to-evade-police-capture-896889.html

Now, once these lasses get ensnared in their love-net, the loitering frequency increases. Amusedly, these girls, albeit in love, seem to avoid amorous chats with them, apparently due to this awful virus. Recently, a guy was garrulously gushing about being with a girl. Call it tough luck, some teensy dust-specks must have traversed into his nostrils, thereby the twitching and triggering terrible sneezes. The belle, who until then, was burbling with bountiful love, suddenly got bewildered, and began biting her nails to button up all her angst. Her biting intensity looked like, had anyone been beside her, she would have borrowed their nails, and bitten them off to bits! The hapless guy soon got the hint and hurriedly left in a huff.  Talk of human’s hypochondriac traits! A friend keeps mentioning of her lousy neighbour, who loves to latch onto lengthy loquacious chats over their long boundary wall. Recently, during such chattering sessions, my friend who had just then crammed food into her mouth started coughing because it got caught in her throat. Lo! Her neighbour, in a trice, had vamoosed into thin air! In fact, I know few folks who are so horribly hypochondriac that even on hearing a sneeze or cough over the phone, in a jiffy, they would have cut the call off! Indeed, people are pretty scared to even sneeze in public places in present times. Even if they sense one, say, while on a relaxed stroll on roads, you see them rushing behind real big tree-trunks. If they are driving, desperately ducking under the vehicle’s dashboard. Just to hide that horrendous sneeze or cough. The culpability of cruel crime-committer can be condoned with compassion. But, a cough or sneeze by a compatriot...Never! Certainly, it’s considered with contempt. Paradoxically, one can find positives even amidst perilous pandemic times! Like, think of baleful situation, with bad-tempered senior, bellowing at you in belligerent tone. Or, think of you, a pretty young gal, being pertinaciously gawked at by perverted oldies.  Or, think of your horrendous house-owner, harrying you over highly trifle matters. Now, cash in on this pandemic paranoia! Start producing those phoney sneezes, and pronto, you have those pesky people, persistently peeving you, petrified into pole-axed state! Silver linings in dark clouds, right?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/pandemic-paranoia-896520.html
03-10-2020||Second Edit||China’s claim unacceptable||It is becoming increasingly evident that China is not interested in a fair, forward-looking, negotiated settlement to the decades-old border dispute with India. Instead of working to de-escalate the ongoing border stand-off, China has now reiterated territorial claims that it had first put forward in 1959 in a letter that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had written to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru rejected the Chinese claim back then, a position that India continues to hold to date. Reiterating an old, unworkable claim at a time when the two militaries seem to be on the brink of war in the Himalayan heights is irresponsible on the part of China, an aspiring superpower. Much water has flowed under the bridge in the 61 years since Beijing put forward the 1959 LAC claim line. The two countries fought a war in 1962, their armies have violently clashed thereafter in 1967, 1986 and more recently in June. Dozens of rounds of talks at various levels have taken place over the decades and the two sides have even signed landmark agreements. By singing a tune it sang in 1959, China is rubbishing all the steps forward the two sides have made at the negotiating table over the decades. This is clearly unhelpful. It will confirm apprehensions in India that Beijing is not serious about negotiations and is simply keeping India engaged fruitlessly at the table while it prepares for aggression on the ground. Over the past six decades, China has always sought to avoid clarifying what its perception of the LAC is. It has repeatedly fudged the issue and kept the Indian side guessing since the 1950s. It has not even come out to say that the LAC means its 1959 claim line. While it has provided a bit more clarity, murkiness persists as even its 1959 LAC claim consisted only of points that could be interpreted in different ways. It is evident now that since May, the PLA has been aiming to physically secure territory as per China’s 1959 LAC claim and has managed to do so in Galwan, Hot Springs and the north bank of the Pangong Tso. This is its objective in Sub-Sector North, too, where it is already preventing Indian soldiers from patrolling up to the LAC. As in the 1950s and 1960s, it is seeking to ensure that India can pose no threat to its control over Aksai Chin. The PLA is unlikely to budge or pull back from its current position in the coming months. India must dig in its heels, too, both at the negotiating table and on the ground. It must prepare itself for the long haul.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/china-s-claim-unacceptable-896516.html

Chennithala earlier denied the allegations that he was presented a costly phone purchased by the firm entrusted with the controversial housing scheme funded by UAE agency, which is facing an allegation of paying kickbacks and flouting FCRA norms. The Congress leader admitted that one of his personal staff members received a watch as a gift from the UAE consulate and added that a protocol department officer in the state government received a phone as a gift. The protocol officer was a personal staff member of CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan while he serving as Home Minister, Chennithala said that since the gifts were given through lucky dip at the UAE national day celebrations the officials needed to be flayed for accepting the gifts. Reiterating that he did not receive any phone as a gift, Chennithala submitted a petition to state police chief Loknath Beheral to trace the phones in question using its IMEI numbers in order to find its users. The bills of the phones had already come out. However, the police are yet to take any action on the petition as no offences were involved. Police were seeking legal opinion on the matter. Chennithala's fresh move might be aimed at putting the ruling left-front in a tight spot as the chances of those associated with the left-front government receiving the phones as gifts could not be ruled out. Chennithala had even raised suspicions whether the costly phone was siphoned off by someone by misleading the consulate authorities. Chennithala's exposure that a protocol department officer receiving phone as a gift would restrict the left-front from further attacking Chennithala over the issue.  Santosh Eapen, managing director of the private firm entrusted with the construction of the UAE agency funded housing scheme, had mentioned in his anticipatory bail plea before the Kerala High Court that former employee of UAE consulate Swapna Suresh wanted him to buy five costly mobile phones and one of the phones was gifted to Chennithala. The CBI is now probing into the allegations over the Rs. 20 crore Emirates Red Crescent funded housing scheme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-congress-ramesh-chennithala-leader-demands-probe-to-trace-uae-phone-896735.html

The Association's representatives would soon meet state Cinematography Minister T Srinivas Yadav to request him to permit the reopening of the theatres (single screen) from October 15, Association leader Vijayender Reddy told PTI. The Association is hopeful of a positive response, he said. The theatres have remained closed since March 15 and each theatre is incurring an expenditure of about Rs three lakhs per month in Hyderabad and about Rs two lakhs per month in the districts though they remained closed, he said. The Association had already requested the state government to waive property tax and not to collect fixed electricity charges during the period the theatres remained closed, Reddy said. The Association comprises about 650 members in the state, he said. The owners of theatres are ready to take Covid-19 prevention measures like the provision of sanitizers. Though the theatre owners are not hopeful of a larger turnout of the audience for the present in view of the pandemic, they have decided to reopen the movie halls now as things may improve by January next year, Reddy added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/theatre-owners-urge-telangana-govt-to-reopen-cinema-halls-896749.html

Efforts by the Kerala Health Minister K K Shailaja and senior health department officials to pacify the doctors did not succeed as the doctors insisted on revoking the suspension, maintaining that the action against the health workers, who had been dedicatedly fighting against Covid-19, amounted to demoralising the health fraternity. Anil Kumar, a 55-year-old Covid-19 patient at the Thiruvananthapuram medical college, was found to have maggot infested sores after being discharged. Nodal officer of the ward and two nurses on duty were suspended pending detailed probe. Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association secretary Dr Nirmal Bhaskar told DH that one doctor and two nurses were handling up to 60 Covid-19 patients without the support of bystanders in each ward. In such a scenario such an unfortunate incident of a patient getting infested might have gone unnoticed. The doctors and nurses were not trying to justify the incident. But such actions before detailed enquiry demoralised the health workers, who had been fighting Covid relentlessly over the past several months. It was in the view of Covid-19 that doctors were given the additional responsibility of nodal officer. But no additional manpower deployment was made, he pointed out. Meanwhile, a police case was initiated against a section of doctors and nurses for carrying out the protest flouting the ban on gatherings of more than five persons imposed in the state under the Section 144 of CrPC given coronavirus spread.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/doctors-go-on-indefinite-hunger-strike-over-maggot-issue-in-kerala-896808.html

03-10-2020||State||Can BJP make inroads into Old Mysuru region? ||Last week, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa vowed on the floor of the Legislative Assembly that the BJP would win 135-140 seats in the 2023 Assembly election and the Congress will be made to sit in the Opposition for 10 years.  But, ask pundits or the BJP’s own poll managers and they will say that Yediyurappa’s goal will require the saffron party to win big in the Old Mysuru region. And this region has come to be a high wall the BJP has not managed to scale in years.  “Even our national president J P Nadda is aware of the situation,” BJP general secretary N Ravikumar said of the party’s difficulty in the Old Mysuru region. He conceded that the BJP’s organisational strength was not as strong as that of the Congress or the JD(S) in the region.  The Old Mysuru region is dominated by the Vokkaliga community and covers the geographies of Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Ramanagara, Chamarajanagar, Chikballapur and so on. The belt comprises some 60-odd assembly constituencies.  For years, the Congress and the JD(S) have fought bitter elections - their rivalry is the stuff of legend, with villages not seeing eye to eye based on their party affiliation - with the BJP nowhere in the picture.  But, in the high-voltage 2019 bypolls, the saffron party managed to win the KR Pet Assembly seat, its first victory in Mandya where the JD(S) holds sway. It also won Chikballapur, another first. In the 2018 polls, the BJP managed to win one seat in Hassan.  That the BJP lacked an organisational base is getting fixed and efforts are on for an aggressive push to make inroads in the region with every election. “The upcoming gram panchayat polls is an opportunity,” BJP’s Nanjangud legislator B Harshavardhan said. “We won very few taluk panchayat seats in Periyapatna, Hunur and HD Kote. There, too, we are improving organisationally,” he said. The BJP is wary of the challenge posed by Congress’ D K Shivakumar, who represents the Vokkaliga machismo, whereas H D Deve Gowda of the JD(S) remains the community’stallest leader.  The BJP appears to be grooming its own crop of Vokkaliga leaders: Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan being put in charge of Ramanagara, the turf of Shivakumar and H D Kumaraswamy; Tourism Minister C T Ravi’s elevation as a national general secretary to name a few.  BJP vice-president B Y Vijayendra, Yediyurappa’s son and although a Lingayat, is emerging as a force to reckon with after his instrumental role in the KR Pet win. He is almost certain to contest the next Assembly election from Varuna, former Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah’s turf.  According to Vijayendra, the Old Mysuru region is “a tough nut to crack” for the BJP, given that it is a strong JD(S) bastion and with Shivakumar. “We will start mobilising booth-level cadre. Once we start winning local elections, we will be poised to win Assembly elections,” Vijayendra, who is currently involved in the party’s campaign in the Sira bypoll, told DH.  According to political analyst Harish Ramaswamy, the BJP’s ascent in the Old Mysuru region was just a matter of time. The KR Pet victory strategy, he said, involved projecting a parochial connection between BJP and Vokkaligas. “Now, they’re trying to push Hindutva into the sizable population of Vokkaligas.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/can-bjp-make-inroads-into-old-mysuru-region-896876.html

The recognition was withdrawn after one student was killed and 24 students sustained injuries in an accident during an educational excursion in Chikkamagaluru district in November 2018. Observing that the order withdrawing recognition did not record reasons, the high court held that by no stretch of the imagination an unfortunate accident can be brought into the ambit of Section 39 of the Karnataka Education Act to derecognise the institution. The accident had happened near N R Pura town when the students from Class 10 were on an excursion. The counsel representing the institution submitted that the institution had spent Rs 22 lakh towards the medical expenses of the students and the staff. He submitted that after several correspondences, the Shivamogga DDPI ordered the withdrawal of recognition in May 2019. The state argued that the institution had failed to comply with a circular, dated January 27, 2011, that mandated institutions to take prior permission before conducting educational excursion. The circular also mandated that only state road transport buses should be used for excursions and not private mini buses. Quashing the order of derecognition, Justice R Devdas said that nothing can be held against the institution that calls for a serious action of derecognition.  "The scope and ambit within which the provision of Section 39 of the Act can operate is when there are deficiencies in an educational institution in maintaining the standards of education, standards of infrastructure and general moral and social standards," the bench said. The bench also directed the institution to consider if any of the parents approach with requests for further medical expenses.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/accidents-outside-the-school-do-not-call-for-derecognition-says-karnataka-high-court-896893.html

Among others who joined the BJP today include Dr C M Rajesh Gowda, whose name is doing the rounds in the party circles as the probable candidate from Sira. The Election Commission on Tuesday had announced the schedule for the by-election to Sira assembly constituency in Tumakuru district and Rajarajeshwari Nagar (R R Nagar) in the city, for which the last date for filing of nomination is October 16. Results will be declared on November 10. The by-election had been necessitated in Sira following the death of sitting MLA B Sathyanarayana of JD(S) last month, while the R R Nagar seat fell vacant following the disqualification of Congress MLA N Munirathna under the anti-defection law last year. The Congress and JD(S) are traditional rivals in Sira, which the BJP has never won. Congress has finalised former Minister T B Jayachandra, who had represented the constituency twice in 2008 and 2013, and was defeated by late Sathyanarayana (of JDS) in 2018, as the party candidate. The JD(S) is yet to name its candidate. According to some reports, Rajesh Gowda is said to have joined the party after the state unit recommended his name among the list of of probable candidates for Sira, to the high command. Speaking to reporters after joining the party, Rajesh Gowda said he was joining the BJP to be its loyal worker and not as a ticket aspirant. He said he will abide by the party decision on the ticket and will work for the victory of the candidate whomever the party names. "I'm joining BJP in admiration of Narendra Modi (Prime Minister) and Yediyurappa's (Chief Minister) leadership and for the development of Sira. I have not joined the BJP to contest the by-election.If given an opportunity, I will contest the polls," he added, as he rejected reports about approaching JD(S) earlier for ticket and stated that BJP was his first political party. Kateel, who welcomed Rajesh Gowda and others to the party by handing over to them the party flag, said youths are getting attracted to the BJP after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, and claimed the BJP today has become the world's biggest political organisation. He expressed confidence about BJP winning both Sira and R R Nagar assembly bypolls and elections to four MLC seats, as he compared the Congress to a sinking ship. The BJP release quoted Kateel as saying that hundreds of public representatives from the Congress and JD(S) were willing to join BJP. State BJP General Secretary Ravi Kumar said in the run-up to the bypolls, 264 booth committees and whatsapp groups have been activated in Sira to strengthen the organization there. According to sources, Rajesh Gowda is the founder- director at Matrix Imaging Solutions, where former Chief Minister Siddaramaiahs son and Varuna Congress MLA Dr Yathindra was a director. Yathindra had resigned as a director in 2016 following controversy after the company won the government tender to setup a diagnostic centre, when his father was CM.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/several-local-leaders-from-by-poll-bound-sira-join-bjp-party-confident-about-win-896836.html

Kumaraswamy, a former Chief Minister, while questioning the credibility of such information being reported, which has the potential to malign people, also sought to know whether an attempt was being made to mislead the people, using the media, and wanted the truth to come out. "....I have been following reports in the media about the ongoing investigation into drug cases.Everyday, there are reports stating that children of politicians, businessmen and influential people are involved and no action is being taken against them. Fictitious stories are also emerging every day," Kumaraswamy said. Speaking to reporters here, he said media reports quoting CCB sources say Anushree's caller list revealed that she got in touch with influential political leaders of the state as soon as she got the CCB notice to appear for questioning. The reports speak about a former Chief Minister, a former Chief Minister's son and an influential politician, he said. Listing the names of a few former Chief Ministers, including him, Kumaraswamy asked "which officer has given such information to the media? on what basis a former Chief Minister is being named? Who is he? His name has to be revealed." Objecting to officials revealing the details to the media, when the investigation is underway, Kumaraswamy said a reference has been made to a former Chief Minister, without mentioning the name and the government has to bring out the truth. "Whoever the former chief minister is, whether it is me or any one, if he has pressurised or she (Anushree) has spoken to him, it has to be revealed before the public. I have spoken to Mangaluru Police Commissioner also and asked him to clarify," he said. In case the police have not revealed any information and the media has created it, the government has to take action against the media, he said, and demanded that the government bring out the truth, reveal the identity and get it investigated. Asking the media to report responsibly, so that no one is unnecessarily maligned, Kumaraswamy sought an investigation into the alleged involvement of a CCB officer in revealing the information and its authenticity. He said he was also writing to the Chief Minister and Home Minister about stopping such media reports that unnecessarily malign people and mislead people without any truth. In response to a question, he also termed it as a conspiracy to malign people ahead of the November 3 state assembly bypolls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/drugs-case-kumaraswamy-questions-reports-about-ex-cms-alleged-interference-in-probe-896886.html

Javadekar is in Goa to attend a series of meetings on the new farm laws Saturday. The Congress leaders reached the hotel around midnight and demanded to meet the Union minister over the Mahadayi river water dispute with Karnataka. When the hotel management refused them permission, they sat on a protest in the lobby. Later, the leaders were detained and taken to a police station in Panaji. The leaders including Goa Pradesh Youth Congress Committee President Varad Mardolkar, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Sankalp Amonkar, office-bearer Janardhan Bhandari.

"Javadekar has failed the State of Goa as far as interest of Mahadayi is concerned,” he said, claiming that the Union minister was also responsible for granting permissions for several environmentally hazardous projects, which were being opposed by people. Responding to the incident, BJP Goa spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik tweeted, “Only CHORS (thieves) and dacoits do such things at midnight @INCGoa inspired by their national leader who was playing to the gallery at Hathras yesterday. @BJP4Goa strongly condemns such act by @INCGoa workers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/congress-leaders-stage-midnight-protest-at-goa-hotel-to-meet-javadekar-detained-896588.html

Around 15 leaders, including Goa Pradesh Youth Congress Committee chief Varad Mardolkar, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) general secretary Sankalp Amonkar, office bearer Janardan Bhandari and others were arrested around Friday midnight by Goa police after they staged a protest at a five-star hotel, where Javadekar had checked in, police said. Javadekar is in Goa to attend a series of meetings on the new farm laws on Saturday. The Congress leaders reached the hotel around midnight and demanded to meet the minister over the Mahadayi river water dispute with Karnataka. A senior police officer said that the leaders were placed under preventive arrest. GPCC chief Girish Chodankar said, "The arrested leaders will not apply for bail. They had gone to meet the minister urging him to save Mahadayi river from being diverted illegally by Karnataka." "The minister should have explained the Centre's stand on the Mahadayi issue," he said. "The river has been diverted by Karnataka in violation of the Supreme Court order and award of Inter-State Water Dispute Tribunal," the Congress leader said. One of the arrested leaders, Janardan Bhandari said they would continue being in police custody, but will not apply for bail. "We don't want bail, we want Mahadayi, our mother," he said. Goa and Karnataka have been at loggerheads over sharing of the water of Mahadayi river. Inter-State Water Dispute Tribunal has declared its award distributing a share of water between Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra states. All the three states have petitioned the apex court against the award.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-congress-leaders-held-for-protest-wont-apply-for-bail-896592.html

Talking to reporters here, the minister said the Maharashtra government was waiting for the CBI probe report in the case. Replying to a question about reports which said that Rajput's death was a case of suicide and not murder, Deshmukh said, "We have not received any official information regarding that. It won't be appropriate to comment on it until we get official information." "We will give a statement as and when we receive any official information about it," he said. "We want that the CBI inquiry report into the case should soon come before public so that they get to know whether it was a suicide or murder," he said. Earlier this week, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had said that it has not reached any conclusion in Rajput's death case and that all aspects were under investigation. Rajput was found hanging in his Bandra apartment on June 14. The Mumbai Police had earlier registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and launched an investigation. However, the CBI took over the probe into the high- profile case in August following the Supreme Court's nod. Rajput's father K K Singh had on July 25 lodged a complaint with the Bihar police against his son's rumoured girlfriend and actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members accusing them of abetting the late actor's suicide. Deshmukh had in the past defended the Mumbai Police's investigation into the case, saying the force conducted the probe in a "professional manner".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/people-must-be-told-if-sushant-singh-rajput-died-by-suicide-or-not-says-maharashtra-home-minister-896651.html

03-10-2020||West||Congress rakes up Mahadayi issue during Javadekar's Goa visit; 15 detained||The two-day visit of Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar took a stormy turn on Saturday after 15 Congress workers were detained for several hours by the police, after they landed up at a five-star resort where the Union Minister was put up around midnight on Friday, to express concerns about the ongoing Mahadayi inter-state river water dispute. After Javadekar did not meet them, the Congress workers led by Goa vice president Sankalp Amonkar, staged a protest outside the resort, after which police detained them for several hours and were released on a bond only on Saturday evening. The BJP has condemned the incident and said that Congress workers "crossed a line" by trying to harass a Union Minister in the dead of the night. "Our delegation wanted to discuss the Mahadayi (called Mhadei in Goa) issue with Javadekar. But instead, the police arrested our workers. It is a sad incident. They were not there to assault anyone. This is a matter for all Goans," Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat told DH on Saturday after the 13 opposition party workers were released on a bond by the local sub-divisional magistrate. "Javadekar should have met Congress workers who had assembled at this hotel because it is an issue related to the life and death of Goans. Congress is firm on the Mahadayi issue. But given the recent developments which have happened, Goa may lose the Mahadayi river if the diversion happens," Kamat, a former Chief Minister also said. Earlier on Saturday, Congress workers in Panaji also burnt an effigy of the Union Minister in protest.  Javadekar is in Goa on a two-day visit during which he is meeting farmers' groups in the state, in order to allay their fears about the controversial Farm bills which were passed in Parliament last month. The BJP has however condemned the "midnight drama" which played out, outside Javadekar's hotel in Panaji.  "The Congress leaders indulged in unruly behaviour. It was an act of goondagiri. We condemn this behaviour. Prakash Javadekar is not here on a holiday. He is here on work," Goa BJP spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik told reporters at a press conference in Panaji. Opposing the Kalasa-Bhanduri project, which aims to divert water from the Mahadayi river to the deficit basin of the Malaprabha river, the Goa government has claimed before the Union Jal Shakti Ministry, the Mahadayi Interstate Water Dispute Tribunal, as well as the Supreme Court, that diversion of water from the river's basin, would lead to increased salinity of Goa's water table and cause "ecological destruction" in the state. Last month a team of scientists from the National Institute of Hydrology had visited Goa to conduct a salinity study of the river water, on the instructions of the Union Jal Shakti Ministry.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/congress-rakes-up-mahadayi-issue-during-javadekars-goa-visit-15-detained-896798.html

A First Information Report (FIR) for forgery was registered against unidentified persons following a handwriting expert's report, said a police official. Vivek Rahade (18), who had recently taken the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), was found hanging from a tree at his family's farm at Ketura in Beed tehsil on September 30. Photos of his `suicide note' went viral on social media after his death. Rahade purportedly said in the note that his parents were poor and hardworking farmers but he had big ambitions. "I have recently appeared for NEET medical exams. Since there is no longer reservation for Marathas and I did not do well in exams, my parents cannot afford to enroll me in a private medical college," the note said. Beed Superintendent of Police Raja Rama Swami said that police found the alleged suicide note in a notebook at Rahade's residence, and sent it to a handwriting expert of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). As per the expert's report, it did not match with a sample of Rahade's writing, he said. "We have registered an FIR against unidentified persons under IPC section 465 for forgery," a local police official said, adding that further probe was on. The Supreme Court recently stayed the implementation of the law granting reservation to the Maratha community in Maharashtra and referred the issue to a constitution bench.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/suicide-note-which-spoke-of-maratha-quota-found-to-be-fake-beed-police-896839.html
03-10-2020||West||Gujarat High Court grants relief to Muslim man facing opposition by Hindu residents over residential plot||The Gujarat High Court has granted relief to a Muslim buyer of a plot located at a Hindu-dominated residential society in Vadodara by permitting him to restart construction of the house and restoration of electricity which had been cut off by the civic body and electricity department. The buyer is one of the many Muslims who have purchased properties at the Samarpan Society but are finding it difficult to settle in view of angry protests by several Hindu residents allegedly on "communal lines." Justice Bhargav D Karia pronounced the order last week on a petition moved by Firoz Mohammed Patel who had sought permission for construction and restoration of electricity supply. The society has been in controversy on similar issues for nearly a year. Patel had bought a plot measuring 5,003 sq mt for Rs1.35 crore from Firoz Fali Contractor under the Disturbed Areas Act, 1991 as the locality falls under the area defined by this Act. Patel has said that after buying the plot by fulling all the legal formalities, he obtained permission for construction from the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and a temporary electricity connection from the electricity board. However, from May onwards, Patel started facing protests from the Hindu residents and eventually the civic body stopped him from construction and his electricity connection was also cancelled with his meters taken away. In the petition, Patel mentioned that some of the members of the society made representations to government authorities and raised “completely baseless and frivolous allegations of illegal construction, fraudulent Disturbed Areas Act permission etc.” He has said that the “underlying motive” behind such allegations was communal and such allegations were raised to pressurise and harass him. The controversy had reached a point where a society road was blocked by the protesting residents and despite notice by VMC, the road has not been opened as yet. Meanwhile, in August, the seller of the plot, Firoz Fali Contractor, was booked for cheating, forging and violation of the Disturbed Areas Act. It was alleged that he concealed his Parsi religion and sold the plot to Patel, the petitioner, by violating the Disturbed Areas Act. Contractor has also moved the High Court seeking quashing of the FIR while saying that he followed all the procedures prescribed under the Actt. The Act defines a certain area as "disturbed" to avoid distress sale of immovable properties without prior permission from a local authority like the district collector. Under the Act, the seller and the purchaser have to satisfy the authority that they are transacting mutually with consent. The Act came into being to avoid distress sale from areas infested with violence. However, in the last several years, dozens of cases have been filed after Muslim buyers bought flat or plot in a society dominated by Hindus. Most of these cases were found to have followed the law yet the buyers faced protest. In many such instances, the buyers were forced to leave the society and the deals were cancelled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-high-court-grants-relief-to-muslim-man-facing-opposition-by-hindu-residents-over-residential-plot-896859.html
