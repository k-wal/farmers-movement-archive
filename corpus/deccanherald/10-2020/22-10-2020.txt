22-10-2020||First Edit||A more concrete Quad now||With Australia set to join the Indian, American and Japanese navies in the upcoming Malabar exercises, co-operation among the Quad countries looks more concrete. The naval exercise, which will take place in November, will be historic; this is the first time that all the Quad countries are participating. Set in motion in 1992 as a bilateral drill between India and the US, it turned trilateral with Japan joining in 2015. The four nations have been engaging diplomatically so far under the Quad rubric. That their militaries will join hands now, even if only for a drill, is a step forward. Cooperation has been limited so far as one or the other of the Quad countries has been reluctant to ruffle Beijing’s feathers at different times. After participating in joint exercises with India in 2007, Australia pulled away, wary of evoking Chinese displeasure. India, too, has been reticent about participating in a grouping directed against China. China’s rising belligerence, especially vis-à-vis India in recent months, has forced the Quad countries to shed such inhibitions, triggering a new keenness in them to join hands. Although all four countries perceive a threat from China, uncertainties remain. Their objectives differ. While the US would like to use Quad to retain its dominance in the Indo-Pacific, the others are keen to work together to ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free and inclusive to all. There is uncertainty over commitment, too. Should the US cut a trade deal with China, its motivation to lead the Quad could diminish. Would it stand by India if its own ties with China improve? India also apprehends that in the event of a war with China, the others may not be willing to risk their own relations with Beijing to support India meaningfully. At best, India’s Quad partners would provide intelligence inputs. The Quad’s value to India in the maritime domain is understood. However, India’s security challenges are primarily continental. Thus, the Quad may not be that useful to India in dealing with the kind of challenges that a border war with China entails. More than its value in the military domain, the Quad holds potential in the economic and technological domains. India could find collaboration with its Quad partners beneficial in building up an alternative global supply chain and reducing trade dependency on China. Delhi and Tokyo are already seriously exploring such collaboration. They should take this further with the US and Australia, too. Engagement on multiple tracks, rather than a focus on the military dimension alone, is the best way forward for the Quad, or even the proposed Quad Plus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/a-more-concrete-quad-now-905364.html
22-10-2020||In Perspective||Offset policy: Changed for the worse||A key financial tool that encourages indigenous manufacture in the defence sector was removed in the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP), 2020. Henceforth, in the case of Government-to-Government (G2G) or Inter-Government Agreements (IGA) or ab-initio single vendor situations, the vendor would not have to discharge any offset obligation.    That India has the dubious distinction of being the world’s second-biggest importer of military hardware, only behind Saudi Arabia, is well known. To neutralise this, the defence offset policy, first made in 2005, introduced an ‘offset’ clause for foreign companies that won defence deals. They would need to invest a part of the contract value in the country, thereby developing skills,  bringing in technology and generating employment in India. The offset obligation was meant to boost India’s domestic defence industry and help the country gain in terms of technology. Since the last 15 years, this offset policy partially compensated for the huge outflow of India’s resources, facilitated induction of technology and added capabilities and capacities to domestic industry whenever the foreign supplier made reverse purchases of Indian goods, invested in local industry or in India’s R&D. This is not unique to India, most defence buyers the world over leverage their buying power by contracting a vendor to discharge offset obligations to augment the purchasing country’s capacity for research, design and development of military products and services and even of aerospace and internal security industries. The foreign vendor has multiple avenues to fulfill his offset obligations. The supplier may directly buy eligible products or services from an Indian enterprise , bring in FDI in joint ventures with Indian enterprises, invest in providing transfer of technology (TOT) to Indian enterprises, or assist in technology acquisition by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in areas of high technology. The Defence Procurement Procedure also provides for offset banking and multipliers. The vendor could bank “offset credits” or take an MSME unit as an “Indian Offset Partner” and get his credit multiplied by 1.5 times or even up to four times where DRDO is the beneficiary. So, why did the government remove this obligation for G2G, IGA and single vendor categories? The government belatedly discovered that vendors would load the contract with an extra cost to pay for the offset obligation. Further, “administrative costs” had to be incurred in implementing the offset obligations. Furthermore, the CAG has criticized the failure to implement the offset policy. Apparently only 59% of the offset obligations had been discharged by the target dates, and there was little hope of other obligations being met by the contracted date. Apparently, foreign vendors made offset commitments to qualify for the supply contract but were never really earnest about fulfilling their commitments. Offsets are, unfortunately, made for controversy – they allegedly distort trade, are non-transparent and riddled with corruption. Nevertheless, they are  increasingly adopted in defence purchases. The offset clause in the contract for the 36 Rafale fighter jets, an IGA, for example, was signed between the Indian and French governments in 2016, with 50% of contract value to be offset and executed by the French company Dassault Aviation and its partners. Political controversy arose over their choice of the main Indian Offset Partner and the non-transparent arrangements for the discharge of offset obligations. Waivers with respect to arbitration and access to books of accounts of the industrial suppliers were sanctioned at the highest level. Obligations were heavily loaded on to the last two years of a seven-year period.   Despite these concessions, Dassault Aviation and missile-maker MBDA have not progressed on transfer of technology to DRDO under the offset clause. Of the new technologies desired by DRDO and to be obtained from the firms under the offset obligations, the vendors did not agree to transfer a majority of them, claiming that they were not within the vendor’s core competence. A country with a huge military hardware requirement needs offset policies to empower the Indian domestic industry and through the “Make in India” initiative, to turn India’s defence production clusters into global manufacturing hubs. If offset clauses result in controversy or the vendor is lax, or an auditor criticises the performance of the policy, the logical solution for defence ministry mandarins is to demonstrate intellectual heft, universalise credit multipliers,  give additional incentives for offset discharge, even use the Ministry of External Affairs to convince the foreign government concerned to make G2G concessions. It is very naive to remove the offset clause itself and expect a vendor to reduce costs! Hopefully, this will not be a prelude to further dilutions of offset obligations for other categories of defence deals as well. An offset clause serves the purposes of boosting India’s defence manufacturing ecosystem, providing technological inputs and contributing to uplifting the country’s  private defence industry, DRDO, defence PSUs and the Ordnance Factories. Isn’t this critical to ushering in Atmanirbhar Bharat?

The motivation came a few months ago when Mahesh Mathrubhoomi and Harish Kumar were visiting their village Chikkenahalli, about 11 km from Channapatna. As educational institutions remained closed due to Covid-19, the government had started various online education channels. The brothers observed that over 180 school and college students couldn’t access such systems due to the absence of internet connection. The few who had connection were struggling with network issues. “Not all the children were in a position to use parents’ mobile data or get a private Wi-Fi connection. Their struggle inspired us,” Mahesh told DH. After two months of toil and Rs 3 lakh out of their own pocket, the duo managed to lay an optical fibre cable from Channapatna to Chikkenahalli.    The fruits of their labour were realised four days ago. Since then, the children are attending classes without disruption. The village has 2,000 houses and all residents are enjoying the benefits. The hotspots have been set up considering the convenience of students. “We instructed the company to block sites that are not necessary for students, including those related to adult entertainment,” said Mahesh. The brothers run an NGO called Mathrubhoomi Seva Foundation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/online-leap-for-students-as-brothers-gift-free-wi-fi-to-village-905356.html

Smaller onions cost Rs 60 per kg in APMCs while the price of bigger onions has increased to Rs 85 per kg. The prices are likely to reach Rs 100 per kg, the traders said. When onions were ready for harvest, heavy rain had damaged the crop. On average, farmers were getting 250 bags of onions per acre. But, due to rains, it has dipped to 70 bags. The supply of onions is not enough to meet the demand, informed an onion trader. Vegetable vendor, Rajesh, said, “Farmers in Hubballi-Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Bagalkote, Haveri and Raichur has sown onion and the crop will be ready by December end or January. The onion prices will reduce by then. If there are heavy rains in North Karnataka, then the problem will be further aggravated.” Due to the growing gap between supply and demand, poor quality onions are being supplied to the APMC, Kankanady market and other areas. Good quality onions are fetching anywhere between Rs 80 to Rs 85 per kg. Owing to the rise in the price of onions, many hotels had stopped serving onion dosa and onion 'pakodas' to customers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/onion-price-skyrockets-in-mangaluru-leaves-consumers-in-tears-905455.html

The term of the temple management committee’s previous members had ended a year ago. The ongoing discussions at the government level are not on filling up posts but are focussed on having an authority for Kukke Subrahmanya Temple on the lines of Male Mahadeshwara Hill Temple Authority. Conventionally, the temple management committee, comprising eight members including the president and priest, takes a decision on all development activities at the temple. Now, in the absence of a committee, Additional Deputy Commissioner M J Roopa has taken charge as administrator of the temple. If an authority is constituted, the Chief Minister will be the president, the minister for religious endowment will be the vice president and the commissioner of the religious endowment department will be the secretary. Sullia MLA, MP and deputy commissioner will be the members. Sources said that until the authority is constituted, the government will set up a development committee and all its five members will be nominated by the government. Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said the proposals on constituting a management committee or development committee or authority for the development of Kukke Subrahmanya Temple is before the government. “A suitable decision for the development of Kukke Temple will be taken at a meeting planned next week,” he said and added that no final decision had been taken so far.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/no-decision-on-authority-for-kukke-subrahmanya-temple-yet-kota-srinivas-poojary-905459.html

Gaurav Shah of Mysore Gujarati Samaj said that this year, no celebrations have been organised in the wake of the Covid impact. "Dandia Raas and Garba are cancelled, as they attract a large crowd. However, members of the samaj and their family members participate in the aarathi held at 8.30 pm every day. We hope for a grand event next year, after the people wade through the current crisis," he said. The Samaj celebrates Navaratri every year, in a traditional style, with Dandia and Garba on all the nine days of the festival. The 'Dandia Nite' had become a great hit among the people, especially youths. Traditional Gujarati band and DJs used to participate, to make the event more colourful and memorable. Debashis Sinha of Mysuru Bengali Association said, "Durga puja is the main festival for Bengalis, during Navaratri. The annual Durga puja, that used to be held at a Choultry on KRS Road, has been limited to a simple aarathi to a portrait of the Goddess this year, with only a few participants." "Usually, puja rituals will be held in the morning and cultural programmes in the evening, along with a variety of games and competitions. But, this year, we are following safety methods, to prevent the spread of Covid pandemic and cancelled all the events. We have organised a simple 'Ghot puja', at Anjaneyaswamy temple near CFTRI, from October 22 to 26. It would be simple ceremony by following Covid guidelines," he said. The association used to get artisans from West Bengal every year, to make the idols of Goddess Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Ganesha and Karthik. The idols used to be taken out on a grand procession on Vijayadashami Day and immersed in River Cauvery.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mysuru-gujarati-bengali-associations-prefer-simple-navaratri-905723.html

However, the rider escaped unhurt. The incident happened when the horses and elephants were taken out for a rehearsal for the ‘Jamboo Savari’, which is scheduled to be held on October 26, the Vijayadashami day. The horse seemed to be frightened at the sight of elephants and started to run helter-skelter. The rider lost control and fell off the horse. An officer said, “The rider is safe and no injuries were sustained. The horse was a little nervous and it will be familiarised with the elephants.” The Mounted Company is an integral part of Dasara, since the period of the Wadiyar kings, the erstwhile rulers of Mysore State. The horses, attached to the Company, which was commissioned in 1951, play a major role in the Dasara procession, from the beginning up to the end of the Torchlight Parade at Bannimantapa. Due to outbreak of Covid-19, this Dasara, Jamboo Savari is limited to Mysuru Palace premises. In normal years, Jamboo Savari used to be between Mysuru Palace and Bannimantap Grounds, covering 5 km. The howdah elephant carries the 750 kg golden howdah on his back along the Jamboo Savari route, as part of Vijayadashami procession.  With only a few days remaining for Jamboo Savari, the horses’ and elephants are familiarised to the sound of cannons and all the animals performed well, during the session, said an officer. The practice sessions were organised outside the palace. As many as 21 rounds of fire, using cannons, will be shot before the commencement of the Jamboo Savari, on Vijayadashami, the final leg of Dasara, on October 26. The horses are under training.

22-10-2020||Main Article||The wages of Hindutva | The Governor and the Mob||We live in strange times. People who swear to protect and defend the Constitution mock at the word ‘Secularism’ that is inscribed in the very preamble to the Constitution. The Governor of Maharashtra, a Constitutional functionary, writes to the Chief Minister, another Constitutional functionary, that “you have turned secular now, the term that you used to hate so much?” What do we see in this question? A clear sense of mocking that “you who were with us till last year have now turned against us!’’ And this conversation was triggered by the Chief Minister’s refusal to open certain temples for festivities in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the heart of the matter are ‘temples’ and the relation of State to religion.  These words reflect a much deeper malaise among various Constitutional functionaries. Truth is, for most of them, the Constitution is a huge inconvenience. Then there is the other episode that has occupied the electronic and social media space. It is an advertisement promoting ‘Tanishq’ – acompany owned by the Tata group —jewellery. The ad is built around the story of a Muslim mother-in-law telling her Hindu daughter-in-law that Godh-bharai (or Seemantha ceremony) is not specific to any religion; for keeping a pregnant bahu happy is part of every religion. It’s a beautiful, heart-warming message. Some people saw a subversive ‘love jihad’ in it and decided to troll the ad so much on social media that the Tata group decided to withdraw the ad. The withdrawal was so quick, meek and tame that the Mob suddenly knew how powerful it was. If you can generate 20,000 or may be 100,000 tweets against anything online, you can wipe it out of real space. And the most powerful corporate house can be humbled, without breaking a single glass pane of a showroom. That’s the new ‘empowerment’. This is the Mob online. We have seen the Mob on the street and then on TV channels. Or the TV channels themselves acting as the Mob.   These two episodes reflect a broader crisis that confronts us today. The first is the increasing irrelevance of Constitutional norms in governance, while the second depicts the increasing failure of the ‘rule of law’, in inverse proportion to the power of the Mob. To understand the psyche behind the Maharashtra Governor’s letter, one must examine the BJP’s paranoia over the word ‘Secular’ and the party’s uncomfortable co-habitation with a Constitution that proclaims secularism as one of the goals of the State. Most BJP supporters would be quick to point out that the word ‘Secular’ was inserted in the Preamble by an ‘illegal’ government under the rule of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency in 1976 through the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution. But then came the 44th Amendment passed by the Janata Party-led coalition government, the successor to Indira Gandhi’s regime of which the BJP’s earlier avatar was also part, that promised to undo all the damage she had done to the Constitution. How the two newly-inserted words (Socialist, Secular) in the Preamble escaped their attention is not clear. Nevertheless, ‘Secular’ (and ‘Socialist’, too) remains in the Constitution and all functionaries who take oath on the Constitution, even if they do so in the name of God, have sworn to protect and defend the Constitution as it stands. Calling the earlier Congress governments ‘pseudo-secular’ or ‘sickular’ has been a favorite pastime of BJP leaders, but none of them have taken the trouble to define what ‘real’ secularism is or who is a ‘real’ secularist. One thing is clear: Secularism stands in an adversarial position to Hindutva. And for a party based on Hindutva, secularism, pseudo or real, is anathema. But the problem is, BJP leaders, too, want the badge of secularism and wish to wear it on their sleeves as the ‘real’ secularists. And how do they demonstrate it? By passing Acts such as criminalising Triple Talaq, the Citizenship Amendment Act, breaking up of Jammu & Kashmir state into two Union Territories and placing J&K under a curfew and lockdown for over a year. Their point is that they no longer ‘appease’ the minorities as the Congress party did. But what they do to the minorities is as clear as daylight. Savarkar proclaimed ‘Hindutva’ as a nationalist ideology for the resurgence of Hindu community in political terms, not religious terms. Is it not possible to aggregate the Hindu community in political terms without the religious narrative? Is there nothing to the Hindu cause or psyche other than Ram Janmabhoomi? Are they not troubled by existential needs such as roti, kapda, makaan, and naukri, sadak, bijli aur paani?   Truth is, if it is only Hindu unity that is sought and not Indian unity, the Hindus then have to be aggregated in opposition to the ‘Other’. And this majority has to be weaponised against the minorities. Only then Hindutva will succeed. For that, it is necessary to coin such terms as ‘love jihad’ – a crime that does not exist in the Indian Penal Code -- an unfounded conspiracy of Muslim men enticing Hindu women to marry them, convert them and increase their numbers. Pose it as a demographic challenge – the challenge of 14% Muslims against 82% Hindus. The Hindus apparently should be a worried lot. If you start believing in the message of the Tanishq ad, then you are lost to the cause of Hindutva. This ad is an act of subversion of Hindutva; hence it must be deleted from public memory. The Governor of Maharashtra has nothing to do with the Mob, but both come from the same ideological moorings. One is a high functionary of State with limited powers; he can only mock. The Mob is faceless and amorphous but has the muscle to subdue the high and mighty. Both are instruments of the same Power.       (The writer, a formerCabinet Secretariat official, isVisiting Fellow, ORF)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/the-wages-of-hindutva-the-governor-and-the-mob-905365.html

The ship was designed by the Indian Navy's in-house organisation, Directorate of Naval Design (DND), and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Kolkata, Navy officials said the INS Kavaratti has a state-of-the-art weapons and sensor suite capable of "detecting and prosecuting" submarines. In addition to its anti-submarine warfare capability, the ship also has a credible self-defence capability and good endurance for long-range deployments. The last of four indigenously built Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) stealth corvettes, INS Kavaratti under Project 28 is scheduled to be commissioned into the Indian Navy by Gen Naravane at Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam, the Indian Navy said in a statement. "The ship has up to 90 per cent indigenous content and the use of carbon composites for the superstructure is a commendable feat achieved in Indian shipbuilding," it said. The Navy said the ship’s weapons and sensors suite is predominantly indigenous and showcases the nation’s growing capability in this niche area. The ship will be commissioned into the Navy as a combat-ready platform as the ship has completed sea trials of all the systems fitted onboard. "With the induction of Kavaratti into its fold, the Indian Navy’s preparedness will be enhanced," the Navy said.

The German carrier had on September 29 announced suspension of all its "planned flights" between India and Germany till October 20, citing "unexpected rejection" of its flight schedule by the Indian authorities. "Flights between India & Germany recommence under air bubble arrangement. Lufthansa will operate from Delhi (4 days), Mumbai (3 days) & Bengaluru (3 days). @airindiain will operate 5 weekly flights from Delhi & 2 every week from Bengaluru to Frankfurt," Puri said in a tweet. While announcing cancellation of its air services from September 30, Lufthansa had said it had applied for continuation of special flights it was allowed to operate until the end of September. Aviation safety regulator DGCA, however, said, "As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them." It, however, continued negotiations over the issues, resulting in resumption of services between the two countries. Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under the 'Vande Bharat Mission' since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-germany-flights-recommence-under-bilateral-air-bubble-agreement-puri-905385.html

Yet Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to remain as popular as ever. Opinion polls in Bihar, where from Oct. 28 to Nov. 7 he faces his first major electoral test since the pandemic, show his coalition comfortably retaining control of the state government. A separate India Today “Mood of the Nation” poll in August said 78% rated his performance as “good to outstanding” compared with 71% last year. One of those supporters is Sanjay Kumar, 22, a carpenter who was beaten by police in April for violating India’s strict lockdown while cycling from the capital New Delhi to his village in Bihar -- a journey of more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) -- after he lost his job. He’s still unable to find regular work. “Some people are not getting all the benefits because of corruption in the middle and that is not his fault,” Kumar said, noting that Modi can’t control the spread of the virus if people don’t wear masks. “No one can question his good intentions,” he said. “He is sincerely trying his best to give poor people food and work.” Many other Modi backers also blame others for India’s woes, and there is no shortage of targets: Federal bureaucrats, state governments, village leaders, opposition parties and even their fellow citizens. The prime minister has helped endear himself to India’s poor by meeting their daily needs with programs to supply cooking gas, toilets and housing, all while taking measures to bolster the status of the Hindu majority over religious minorities. Weak Opposition In the absence of significant national opposition, voters have been willing to give Modi a very long leash, according to Milan Vaishnav, director and senior fellow at the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This kind of politics, however, is not without its shortcomings,” Vaishnav said. “Mr. Modi was able to make this argument effectively in 2019 but it will be harder in 2024 if he cannot make more rapid progress on the economy, employment, and governance.” As prime minister, Modi has been focused on making India both attractive to global investors and unabashedly Hindu. His Bharatiya Janata Party returned to power in May last year with a thumping majority following a campaign that highlighted his success in providing necessities to the poor, combined with a Hindu nationalist agenda that played up his strongman persona -- particularly against arch-rival Pakistan. Since winning re-election, Modi revoked Article 370 of the constitution that granted special autonomous status to India’s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, and approved a citizenship law that discriminates based on religion. He has also pushed for a national citizens registry in the northeastern state of Assam and laid the foundation stone for the construction of a Hindu temple at a site where a 16th century mosque was razed. A spokesman for Modi’s office did not respond to several requests seeking comment. “He is popular because he has ideological clarity and he’s only implementing what the BJP had promised in their manifesto, like the promise to repeal Article 370,” said Arun Anand, research director at Delhi-based think tank Vichar Vinimay Kendra and author of two books on the BJP’s parent organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. “Politicians keeping their word is rare in India.” Modi has positioned himself along with other populist leaders across the globe who feed off anxieties that minority groups will one day supplant the majority even though Hindus make up 80% of India’s population, according to Sudha Pai, New Delhi-based political scientist, author and former pro-vice chancellor of the Centre for Political Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University. He’s also been adept at leaving the details of policies to ministers and bureaucrats who take the blame if something fails, she said. “Now we have a populist regime that has created a leader that can’t do wrong,” Pai said. “He has this way of speaking like a godman.” Controlling the Narrative Modi has shown he can turn upheaval into political gains. In 2016, his move to abruptly withdraw 86% of circulating currency with four hours notice led to prolonged cash shortages and an economic slowdown that caused hardship across India. Still, his party won a key state in a landslide just months later as his party told voters it helped rein in corruption and tax evasion -- even though it ultimately failed to achieve its goal. Part of his success is an ability to control the narrative. Modi hasn’t held a single press conference as prime minister during his six years in power, instead reaching out to the masses directly through a weekly radio program as well as posts on Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. His party’s social media army has effectively deflected blame for problems, including to opposition parties. “Modi’s ability to reach his message directly to individuals is unsurpassable,” said Neelanjan Sircar, assistant professor at Ashoka University and senior visiting fellow at Center for Policy Research. “I am increasingly convinced of the connection between creating of a powerful charismatic leader and a media-controlled narrative. How do you build trust in somebody? You keep telling stories that build his credibility.” As India’s Covid-19 outbreak became one of the fastest-growing in the world, Modi shared a carefully choreographed video in August featuring him feeding peacocks in his official New Delhi residence during his morning exercise regime. That kind of imagery has helped cement an image of Modi as “a monk-like ascetic who can be trusted with one’s life,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst who has written a biography on Modi. Sahebrao Patil, a 60-year-old driver in Maharashtra who suffered a loss of income after the lockdown, is among those who say Modi can do no wrong. “I believe with all my heart that Modi cannot lie,” he said. “We don’t even ask who’s the candidate. We just vote for Modi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-modi-s-still-so-popular-even-as-india-fails-to-fight-coronavirus-905408.html

"The policy will have everything that Satcom does in terms of protecting assets, creation of assets, monitoring and communication," Dr K Sivan said, adding that the changes are aimed at encouraging the private sector and enhancing national security capabilities. The policy proposes measures to monitor the use of space assets for communication to or from Indian territory, along with listing steps to bring in more assets under India's control to enhance its ability to utilise space-based communication for national needs. Sivan said that India will soon have specific policies on launch vehicles, navigation, remote sensing and human spaceflight, and national space policy. The draft says that private companies can establish telemetry, earth stations and satellite control centres in or outside India. Companies can also offer the capacity to commercial and societal communications within India as well as outside India, along with supplying their systems and solutions to international markets. According to the draft, companies can avail Indian and non-Indian orbital resources through either designated entities under the Department of Space on a commercial basis or through the new norms. However, Satcom programmes focusing on societal development, such as tribal development, health, education and disaster management, will remain under the purview of the Department of Space.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/private-companies-may-soon-be-allowed-to-launch-satellites-report-905448.html

Reaching out to the people of West Bengal during the state's biggest festival, the Prime Minister said though it was being celebrated on a limited scale due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the "enthusiasm is still unlimited". Noting that Goddess Durga was worshipped as a symbol of 'Shakti' (strength), Modi said his government was consistently working for the empowerment of women. "From opening Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women, giving soft loans to them under the Mudra Yojana, to launching Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative, granting permanent commission to women in the armed forces and extending maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, we have taken a number of steps for their empowerment," he told a gathering at Durga Puja celebration organised by the BJP. He also said anti-rape laws were made more stringent to include death penalty. "We are alert towards the security of women," he said. The Prime Minister's remark came in the backdrop of a string of incidents of rape and murder of women, including the Hathras incident that shocked the nation and triggered outrage against the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. The Prime Minister recalled the contributions of reformers from Bengal like Ram Mohun Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, spiritual leaders Ramkrishna Paramhans and Swami Vivekananda, cultural giant Rabindranath Tagore, and revolutionaries like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Khudiram Bose in shaping India's national identity. Durga Puja, he said, was the epitome of pluralism and reflected the collective strength of India. The BJP had made elaborate arrangements for live viewing of the Prime Minister's virtual address from the national capital. The event was televised live at over 78,000 polling booths across the state's 294 assembly constituencies. Assembly polls are likely in West Bengal around April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-narendra-modi-reaffirms-commitment-to-women-empowerment-in-virtual-durga-puja-address-905475.html

Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Secretary Ajay Sawhney wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, conveying strong disapproval of the government over misrepresentation of the map of India. The IT secretary, in his letter, has reminded Twitter that Leh is the headquarter of Union Territory of Ladakh and both Ladakh as well as Jammu and Kashmir are integral and inalienable parts of India, governed by the Constitution of India. The government had asked Twitter to respect the sensitivities of Indian citizens and has also made it clear that any attempt by Twitter to disrespect sovereignty and integrity of India, which is also reflected by the maps, is totally unacceptable and unlawful. Earlier, Twitter had shown geo-location of Leh in Jammu and Kashmir, People’s Republic of China. Issuing a stern warning, the IT secretary has said that such attempts not only bring disrepute to Twitter but also raise questions about its neutrality and fairness as an intermediary. Reacting to the government letter, Twitter said, “Twitter remains committed to working with the Government of India. We respect the sensitivities involved and have duly acknowledged the letter." National Security Analyst Nitin Gokhale, who had gone live on Twitter near the Leh in Ladakh on 18 October, had said that his map location displayed Jammu and Kashmir, People’s Republic of China. Ladakh was carved out from Jammu and Kashmir and granted the union territory status on August 5 last year when the centre scrapped the special status and split it into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Leh is headquartered of Ladakh Union territory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-govt-warns-twitter-for-showing-leh-as-part-of-china-905487.html

If the validity of such visas has expired, fresh visas of appropriate categories can be obtained from the Indian Mission/Posts concerned. Foreign nationals intending to visit India for medical treatment can apply for a Medical Visa, including for their medical attendants. "This decision will enable foreign nationals to come to India for various purposes such as business, conferences, employment, studies, research, medical purposes etc," an official statement said. All such travellers will, however, have to strictly adhere to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare regarding quarantine and other health/Covid-19 matters. The government had taken a series of steps to curtail the inward and outward movement of international passengers since February 2020. It has now decided to make a graded relaxation in visa and travel restrictions for more categories of foreign nationals and Indian nationals who wish to enter or leave India. Earlier on August 18, the government had allowed re-entry of foreign journalists, who had left the country and could not return due to restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, if they have a valid visa. Prior to that on August 7, the government had allowed Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card holders from the United States, Germany, France, and Kuwait with which India entered into an "air bubble" agreement. In June, the government had relaxed visa rules further to allow minor foreign nationals whose one of the parents is an Indian national or an OCI cardholder and foreign nationals married to Indian citizens among others to fly into the country. Foreign nationals who are single parents of minor children holding Indian passports or OCI cards and students who are foreign nationals with at least one of their parents is an Indian citizen or OCI cardholder were also allowed to enter the country in June. India had on May 22 allowed minor children born to Indian nationals abroad and holding OCI cards and OCI cardholders who wish to come to India on account of family emergencies like a death in family were allowed to travel to India/ Similarly, couples where one spouse is an OCI cardholder and the other is an Indian national and they have a permanent residence in India as well as university students who are OCI cardholders (not legally minors) but whose parents are Indian citizens living in India were also allowed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-eases-visa-restrictions-allows-oci-pio-foreigners-to-visit-india-905495.html

The seven-year-old boy was kidnapped on October 14 from an area under Ganha police station limits in Bihar's Champaran district, the official from Mumbai police said. On October 19, his family members got a call for ransom of Rs 20 lakh, failing which the caller threatened to kill the boy. While conducting a probe into the case, the Bihar police come to know the ransom call was made from Kandivali in Mumbai, the official said. The Bihar police then contacted the Mumbai police and with their help, the accused, Riyasuddin Ansari, was arrested from suburban Kandivali on Tuesday, he said. On the basis of the accused's call detail records, the Bihar police also come to know he was in constant touch with three other persons -- Khan Muhammad Ansari (35), Alauddin Ansari (22) and Muslim Ansari (35) -- who were also arrested from Bihar. The accused revealed that Muslim Ansari had kept the boy in a forest area under Padrauna police station limits in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar district, from where he was rescued by police, the official said. The conspiracy to kidnap the boy was hatched by Khan Muhammad Ansari, as he was under debt and wanted to get money by seeking ransom, the official said, adding that all the accused were well known to the boy's family members. Accused Riyasuddin Ansari, who was arrested from Mumbai, was handed over to the Bihar police on Wednesday, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/maharashtra-bihar-cops-come-together-to-solve-kidnapping-case-of-boy-905497.html

The benefits range from lowering maternal deaths and improving nutrition levels in the near term to putting more girls in college and enabling women to achieve greater financial independence in the long-term, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, an economist with SBI, wrote in a report to clients Thursday. “This is clear from the data,” Ghosh said. “The working age population increases with high marriage age.” While the mean female marriage age in India is already above 21 years, about 35% of are married before then, with the current legal limit at 18 years, according to SBI. India is home to every third child bride in the world, with more than 100 million getting married even before turning 15, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund. Marriage at a young age means not even a quarter of women in India get into the labor force despite accounting for almost half of the 1.3 billion population. Women earn 35% less on average than men, compared to the global average of a 16% gap. A government panel is looking at the right marriageable age for women in India, with Modi saying a decision would be taken soon. This would be the first revision in more than four decades and put India in the league of Asian peers such as China, Japan and Singapore. The marriage age for women in India might be raised to 21 years, the same as for men, according to Ghosh, who sees the number of women graduates rising as much as 7 percentage points from 9.8% at present. “The move will have other legal and psychological benefits also,” Ghosh said. “Any ground-level change will only happen when the psyche of people alter.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/big-gains-in-india-seen-from-higher-legal-marriage-age-of-women-905510.html

More than 2.5 lakh coronavirus patients have recovered from the infection in the state. A holistic approach is required for follow up care and well-being of all patients who have recovered from Covid-19, Additional Chief Secretary P K Mohapatra said. Quoting the advisory, Mohapatra said if health permits, regular household work can be done. However, professional work will be resumed in a graded manner. "Daily practice of yogasana, pranayama and meditation, as much as health permits or as prescribed" is advised, he said on Wednesday. Those who have recovered from Covid-19 may expect cardiovascular, pulmonary and other neurological and endocrinological sequelae, Mohapatra said. He said that recovered people need to continue with Covid-19 safety measures like wearing masks, washing hands, maintaining respiratory hygiene and physical distancing. They have been asked to drink adequate amounts of warm water (if not contraindicated), take immunity-boosting AYUSH medicines prescribed by a qualified practitioner of AYUSH, he said. Daily morning or evening walk at a comfortable pace, balanced nutritious diet, and adequate sleep and rest are advised. The advisory also suggested that Covid recovered persons should avoid smoking and consuming alcohol. They have been advised to look for early warning signs such as high grade fever, breathlessness and unexplained chest pain. Recovered individuals have also been advised to share their positive experiences with their friends using social media and community and religious leaders for creating awareness and dispelling myths and stigma.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/odisha-govt-advises-yoga-pranayama-for-recovered-covid-19-patients-905518.html

"The missile was integrated with the actual warhead and a tank target (a discarded Vijayant tank) was kept at the designated range. The missile hit the target accurately, defeating the armour," the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said in a statement. The trial was conducted at Pokhran (Rajasthan) early in the morning. The anti-tank guided missile, with a range of 4 km, has been developed to engage highly fortified enemy tanks in day and night conditions. Named after former DRDO chief B D Nagchaudhuri, the home-grown weapon is a third-generation anti-tank guided missile with fire-and-forget and top-attack capabilities to effectively engage and destroy all known types of battle tanks during day and night. The missile has passive homing guidance to defeat all types of tanks equipped with composite and reactive armour. In 2018, the Defence Ministry approved a Rs 524-core package to purchase more than 300 missiles and 25 of its launchers (Nag missile carrier, NAMICA) for the Indian Army.   With the final user trial over, Nag will enter the production phase. The missile will be produced by defence public sector undertaking Bharat Dynamics Limited, whereas the ordnance factory, Medak, will produce its launcher, which is a BMP-II based system with amphibious capability.   Nag is one of the five missiles planned in the integrated guided missile programme initiated by former DRDO chief A P J Abdul Kalam in 1983. Three of the five missiles - Agni, Prithvi and Akash - are being used by the armed forces, while the Trishul project was shut down in 2008.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/final-user-trial-of-nag-anti-tank-missile-successfully-completed-drdo-905519.html

The two sides are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh. The United States, which antagonised Beijing this week by approving the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, has also been pushing for stronger security ties with India to help balance China's growing regional influence. US companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet discussed the final draft of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation on Wednesday, an Indian government source said. An accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data, a defence industry source said. It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India, the defence source said. "It is a foundational agreement, which the US has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability," the source said. India has traditionally been hesitant about getting drawn into a US-led security alliance and antagonising China. But tensions have risen dramatically with China this summer, erupting into a clash between border troops in the western Himalayas. This week New Delhi agreed to invite Australia into next month's naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, disregarding concerns it would anger China, which sees such a grouping as directed against it. "In tandem, the moves signal a new level of strategic convergence between the two democracies and a break from India's 'non-aligned' past," said Jeff Smith, a South Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, about the proposed pact. Already there is robust intelligence sharing between US and India, particularly about Chinese activity in the region, a second government official said. This includes information on PLA deployments on the Indian border and also Chinese maritime activity, including its deep water fishing fleets, which have caused friction between Beijing and other countries. "They are sharing a large amount of data," said the official.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-us-set-for-military-pact-on-satellite-data-during-mike-pompeo-mark-esper-visit-905540.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde, A S Bopanna, and V Ramasubramanian issued notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice and various high courts on the plea. “Issue notice returnable in four weeks,” the bench said. The apex court was hearing a petition filed by Youth Bar Association of India and advocate Sanpreet Singh Ajmani which suggested that alternate and pre-litigation processes be made mandatory to reduce pendency of cases in various courts. According to the petition, the use of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms will help to control frivolous matters coming up for hearing by giving an opportunity to parties to settle their disputes amicably before any litigation can start. The plea contended that pre-litigation mediation is an attempt to resolve the dispute among the parties amicably with the help of neutral third party called Mediator before going to the court or even before filing litigation or sending a notice.  “It gives a chance to both the parties to end the dispute in a win-win position. In it, issues can be sorted out sooner and this process is inexpensive compared to the expenditure incurred at every stage of the case/issues in litigation.  “To reduce the number of pending cases, the Government should work on a mechanism to introduce a pre-litigation mediation process, so that avoidable cases can be prevented from reaching the courts and settle the issue effectively,” the plea said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-for-sop-mandating-pre-litigation-mediation-905544.html

The daily positivity rate is reported to be 3.8 per cent.  "The decrease in the daily positivity rate is simultaneously mapped by the falling active cases, which continue to be under 7.5 lakh as on date," the ministry said. "India's trend of steadily decreasing active cases of coronavirus infections continues and they have sustained below 10 per cent of the total caseload for the last three days suggesting only 1 in 10 cases are active Covid-19 patients across the country," the ministry said. The total recovered cases are close to 69 lakhs and exceed active cases by 61,58,706.  A total of 79,415 patients have recovered and discharged in a span of 24 hours whereas 55,839 infections were reported during the period. The national recovery rate has progressed to 89.20 per cent, the ministry said. Eighty-one per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs. Maharashtra has contributed more than 23,000 to the single-day recovery.

The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and the International Press Institute (IPI) also asked Modi to direct the state governments to drop all charges against journalists, including those under the draconian sedition laws, "that have been imposed on them for their work”. The IPI is a global network of editors, media executives, and leading journalists for press freedom while the IFJ is a global federation of national journalists’ unions and associations. In their letter, IPI Deputy Director Scott Griffen and IFJ General Secretary Anthony Bellanger expressed their "grave concern over the increasing use" of sedition charges against journalists in the country, the recent one being the case of sedition filed by the Uttar Police against Malayali journalist Siddique Kappan, who was trying to reach the family of Hathras gang-rape victim. The letter also cited the cases of Face of Nation editor Dhaval Patel, who published a report about possible leadership change in Gujarat, and Bhumkal Samachar editor Kamal Shukla, who shared a cartoon referring to the rejecting petitions for investigations into the mysterious death of a judge Brijgopal Loya. It also referred to the case against veteran journalist Vinod Dua for his broadcast blaming the government on its Covid-19 preparedness and making allegations against Modi. "We find it extremely disturbing that governments in different states of India are attempting to stifle press freedom by filing cases against journalists under different sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 124A. The number of cases filed against journalists have increased enormously after the spread of the pandemic," the joint letter said. Quoting a report by Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG), the letter said that as many as 55 journalists were targeted for covering the pandemic in India between March 25, when the lockdown was first imposed, and May 31. The health crisis is being used as an excuse to silence those who have exposed shortcoming in the government’s response to it, while on the contrary, it is important for both citizens and the public authorities to have factual information about the situation in order to best respond to the pandemic, it said. Asserting that free media is essential to a successful public health response, it added that democracy in India can remain strong only when the media is free to report and shine a light on issues that need urgent attention of the government. "We urge you (Modi) to take immediate steps to ensure that journalists can work without any harassment and fear of reprisal from the government. We also call on you to direct the state governments to drop all charges against journalists, including those under the draconian sedition laws, that have been imposed on them for their work," the letter added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ipi-ifj-urge-modi-to-prevent-increasing-use-of-sedition-laws-against-journalists-905572.html

Lieutenant Divya Sharma, who hails from Malviya Nagar in New Delhi; Lt Shubhangi Swaroop from Tilhar, Uttar Pradesh; and Lt Shivangi from Muzaffarpur, Bihar; are the three women officers now qualified to fly the Dorniers in all operational missions. They are part of half a dozen naval aviators, who completed the Dornier Operational Flying Training course and graduated as ‘Fully operational Maritime Reconnaissance Pilots. The passing out ceremony was held at INS Garuda, Kochi. The officers underwent basic flying training partly with Indian Air Force and partly with the Navy before the DOFT course. Amongst the three women pilots operationalised for maritime reconnaissance flying, Lt Shivangi was the first to qualify as a naval pilot in December 2019, an Indian Navy spokesperson said in a statement. This comes a month after two other women officers of the Indian Navy got their wings to serve as observers in naval choppers, making them the first women officers to operate from a warship. The Dornier flying course comprises one month of the ground training phase, at some of the professional schools and eight months of flying training at the Dornier Squadron (INAS 550) of the Southern Naval Command. In fact, Lt Divya Sharma was adjudged ‘First in Flying’ while her coursemate Lt Shivam Pandey was adjudged ‘First in Ground'. Since 2016, the IAF inducted 10 women fighter pilots, including Flt Lt Shivangi Singh, who would fly the IAF's most modern Rafale combat jets. As of February 2020, the Indian Navy has 527 women officers whereas IAF and Indian Army has 1,601 and 1,648 of them respectively. The number of women officers recruited by the Navy in 2017, 2018, and 2019 is 57, 38, and 54 respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/navys-first-batch-of-three-women-pilots-ready-for-maritime-reconnaissance-mission-on-dornier-aircraft-905585.html

Objecting to the intention of Netflix, the spokesperson of Sahara India Pariwar said, "the whole film is a bundle of lie, manipulating and ill-conceived which is an attempt made by Netflix to tarnish the image of Sahara". Sahara Group said the series has wrongly mentioned that Sahara is in the business of chit fund. In addition, the group said the film has very wrongfully alleged that its depositors are not genuine. "This is completely wrong. We were never, and we are never a chit fund company. Since the beginning, we were under regulation of Registrar of Firms Societies, under the regulation of Reserve Bank for 21 years, worked long years under Ministry of Corporate Affairs and now our workers have promoted and are running cooperative societies under the regulation of Ministry of Agriculture," Sahara Group said in a statement. Besides, Sahara Group said not a single rupee has been forfeited in any of the schemes of Sahara whether the account continues or discontinued.  "It is said in the film that agents stop going to the village and when the account is discontinued, account holder gets a letter of the amount being forfeited which is absurd and wrongfully maligns Sahara Group's image," Sahara Group said. On the issue of re-investment, Sahara said “Netflix, in the film tried to paint a negative image of Sahara on the reinvestment aspect. Throughout the world, in all financial institutions including banks and, in the companies, where agents are promoting business-like in life insurance, etc. the reinvestment is always done in a big way. In our case around 40 per cent is reinvested." Calling the series ill-researched and away from facts, Sahara Group has demanded that the film be immediately banned throughout the world and Netflix should be asked to take the factual correct information, which should be incorporated and changed in the film and then to be exhibited. With regard to fooling depositors for many years, Sahara Group said its "an absolutely wrong allegation that we were fooling the investors in beginning years and then we were /are unable to repay. We are regularly repaying though in some cases delayed payments are done but we are paying interest of the delayed period up to the last day".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sahara-group-demands-ban-on-netflix-series-bad-boys-billionaire-905599.html

Doctors from five different Delhi hospitals told Reuters they have received twice the number of patients with respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis in the past two weeks. Dust and smoke fill Delhi's air every winter, making breathing difficult for adults and children alike. Government data reviewed by Reuters shows that air quality this October has been worse than in the same month in 2019 and 2018. "Pollutants have an inflammatory effect on the lungs and so does Covid-19," said Dhiren Gupta, a pulmonologist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in the city, which has reported more than 340,000 coronavirus cases. "We are getting more cases with respiratory issues but we have to run Covid-19 tests on them too," said Hema Gupta Mittal, a senior pediatrician at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Delhi had a record spell of clean air earlier this year after the government imposed a strict nationwide lockdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak but air quality has deteriorated in the last two months. In October, the air quality index (AQI) has averaged a "poor" 227 on a scale of 500, well above the "safe" limit of 60. The index measures the concentration of pollutants finer than 2.5 microns in diameter that can reach deep into the lungs and cause deadly diseases including cancer and cardiac problems. Delhi's Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the government was working to clear the toxic air by restricting construction and other dust-raising activities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/doctors-in-delhi-see-jump-in-breathing-issues-amid-covid-19-pollution-905603.html

The Press Association, a body of Press Information Bureau accredited journalists, also condemned the "abrupt sealing" of the Srinagar office of Kashmir Times newspaper and demanded its immediate opening. In a statement, the Guild said that newspapers and magazines in the undivided state of Jammu and Kashmir were already ravaged by conflict with editors and correspondents working against "difficult odds". It said that the Guild considers the action of the state administration against Kashmir Times as "vindictive and injurious not just" to Kashmir Times, but also to the entire free media in the region. It also added that the newspaper editor Anuradha Bhasin and other staff have been denied access to records, computers, furniture, and equipment in the office. "The Guild calls upon the government of Jammu and Kashmir to restore status quo, and to create circumstances in which media can function without hindrance and without fear," the statement said. The Guild reminded that publications have "steadily lost" advertising over the last decade and the communication shutdowns, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown have totally stopped the trickle of revenue. It said that the online editions are crippled by the slow internet speed imposed by the government. "The Kashmir Times, a 55-year-old publication, was forced to shut down its Srinagar edition in March," it said. Instead of assisting the media, which was "most needed in these dark times", the Guild said the administration without any notice took control of the office of the newspaper, "putting its lock" on the door. Demanding immediate opening of the Kashmir Times office to allow the journalists to carry on their professional duty, the Press Association said in a separate statement, "at the same time the state administration should bring the ''erring'' officials to book. Law of the land should take its own course and a renowned newspaper office should not be sealed in this way." "According to Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of the newspaper, no notice was given for the sealing," it said. The government was "targeting" her for speaking against the administration and moving the Supreme Court against media restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre abrogated the erstwhile state''s special status under Article 370 in August 2019, the statement quoted Bhasin as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/editors-guild-demands-reversal-of-sealing-of-kashmir-times-office-905619.html

Here are the top stories of October 22, 2020: Union Finance Minister and BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday released BJP's manifesto in Patna for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections. In the manifesto, the saffron party has promised free Covid-19 vaccine to all in the state. It has also promised jobs to 19 lakh people in Bihar. The BJP drew sharp flak shortly after it released its manifesto. Taking swipe at the BJP, the Congress mockingly tweeted, “If you had delivered on the promise of 2 crore jobs earlier, then there would have been no need for fresh 19 lakh jobs.” The RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said that since the BJP had no face in Bihar, it had to ask Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to release the vision document (as BJP’s manifesto is known). “NDA manifesto promises free vaccine for Biharis. With this poll promise @bjp4india has implied that the citizens of other non-election states will have to pay for the vaccine,” tweeted Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday said that he has tested positive for Covid-19 and was undergoing treatment, while also asserting that his parameters were fine and he was looking forward to hitting the campaign trail soon in the poll-bound state. Active cases of Covid-19 in India have remained below 10 per cent of the total caseload for the last three days suggesting that only 1 in 10 cases are active coronavirus patients, the Union Health Ministry said The daily positivity rate has also been maintained at less than 5 per cent over the past three days.  The government has shot off a stern letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, conveying its strong disapproval over misrepresentation of the Indian map, and asserted that any attempt by the micro-blogging platform to disrespect the country's sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable. Earlier, Twitter had shown geo-location of Leh in Jammu and Kashmir, People's Republic of China. India on Thursday decided to restore all existing visas, except electronic, tourist, and medical categories, with immediate effect as part of its strategy to provide graded relaxation in travel restrictions from abroad, eight months after its suspension due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also allowed Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) and Person of Indian Origin (PIO) cardholders and all other foreign nationals to visit India for any purpose, except on a tourist visa, to enter by air or water routes through authorised airports and seaport immigration check posts. BMTC has started yet another trial run of the electric bus as part of the long-delayed process of hiring 300 e-buses. The 12-metre lenght air-conditioned e-bus, provided by Olectra Greentech Ltd, has 34+1 passenger seats and can run up to 200 to 250 km in a single charge, which takes about three hours. The BMTC expects that covering relatively long distance without having to go for multiple charge will help in optimum utilisation of the bus. The vehicle also has a provision to support a wheel chair for specially-abled and senior citizens.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-bjp-promises-free-coronavirus-vaccine-to-all-in-bihar-sushil-kumar-modi-tests-positive-for-covid-19-905622.html

22-10-2020||National||India has set aside Rs 50,000 crore to vaccinate world’s second biggest population||The government has set aside about Rs 500 billion ($7 billion) to vaccinate the world’s most populous country after China against the coronavirus, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration estimates an all-in cost of about $6-$7 per person in the nation of 1.3 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. The money provisioned so far is for the current financial year ending March 31 and there will be no shortage of further funds for this purpose, they added. A Finance Ministry spokesman couldn’t immediately be reached when tried on his mobile. “I doubt that the marginal cost of a vaccine would be anything close to that number at the volumes that India will purchase. There’s one large buyer -- India -- and one large seller, potentially,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, which has offices in Washington and New Delhi. “A lot will come down to negotiations and the government has a lot more power in these situations.” Adar Poonawalla, head of the Serum Institute of India Pvt., the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, has predicted the nation would need about 800 billion rupees to procure and inoculate people living everywhere from the Himalayas to the remote Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Apart from buying the treatment, transporting them from manufacturing sites would be a massive undertaking. Delivering a vaccine across India “will be a gigantic task,” Mahesh Devnani, an associate professor at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, said Wednesday on a webinar. “We need a prioritization plan, everyone cannot have it initially.” By one estimate, airlifting single-dose regimens to protect the world’s population would require space in about 8,000 cargo planes. The biggest challenge for India will be building up cold-chain logistics to distribute vaccines across India in a short period of time, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, the founder, and chairman of Biocon Ltd., said at the Bloomberg India Economic Forum last week. “I do hope by the end of November that we are able to say we have a plan” and digital platforms to help roll out vaccines, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-has-set-aside-rs-50000-crore-to-vaccinate-world-s-second-biggest-population-905653.html

US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper will visit India on October 26 and 27 for the high-level dialogue aimed at further boosting defence, security and global strategic ties between the two countries. The Indian side at the talks will be represented by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. "The third ministerial dialogue will entail comprehensive cross-cutting bilateral issues of mutual interests. In addition, both sides will also exchange views on regional and international issues," MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing. He said Pompeo and Esper will have bilateral meetings with their Indian counterparts as well. "They will also be meeting the National Security Advisor. There will be a joint call on the prime minister," Srivastava said. Asked why the talks have been scheduled just days ahead of the US presidential election, Srivastava said: "Diplomatic calendars have their logic. Earlier two meetings were also held towards the end of the year." Specifically asked about key issues to be discussed, the MEA spokesperson said the talks will cover all "salient regional and global issues" as the partnership between the two countries is a comprehensive global one. The high-level talks are taking place in the midst of India's festering border row with China in eastern Ladakh as well as renewed global focus on growing Chinese military muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific region. Both the issues are expected to figure in the talks. The first edition of the two-plus-two dialogue was held in Delhi in September 2018 after the mechanism was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. The second edition of the dialogue took place in Washington in December last year. The new framework of the ministerial dialogue was initiated in order to provide a forward-looking vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bilateral-regional-and-global-issues-to-figure-in-india-us-dialogue-905658.html

22-10-2020||National||Hathras controversy: Aligarh Muslim University to extend tenure of 'terminated' doctors||The Aligarh Muslim University has agreed to extend the tenure of two Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College doctors, whose services were allegedly "terminated" for their remarks in connection with the case of alleged gang-rape and death of a Dalit woman in Hathras. "On the request of the Chief Medical officer of the hospital, received on Wednesday, the university has given its nod to the proposal to extend the tenure of the two doctors," AMU spokesperson Omar Saleem Peerzada said over the phone from Aligarh on Thursday. The order ending the contract of the two doctors -- Dr Mohamnad Azeemudin and Dr Obaid Imtiaz -- was issued by Chief Medical Officer S A Zaidi on Tuesday, a day after the CBI team probing the gang-rape and death case visited the hospital. The AMU authorities have denied the allegations of termination as "highly speculative" and said the two doctors were engaged "on a temporary one-month vacancy from September 9". The Resident Doctors Association (RDA) had written a letter to the AMU Vice-Chancellor on Wednesday and urged him to take immediate steps to withdraw the termination order. The letter signed by RDA president Mohammad Hamza Malik and general secretary Mohammad Kaashif stated that the action against the two doctors smacked of "vendetta politics" and was aimed at muzzling the right to freedom of expression. The two doctors told reporters on Tuesday that "they were quite taken aback by this step because they had not been given a chance to present their view to the authorities." In response to a query by media persons, the two doctors had hinted that they might have paid a price for giving their opinion to some journalists who had visited the hospital in connection to the Hathras case. The 19-year-old woman, who was assaulted and allegedly raped by four men, was under treatment at the hospital before being referred to Delhi. She died at a Delhi hospital later. Reported comments of one of the doctors contradicted the Uttar Pradesh Police's stand that the FSL report in the case found no traces of sperm, indicating that there was no rape. The doctor had reportedly claimed the FSL report had no evidentiary value as samples were collected 11 days after the crime. Meanwhile, President of the Progressive Medicos and Scientific Forum (PMSF ) Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti also wrote to the AMU Vice Chancellor, demanding the "revocation of the termination order of two the Medical officers". The letter, which was sent by mail on Thursday, states that it appears that the two doctors have "paid the price for providing factually correct and scientifically sound information pertaining to the samples of the Hathras rape victim " The letter states that it is unfortunate that "the two doctors have been punished because their version contradicts the police version"  of the alleged gang-rape. The letter states that this episode comes at a time when universities across the country are "struggling hard to defend democratic values and the fundamental rights"  of freedom of expression.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-controversy-aligarh-muslim-university-to-extend-tenure-of-terminated-doctors-905688.html
22-10-2020||National||India underlines Pakistan failed to fulfil 6 key mandates of FATF||India on Thursday underlined that Pakistan had not yet implemented as many as six of the 27 action points the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had prescribed after grey-listing it in 2018 for its lax legal mechanism to detect and stop the flow of funds to terrorist organizations. The FATF, which is currently holding its plenary virtually, will on Friday formally make public the outcome of its assessment of the Pakistan Government’s progress in implementing the 27-point action plan suggested by it in June 2018. New Delhi pointed out that the Pakistan Government had so far made progress on 21 of the 27 action plans suggested to it by the inter-governmental organisation set up to coordinate global efforts to squeeze flow of funds to the terrorist organizations and stop money-laundering. “Six important action items are yet to be addressed (by the Government of Pakistan),” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said in New Delhi. “As is well known, Pakistan continues to provide safe havens to terrorist entities and individuals and has also not yet taken any action against several terrorist entities and individuals including those proscribed by the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) such as Masood Azhar, Dawood Ibrahim and Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi.” The FATF in 2018 has put Pakistan in its “grey-list” – officially a list of “jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in its legal regime to check money laundering and terrorist financing”. The Government of Pakistan and the FATF by June 2018 agreed on an action to plug the loopholes. The FATF had in October 2019 set February 2020 as the deadline for Pakistan to deliver on its promises to plug the loopholes in its legal framework to squeeze flow of funds to the terrorist outfits. The intergovernmental organisation warned that if Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Government failed to deliver on its commitment, Pakistan might be put on its “black-list” - officially the list “jurisdictions with strategic AML / CFT (Anti Money-Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism) deficiencies for which a call of action applies”. But even as Pakistan failed to fully implement the June 2028 action-plan, the FATF plenary in February this year decided against putting the country on the “black-list” and give it time till the next plenary, which started earlier this week and would conclude on Friday. “(The) FATF has well laid out standards and procedures for putting a country in its Black List and Grey List,” said Srivastava, adding: “After a country is put on a list, an action plan is given to it and the country concerned is expected to fully complete the action plan within the stipulated time.” "Those found wanting in implementing their obligations are held accountable and subjected to appropriate action,” said the MEA spokesperson. Sources told the DH in New Delhi that the FATF might on Friday give the Government of Pakistan time till June 2021 to implement the six pending action points.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-underlines-pakistan-failed-to-fulfil-6-key-mandates-of-fatf-905696.html
22-10-2020||National||JEE (Main) to be conducted in regional languages from 2021||The Centre on Thursday announced that the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) will be conducted in more regional languages from next year in addition to Hindi, English and Gujarati. Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said in line with the vision of National Education Policy-2020, the Joint Admission Board of JEE (Main) has decided to conduct the examination in more regional languages of India. Nishank, however, did not specify the languages in which the examinations will be held. The Minister said, “The decision of the Joint Admission Board will help students comprehend questions better and score higher”. At present, the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to medical courses is conducted in regional languages apart from Hindi and English. Students can appear for NEET in Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. The decision came after a row over the exclusion of other languages for JEE (Main) and conducting the test only in Gujarati. Nishank, on Thursday, said that the JEE Main will be conducted in “regional languages where entry to state engineering colleges is decided based on an examination conducted in regional language”. Nishank also said this decision will have far-reaching implications as “top-scoring countries in PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) examination use mother tongue as a medium of instruction”. According to officials in the NTA, the decision to add more languages in the list for JEE Main was taken after requests from states. The JEE (Main) was started in 2013 with the idea to grant admission to engineering colleges across states through a common test. However, only Maharashtra and Gujarat governments had then agreed to admit students in their engineering colleges through JEE (Main), prompting the National Testing Agency (NTA) to issue question papers in Marathi, Urdu and Gujarati, as requested by the states. In 2016, both the states opted out of the JEE, but the Gujarat government requested the NTA to continue providing question papers in Gujarati for its students.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jee-main-to-be-conducted-in-regional-languages-from-2021-905699.html

It also said that it was trying to provide the required assistance to the labourers. “This mission is in constant touch with Somalian government for the immediate rescue of 33 Indian labourers from Mogadishu, Somalia. We are in touch with the labourers also for getting them the assistance needed, at the earliest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Somalia has assured that arrangements will be made for these people to visit India soon," the Commission tweeted in Hindi on Wednesday in reply to a tweet by activist Rajesh Mani. Rajesh Mani of Manav Seva Sansthan said 33 Indian labourers, including 25 workers from Uttar Pradesh, have been held hostage by a company in Somalia for the last eight months. He said the matter came to his knowledge after a labourer from Kushinagar district contacted him. The activist said he took to Twitter to contact the Indian High Commission in Kenya to seek help. "I contacted the Indian High Commission in Kenya and the external affairs ministry through Twitter and e-mail. They gave assurance of helping the labourers," he said. Mani said out of the 33 labourers held hostage, 21 belong to Gorakhpur division. Six of the labourers are from Bihar and one each from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, he said. According to the activist, the labourers had joined the company 10 months ago. In the first two months, the company treated them well, but from the last eight months, the workers were not paid their salaries, he said. “On Tuesday, one Sugreev Kushwaha of Kushinagar contacted me through WhatsApp, and told me that 33 Indian labourers were living in difficult conditions as the company at Mogadishu in Somalia, where they were working, had made them hostage in the factory campus. He said they have not been paid from the last eight months. He also sent me a video clip showing their condition,” Mani said. “When the labourers demanded their salary, the company made them hostage inside the factory campus, took their passports and threatened to shoot them. They have also not been given food, water and medicines since the last 15 days. The labourers have been confined to their rooms and kept hungry and thirsty. The company is treating them like bonded labourers,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/33-indian-labourers-held-hostage-by-somalian-company-high-commission-trying-to-resolve-crisis-905710.html

He said that India and China continued to have discussions through both diplomatic and military channels to peacefully resolve the stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh – in keeping with the agreement reached between the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their meeting in Moscow on September 10. “The immediate task is to ensure a comprehensive disengagement of troops in all the friction areas,” said the MEA spokesperson. The diplomats of the two sides had five rounds of video-conferences under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and coordination on India-China Border Affairs or the WMCC, which was instituted in 2013. The senior military commanders also had seven rounds of talks on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two nations – with the last being held on October 12.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-remains-engaged-with-china-to-find-mutually-acceptable-solution-905718.html

On page 23 of the study, the ICMR itself admits that reliable tests to gauge neutralising antibodies in a plasma sample were not available in India when the study was launched (on April 22). Big mistake Dr Rao said he has strongly denounced in writing the Centre’s decision to pull the plug on “the only science” which works on Covid-19. He admitted that there was a need for scrutiny on what type of antibodies and what dosages need to be given to patients. “These are answers which are emerging but in the interim, the Centre must continue to offer plasma therapies,” hesaid. Dr R Sreelatha, head of the Transfusion Medicine Department in Victoria Hospital, one the first entities in the state to conduct convalescent plasma trials, said unequivocally that the therapy works. “The time-frame of administration is important. It is most efficacious when oxygen saturation is not yet below 92%,” she said. Another authoritative expert who did not want to be named heaped further scepticism on the study, saying its conclusions cannot be trusted.  Dr Rao pointed to the fact that the study had failed to note the percentage of NAb (neutralising antibody) titers, whether they were high, moderate or low.  A titer is a laboratory test that measures the presence and amount of antibodies in the blood. “Optimum titers play a pivotal role in the success of plasma therapy. The study does not mention percentages,” Dr Rao said. He also pointed to a recent study of 42 Indian Covid-19 patients by Emory University in the United States. Researchers discovered that while 90.47% of patients had developed an IgG response, only half of them had appreciable Covid-neutralizing antibody titers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/experts-denounce-scrapping-of-plasma-therapy-905733.html

The phase-3 trial is likely to be conducted on more than one thousand individuals to find if the vaccine offers any lasting protection. Named Covaxin, the vaccine is made from an ineffective strain of the Covid-19 virus isolated at the National Institute of Virology, Pune. The Drugs Controller General of India had approved the phase-3 trial on October 20 based on the results of the phase-I/II trial and animal studies. The regulator asked the company to be extra careful in picking up the right candidates as the recipient of the vaccine. Numerous such vaccines, including the shots for seasonal influenza, Polio, Pertussis, Rabies and Japanese Encephalitis, use the same technology. Once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves the immune system as a dead virus to mount an antibody response towards the virus. New treatment option Meanwhile, Pune-based Serum Institute of India has joined hands with the International AIDS vaccine Initiative and pharmaceutical giant Merck to produce a type of monoclonal antibodies against Covid-19 for the world. An effective and safe method of treatment, monoclonal antibodies offer an alternate therapeutic regimen for Covid-19 as several of them are various stages of research and development. SII and Merck would develop SARS-CoV-2 neutralising monoclonal antibodies co-invented by IAVI and Scripps Research as an innovative intervention to address the pandemic. Neutralising antibodies are widely considered to be promising candidates for Covid-19 treatment and prevention. Encouraging results for Covid-19 antibody treatment have emerged from preclinical research and initial clinical trials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-biotech-s-vaccine-cleared-for-phase-3-trial-905736.html

Singh, who had been warned by the BJP leadership not to support the accused, said that he was even prepared to 'sacrifice' his life to ensure that the complaint of the family members of the accused was also registered by the police. Speaking to reporters in Ballia, about 400 kilometres from here, the MLA said that the deceased, identified as Jai Prakash Pal, had a criminal past and that the latter faced robbery cases also. ''Pal was a criminal....he was killed by a soldier,'' Singh said. The accused Dhirendra Singh was the district president of BJP's ex-servicemen cell. Seeking to make light of the show cause notice issued to him by the party leadership, the MLA said that it was a ''usual practice''. The 'Karni Sena', a caste-based outfit, also lent support to the accused and warned of an agitation if the cops did not lodge an FIR against the victim's family. Dhirendra, a close aide of Surendra Singh, had sprayed his rival with bullets after an altercation during the meeting convened by the officials to discuss allotment of fair price shops at Durjanpur village in the district. He was arrested along with nine others. Upset over the support to the accused by Surendra Singh, the BJP leadership has issued him a show-cause notice and asked him not to interfere with the investigation. The MLA had said that he was supporting the accused as both of them were from the same caste.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/criminal-got-killed-by-soldier-bjp-mla-again-defends-main-accused-in-ballia-firing-905537.html

Police said the BJP leaders did not have permission for taking out the 'yatra'. The Punjab unit of the BJP had planned to take out a 'yatra' in protest against the alleged atrocities on the scheduled caste community and post-matric SC scholarship scam in the state. The rally was to start from Jalandhar and end at the residence of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in Chandigarh. As the BJP leaders and workers started their 'yatra' in their vehicles at Surya enclave in Jalandhar, police personnel stopped them and detained many senior state party leaders. Party general secretary Jeevan Gupta and former minister Manoranjan Kalia were among the people who were detained by police. They were brought in a bus to Circuit House in Jalandhar. Later, they were released. Talking to reporters, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Som Parkash said the protest rally was organised against the alleged multi-crore post-matric Scheduled Caste scholarship scam and "atrocities" on Dalits. "We wanted to wake up the state government from its slumber on these issues through this rally," Parkash said. Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma said the party will continue to fight till the SC community gets justice. Former Union minister Vijay Sampla said that stopping the BJP's protest rally was “unconstitutional”. BJP leaders had been demanding a CBI probe into the alleged scholarship scam in which the name of minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had figured. After the allegations of Rs 64 crore misappropriation in the SC scholarship scheme had surfaced, the chief minister had directed the chief secretary to conduct a thorough enquiry. The chief secretary's report, based on the findings of the three-member panel of IAS officers led by Food Secretary KAP Sinha, had exonerated Dharamsot.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/punjab-bjp-leaders-detained-over-dalit-insaf-yatra-protest-rally-905637.html

A Pathanamthitta native complained to the police that the accused cheated many people by accepting lakhs of rupees by offering partnership in a paper and cotton-based banner manufacturing unit at Palakkad district in Kerala. The complainant, C R Harikrishnan, hailing from Aranmula, also alleged that he invested around Rs. 30 lakhs, but was not issued any share certificate.  Rajasekharan was arraigned as fifth-accused in the case registered by the Aranmula police. His close confident and personal staff Praveen was the first accused in the case. Various sections of IPC for breach of trust and cheating were invoked. The complainant said that cheating took place while Rajasekharan was serving as Mizoram Governor and the venture was inaugurated in November 2018. Meanwhile, Rajasekharan reacted that it is a politically motivated case. The case has been registered without conducting any sorts of preliminary verification and hence a political ploy is strongly suspected. He said that he just tried to promote the venture, but was unaware of the financial deals involved in it. BJP Kerala leaders have strongly backed Rajasekharan. BJP state president K Surendran said that Rajasekharan has a very clean political track record and the fresh allegations and case is part of a conspiracy of the ruling Left-Front in Kerala to tarnish BJP's image. He also said that the party would legally and politically face the case. Incidentally, the case against Rajasekharan came close on the heels of the Centre nominating him as its representative in the administrative committee of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Earlier, BJP NRI cell convenor Harikumaran Nair was nominated as Centre's representative in the committee. But he was replaced by Rajasekharan soon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/cheating-case-against-bjp-leader-and-former-governor-of-mizoram-kummanam-rajasekharan-905664.html
22-10-2020||National Politics||Rahul Gandhi sympathetic to anti-national elements: Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of being sympathetic towards “anti-national elements”. Referring to Gandhi’s meeting a day before with the wife of Siddique Kappan, the Kerala journalist who was arrested by Uttar Pradesh Police while on his way to Hathras, Adityanath said, “He (Rahul Gandhi) openly meets members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). This clearly reflects his mentality towards anti-national elements”. He further alleged, "This is the same PFI which has plans to instigate a series of riots in the country, and those doing politics in the name of religion are trying to disturb the country's communal harmony". The Popular Front of India (PFI), an alleged radical group, has been accused of funding certain protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that took place across the country earlier this year. The Uttar Pradesh police had earlier sought a ban on the organization. Kappan's wife Raihanath had on Wednesday met Gandhi, an MP from Wayanad in Kerala, to hand over a memorandum seeking justice for her husband. Amidst the opposition’s attacks on the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, the chief minister claimed that during his tenure since 2017 strict measures have been taken to remove the mafias and prevalence of hooliganism. “The mafia which was being harboured by the opposition parties, now they are on the run begging for their lives. Due to strict measures and resolve of the government, mafia and hooliganism have become a thing of the past in the state,'' he said, according to an official press release. Adityanath made the remarks while addressing public meetings for the upcoming bypolls in the state’s assembly constituencies of Bulandshahr, Amroha and Tundla, as per the release. The CM claimed the Western part of the state has been freed from the hold of mafia elements and goons. “Their properties are being razed and they have no place left to hide,” he said. Adityanath also asserted that the state government was continuously working towards transforming Uttar Pradesh into “Uttam Pradesh” for the past three years. He said not only the dues of sugarcane farmers are being cleared but the sugar mills that were shut down during the rule of previous governments are now operating with full capacity and productivity. The CM also recalled former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh as “the true crusader of farmers’ rights and wellbeing”. "Now, the leaders are only doing lip-service in the name of farmers in order to garner their votes," he said. He also called upon the people to give a “befitting reply” to those who based their politics on caste and religion. Castigating the opposition, he said it was their narrative that had led to the  Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013, the “exodus” of businessmen and traders from Kandhla and Kairana and the killings of innocent youths. Accusing the opposition of playing communal politics, the CM also said they were against the Kanwar Yatra and were raising the bogey of communal disharmony. “Now, under BJP rule, the Kanwar Yatra is taken out and flowers are showered on the Kanwarias,'' he pointed out.       He also said the person who donated his property for Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)  has been totally neglected and the BJP government will set up a university in Aligarh named after Maharaja Mahendra Singh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-sympathetic-to-anti-national-elements-yogi-adityanath-905679.html

The state government has constituted a committee to remove Punjab from nearly 237 Acts on the initiative of state Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta. Most of the acts are related to revenue and police departments and have the word Punjab in them, according to officials. Haryana was carved out as a separate state from undivided Punjab on November 1, 1966, under the Punjab Reorganisation Act. Haryana had adopted various acts which were already in force in undivided Punjab to run its administration. It was then resolved that the new state would be governed by the laws applicable in Punjab and it could make necessary amendments as per its requirements after two years. While a majority of the acts were amended over the years, Gupta had last month mooted the proposal to omit Punjab from the remaining acts. "Haryana is gearing up to do away with the name of the state of Punjab from its laws. The state government has constituted a Committee in this regard after the initiatives of Vidhan Sabha Speaker, Gian Chand Gupta,” a state government statement said here on Thursday. The committee constituted under the chairmanship of the legal remembrancer and administrative secretary of the law and justice department will review and examine the amendment of the subtitles of the acts, it said. The state government has informed the Haryana Vidhan Sabha Secretariat regarding the constitution of the committee which will submit its report to Haryana chief secretary, Vijai Vardhan, within a month. According to the order issued by Vardhan, the members of this committee will include the officer on special duty (OSD), law and justice department, deputy secretary of the department of political and parliamentary affairs and OSD (rules) of general administration department. “Haryana had inherited the laws which were in Punjab's name and the governance in Haryana has been based on these laws for the last over 54 years. The people of the state have been demanding to change the laws and add the name of Haryana,” the statement said. Gupta had held a meeting with the officers of the state government and of the Vidhan Sabha Secretariat at the state Assembly Secretariat on September 24, in this regard. The Speaker had instructed the chief secretary to formulate a plan to omit Punjab from all the state laws and the decision to constitute the committee was also taken in the meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/haryana-initiates-process-to-omit-word-punjab-from-its-laws-905749.html

A bench of Justice A R Masoodi passed the order on the bail plea of Kanojia. The petitioner had pleaded that he was innocent and was implicated due to ulterior reasons. Kanojia was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police on August 18 from Delhi. The FIR against him was registered here at the Hazratganj Police Station on August 17 for allegedly sharing an “indecent” post on his Twitter handle and saying that he did it on the directive of Hindu Sena chief Sushil Tiwari, who denied the allegation. The FIR registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Dinesh Kumar Shukla said, "On August 17, it was seen that Prashant Kanojia through his twitter handle (@Pjkanojia) had uploaded an indecent post related to Ram temple stating that it was done on orders of Tiwari.” The post was uploaded to “malign Tiwari's image”, said the sub-inspector in his complaint, adding that “such posts can disturb peace". The case against Kanojia was lodged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including section 420 and those of the Information Technology Act. In a Facebook post on August 17, Tiwari said he had nothing to do with the objectionable post, asserting that he supported ''Hindutva'' ideology and not "fake posts''. Kanojia was earlier arrested in June last year for allegedly posting objectionable remarks against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the social media.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, commonly known as the Roshni scheme, was enacted with the twin objectives of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state's land. It was repealed in November 2018 by the State Administrative Council (SAC) under the chairmanship of the then Governor Satya Pal Malik. On Wednesday, Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, P K Pole chaired a meeting of deputy commissioners and other concerned officials and directed them to submit comprehensive details of ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, police officers, government employees, businessmen, other influential persons and their relatives who have derived any benefit under the Act, officials said. Pole directed all the deputy commissioners of Kashmir division to submit the district-wise details of the state's lands as in 2001, status of the lands and well as encroachment and illegal occupation at the earliest. Pole stressed on constituting district-level teams to collect all required details "on a war footing", the officials said, adding, he instructed the concerned officials to ensure no laxity in this regard and directed all DCs to ensure implementation of directions of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court in letter and spirit. On October 9, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court had ordered a CBI probe into alleged financial irregularities in the Roshni land scheme. The HC was hearing a petition alleging that the state exchequer had to bear an estimated loss of Rs 25,000 crore due to the scam. The high court had asked the CBI to take over the probe and file a status report every eight weeks. The administration had also ordered a probe by the anti-corruption bureau into alleged instances of cornering high-value prime lands in Jammu and Srinagar cities by misusing the law. The Anti-Corruption Bureau of Jammu (Vigilance), which was investigating the matter till the HC asked the CBI to take over, had registered 17 FIRs in connection with the alleged scam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-admin-working-on-details-of-beneficiaries-of-alleged-roshni-act-scam-905390.html

A joint statement signed by the All India Democratic Women's Association, National Federation of Indian Women, All India Progressive Women's Association, Pragatisheet Mahila Sangathan and others said that that the organisations and activists working to preserve the right to life, livelihood, democratic rights and a violence-free life are extremely concerned at the way the inquiry in the Hathras case is being compromised. The 19-year-old woman, who was assaulted and allegedly raped by four men on September 14, died a fortnight later at a Delhi hospital. She was cremated in the dead of the night on September 30. While her family claimed the cremation was carried out against their wishes, the police said the last rites were held "as per the wishes of the family". "The UP government under CM Yogi Adityanath seems to be working overtime to protect the upper caste culprits who belong to the same Thakur caste as the CM. The Thakur community is being allowed to organise their caste panchayats and openly threaten the girl's family who now fear for their safety," the statement said. "The investigating agency is brazenly denying that a rape was committed. Cases are filed against the people who have supported the family," it said. "The website of the CBI had earlier displayed the FIR registered by its Noida branch which included Sections 376, 302 etc. This has been removed from this website. Now it states that the CBI will conduct its investigation on the basis of an earlier FIR lodged at the Hathras Police Station which does not include charges of gang-rape and murder." "This is a clear attempt to dilute the investigation even before it has started. The app from women’s organisations is for nationwide joint protests on October 29,¨ the statement said. It also said that attacks against Dalits and women go on with impunity and alleged that goons and rapists are being given "political patronage" by the Narendra Modi regime at the centre and the Adityanath government in the state. "We appeal to all citizens to come forward and raise our voice in unison to condemn this brazen attacks on the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women. This violence has increased under the BJP-RSS regime. We condemn the Manuwadi Code that is being implemented in Uttar Pradesh. Let us all unitedly fight to protect the secular, democratic traditions of our country and the fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution. Let us all unitedly protest all over the country on October 29, 2020 – one month after the death of the Hathras victim. CM Yogi must resign, DM Hathras must be removed," it said. The groups also demanded a court monitored impartial investigation into the case and that the case be investigated under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Invoke the Prevention of Atrocities Act against the accused including the police and administrative officers responsible for burning the victim's body to destroy evidence, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/womens-groups-call-for-nationwide-protest-against-hathras-gang-rape-905393.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Allahabad HC stays arrest of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari's sons||Providing major relief to two sons of jailed gangster and BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Wednesday stayed their arrest in the Dalibagh land case. The high court, however, directed the duo -- Abbas and Umar – to co-operate in the investigation. A division bench of Justice DK Upadhyay and Justice Saroj Yadav termed the argument of Advocate General Raghvendra Singh as fallacious and said the petitioners were able to make out a case for interim relief. Challenging the FIR lodged at Hazartganj police station on August 27, the Ansaris had engaged a battery of top lawyers including senior advocates JN Mathur, HGS Parihar and Arun Sinha, who argued that the FIR did not disclose commission of cognizable offence as the two brothers were not even born when the alleged offences were said to have been committed. "The FIR has been lodged due to mala-fide reasons," stressed Mathur. Opposing the plea, the Advocate General argued that the petition was not maintainable. The FIR was lodged against Ansari, a gangster-turned-politician, and his two sons claiming that the petitioners had committed cheating and forgery with regard to land in the posh Dalibagh area and got a map sanctioned by the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) in a fraudulent manner for the purpose of raising construction on it. In August, the authorities here had demolished two illegal buildings owned by Ansari in Dalibagh area. The map of the property was not passed by the LDA, according to officials.

22-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality in 'very poor' category, to deteriorate in next two days||Pollution levels in the national capital dropped to 'very poor' category on Thursday evening and is likely to worsen in the coming two days, government agencies said. Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) have been recorded at 302, which is in the 'very poor' category. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast further deterioration in air quality with increase in PM 10 and PM 2.5 pollutants. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. "Air quality will deteriorate in the coming two days till October 24. There are factors other than farm fires which are worsening the air quality, such as vehicular pollution and waste burning. "PM 2.5 will increase and PM 10, which is now in 'poor' category, will be 'very poor' by October 24," Additional Director General of IMD Anand Sharma told PTI. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor SAFAR said an increase in stubble fire count was observed around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring regions. On Wednesday, the count was 1,428.  Though the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and other agencies had predicted an improvement in air quality for Thursday, the AQI turned out to be worse than Wednesday. According to the CPCB, Delhi's AQI was in 'poor' category on Thursday morning at 254 and it deteriorated to 'very poor' at 302 by evening. It was 256 on Wednesday.

22-10-2020||North and Central||Murder convict released on parole amid Covid-19 lockdown kills another man: Report||Police told the publication that the incident took place in south Delhi’s Tughlakabad village. Vishwajeet was previously involved in six cases of dacoity and for crimes under the Arms act along with a murder case, the report added quoting official police sources. DH could not independently verify the report. Vishwajeet and two more had reportedly lost Rs 70,000 to Vicky Gupta while gambling near a forested area in Tughlakabad village. “Vishwajeet accused Vicky of cheating during the game and demanded the money that he had lost back. An argument ensued and Vishwajeet took out a knife, stabbed Vicky in his chest in a fit of rage and fled,” a senior police officer told the publication. The victim was declared dead after being taken to the hospital and a murder case was registered against Vishwajeet on the statement of a witness. Earlier this week, the Delhi High Court observed that its blanket order extending interim bails and paroles granted to prisoners in view of the Covid-19 pandemic should come to an end as the number of infected persons in jails here was only three. According to the Director-General (Prisons), including Vishwajeet over 6,700 prisoners were granted bail or parole and the majority still continue to remain outside in view of the blanket order passed and extended from time-to-time by a full bench of the high court.

22-10-2020||North and Central||Jammu and Kashmir likely to hold BDC polls from November||Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to hold the first-ever election to 20 district development councils (DDCs) in November-December to complete third tier of Panchayats. On October 17, the Centre amended the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, to facilitate the setting up of DDCs, the members of which will be directly elected by voters in the Union Territory. In the absence of an elected government in the UT, these Councils are set to become a new unit of governance in Jammu and Kashmir. Official sources told DH that elections to the DDCs will be held along with by-elections to nearly 1,300 vacant sarpanch and panch seats in the UT. “Exercise to hold elections to newly announced DDCs has been set into motion. A formal announcement is likely to be made by the end of this month or early November,” they said and added the elections are likely to commence from the end of November and last about a month. Though the government is yet to take a final call, sources said, the DDC elections are likely to be held on a non-party basis which can neutralize any impact from a likely boycott call from regional political parties like National Conference, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and others. While Panchayat elections in 2018 were held on a non-party basis, the municipal polls were held on party-basis. Later, the Block Development Council (BDC) polls, which formed the second-tier of Panchayats, were also held on party-basis. It will be the first electoral exercise after the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was downgraded as UT on August 5 last year. The holding of BDC polls will complete the third tier of Panchayats for the first time in the history of J&K as never in the past the erstwhile Union Territory had elected DDCs, which used to be headed by the Chief Minister and Cabinet Ministers. The term of the DDC will be five years, and the electoral process will allow for reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women. The BDC elections are evidently intended to kick-start the political process in the UT. J&K has been under the central rule since June 2018 when the BJP pulled out of the alliance government with the PDP. The special status of the erstwhile state under Article 370 was revoked in August 2019 by the Parliament and it was bifurcated into the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-likely-to-hold-bdc-polls-from-november-905500.html

Wearing masks, doctors from Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and Rajen Babu Tuberculosis Hospital held placards and appealed to higher authorities to intervene and resolve the crisis. Recently, several resident doctors of the three facilities had held a protest at Jantar Mantar followed by a candlelight march. "We ate tired of raising this issue, but still no resolution is in sight. We should be in hospitals now. We have no option but to press for our demands. We want our due salaries, it is our basic right," said Abhimanyu Sardana, the president of RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital. The members of the Resident Doctors' Association of the Hindu Rao Hospital have been protesting for the past several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking release of salaries due for the past three months. Resident doctors of the Kasturba Hospital are also agitating over their pending salaries too. Jyotsana Prakash, a resident doctor at Hindu Rao Hospital, who joined the protest, said, "Some of us might even sit on hunger strike from today. Final decision is yet to be made by the association". North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash recently had said that salary has been released for resident doctors for the "month of July". The BJP, which controls the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), and the ruling AAP have sought to blame each other for the situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/resident-doctors-of-ndmc-hospitals-protest-at-jantar-mantar-over-salary-dues-905534.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi High Court directs police give details of child porn to NCRB to notify content for removal||The Delhi High Court has directed the police agencies to forward sexually explicit material relating to a 24-year-old woman, who was a minor when the pictures were taken, to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) for notifying the objectionable contents for removal from the Internet. The high court also directed Facebook and Google to remove the offending contents and URLs from their platforms. It also directed the police authorities to use protocols and resources available with the NCRB and other concerned agencies to identify persons who are reloading the offensive contents on the Internet in India and take action against them. “In the circumstances, this court directs the concerned police agencies to forward offending material relating to the petitioner, which undeniably falls within the scope of sexual explicit material relating to a child, to the NCRB. “The NCRB shall also use the protocols available in terms of the Memorandum of Understanding entered into with NCMEC or otherwise to notify the offending material in order that the same can be actioned and removed from other platforms as well,” Justice VIbhu Bakhru said. National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a non-profit organisation involved in helping to find missing children, reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimisation. The court’s order came on a petition by a young woman, who was 16-year-old in 2012 when she became friends with a boy of her class and entered into a relationship which later on became abusive. The woman said the boy used to emotionally blackmail her and compelled her to send her intimate photographs to him. She succumbed to the tactics and started sending him her 'intimate pictures’. Later, she broke up her relations with him and went abroad for higher studies, the plea said. However, the boy kept troubling her and even went abroad where he tried to throttle her after which a court there passed orders restraining him from contacting her. She claimed that in 2019, she came to know that the man had posted her intimate pictures on various platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and YouTube and the uploaded photographs were the same that were sent by her to him when she was a minor. He misused the photographs and uploaded them on the Internet, she said, adding that she lodged an FIR against him with the Special Cell, Cyber Crime Department of Delhi Police and also contacted the social media platforms for removing the objectionable photographs. However, when the webpages/ URLs were not removed, she approached the court seeking the relief. Noting that even after removal of the URLs, further webpages containing the offending images had been uploaded on Instagram, YouTube and other platforms, the court said it appeared that the offending images had been widely distributed and they are also being uploaded by several persons other than the accused. “This brought into sharp focus the problem of preventing circulation of identified objectionable material on the platforms operated on the net,” it said. The court said, “Given the statutory framework, it would be necessary for the intermediaries to take all effective measures that may be available with them to ensure that the child porn (CP) content is not hosted on their platforms.” It noted that the affidavits filed by Facebook and Google also indicate that they are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other tools to remove the offending content from their platforms. The Central government, represented through standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, said that NCRB acts as a nodal agency for technical and operational functions of On-Line Cyber Reporting Portal: “www.cybercrime.gov.in.” The incidents reported on the portal are shared with the law enforcement agencies. NCRB has also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NCMEC to receive Cyber Tipline reports relating to suspected child porn content, he said. Facebook, in its affidavit, affirmed that it has implemented a number of measures to combat the spread of child porn including working with NCMEC and once it identifies a child porn image on its platforms, it immediately removes the same. Google LLC, in its affidavit, claimed that it has adopted various protocols to deal with child pornography or child sexual abuse materials on its YouTube platform. Google also stated that it has issued robust Community Standards and Policies that prohibit its users from uploading any content that endangers the emotional and physical well being of minors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-high-court-directs-police-give-details-of-child-porn-to-ncrb-to-notify-content-for-removal-905571.html

The chief minister, who transferred digitally Rs 113 crore compensation to 3,48,511 farmers in 19 districts affected by the flood, said a permanent solution to the problem would be found and a work plan was being prepared. Till then, usual safety measures will be taken in flood-prone areas, he said. The chief minister said the compensation amount was too less as compared to the hard work put in by farmers for cultivation. It is just a proof of the government's commitment towards farmers, he said. Stressing that under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi the state government is committed to safeguard the interests of farmers, he said the Indian economy had not had any major impact of the global slowdown or the Covid-19 pandemic because the farmers have continuously worked hard to strengthen the farming sector.  Under such circumstances, it is "our duty to ensure that farmers get the right remuneration of their produce". Farmers should not face harassment of any kind at any level and the district magistrates have been given clear orders in this regard, he said. Those found involved in any such activity will be punished, he said. The chief minister also interacted with some of the beneficiary farmers through video conferencing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-yogi-adityanath-gives-out-compensation-to-flood-hit-farmers-905578.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots: Worst communal riots since partition, says court||The riots in Delhi in February this year was the “worst communal riots since partition” in the national capital and that it was a “gaping wound” in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a “major global power,” observed a Delhi Court on Thursday. The remarks by the court came while dismissing the bail pleas in three cases of former AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, who allegedly abused his “muscle power” and “political clout” to foment communal violence. “It is common knowledge that the dreary day of February 24, 2020, saw parts of north-east Delhi gripped by a communal frenzy, reminiscent of carnage during the days of partition. Soon, the riots spread like wildfire across the smoke-grey skyline of Capital, engulfing new areas and snuffing out more and more innocent lives. “The Delhi riots 2020 are a gaping wound in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a major global power. Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub/centre point for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said. The court further said the spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a “premeditated conspiracy”. “At this stage, I am reminded of a famous English saying which says that 'when you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far and spread the fire'. "So, when the applicant (Hussain) is at the receiving end now, he cannot pass on the buck by simply taking a plea that since he did not participate physically in the riots, so he has no role to play in the riots. It is prima facie apparent that the applicant abused his muscle power and political clout to foment communal violence in the area,” the judge said. One of the cases pertained to the alleged presence of 100 people standing on the terrace of Hussain's house with petrol bombs and throwing them on the persons belonging to another community during the riots in Dayalpur area. The second case related to looting of a shop in the area due to which the shop's owner incurred a loss of about Rs 20 lakh. The third case related to looting and torching of a shop due to which the owner incurred a loss of around Rs 17-18 lakh. The judge said there was enough material on record to presume that Hussain was very well present at the spot of crime and exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as “human weapons”, who on his instigation could have killed anybody. “It is noteworthy that at the time of eruption of communal riots in the area(s) of north-east Delhi, the applicant (Hussain) has been in a powerful position (being sitting Councillor of the area from Aam Aadmi Party) and it is prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” the court said in its order. It further said that the allegations against Hussain were grave in nature. Regarding the contention raised by Hussain's counsel that there was a delay in recording of statements of the witnesses in the cases, the court said it can be said to be delayed when the witnesses were known to the police and yet police do not record their statements; whereas, in a case of rioting, police hardly has any idea as to who were the witnesses. “Further, people normally do not come forward and it is admitted position on record that on the date of incident nearly 10,000 PCR (police control room) calls were recorded in the area of PS (police station) Dayalpur. Thereafter, on the basis of these calls, police reverted back and traced out some of the witnesses. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is delay in recording of statements of witnesses by investigating agency,” it added. It said that the public witnesses in the three matters were residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, the possibility of Hussain threatening or intimidating them cannot be ruled out. It added that though there was no video footage or CCTV footage, showing Hussain's presence at the spot, there was enough ocular evidence available on record. The independent public witnesses in the matters have categorically identified him to be present at the scene of crimes on the date of incidents, said the court. “It is nowhere disputed that the applicant (Hussain) is a public figure and the public witnesses are residents of the same locality, so prima facie this Court has to believe that the aforesaid public witnesses knew the applicant very well… I find the “ocular evidence” of independent witnesses to be categorical, which gives the clear details qua the active role played by him in the incidents in question,” it said. The court further said that the call detail record analysis confirmed his presence at or around the scene of the crimes on the date of the incident. Senior advocate K K Manan, appearing for Hussain, claimed that he has been falsely implicated in the matter by the police and his political rivals with the sole purpose of harassing him by abuse of the machinery of law. Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary said Hussain was the main kingpin/conspirator in the cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-worst-communal-riots-since-partition-says-court-905588.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots: Umar Khalid tells court he's in sort of solitary confinement||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with north-east Delhi riots in February, told a court here on Thursday that he was not allowed to step out of his cell and it was sort of a "solitary confinement". Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed Tihar Jail Superintendent to be present before the court on Friday to hear the matter. Khalid made his submissions directly to the court through video conferencing when he was produced before it on expiry of his judicial custody in the case. The court also pulled up the Assistant Jail Superintendent of Tihar prisons for not unmuting the microphone when Khalid told him that he wanted to speak to the judge. Khalid said the official told him the microphone will be unmuted if the judge gave the permission for it. “If an undertrial wants to say something, then unmute and let him speak or you tell us that he wants to say something,” the judge told the jail official. Khalid alleged that he was alone in his cell and not allowed to step out of his cell or talk to anyone. “I have not been allowed to step outside at all. I am alone in my cell. No one is allowed to meet me. It is practically sort of a solitary confinement. I am not well for the last three days. I am feeling discomfort. This is like a punishment. Why am I given this punishment? I reiterate that I need security but it cannot be that I have to be in my cell all day,” he claimed. He further said that on Wednesday he was shown an order passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma of Jail number 2, in which it was stated that Khalid should not be allowed out of his cell for 24 hours a day. “I request a recall of that order. In the morning, the Jail Superintendent came and asked the jail staff to allow me to go outside. I was allowed to step out for 10 minutes and then after he left, I was not allowed to go outside since then,” Khalid alleged. When his counsel, advocate Trideep Pais, told the court that no adverse steps should be taken against him by the jail authorities for putting forward his grievances, the judge said, “Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances. You should take care of it.” The court had on October 17 directed the Tihar Jail Superintendent to provide adequate and security in judicial custody. The directions came on an application filed by Khalid seeking adequate security in prison so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-umar-khalid-tells-court-hes-in-sort-of-solitary-confinement-905593.html

22-10-2020||North and Central||After rollout of NEP, class 10, 12 board exams should be discontinued: Sisodia to Centre||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday recommended that after the rollout of the new National Education Policy (NEP), board exams for class 10 and 12 should be discontinued. Sisodia also suggested that the government must introduce multi-year stage-wise classes and external assessment at the end of each stage He made the suggestions during the 57th General Council Meeting of the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) chaired by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' and attended by state education ministers Sisodia pointed out that the '5+3+3+4' model recommended in the NEP can attain its full potential if the existing one year per grade system is removed. "It means, instead of an existing class system where all children of a class move together in all subjects despite being at different learning levels, the multi-year stage will help the child move as per their learning need in different subjects at their own pace. A stage-wise curriculum with a clearly stated learning goal in terms of knowledge, skills and values be created," he said. "Going by the logic of the stage, after the full roll-out of NEP, class 10 and 12 board exam should also discontinue. The existing board exams made sense in 10+2 model but not in 5+3+3+4. Retaining two board exams in one last stage will dilute the significance of the first three stages in the school life of children," he added. Sisodia, who is also Delhi's Education Minister, noted that when the mandate of the National Testing Agency (NTA) is to conduct entrance exams for admissions in higher education institutions, there is no need for class 12 board exams. "Hence, the class 12 board exam should not be a high stake exam anymore. It is about time that we introduce multi-year stage-wise classes and external assessment at the end of each stage replacing the existing year-wise classes and two board exams in class 10 and 12," he said. ”Transformation should be holistic and not piecemeal. Instead of an existing class system where all children of a class move together in all subjects despite being at different learning levels, the multi-year stage will help the child move as per their learning need in different subjects at their own pace. We recommend stage-wise curriculum with a clearly stated learning goal in terms of knowledge, skills and values," he added. The NEP approved by the government last month replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower. Teaching up to Class 5 in mother tongue or regional language, lowering the stakes of board exams, a single regulator for higher education institutions, except for law and medical colleges, and common entrance tests for universities are part of the sweeping reforms in the NEP. Replacing the '10+2' structure of school curricula with a '5+3+3+4' curricular structure corresponding to age groups 3-8, 8-11, 11-14 and 14-18 years respectively, scrapping M.Phil programmes and implementing common norms for private and public higher education institutions are among other salient features of the new policy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-rollout-of-nep-class-10-12-board-exams-should-be-discontinued-sisodia-to-centre-905675.html

A letter from the Lok Sabha Secretariat has asked the Northern Railways, which has been serving food in the canteen since 1968, to pack up and move on from the Parliament premises by that time. The India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), the government’s tourism arm, runs the luxury five-star Ashok Group of hotels. "The competent Authority has desired that the operations of the catering units in Parliament House Estate (Parliament House Parliament House Annexe & Parliament Library Building and paties mide and outside PHE providing services to dignitaries) be taken over by ITDC 15.11 2020," the letter stated. "The Northern Railway may, accordingly, hand over the electronic gadgets viz Computers Printer etc. provided by the Lok Sabha Secretariat to ITDC and furniture items, equipment gadgets etc to CPWD for being handed over by them to ITDC," it said. The process to find a new vendor was started last year and in July this year, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla met Tourism Minister Prahlad Patel and officials of ITDC to discuss the issue. Officials at ITDC said they have been instructed to keep a special focus on the “quality of food” which should suit both “common people as well as dignitaries”. At present, the canteen serves around 5,000 people during every session. It has a total of 48 food items on its menu for lunch and evening snacks. While matters relating to catering arrangements in the Parliament House Complex are typically decided by a joint committee on food management, in the 17th Lok Sabha, however, the food committee has not been constituted. The final decision was taken by Speaker Birla, who has taken personal interest in ensuring that better quality food is served in the canteen and also to end subsidies. An end to subsidies is expected to lead to annual savings of approximately Rs 17 crore to Parliament.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/northern-railways-to-end-52-year-legacy-of-serving-food-in-parliament-itdc-to-take-over-905685.html

It said a special festival package of advance will be also be accorded to all Delhi government employees for any important festivals up to March 31, 2021. The Finance department under Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has decided to give a mega festive package to Delhi government employees in view of the hardships due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, an official statement said.  The government has decided that cash equivalent of LTC will be given to its employees by way of reimbursement if an employee opts for this in lieu of LTC in the block of 2018–21, the Delhi government statement said. "The employees who are entitled to business class airfare will get Rs 36,000 LTC followed by Rs 20,000 for the employees who are entitled to an economy class of airfare. The employees who are entitled to rail fare of any class will get Rs 6,000 LTC," it said It has also been decided that a special festival package of advance will be accorded to all the Delhi government employees for any important festivals up to March 31, 2021. An amount of Rs 10,000 will be paid to the employees as advance, under the initiative, it said. The special cash package has been announced in a bid to boost the consumption expenditure and incentivise employees, the statement said.  The Delhi government is very hopeful that through these steps it will bring some ease to lives of the employees and they will be able to happily celebrate the upcoming festival with their family, it said.  A  number of Delhi government employees are not in a position to avail the LTC fare for travel to any place in India or their hometowns in the current block of 2018–21 due to disruption in transport and hospitality sectors caused by the pandemic, it said.  The special festival advance is being given with a view to enabling government servants to meet expenses relating to festivals and to encourage spending, thereby giving a boost to economic activities, it said. Earlier this provision of advance was only there for the non-gazetted employees. Now it would be applicable to both gazetted and non-gazetted employees, it said. Employees will get a pre-loaded 'Rupay' card of the advance value.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-government-employees-can-opt-for-cash-equivalent-of-leave-travel-concession-905697.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Jammu and Kashmir government employees can now be retired after completing 22 years of service||Jammu and Kashmir's civil service regulation rules were amended on Thursday to allow the administration to retire government employees at any time after completing 22 years of service or attaining the age of 48 years, an official said. The employees can be retired after being given three months notice or three months of pay and allowance in lieu of the notice, the official said. On the orders of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, the administration has introduced certain substitutes in 226(2) Article of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Service Regulations, the official said. He said a notification was issued by the Finance Department in this regard. The notification states that in the exercise of powers conferred under the provision to Article 309 of Indian Constitution, Lieutenant Governor has directed that Article 226(2) of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Service Regulations may be substituted as "226 (2): (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Regulations, the government may, if it is of the opinion that in the public interest to do so, require any government employee other than one working on a post which is included in Schedule II of these rules, to retire at any time after he/she has completed 22 years of qualifying service or on attained 48 years of age. The notification, however, said the employee can be retired provided the appropriate authority gives notice at least three months before the date on which he/she is required to leave or three months of pay and allowance in lieu of such a notice, the spokesperson said. The employee shall be granted pensionary benefits admissible under these rules on the basis of qualifying service put in by him/her on the date of the retirement, the spokesperson added. According to the official, the notification states, "A government servant who is retired immediately after allowing him to pay and allowances in lieu notice will be entitled to pension from the date of such retirement and the pension shall not be deferred till after the expiry of the three months for which he is paid pay and allowances." Setting the Time Schedule to be followed, it stated that “the exercise of review of the performance of the government servants will be initiated for each employee for the first time after her/his completion of 22 years of service or attaining 48 years of age and any time subsequently, as may be required”. The notification further states that a register of the government employees, who are due to attain the age of 48 years or to complete 22 years of service, has to be maintained by the administrative department. The register should be scrutinised at the beginning of every year by officers to be nominated by the administrative department concerned and the review is undertaken as mentioned in sub-clause (b), the notification read. The spokesperson said there is no bar on the government to review any such case again where it was decided earlier to retain the officer, but the administrative department is of the opinion that it is expedient to undertake the review again on account of changed circumstances, in the public interest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-government-employees-can-now-be-retired-after-completing-22-years-of-service-905700.html
22-10-2020||North and Central||Rajasthan High Court stays proceedings against Arun Shourie, others in Laxmi Vilas Palace sale case||The Rajasthan High Court High court on Thursday stayed the proceedings of a trial court which had ordered reopening of a probe against former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie and four others over the sale of a government-owned hotel in Udaipur two decades back. The Jodhpur bench of the high court has summoned records of the case from the special CBI court, asking it not to proceed against the five petitioners until further orders. Last month, the CBI court ordered the registration of a new FIR against former Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, the then department secretary Pradip Baijal, Lazard India Ltd managing director Ashish Guha, valuer Kantilal Karamsey and Bharat Hotels director Jyotsana Suri over the sale. The CBI had already filed a closure report after its earlier investigation into the sale of Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel. According to the initial complaint, the five had conspired through the disinvestment process in 1999-2002 to sell the ITDC-owned hotel to a private company for a meagre Rs 7.52 crore, causing a loss of Rs 244 crore to the exchequer. The counsels for the five petitioners appeared before the court of Justice Vijay Bishnoi through video conferencing. The day’s hearing lasted over an hour. Arguing his case himself, Shourie explained the disinvestment process. He said one individual had twice challenged the process before a division bench of this court in 2002 and 2006. Both times, the pleas were dismissed. Shourie said the trial court had made observations against him, alleging that he is of “dual character”, without giving him a hearing. The counsels said the trial court grossly erred in passing the order. They argued that it could not be said on the basis of the material collected by the Central Bureau of Investigation during the probe that the petitioners were involved in the commission of a crime. Additional Solicitor General of India S V Raju also supported petitioners' arguments. “The CBI has filed closure reports twice in the matter with detailed reasons on why no offence is made out against any of the persons named in the FIR. But the trial court without considering the said reasons in the right perspective has illegally passed the impugned order,” Raju argued. The trial court had also ordered that Shourie and others should be summoned before it through an arrest warrant and also directed that the administration should take over the hotel till the matter is settled. Both directions were earlier put on hold by the high court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajasthan-high-court-stays-proceedings-against-arun-shourie-others-in-laxmi-vilas-palace-sale-case-905701.html

22-10-2020||Opinion||What’s in a name? A lot, if it’s ‘Kamala’||By Francis Wilkinson  The 2020 election is about Covid-19. And the economy. Climate and energy. Foreign policy. And, of course, the incumbent threat to democracy, rule of law, etc. But all those are, ultimately, ancillary to one overriding issue. Senator David Perdue last week put his finger on the fault line of American politics, raising the question around which this election, as well as the last one, truly revolves: Does a White man in 21st century America have an obligation to say Kamala Harris’s name correctly? That’s ultimately what the entire Make America Great Again agenda is about. The question arose when Perdue deliberately fumbled Harris’s name — at one point he called her “Kamala-mala-mala” — before a MAGA crowd that duly appreciated his antics. The fallout from Perdue’s comedy routine has been both mechanically predictable and movingly improvisational. Kamala-mala-mala is a name that launched a new meme along with a thousand tweets. The campaign of Perdue’s Democratic opponent in the Georgia Senate race, Jon Ossoff, says it raised $2 million in mad money after Perdue’s mal-pronunciation — although the way money has been pouring into Democratic coffers it’s possible that was just a lazy weekend haul. Kamala-mala-mala-gate seems the sort of political flotsam that flows into the news cycle bobbing on a sea of far weightier issues. Yet both liberals and conservatives know it’s more than that. The incident encapsulates a war waged across American centuries. It has a long and hard lineage. When Roger Taney, chief justice of the Supreme Court issued his corrosive ruling in Dred Scott, he summed up American history to the year 1857 by noting that Black Americans had never possessed “rights which the white man was bound to respect.” MAGA is Taney’s heir; Harris is the political descendent of Dred Scott. Much of American history consists of Black people and other subjugated Americans striving, against fierce resistance, to acquire rights that White men are indeed bound to respect. That effort reached a symbolic and political peak in the presidency of Barack Hussein Obama. Donald Trump’s refusal to recognize any rule, law or person outside MAGA’s exclusive domain is a reassertion of historic prerogatives as well as personal corruption. Mispronouncing Harris’s name at a MAGA rally is not a mistake; it’s a rite. (Trump himself has had fun with Harris’s name, though, unlike Perdue, no one expects more of him.) Perdue's communications director, John Burke, tweeted that Perdue "simply mispronounced" Harris's name and "didn't mean anything by it." The fib was both necessary and transparent. Perdue has served with Harris in the Senate since January, 2017. Kamala — pronounced Comma-La — is not even difficult to pronounce, consisting of three familiar syllables that flow readily off an English-speaking tongue. Butchering Harris’s name is simply a more insidious variation on the nativist cry of “English only.” It targets not just the immigrant culture, but the person. The internet responded to Perdue with #MyNameIs. Prominent Americans, including former US Attorney Preet Bharara and Representatives Ilhan Omar and Ro Khanna, discussed the origin or meanings of their names. Journalists with bylines such as Li Zhou and Clarissa-Jan Lim wrote stories about the trend. And therein lies the cultural backlash to Trump and Perdue’s cultural backlash: No amount of MAGA can turn back the tide. Stupid campaign stuff is part of politics. Perdue’s adolescent attack on Harris was embarrassing and, well, stupid. But it was also a shot fired in a very long and very consequential war.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/what-s-in-a-name-a-lot-if-it-s-kamala-905415.html
22-10-2020||Opinion||How to practice a skill more scientifically||With the pandemic effectively getting rid of most of our travel plans, some of us are starting to use the extra time on our hands to pick up new skills, or to get back to learning something after a break. What does neuroscience tell us about how we can learn and practice a skill more effectively? And how can we apply some of these findings to our own lives? To be quite honest, I had some trouble starting to write this article, because as the pandemic rages on, and more and more people are starting to experience its financial and health effects, it seemed a little frivolous of me to write a something aimed specifically at those few of us who are fortunate enough to have the free time (and mind-space) to pick up new skills. This article, however, is not to make light of people’s serious problems, but is rather an attempt to explain a little bit about how the brain works in general, and how we can make changes to the way we learn to make the learning more effective. A couple of months ago, I decided to shake the dust off my old music book and started practicing classical vocals again after many years. It took me a couple of days just to get my voice warmed up, and a week or so for the voice to start ‘moving’ across notes gracefully. But a couple of weeks into this everyday practice, I started noticing something amazing – not only were my classical vocals improving, but so was my voice across multiple genres and types of songs. Since memory is so associative, it is prone to some flaws as well. It is this feature of the brain that causes us to get confused when we see a workplace acquaintance of ours at a restaurant. The brain is so used to associating that face with the workplace environment that it must work harder to identify the face outside of the familiar context. While taking short breaks to activate default mode networks of the brain is important, it is critical to do so in a measured and conscious manner. Digital distractions have made it almost impossible to concentrate on a task for a prolonged period, and for people who are prone to procrastination, it can be a never-ending spiral. I’ve tried the Pomodoro technique and can attest that it works. The day I tried it for the first time, there was an advertisement for toddler clothes in the webpage of the article I was reading. Under normal circumstances, it would have taken me no thinking at all to click on the ad and squander more than a few minutes flitting from one website to another. But because I knew that I had a Pomodoro break coming up, I resisted the temptation and concentrated on my reading. Experts suggest that rather than get overwhelmed by dividing up a large task into chunks, it might be a better idea to just focus on doing concentrated work during the 25-minute work slot and slowly ease into the technique. Many of these learning techniques can help kids with their schoolwork as well. One of the best ways to commit something to memory, experts say, is not simply to underline or write notes while studying, but to look away from the page and see how much you can recall from what you read. Finally, it can be a great idea to try and explain something so a ten-year old understands. Many scientists and engineers can be so caught up in the nitty-gritties of what they do that they lose sight of the bigger picture. Explaining so a child understands is not as difficult to do as it sounds, and the payoffs can be excellent. If Einstein himself could say that one only understands a topic if they can explain it to a six-year old, then I think the rest of us could take courage from his statement. At the end of the day though, most of us are running on depleting mental resources due to the pandemic and its effects, and it is important to be kind to ourselves if our productivity is not at its maximum. One thing that we could all take away from this article, however, is that the brain is indeed a fascinating organ, and one that we are still discovering so much about. (Aditi Subramaniam is a neuroscientist turned writer who is fascinated by the workings of the brain and how we can ‘rewire’ it to our advantage. She enjoys writing about the neuroscience of everyday life, and its practical implications for parenting) Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author’s own.

22-10-2020||Panorama||The hazards of too many choices in high school||After 34 years, education reforms that have been talked about for decades are here in the form of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The changes that have been proposed for the school education system, in particular, are many. These include the idea of reinventing the curriculum to test conceptual learning rather than rote memorization (section 4.4), changing the medium of instruction to the child’s mother tongue until at least grade 5 (section 4.11) among others. For high school students in particular though, a potential game-changer is the proposal of extending flexibility to students in Grades 11 and 12 in choosing subjects across all subject streams (highlighted in sections 4.9 and 4.10). Ask any high school student and they will tell you that flexibility in subject streams is something that they have always desired. As a young teenager, very few students usually have a clear understanding of what they would like to pursue as a career in their future. Many are usually torn between different options.  “Not everyone is interested in every subject offered within the streams available in schools right now,” says Palak Vohra, a student of Grade 9. “If flexibility is allowed, then I will choose subjects that I am definitely interested in, and that will help me to explore and learn at a deeper level. My family would support me in this as well because they are invested in seeing me learn what I am passionate about.” Flexibility in subject streams can open up the possibility of varied career options to young students since they will not be forced to specialize in any particular subject area at an early age. Ideally, an integrated combination of subjects from the humanities, commerce and science streams can result in strengthened quantitative and qualitative analytical skills.  “I personally favour the NEP’s guideline of allowing flexibility in subject combinations,” states Rubica Vohra, mother of Palak Vohra. “In her time, my elder daughter didn’t have many options to choose from. This was four years ago. From her experience, I know how hard it is for a student to perform equally well in all the subjects provided in a particular stream, especially when some of them do not really fall within their interest area.” But the practical challenges of implementing such a comprehensive change in the school curriculum are many. Critics of the NEP have already pointed out that unless the same flexibility in choosing subjects is extended to college admission criteria (especially in the medical and engineering fields, as these domains require at least 3 compulsory subjects to qualify for the entrance examinations), the flexibility offered to high school students in choosing any subject they wish to study would fail in achieving its ultimate objectives. Then the questions arise: what are the metrics based on which students will be allowed to choose subjects? Would it be entirely left up to the school administration’s discretion? If so, are there regulatory measures to ensure that school administrations don’t indulge in malpractices while exercising this kind of power? The notion of choosing any randomized set of subject combinations in the most critical years of a student’s school life may not be a practical idea. The implementation of such flexibility in subject choices is currently a vague notion for most school administrators. “This reform is something that we in the teaching profession have all been waiting for. However, the way that it has been laid out in the NEP, the implementation may be a challenge,” opines Shubhi Vadehra, a high school teacher. “For one thing, there are endless options available in terms of subjects that students can choose from if there really is flexibility on the same matter. But the more subjects a school offers, the more trained faculty it needs for teaching the same. I am not sure how exactly it will be implemented in government schools in particular since it is common knowledge that they already suffer from a shortage of trained staff.” Though there are so many challenges in implementation, the NEP has devoted only two pages in its entire draft on laying out implementation road maps (found in Part IV of the document). With regard to implementing the policy, the mechanisms mentioned in the document are vaguely worded and offer no clear-cut strategy for the public. It has left strategizing on implementation to a wide variety of stakeholders (including the union and state governments along with schools) and has merely recommended that these diverse institutions work closely together. It appears that the next step is for the union government to consolidate criticism and feedback on the NEP to revise the guidelines.  (Ankitha Cheerakathil is the ExecutiveDirector-India of Institute H21, a policy research organization.

22-10-2020||Second Edit||The stink of misogyny||Kamal Nath is not the first Indian politician to denigrate women with a crass and demeaning remark, and he will not be the last. Patriarchy and misogyny are so deeply ingrained in the Indian male mind and behaviour that we might need a social revolution lasting generations to make it an equal society. The Congress leader’s reference to a woman candidate in the Madhya Pradesh bypoll as “item” ranks with some other poor remarks made about women in politics by many politicians. Narendra Modi’s “Pachas karod (Rs 50 crore) ki girlfriend” and “Congress ki vidhwa” (widow of Congress) remarks are infamous, and there have been umpteen other insulting and derogatory comments on women politician’s bodies, looks, dress, habits and conduct. They are all weapons in a sexist armoury and politicians use them to run down women in opposite camps and even in their own. It is basic to being male for many.  Kamal Nath burst into derisive laughter also, enjoying his own insulting remark. He did not regret his insolence even after wide criticism and disapproval from the party’s top leader Rahul Gandhi. An insincere explanation and apology had to be literally extracted out of him. In a misogynistic society, to regret a word against a woman, however uncouth it is, is considered beneath oneself. It is par for the sexist course to stand one’s shameful ground because you might otherwise be considered weak and less manly. It is not known how his audience reacted to the outrage. It is likely that there was no disagreement, because he would not have made the remark if heknew it would not be appreciated. Politicians are nothing if they do not know the men they talk to. So, the problem is not just Kamal Nath and his ilk in any party, but also the constituency to which they appeal. This is the male Indian mind, entrenched in privilege and prejudice, and Kamal Nath may be just about every man, to our shame. The few Indian politicians who excelled themselves in politics, like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha and Mamata Banerjee had to fight this most unequal world to make a mark. Even with the advantage of family legacy and popularity in other fields, it was difficult for many, and for those who had just a name and the spirit, life in politics could only have been a fight every day. Every woman in public life who has to go through the fire test of abuse, slander and worse is a slap on the face of those like Kamal Nath. But the very fact that we call each of them the only man in their world shows how skewed the world is.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/the-stink-of-misogyny-905363.html
22-10-2020||South||Kerala cabinet nod to implement 10% reservation in govt jobs||The Kerala cabinet on Wednesday approved implementation of 10 per cent reservation in government jobs for the financially backward section in the general category without affecting the existing ones. This would be implemented by amending the reservation provisions in the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. The meeting decided the criteria for reservation after considering the recommendations of a two-member commission, headed by retired Judge K Sasidharan Nair and member Advocate K Rajagopalan Nair. The eligible candidates will be selected on the basis of the income of the family and their financial backwardness, an official release said. "The governmenth ad earlier decided to introduce a 10 per cent reservation in employment and admission in educational institutions for the economically backward sections in general category in the wake of the 103rd Amendment to the Constitution and notifications issued by the Central Government," it said. Currently, 50 per cent reservation is set aside for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and Backward Communities. The state government said the new 10 per cent reservation would not affect the existing categories, but was for those who are economically backward in the general category. The cabinet also decided to amend the Police Act to counter cyberattacks on women and children and decided to recommend the addition of Section 118-A to the Act to ensure severe punishment for the culprits. "It's a matter of great concern that there is an increase in crime through social media. Some of the recent crimes committed using cyber platforms have caused great concern inour society. Cyber attacks are a major threat to private life. It has been decided to amend the Police Act as it is found that the existing legal provisions were inadequate to fight such crimes," the release said. It also said that the Cabinet has decided to recommend to the Governor to issue this amendment as an ordinance. The Cabinet recommended the addition of Section 118-A to the existing Police Act, providing an imprisonment of up to five years or a fine of up to Rs 10,000 or both to those who produce, publish or disseminate content through any means of communication with an intention to intimidate, insult or defame any person. The government said there has been an increase in fake propaganda and hate speech on social media since the outbreak of the pandemic. The Supreme Court had repealed Section 66-A of the IT Act 2000 and Section 118 (d) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 on the grounds that it was against freedom of expression. "The Central Government has not introduced any other legal framework to replace this. In this scenario, the police are unable to deal effectively with crimes committed through social media," the release said. Another decision taken was to fix base prices for 16 varieties of agricultural crops as part of measures to support farmers and to boost the agricultural sector. The scheme will come into effect on November 1. The base price is fixed for 16 varieties, including tapioca, banana, pineapple, cucumber, lentils, tomatoes, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, beans, beetroot and garlic. This price is determined, based on the cost of production and productivity, the release said. "The aim is to provide the farmer the base price even when the market price falls lower than that. This will ensure price stability and good returns for them. It will also protect the farmers from market price fluctuations. They will be interested in cultivating crops for which the base prices are fixed," it said. The state government also said that the five month deferred salary of government employees would be merged with Provident Fund on April 1, 2021 as an immediate liability of Rs 2,500 crore would be incurred if repaid in cash. The merged amount can be withdrawn after June 1 2021. The Governor had on April 30 given his approval to an ordinance empowering the government to defer for six days the salaries of its employees for five months as part of measures to reduce the state's expenditure in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cabinet-nod-to-implement-10-reservation-in-govt-jobs-905375.html

This is the first batch which has cleared the higher secondary (12th standard) equivalency examination. Kerala, the first state to implement a transgender policy, had introduced 'Samanwaya', a continuing educaion programme drawn out by the KSLMA and the Social Justice Department in 2018, for mainstreaming the transgender community. A total of 22 people attended the examination and 18 have cleared it from various districts, including Pathnamthitta, Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, a KSLMA press release said. Karthick, an autorickshaw driver, who cleared the examination, has got admission in the Kerala Univeristy's BA History group, KSLMA sources said. Until now, a total of 39 people from the transgender community have passed the Class 10 equivalency course and currently 30 are pursuing it. "There are 62 transgender people in the higher secondary equivalency course," the release said. "...community members have registered for Class 4, 7, 10 and higher secondary equivalent courses. Through this scheme the transgender persons can continue their education which would increase their employment opportunities and help them to get a job and thereby lead a quality life," the Social Justice Department said. A major problem faced by the transgender community is the high rate of school and college dropouts due to social discrimination, financial constraints and lack of family support. As part of the 'Samanwaya' scheme, KSLMA had conducted a survey and identified 918 transgenders who were willing to register under this programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/18-members-of-transgender-community-clear-higher-secondary-course-in-kerala-905485.html

"Tamil Nadu is also the forerunner among industrialised states," he said here inaugurating a new facility of a diversified conglomerate which includes branded, packaged food business. Successfully, two editions of Global Investors Meet have been held by the government and foreign visits were made to bring investments, he said adding, "Amma's government has attracted substantial foreign investments." Even during the present coronavirus pandemic, 55 pacts have been inked with companies envisaging Rs 40,000 crore plus investments and this is set to open up job opportunities for 74,212 people, he said. "I am happy to say that through such investments, Tamil Nadu has achieved the first place in the country in attracting new investments in 2020," he said. At Viralimalai, the Chief Minister unveiled a statue depicting bull taming sport 'jallikattu' in which a man was shown successfully dominating a bull. Earlier, when Palaniswami arrived at the Tiruchirappalli airport from Chennai, he was given a rousing reception and he reached here, a distance of about 60 km, by road.

Dinesh, accompanied by his assistant (who shot the photos), did not shout for help as he recognised the reptile. It was 'Babiya', the guardian of Ananthapura Lake Temple, who waited a few minutes and then returned to the Ananthpura pond that surrounds the temple. The brief appearance of Babiya in the wee hours in the Muzrai temple on Tuesday, located in the northern part of Kerala, hardly created a flutter in Ananthpura village, which is about 45 kms from Mangaluru. Babiya's brief appearance, however, became a social media sensation when a photo was shared on WhatsApp. Former Managing Trustee of the temple Sri Krishnaiah recollects having seen Babiya one rainy night move through his house (located near the temple) and head towards another lake, Ayyappa Vana. "In fact, the crocodile before Babiya used to respond to the calls of my father Narayanaiah," he recollected. Narayanaiah had received an appreciation letter from a British Collector, for having demonstrated that the crocodile responded to his calls even from four different corners of the pond. During World War II, a British soldier had shot that crocodile. The British soldier in question died the same day from a snake bite. "In no time, Babiya made her presence felt in the pond and is probably as old as me," said 75-year-old Krishnaiah. The offerings (naivedhya) to God, comprising cooked rice and jaggery is fed twice a day to the friendly crocodile. Experts identified the reptile as a mugger crocodile with a natural diet in the wild consisting primarily of fish. Due to mutual respect, the pond surrounding the ninth century temple continues to be a safe haven for a fast-depleting species.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/temple-pond-in-kasaragods-kumble-is-safe-haven-for-crocodile-for-at-least-seven-decades-905590.html

"Those who held the reins of power in Tamil Nadu declined to say anything on people's representations and do not pay heed to their grievances," PMK founder chief S Ramadoss said on his Twitter handle. "The demand for 20 per cent reservation for Vanniyars was four decades old," Ramadoss said in a Facebook post adding his party's request for exclusive quota was not fulfilled by both previous dispensations and those who were in power now. The Vanniyars, also known as Vanniya Kula Kshatriyas are among the 35 plus castes that fall under the Most Backward Classes in Tamil Nadu and they, alongside the Denotified Communities are provided 20 per cent reservation out of the total 69 per cent quota. Northern Tamil Nadu, including Vellore, Cuddalore, Kancheepuram, Chengelpet, Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram is considered the heartland of the Vanniyars. Ramadoss said in the new year (2021), protest for 20 per cent exclusive reservation for Vanniyars would be started adding the agitation being planned would be on a massive scale and "unseen in history." "The massive scale of agitation would prompt the government to request them to call off the protest and sign an agreement for exclusive reservation for Vanniyars," Ramadoss said and urged the youth, women and all others to gear up from now onwards for the protest to retrieve the rights of Vanniyars. In a statement, the PMK leader lauded the AP government for constituting welfare boards for the development of 56 kinds of backward classes and wanted the model to be replicated in Tamil Nadu for the state's sustained growth. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy fulfilled what he promised and also what he had not committed, he said. "The AP model was the first step towards achieving several demands of his party aimed at social justice," he said. "Such longtime demands include a caste-based census of people in Tamil Nadu, reservation to castes on the basis of their population, identification and implementation of sustained development goals for every caste and an Equal Opportunities Authority for the growth of all communities," he said. The PMK top leader lamented that both people who had occupied the seat of power previously and those who now governed (DMK and AIADMK) Tamil Nadu were "denying" complete social justice. He accused them of not addressing the lacunae in reservation matrix and for not carrying out the caste-wise census.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmks-ally-pmk-hits-out-at-govt-warns-of-massive-quota-protest-905601.html

I am making an announcement that the entire population in the state will get the vaccine whose cost will be completely borne by the government," Palaniswami said, addressing a Covid-19 review meeting in Pudukkottai, 380 km from here. His announcement came hours after the BJP made free vaccine as part of its election manifesto in Bihar which goes to polls in two phases on November 3 and 7. Tamil Nadu faces its most crucial elections in recent years in less than seven months and it was no surprise that the Opposition attacked Palaniswami for the "free" announcement.  "Does the Chief Minister think free Covid-19 vaccine is an incentive that his government gives to people? It is the duty of every government that works for the people to give the vaccine free. It is laughable to see that a person who was not able to provide Rs 5,000 as a relief to people is projecting himself as patronising," Opposition Leader M K Stalin said.  During his speech, Palaniswami also said the state has made huge gains in its fight against Covid-19 as the recovery rate is more than 90 per cent. He also said Tamil Nadu was the only state that did a maximum number of RT-PCR tests. Government and private hospitals in Tamil Nadu are conducting clinical trials of Covaxin and Covishield vaccines for the past few months. A top government official said it will be a long time before people got a vaccine for Coronavirus as it is still at a premature stage. However, he said, the state government has come out with an initial plan for the vaccination programme.   "The vaccine needs to get validated in the first place. There will be systematic planning for the distribution of the vaccine like we did for pulse polio. We have divided people into categories and have prioritised the set of people who will get the vaccine first," the official said.  He also added that the government has asked its medical units in districts to identify cold storages where the vaccine can be stored before it is given to the people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/palaniswami-assures-free-covid-19-vaccine-to-tamil-nadu-people-905610.html

Rahul has mooted online trading options to the district which is now lacking sufficient marketing infrastructure despite having a range of indigenous varieties of agricultural produce. He also directed the district agriculture department officials to submit a project proposal. It was during a presentation by Kudumbashree on the organic and indigenous farming activities in the district that Rahul, who was on a three-day visit to his constituency, had shown keen interest in exploring the wider market of the produce. He also visited many paddy fields of the high-range district that grow indigenous varieties and also held talks with traditional farmers of the district. Kudumbashree's Wayanad district mission coordinator Sajitha P told DH that at present the major challenge is with regard to marketing. Since the majority of the families in the district are involved in agricultural activities, the demand for the produce in the district is low. The options for marketing the produce outside the district is also very limited now. Hence any initiative from the MP in this regard would be much relief. As many as 6,800 joint liability groups of women, with four members in each group, are carrying out various types of farming in 4,963 acres in the district. Of this, 1,020 groups are that of members of the tribal community alone. Tubers, banana, paddy and vegetables are the major produce. At present the majority of the produce are sold out through local markets. Last year 50 tonnes of traditional 'Palthondi' rice grown by the women farmers were exported to Gulf countries. Rahul also interacted with many traditional farmers like Cheruyaval Raman, who is known for preserving many traditional rice varieties, and visited the paddy fields. Assistant director of agriculture of Panamaram block of Wayanad, R Manikandan, who represented the Agriculture Department in the meeting, said that the MP directed to submit a detailed project proposal on the steps to be taken for enhancing marketing and value addition for the district's produce. "A detailed project report on the infrastructure requirements would be prepared by the department soon. Paddy, coffee, tea, turmeric, banana, ginger and spices are the produces that have a wider potential," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rahul-gandhi-kindles-hopes-of-wayanad-farmers-905618.html

It was while considering an anticipatory bail plea of Sivasankar that NIA stated that so far there was no reason to arrest Sivasankar in connection with NIA's case and hence the court closed the anticipatory bail plea. Meanwhile, the anticipatory bail plea of Sivasankar in connection with the probe against him by the Enforcement Directorate and Customs would be considered by the Kerala High Court on Friday. The court earlier restrained both the agencies from arresting Sivasankar till Friday. Though the customs made a move to arrest Sivasankar on October 16, Sivasankar complained of discomfort and was rushed to a private hospital.

The mobile phones numbering 14,400 were in an unpacked condition and was being transported to a firm in Mumbai for packing. The incident took place at Melumalai village in Krishnagiri district on the Chennai-Bengaluru national highway in the wee hours of Wednesday. Krishnagiri district Superintendent of Police (SP) B Gangadhar told Deccan Herald that the gang of ten people waylaid the truck at the village and overpowered the driver and another person travelling with him. After driving the truck for about 8 to 10 kms, the gang transferred all the contents into their own vehicle and fled the spot. After the incident sent shock waves, the Tamil Nadu Police formed nine special units to nab the accused. Some of the teams have rushed to Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra looking for the thieves. Police sources said the worth of the stolen mobile phones is said to be around Rs 15 crore. "We have narrowed down on the accused and we are confident of securing them in the next two days. We have strong suspicion that the kanjar gang of Madhya Pradesh might be behind the theft of mobile phones. The incident has every footprint of the modus operandi of the gang," Gangadhar said. He added that the mobile phones were being transported by the courier company to a firm for packing them in boxes. "These were unpacked phones. Once they are manufactured, they are sent to a firm in Mumbai for packing. After packing they are sent to various parts of the country for sale. So their exact worth is difficult to calculate as they were not packed units," the SP added. Another police officer said the police launched an investigation after the courier company filed a formal complaint. "We have sent teams to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. The kanjar gang is known for criminal activities and we know their modus operandi. They usually follow vehicles from their original destination and way-lay them in the dead of the night," another police official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/truckload-of-new-xiaomi-phones-stolen-in-tamil-nadu-police-teams-rush-to-mp-maharashtra-andhra-905677.html
22-10-2020||South||Tamil Nadu's Covid-19 recovery rate hits 93%, daily cases witness downward trend||Tamil Nadu, one of the highest contributors to India’s Covid-19 tally with over 7 lakh cases, has been witnessing a downward trend in the number of people testing for the novel coronavirus in the past week with the recovery rate hitting a whopping 93%. Despite the gains made, the Health Department does not want to “let the guard down” as it feels the coronavirus is “unpredictable” and even one small event can turn into a potential cluster or a super-spreader. Also, the upcoming festival season and the north-east monsoon is giving jitters to those at the helm as they fear crowding of people at shopping centres could lead to an increase in the numbers yet again. “We cannot claim success as yet. We are not going to do that because we are dealing with a pandemic. And to be honest, we are being very cautious now, more than ever. With upcoming monsoon likely to be a breeding ground for Dengue, and illnesses due to food and water contamination, we are not letting our guard down,” Health Secretary Dr. J. Radhakrishnan told DH in an interview. He also dismissed suggestions that the testing numbers have been reduced by maintaining that the state was testing over 80,000 samples a day though the number went up to 95,000 on a couple of occasions. The daily cases in Chennai have also gone below 1,000. The recovery rate of 93.4% as on Thursday evening was one of the highest in the country as the number of active cases stood at just 34,198. Radhakrishnan said the goal was to further reduce the number of people testing positive for the novel Coronavirus and keeping the fatality rate below 1%, which is now a little higher at 1.5%. The cases have also come down to around 3,100 a day after having hovered between 5,500 to 6,000, while the number of deaths per day has also witnessed a slump. At last count on Thursday morning, Tamil Nadu had a total of 7,00,193 cases, including 6,55,170 recoveries and 10,825 deaths. The positivity rate is also below 5% for the past few days. Radhakrishnan, considered a disaster mitigation expert, attributed the dip in cases to micro-level planning, aggressive testing policy, fever camps at various parts of the state to identify those with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms and door-to-door screening of residents.   The state sticking to RT-PCR tests, considered very reliable by medical experts is also another reason for early detection of cases and recovery. “Fever camps which began in Chennai initially and expanded to other parts of the state where people underwent basic check-up and door-to-door screening helped us contain the virus. Testing was made easy with 194 labs over a period of seven months and in Chennai, we collected samples at homes,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadus-covid-19-recovery-rate-hits-93-daily-cases-witness-downward-trend-905703.html

While the crop loss is estimated at Rs 8633 crore, road damages are around Rs 222 crore. The loss to GHMC is around Rs 567 crores.  The state government has released Rs 550 crore for immediate flood relief. Food packets were supplied to more than two lakh people, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar IAS informed the central team. The incessant rains and the ensuing floods on October 13-14 have claimed at least 70 human lives across Telangana, 33 of them in the capital Hyderabad alone. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao declared the state's losses at Rs 5,000 crore and in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urged the Central government to release Rs 1,350 crore immediately for the rehabilitation and relief works. Though there were extremely heavy rains in the entire Telangana, excessive damage was in and around Hyderabad. Breaches to three major tanks coupled with flooding in the Musi river resulted in the low-level areas inundated. The team comprising senior officials from the finance, road transport, and agriculture ministries visited the Falaknuma ROB, Al-Jubail Colony, Ghazi Millat Colony, Kandikal gate main road, Hafeez Baba Nagar and other flood-affected areas on Thursday. The team inspected restoration works of Chandrayagutta ROB and the removal of debris from the drains. The team interacted with the flood-affected people, whose houses are in the water for the past 10 days, to know how the floodwaters entered even the first floors. The GHMC officials informed that the Palle-Cheruvu breached and flood water entered in Al-Jubail colony and Ghazi Millat Colony etc., areas.

After having resolved internal issues, albeit for now, the ruling party is now facing trouble from alliance partners like the BJP and PMK, an influential force in northern parts of the state. The pressure from the allies come at a time the state's most-crucial Assembly elections in recent times is just seven months away. Only earlier this month, the party settled the Chief Ministerial face issue by projecting incumbent Palaniswami after his former boss O Panneerselvam paved the way. PMK, which is considered a tough ally, on Thursday came out in the open to criticise the "rulers of Tamil Nadu" though not directly mentioning the name of Palaniswami. "Andhra's (Chief Minister) Jagan (Mohan) Reddy does things that he promised and also those he never promised. But the rulers here do not say anything about people's demands. Even if someone takes the problems to them, they do not lend their ear. They also refuse to do anything," party founder S Ramadoss wrote on his verified Twitter page. The public criticism by PMK comes at a time the BJP is given mixed signals on its alliance with the AIADMK by claiming that it has the potential to field candidates in all 234 assembly constituencies, even as the saffron party dithers on clarifying its stand on Edappadi K Palaniswami as chief ministerial face of the combine. Besides, the BJP has also begun working on the ground with an eye on the assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. Tamil Nadu BJP President L Murugan has been maintaining that the leader of the alliance will be decided in "New Delhi." Another ally, DMDK led by actor Vijayakanth, has also been posturing for quite some time by claiming that it would emerge as an alternative to the Dravidian majors. The aforesaid three parties are the major partners of the AIADMK-led alliance which managed to win just one out of the 39 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Ramadoss has also bowled another googly by asking people from Vanniyar community to which he belongs to be prepared for a struggle in the first half of 2021 to get 20 per cent reservation for them. Ramadoss' open criticism of the AIADMK also led to speculation whether he was planning an exit and join the DMK front. While admitting that the statements could be part of "pressure tactics" by the parties to bargain for more seats, AIADMK leaders admit that it might find it difficult to deal with allies in the run-up to elections. The party needs a strong alliance to take on the DMK, they said. Political analysts say alliance partners coming out against the AIADMK in public shows that the troubles for the ruling party is far from over. "While the ruling party might have solved its internal problems for now, the external problem has surfaced now and that too in the open. Statements from alliance partners are direct pressure on the AIADMK. Moreover, assembly election is very important for a party like PMK," political commentator Prof. P. Ramajayam told Deccan Herald. An alliance with PMK did help the AIADMK win at least three seats in crucial by-elections in 2019 that led to the survival of the Palaniswami government. "AIADMK needs to keep PMK in good humour because the party has a committed vote bank of 5 per cent which could prove crucial in a closely-contested election," another political analyst said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-internal-rumblings-aiadmk-faces-trouble-from-allies-905722.html

Party president M K Stalin said the protest will be held to condemn the Governor's delay in signing the Bill and the AIADMK Government's reluctance to exert pressure. Stalin's announcement came after the Governor responded to his letter written on Wednesday seeking immediate consent for the Bill.  "I would like to inform you that I am seized of the matter and getting it examined from all angles. I need at least 3 to 4 weeks time to arrive at a decision The same has also been informed to the delegation of Ministers who called on me recently," Purohit told Stalin in the letter. Meanwhile, VCK President and Chidambaram Lok Sabha MP Thol. Thirumavalavan demanded that the Centre recall Purohit for acting against the interests of Tamil Nadu.  The Bill assumes significance after publishing of NEET results last week and political parties feel the Governor not giving his assent would only result in government school students losing out on medical admissions. Tamil Nadu had been opposing conduct of NEET for admission into medical and dental colleges, but when it became clear that the Centre would not give an exemption, the state government came out with an idea to provide reservation to students from schools run by it. The move to provide reservation was taken after the number of government school students getting into medical colleges witnessed a massive dip in the past few years after the introduction of NEET. The reservation would apply to all government colleges and government quota seats in self-financing medical colleges in Tamil Nadu and would ensure 300 students from government schools pursue medicine every year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-to-hold-protest-against-tamil-nadu-governor-on-reservation-bill-905730.html

Karnataka asks transport commissioner||The Karnataka government has asked Transport Commissioner N Shivakumar to submit a report as soon as possible on the cost incurred by oxygen suppliers in transporting medical oxygen from their manufacturing facilities to hospital clients. The move comes three weeks after the gazette notification of National Pharmaceutical and Pricing Authority (NPAA) that clearly states, "The state government is required to fix the transport charges under the Disaster Management Act." Transport Commissioner N Shivakumar confirmed to DH that the government had sent a letter to this effect a few days back. He said, "A three-member panel has been formed but due to the transfer of an additional commissioner, we have to find a replacement member in the panel. We will be taking into account operational costs of suppliers and fixing transport costs like we have done, for autos, busses etc." On operational viability, oxygen suppliers have pointed out that various factors like distance from source and type of equipment installed affect the cost of delivering liquid medical oxygen from the manufacturing location to the hospital premises. Suppliers say they have seen an exorbitant increase in transportation cost due to a surge in medical oxygen demand. The 'operational costs' that the transport department has to include are the cost of sourcing products from far-off manufacturing facilities, transit loss, decantation loss, sanitisation and hygiene compliance requirements at all manufacturing locations, drivers, tankers, plants and plant facilities, maintenance and additional manpower costs, driver incentives and support for Covid-19 pandemic, and implementation of social distancing norms at all locations. If the transport cost does not factor in these operational costs, suppliers will be forced to recover these additional costs from customers, that is, their hospital clients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/what-is-the-cost-of-transporting-medical-oxygen-karnataka-asks-transport-commissioner-905453.html

Preliminary estimates by the government suggest crop loss in around 6.3 lakh hectare of cultivated land due to flooding in Rivers Bhima, Krishna and their tributaries during the monsoon season. "We have assessed the extent of flood loss following the aerial survey. Compared to last year, extent of flooding is more," Yediyurappa told reporters. The floods in 2019, which affected many districts in North Karnataka, was one of the worst in hundred years. The state has sought assistance from centre for the welfare of victims, he said, adding that there were no financial constraints for relief and rehabilitation. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Yediyurappa has sought a special package of Rs 10,000 crore with the government having estimated losses exceeding Rs 21,500 crore in three spells of extreme rainfall in August, September and October. In the first spell of floods between August 1 to September 15, Karnataka suffered losses to the tune of Rs 9,441 crore. The next spell in the second fortnight of September caused damages worth Rs 5,668 crore. Initial rough estimates of damage and loss suffered due to heavy rains and extensive flooding which started on October 10 is about Rs 6,500 crore, Yediyurappa said. The CM also made a case for new norms of the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as the present ones are "grossly insufficient to give a modicum of relief to the affected farmers and households," he said. Karnataka's relief measures are way more than what is prescribed under NDRF, Yediyurappa poiinted out. "The state has to bear this huge burden of additional relief for both the 2019 floods and the present floods," he said, adding that the state was "hard pressed" in providing relief since a significant portion of the State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) went towards Covid-19 containment. The current flods have resulted in 10 deaths and damages to 12,700 houses, Revenue Minister R Ashoka said. "Crop loss is reported in 6.3 lakh hectare land. Immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 is being released to all affected families," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/north-karnataka-floods-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-asks-pm-modi-for-rs-10000-crore-special-package-905662.html

Locals had petitioned the district administrations against it maintaining that final ESZ notification was issued without consulting them. Kannada and Culture Minister C T Ravi told DH that they recommended declaring only forest land as ESZ rather than including revenue villages in the same. “There are models in other states, where ESZ or buffer zones are declared based on the distance from the forest boundary, which also can be emulated,” hesaid.

22-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka to audit blood groups of critical Covid-19 patients||The recent publication of two international studies which stated that Covid-19 is more severe in patients with blood group A or AB, has pushed the state government into conducting an audit on the blood groups of critical patients. The studies, conducted in Denmark and Canada, have found that people with type O are less likely to catch Covid-19 or develop major complications and die. Meanwhile, individuals with blood types A and AB are most vulnerable to the disease. The state audit could be a boon, as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not undertaken a survey to check for the association of the ABO blood group for indices of disease severity in Covid-19 sufferers. The data collection, which began earlier this week, will trawl city and taluk hospitals for blood work results for critically ill and deceased Covid-19 patients. “We will be able to collate data in hospitals where they have collected it,” explained Dr Thrilok Chandra, Head, Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU), which oversees medical treatment of heavily symptomatic patients. Data available “There is already some data regarding blood tests, but it is not granular enough to make an assessment,” Dr Chandra added. One of the key challenges is that for most Covid-19 patients in India, blood group testing would not have been done at the outset, because investigating medicos are generally more preoccupied with critical investigations such as renal function tests (RFT) and checking for alarm markers. “Consequently, we will now have to forge through individual case sheets and find it. However, manpower is a challenge,” Dr Chandra explained. Some blood typing data is already available as part of the plasma programme. Dr Vishal Rao of HCG Hospital, who set up Karnataka’s plasma therapy programme, said that initial data suggests that there are no significant differences in outcomes from blood groups. “Out of 12 patients with AB type blood, mortality was 75%. Of 44 patients with Type A blood, mortality was 38%. However, mortality among 78 Type B patients was worse at 51.2%, while among 88 patients with Type O, 47.7% people died,” he said. He, however, added that this could be due to the efficacy of plasma therapy. Another large sample is Victoria Hospital, where over 6,000 Covid-19 patients have been subjected to routine bloodwork. “The study says type O’s are less likely to catch Covid-19 but our wards are full of them,” a government researcher said. However, data about the scale of severity among the various groups was unavailable. Dr C Shivram, head of transfusion services at Manipal Hospital said there are regional differences to be considered.“For example, Type AB blood is extremely rare in India,” he pointedout. “The true implication of the multinational study is why some blood groups have lesser antigens, which signifies reduced immunity,” Dr Vishal Rao said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-to-audit-blood-groups-of-critical-covid-19-patients-905345.html
22-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka fast emerging out of unemployment post-unlock as joblessness rate drops||Karnataka is emerging out of the unemployment crisis faster than the rest of the country. After the lockdown in August 2020, the unemployment rate in the state — which is dependent on knowledge-intensive and white-collar workforce — touched a low of 0.5% while it was 2.4% in September, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). In September, Maharashtra recorded an unemployment rate of 4.55%, Gujarat 3.4% and Tamil Nadu 5%. Karnataka’s unemployment rate is almost a third of the national rate (6.7%).  Two other states that have lower rates than Karnataka are Assam (1.2%) and Chhattisgarh (2%). The unemployment rate is the percent of the labour force that is jobless — the proportion of people who aren’t able to find a job despite an active search, as part of the total pool of available workforce. At the peak of the lockdown in April, the joblessness rate in Karnataka was 29.8% while the national average stood at 23.5%. However, as digital and IT services sectors picked up pace quicker than the manufacturing sector, the state saw a boost with a steep drop in the unemployment rate. "The primary difference is between knowledge and white-collar and non-white-collar workers. While knowledge workers are fully working from anywhere and are getting more opportunities due to expanded IT projects, it's the traditional sectors that are showing slower recovery," said, Lohit Bhatia, President Workforce Management, Quess Corp. However, some other experts also warn that the actual unemployment numbers might be way higher than the reported numbers, as reverse migration during the lockdown has led to a reduction in the labour participation rate (LRP) -- or simply put the total available pool of workers in a geographic area.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-fast-emerging-out-of-unemployment-post-unlock-as-joblessness-rate-drops-905349.html
22-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||False positives in rapid antigen tests are possible despite 98% specificity of tests: Experts||Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) are known to give false negative reports 50 per cent of the time but false positives in rapid antigen tests are also possible despite 98 per cent specificity of the tests, say experts. They say it is best to isolate asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients at home if the patient or the care provider has requested an RT-PCR test after a RAT positive test and if the test report is awaited as this prevents them from exposure to a Covid-19 ward in case it is a false positive. Karnataka currently tests only RAT negatives with RT-PCR. Test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease, whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease. Talking to DH, eminent epidemiologist, cardiologist and president of Public Health Foundation of India Dr Srinath Reddy cited US researchers saying, “There would be a staggering 6.5 million false-positive results each day” if a test with 98 per cent specificity is used every day for mass testing in each of the 325 million population of the US. He said despite the small 2 per cent false-positive possibility in RAT, 'when used for mass testing, the number of falsely identified persons are very high.' For the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to validate a RAT kit, the minimum acceptance criteria of sensitivity and specificity, as a Point of Care Test without transport to a laboratory setup, 50% and above, and 95% and above, respectively.  In a laboratory setup, with samples collected in Viral Transport Medium, the criteria are -- Sensitivity: 70% and above, and Specificity: 99% and above. Dr V Ravi, Senior Professor and Head, Neurovirology, NIMHANS, and member of State Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, told DH, "RAT positive is considered Covid-19 positive. There is no need for a confirmatory RT-PCR test. We cannot test everyone tested with RAT again with RT-PCR. Besides, it is neither the same sample nor the same day. A different sample is given for a confirmatory test on a different day." Patients can now get tested on demand even if asymptomatic. Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for state Covid-19 testing said, "If a patient is RAT positive and only has mild symptoms, he/she should get home isolated if an RT-PCR test report is awaited. It is not necessary to get hospitalised. There are other ways of corroborating a false positive too like an inflammatory marker test, an X-Ray, or a CT Scan. No test, even a gold standard one can be 100% accurate."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/false-positives-in-rapid-antigen-tests-are-possible-despite-98-specificity-of-tests-experts-905464.html

He is unfit to be in a civilised society. In the interest of their party and our state, Karnataka BJP should send him back to the caves,” Siddaramaiah tweeted. This retort was in response to a comment Kateel made referring to Siddaramaiah as ‘Huliya’ and KPCC president D K Shivakumar as ‘Kanakapurada Bande’. He said that the Huliya will be sent back to forest while the Bande will be shattered. Siddaramaiah also accused Kateel of working against Yediyurappa. “Nalin is the face of the anti-Yediyurappa squad within the state BJP. This squad is working tirelessly to lose in byelections and eventually blame B S Yediyurappa for the loss,” he said. Kateel sought to brush off Siddaramaiah’s retort by quipping that the ‘language’ used in the former CM’s tweets suggested that his account could have been hacked. “I am inclined to think that your account is hacked. If it’s true, file a police complaint as the language used in the tweets does not augur well with leaders like you. In case your account was not hacked, I sympathise with the manner in which you expressed your intolerance,” he said.

The court perused the submission that 35 protests were held in the jurisdiction of Ulsoorgate police station in Bengaluru. A division bench, headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, was hearing a PIL filed by Sai Datta, a social activist, seeking directions to the authorities for stricter implementation of the rules issued to stop the spreading ofCovid-19. The list provided by the Ulsoorgate police stated that there were 35 cases when people gathered in large numbers either for protests or for other reasons. The bench observed that the photographs revealed that there were large gatherings and a large number of people were seen not wearing masks and not following rules of social distancing. The advocate, representing the petitioner, stated that Maruthi Manpade, one of the leaders who had organised one such protest rally on September 25, unfortunately, died due to infection of Covid-19. “On the face of it, these are cases of gross violation of the rules of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. These gatherings are contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Therefore, the state and all the authorities must come down heavily on such breaches with heavy hands,” the bench said. The court extended the time granted to the respondents until November 5.

There was nothing to dislike in Modi's Tuesday's address, and the prime minister had a "radiant glow" on his face which will rid the country of its problems, the editorial in the Marathi daily said in a sarcastic tone. "What did prime minister Modi tell the countrymen through his address? What was new? Did he give any assurance to the flood-hit people in Maharashtra? Which monetary package was announced? All such criticism can be directed at the speech, however, the speech was short and effective," it said. The prime minister on Tuesday appealed to people to follow Covid-19 guidelines even though lockdown has ended, and warned that negligence can dampen the festive spirit. "Whatever he spoke about coronavirus, it was all true. He came, he spoke. His white beard, the radiant glow on his face....This glow will eradicate the darkness of calamities in the country," the editorial said. Modi talked about economic activities in the country is increased, but did not refer to the unemployment caused by the pandemic, it said. "Before the speech, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had appealed to the PM to talk about the Chinese incursion (in Ladakh) and when India will drive out Chinese soldiers. But Modi did not touch on a single issue," the Sena mouthpiece said. "His speech was short and crisp. In fact, the seven-to-eight minute-long coronavirus awareness address was one of the best speeches in the last seven months," it added. Referring to the demand to reopen temples in Maharashtra, the editorial said governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari must have noted that the prime minister said the places where crowding can happen can not be reopened so soon. Opposition BJP has been demanding that temples in Maharashtra be reopened, and Koshyari had written a caustic letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on the issue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pm-remained-mum-on-many-issues-but-speech-was-crisp-shiv-sena-905606.html

The court also ordered that along with result, votes cast by the contentious appointment of three government nominees, reportedly associated with BJP, be produced in the court in a sealed cover in the next hearing on November 24. The orders came on a petition moved by three Congress leaders including two sitting MLAs challenging the appointment of three nominees as government representative in the managing committee of the union. The petitioners have alleged that at the instance of BJP these appointments were made in order to create "artificial majority" to favour members belonging to the ruling party. In August, the polls for 13 seats of managing directors were held, out of which 9 seats went to a panel belonging current chairman Ramsinh Parmar and vice-chairman Rejendrasinh Parmar. Ramsinh is an ex-Congress MLA who joined BJP in 2017 while Rajendrasinh is a Congress MLA from Borsad. The BJP supporters won only 4 seats. The petitioners have alleged to the appointment of three members as government representative is only to create a majority. Justice Biren Vaishnav after hearing the case issued notice to the state government and directed to proceed with the polls to be held on Friday but barred from declaring the result. The order states, "It is clarified that votes cast by the three directors appointed, pursuant to the order dated 20.10.2020 shall be kept in a separate sealed cover. The results of the Election of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the petitioner society shall not be declared till the returnable date and shall be subject to further orders that may be passed on that date. The respondents shall place the sealed cover of the process of the election before this Court with an affidavit." The court will hear the matter on Saturday. The petition stated that Rajesh Pathak, one of the elected members and associated with BJP, is aspiring for the post of chairman or vice-chairman and has only three to four elected members in his support. The petition alleges that the registrar has sought "to exercise the powers colourably and with malafide intention to create an artificial majority in favour of the members belonging to the political party in power in the state."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-hc-orders-to-proceed-with-polls-for-amul-dairy-chairman-vice-chairman-posts-bars-from-announcing-results-905614.html

The police have already summoned Ranaut and her sister for questioning next week after a case was registered against them on the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate's order on another complaint. In his complaint before the Andheri Magistrate Court, lawyer Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh also accused Ranaut of sedition and causing disharmony between two religious groups through her tweets. The Bollywood actor had "no respect for varied communities of India, law of the land and authorised government bodies" and even made fun of the judiciary, it stated. Following the Bandra court's order to the police to register a First Information Report against her, Ranaut posted "malicious and defamatory" tweets against the judiciary, terming it as "Papu Sena", the complaint stated. The matter will be heard in the Andheri court on November 10. Last week, the Bandra Metropolitan Magistrate's court had ordered the police to investigate a complaint filed by Munawwar Ali Sayyed, a Bollywood casting director and fitness trainer, which referred to Ranaut's and her sister Rangoli Chandel's tweets and other statements. On the direction of the court, the Bandra police registered an FIR against Ranaut and her sister under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc), 295A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/complaint-filed-against-kangana-ranaut-for-tweet-about-judiciary-905627.html
22-10-2020||West||CBI being misused by BJP-govt: MVA||A day after stonewalling the banket entry of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Maharashtra, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government on Thursday said that the decision was fuelled by apprehensions of the apex investigative agency’s misuse. The Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress cited the example of the CBI registering a case into the TRP scam following the recommendations of the Uttar Pradesh government. The Maharashtra government’s Home Department has issued the order under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, withdrawing the ‘general consent’ given to the CBI since February 1989. Now the CBI will need to approach the government for permission before initiating any investigations on a case by case basis. Home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the Maharashtra Police and Mumbai Police are extremely capable of handling any cases. “However, in the recent past, many important, sensitive cases have been handed over to the CBI, due to political pressures,” said Deshmukh of the NCP. Thackeray’s close aide and Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said in the past that it has been noticed that CBI is being misused. “We have seen similar decisions have been taken in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and other governments,” he said. “If it is Maharashtra, there should be CBI, ED… The intention is to harass and defame the non-BJP ruled states, leaving us with no option but to block the CBI from probing any cases without our permission,” Raut pointed out. Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that in the past there have been several examples of CBI being misused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/cbi-being-misused-by-bjp-govt-mva-905630.html

Under the 'Kisan Suryodaya Yojana', which envisages providing day-time power supply for irrigation, farmers will get electricity from 5 am to 9 pm.  The state government has allocated a budget of Rs 3,500 crore for installing transmission infrastructure under this scheme by 2023. Over 234 '66-Kilowatt' transmission lines, with a total length of 3,490 circuit kilometres (CKM) will be established under the project, in addition to 220 KV substations, the statement said.  Dahod, Patan, Mahisagar, Panchmahal, Chhota Udepur, Kheda, Tapi, Valsad, Anand and Gir-Somnath have been included under the scheme for 2020-21.

22-10-2020||West||Maharashtra withdraws general consent to CBI operations||Maharashtra is the fifth state to withdraw general consent for CBI operations within its territory, a move that came in the backdrop of the central agency taking over a Lucknow police FIR to investigate alleged TRP manipulations by TV channels when Mumbai police was already probing the matter. The move comes amidst the opposition's allegations that the Centre is using the agency to circumvent investigations by the state police especially in the cases related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the TRP scam. The governments of West Bengal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh had recently withdrawn the general consent to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a kind of blanket nod for the agency to probe scheduled offences specified in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DPSE) Act, 1946.  The CBI also lacks a "general consent" from Mizoram. Unlike the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which has a countrywide jurisdiction to take over any case related to terrorism, the CBI requires consent of the state government under section 6 of the DPSE Act, the law that governs the agency's functioning. "The Central Government can authorize CBI to investigate such a crime in a State but only with the consent of the concerned State Government. The Supreme Court and High Courts, however, can order CBI to investigate such a crime anywhere in the country without the consent of the State," the CBI manual states. However, recently the Calcutta High Court had given reprieve to the CBI by allowing it to act against Central government officials in a state even without general consent, saying "...the Central Government/CBI's power to investigate and prosecute its own officials cannot be in any way impeded or interfered by the State even if the offenses were committed within the territory of the State...". Mizoram, while according consent to the extension of power and jurisdiction of DSPE in the state last year, put a condition that every individual case needed prior approval of the state government. The CBI probe into the TRP scam on the basis of a Lucknow police FIR became a flash point with the Maharashtra government, triggering the withdrawal of general consent to the agency by the state government on Wednesday. Mumbai police had busted the racket of Television Rating Point (TRP) manipulation on October 6, arresting four persons including two Marathi channel owners and two former employees of Hansa agency that has been involved in the process of determining the TRPs. TRPs are a tool to judge which TV programmes are viewed the most and also indicate the viewers' choice and channels' popularity. Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had told reporters that Republic TV news channel was involved in the racket and those responsible will be arrested, be it its director, promoter or any other employee. The channel had moved the Supreme Court seeking that the probe be handed over to the CBI among other requests. On October 15, however, the apex court refused to entertain the plea and asked the channel to move to Bombay High Court. On October 17, Uttar Pradesh police registered an FIR on a complaint from one Kamal Sharma, working with an advertising company and claiming that he has "reliable information" that "certain unknown accused" with a "common intention" entered with criminal conspiracy to manipulate TRPs. Within 24 hours, Additional Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh Awanish Kumar Awasthi recommended a CBI probe with an attached proforma stating that "preliminary investigation was started by the local police. During the deliberation of the said indictment, prima facie, facts related to Uttar Pradesh and other provinces have also come to light". On October 19, the Centre issued a notification asking the CBI "for furnishing comments regarding feasibility of undertaking the investigation into the matter". The very next day, the agency registered a case. Defending the decision of keeping the CBI out of Maharashtra, the state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said, "The CBI had been given a free pass by the earlier government. We have withdrawn it. We thought about political scores being settled through the CBI. So we have withdrawn the permission granted earlier to avoid such a thing happening. "Earlier, CBI had taken up the investigation in some cases. We are concerned about the use of CBI to intervene in the ongoing TRP scam and hence Maharashtra decided to withdraw its permission." Deshmukh said a Supreme Court judge, a few years ago, had described the CBI as the "government's parrot". "We want to avoid it happening now," the minister had said. Recently, the CBI has taken over an FIR registered by Patna Police into allegations of abetment to suicide in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput even when Mumbai Police was probing the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-withdraws-general-consent-to-cbi-operations-905712.html
22-10-2020||West||Gujarat bypolls: CM taunts Congress for going to resort amid Covid-19, party hits back||Hitting the campaign for the ensuing Assembly bypolls, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Thursday attacked Congress in an election rally claiming that instead of being with the people when coronavirus pandemic broke out earlier this year, the opposition party leaders were "drinking liquor and taking a dip in swimming pools in a resort in Jaipur."   Rupani was speaking at the rally while campaigning for party's Abdasa Assembly seat candidate Pradyumansinh Jadeja in Kutch district. Jadeja is among the five BJP candidates who left Congress earlier this year in the run up to Rajya Sabha polls helping the BJP glean three out of four seats despite not having required numbers. During the election time, a total of eight Congress MLAs resigned, out of which six joined BJP. To stop further defections, the Congress had to take its MLAs to Jaipur. Referring to the same, Rupani said that "Congress leaders never work for the betterment of people and during crisis they run away when needed. Earlier, they had run away to Bengaluru resort." He claimed that when the coronavirus pandemic started spreading and created fear among the people, his "goverment did everything to help people while Congress leaders ran awy." He said, "To ensure that people didn't face hardship, goverment took all effort. But Congress leaders were nowhere to be seen." The Congress hit back with data of illicit liquor trade busted in the state to say how "corrupt" the ruling BJP government is under whose rule liquor flows so easily in the state despite prohibition. In a statement, the Congress alleged that "BJP has been strangulating the democracy by buying legislatures to win elections." As the campaign heats up for the polls to be held on November 3, the Congress has also launched an aggresive campaign against the BJP. It has termed five of its turncoats, contesting on BJP tickets, as "Gaddar" (traitors). The result of the bypolls will not alter Rupani government in any manner, but it is widely perceived as a contest of prestige, specially for the BJP which chose defectors instead of its own workers. For Congress, winning majority of the seats will only boast party morale in the civic body polls next year and eventually in 2022 Assembly polls. Besides these two parties, the result is set to affect at least two of its leaders- Gujarat BJP president C R Patil and Congress's state working president Hardik Patel. This is the first election after their appointments to the post.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-bypolls-cm-taunts-congress-for-going-to-resort-amid-covid-19-party-hits-back-905726.html

The financial transactions that took place in the last five years are being examined, he said. "The Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch has started the process of scrutinising the financial transactions of these five channels that happened in the last five years," the official said. It will also examine their revenue sources, he said. "During the investigation conducted so far, it has been observed that there was a sudden spike in the number of transactions," he said, without giving any further details. The police will also slap sections related to forgery in the case, including IPC sections 408, 463, 465 and 468, he said. Meanwhile, the police recorded the statement of the CFO of the Republic TV channel S Sundaram on Thursday and he will again be called on Friday, the official said. Executive editor of the channel Niranjan Narayanswamy will also be called for questioning again, he said. The probe team has recorded the statement of Republic TV's distribution head Ghanshyam Singh in the case, he said. The alleged fake TRP scam came to light when rating agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint with the police through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain channels were rigging TRP numbers to lure advertisers. It was alleged that some families at whose houses meters for collecting data of viewership were installed were being bribed to tune into a particular channel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/trp-case-cops-scrutinise-financial-transactions-of-5-channels-905735.html
