26-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||No leadership change in Karnataka: Pralhad Joshi||Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi on Monday stated that the national or State BJP does not have any proposal for leadership change in the BJP government in Karnataka, while Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa is performing well. He also clarified that there is no proposal about Congress leaders M B Patil and Vinay Kulkarni coming to the BJP. Joshi charged that Leader of Opposition in Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah is politicising the issue of flood management and compensation. "In 10 years of UPA regime, the Centre provided Rs 4,609 crore compensation during natural calamities in Karnataka, against the demand of Rs 44,000 crore. Modi government provided Rs 11,753 crore in six years, and the demand was Rs 27,208 crore," he said. Large & Medium Scale Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar criticised the opposition saying that competition between D K Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah of Congress for the post of the chief minister was already on even as the position is not vacant. MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal's statement about leadership change is his personal view, which is observed by the party, and State BJP president would take suitable decision about his statement, Shettar added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/no-leadership-change-in-karnataka-pralhad-joshi-907155.html

The 88-year-old leader who joined the BJP in 2017 after cutting ties with the Congress of which he was a member for several decades, was speaking at Vijayadashami Utsav organised by the RSS in Bengaluru on Sunday. Krishna said the RSS founders were responsible for presenting the idea of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" before the nation. "This idea reflects the basis of the historical, cultural and moral ethos of our country," he said, adding, "I have served as a politician in several capacities and donned many a role and today I feel that the role of RSS is significant more than ever before." Krishna, a former chief minister and union external affairs minister, quit the Congress saying the party was “in a state of confusion” on whether it needed mass leaders or not. During the event, Krishna was presented with the signature RSS cap. The RSS is the ideological parent of the BJP. Stressing the importance of nationalism and patriotism, Krishna drew a parallel with countries like the USA that mandate every citizen to draft into the military or national service for at least two years. "This has also become a point of contention in the current US elections, with many criticising Donald Trump for failing to draft himself. People are alleging that he excused himself out by giving dubious reasons. India too, needs to place a similar mandate on its citizens. We have not done it thus far but it's never late," he said. Democracy in India also reflects the spirit of Hindu religion, he said. "Unlike the case of Trump who has not committed to peaceful transfer of power, leaders like Atal Bihari Vajapayee were willing to let go of power and happily worked in the opposition. This is the culture of detachment that Hindu religion represents," Krishna said. There were scores of RSS workers who had dedicated their entire life to the service of the nation, according to Krishna who believed that patriotism was a "vaccine" that needed to be administered to children at a young age. He further opined that India's education system was unfortunately based on western ideas and needed a shift in focus. RSS had a role to play towards this end, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/rss-role-more-significant-than-ever-in-india-senior-bjp-leader-s-m-krishna-907187.html
26-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka bypolls: Congress moves EC over set-top box freebies to voters||The D K Shivakumar-led Congress on Monday moved the Election Commission with a complaint that BJP’s Rajarajeshwarinagar candidate Munirathna distributed set-top boxes to voters ahead of the November 3 bypoll. “One candidate has his photo on set-top boxes being distributed in the name of his company. If the Election Commission is alive and if they want to protect the law, they must take action. The candidate himself has admitted that he’s doing it,” Shivakumar, the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, told reporters. Shivakumar said Munirathna should be booked under IPC section 171 (A-D) and under section 123 of the Representation of the People Act. “The returning officer should take immediate action.” A Congress delegation submitted a formal complaint to Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar. The Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll has become a high-voltage contest with the Congress having fielded debutant Kusuma Hanumantharayappa to go up against BJP’s Munirathna, who was disqualified last year under the anti-defection law. The JD(S) has fielded local clansman Krishnamurthy V. Speaking to reporters, Munirathna virtually admitted that set-top boxes were being given to voters. “That's my profession,” he said. “(Shivakumar) also runs a cable network. He's a businessman, too. We’re both doing our business. Whatever complaint is filed against me holds good for (him) also,” he added. A recent Congress survey showed that Munirathna was looking to strengthen his “hold” in slum areas through his interests in the cable television business. In his election affidavit, Munirathna, a film producer, has declared his links with Munirathna Telecommunications Pvt Ltd, Rockline Telecommunications Pvt Ltd among other firms in the television/entertainment industry. Shivakumar also denied the BJP’s charge that he was making attempts to consolidate the Vokkaliga votes in favour of the party’s candidate Kusuma, who belongs to the community that has a sizable number of votes in Rajarajeshwarinagar. “What caste? Why are they so fearful? The Congress itself is our caste. Where have I indulged in caste politics? Some community leaders would’ve held meetings,” he said. Citing the example of Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa publicly asking Veerashaiva-Lingayats to vote for the BJP during the December 2019 bypolls, Shivakumar said: “Have I made such a speech?”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-bypolls-congress-moves-ec-over-set-top-box-freebies-to-voters-907231.html

26-10-2020||National||Narendra Modi, BJP conjuring 'sinister conspiracies' behind every act of opposition: Sonia Gandhi||India, the world's largest democracy, is facing a serious crisis with the government diverting attention away from real issues by raising bogus threats to 'national security', Congress President Sonia Gandhi has claimed. She also alleged that institutions that are supposed to uphold citizens' rights are being co-opted or subverted. The Congress chief, in a scathing critique of the Modi government wrote that at a time when the nation is facing genuine threats that need to be dealt with, BJP government is conjuring 'sinister conspiracies' behind every activity they perceive as being opposed to them. She cited examples of threats issued by BJP leaders during the Shaheen Bagh protests, and accused the party of creating the conditions which resulted in violence in northeast Delhi. She said that the Modi government began its campaign against its political opponents early in 2014, branding them as enemies of India, and unleashing the 'most draconian laws' in the country's penal code against every protester who disagreed with the BJP publicly, starting with sedition cases against student leaders at JNU, and expanding to activists, scholars and intellectuals. The Modi government leaves no scope for exaggeration, Gandhi said, adding that the government has pressed every part of the State into service against its opponents, be it the Police, the ED, the CBI, the NIA and even the NCB. "These agencies now dance only to the tune of the Prime Minister and home minister’s office." she said. While the BJP has often criticised Congress and Indira Gandhi's emergency for curbing individual freedoms, Sonia Gandhi took this opportunity to turn the tables and cite how the current regime has 'poisoned' politics and society. While the BJP is free to propagate its political ideology under the Constitution, "to paint genuine civil society leaders as evil conspirators and terrorists is to burn the bridges of communication with the common people, on whose behalf they (BJP) speak." Emphasising the importance of the common man, she added that citizens do not cease to be so if the party they vote for loses elections. She accused the BJP, which claims to work for 130 crore Indians, of treating its opponents as second-class citizens without democratic rights. "They (citizens), and only they, are the nation", she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/narendra-modi-bjp-conjuring-sinister-conspiracies-behind-every-act-of-opposition-sonia-gandhi-907015.html

The search for a suitable vaccine for Covid-19 has almost come to the final stage, Dr E Venkata Rao, Principal Investigator in the COVAXIN human trial and Professor in the Department of Community Medicine at the Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital here said on Sunday. IMS and SUM Hospital is among the 21 medical institutes selected across the country by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) where the third phase trial would be conducted. The indigenous vaccine, being developed by ICMR and Bharat Biotech has received the approval of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for initiating the third phase trial. After completion of the first and second phase of the trial with demonstrable safety profile and immunogenicity, the large-scale efficacy trial involving thousands of volunteers has been planned now, Dr Rao said. Dr Rao, who is the head of the Preventive and Therapeutic Clinical Trial Unit (PTCTU), said during this phase the age limit and eligibility/ screening criteria would be relaxed and several volunteers who are otherwise apparently healthy would be recruited for the trial. Like the previous phases, half of the volunteers would receive placebo and the remaining half would be administered COVAXIN in this phase. Even health care workers would be recruited for the trial. The volunteers would be followed up over a considerable period of time to look at the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the development of the Corona disease, he said. Rao said there had been a huge response and enthusiasm among people who had offered themselves to be volunteers for the trial. He said persons above 18 years will be taken for the human trial. The interested volunteers for the project could enrol themselves for the trial by registering online at www.ptctu.soa.ac under the section register for clinical trials, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-biotechs-covaxin-phase-iii-trials-to-begin-in-bhubaneswar-soon-907043.html
26-10-2020||National||Coal scam: Former Minister Dilip Ray, others awarded 3-year jail term by Delhi court||A Delhi court Monday awarded 3-year jail term to former Union minister Dilip Ray in a coal scam case pertaining to irregularities in the allocation of a Jharkhand block in 1999, saying white-collar crimes are "more dangerous" than ordinary ones because of the "damages inflicted on public morale". Besides Ray, the 68-year old former minister of state (coal) in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Special Judge Bharat Parashar also awarded 3-year jail term each to two senior officials of the ministry at that time -- Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam, both about 80-year-old. The court also awarded 3-year jail term to Castron Technologies Ltd (CTL) director Mahendra Kumar Agarwalla (75). The court, however, granted bail to the convict persons to enable them to approach the high court against the verdict. It also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Ray, Rs 2 lakh on Banerjee and Gautam, while Agarwalla was asked to pay a fine of Rs 60 lakh. It imposed Rs 60 lakh on CTL and Rs 10 lakh on Castron Mining Ltd (CML), also held guilty in the case. In response to the convicts' argument that no loss was caused to anyone in the matter “since almost the entire amount of extracted coal was surrendered to the government, the court said, non-availability of sufficient raw material such as coal has in fact resulted in the lack of infrastructural/ industrial development of the country. “Had coal block been allocated to a deserving applicant company after following the due process of law and the company would have proceeded to extract coal so as to use it captively in its end use project then it would have certainly added to the infrastructural/ industrial development of the country. “...arbitrary allocation of coal blocks as has been seen in the present matter to unscrupulous persons who never intended to establish any end use project in itself has caused huge loss to the nation which is difficult to be computable in monetary terms,” the court said. The court said the case involved commission of white collar crimes and that too by people occupying high places in the society.  “Such 'white collar crimes' are in fact more dangerous to the society than ordinary crimes, firstly, because the financial losses are much higher, and, secondly because of the damages inflicted on public morale... “In fact white collar crimes are a peculiar feature of an acquisitive and affluent society and even though our society can not be strictly termed as an affluent society but it is certainly becoming acquisitive,” the judge said. While refusing to release the convicts on probation, the judge said, “keeping in view the peculiar nature of facts and circumstances of the present case coupled with the gravity of offence, though none of the convict persons deserve to be extended the benefit of probation but even otherwise as the offence under section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) of IPC is punishable with imprisonment up to life, so the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act do not apply.” The convicts had urged the court to take a lenient view considering their old age and that they were never convicted earlier. The CBI, represented by public prosecutors V K Sharma and A P Singh, however, had sought maximum punishment for the convicts. The court had convicted all the five accused persons for various offences including criminal conspiracy (120-B of IPC), criminal breach of trust by public servant (409 of IPC), cheating (420 of IPC) and corruption (PC Act). It had convicted sixth accused - CML - for theft (379 of IPC). Regarding Ray, the judge had said that he “dishonestly facilitated allocation of the abandoned non-nationalised coal mining area in favour of CTL and that too in violation of the direction of law.” “He thus dishonestly allowed misappropriation of the said coal mining area by company CTL,” he said. The case pertains to allocation of Brahmadiha coal block in Giridih in Jharkhand to CTL in 1999.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/coal-scam-former-minister-dilip-ray-others-awarded-3-year-jail-term-by-delhi-court-907047.html
26-10-2020||National||A flu shot may help you check pollution impact after Covid-19 recovery||If you have recovered from the novel coronavirus and you reside in a high air pollution zone, clinicians recommend getting a flu shot to lower severity of post-recovery symptoms and also protect against flu infection.  Earlier, experts had suggested that air pollution may increase the transmissibility of Covid-19, making people more vulnerable to the disease and aggravating the Covid-19 situation. They had also warned that those who have had the infection in the past may also have to face new challenges.  According to UK-based patient group LongCovidSOS, data from a King’s College London-devised symptom tracker app shows that 10 per cent of Covid-19 patients remain unwell after three weeks, and up to five per cent may continue to be sick for months. Another study quoted by the publication report found that 87 per cent of 143 patients in Rome suffered from 'long Covid' symptoms for nearly two months after they had recovered. Ongoing illness after infection with Covid-19 is often called 'long Covid'. Some of the common symptoms people suffer from include Cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, joint pain, muscle aches, and lungs, heart, and kidney damage. “Hundreds of Covid-19 patients have been treated at Apollo Hospitals and what we’ve found in large follow-ups is that patients who had pneumonia on chest X-ray, needed oxygen or respiratory support have persistent symptoms beyond recovery, such as a nagging cough, breathlessness while walking, fall in exercise tolerance and chronic fatigue. Older adults and people on oxygen support are at maximum risk, but it doesn’t happen only to people in ICU. "I recommend an annual flu vaccine to all recovered Covid-19 patients and a pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia to people before the age of 65 to protect them from chronic respiratory diseases when the weather turns cold and pollution level peaks,” Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals in Delhi told the publication. Dr Vivek Nangia who practices at Delhi's Max Super Speciality Hospital pointed out a study which has been published by Harvard Medical School. "They have shown that with every 1 micron per metre rise in PM 2.5 particles, there's an eight per cent increase in the mortality. Indeed, a tough time for post-Covid patients is in store," he had told PTI.

Rahul said even Bhagwat knew the truth about Chinese intrusion but was “scared” to face it. “Deep inside, Mr Bhagwat knows the truth. He is just scared to face it. The truth is China has taken our land and the Government of India & RSS have allowed it,” the former Congress President said responding to the RSS chief customary Vijaya Dashmi speech. In his speech on Sunday, Bhagwat had admitted the Chinese intrusion but claimed that India’s firm response had shocked China. “India stood firmly. China was shocked at the response given by India. The setback — economically and strategically — was good enough. China would not have anticipated it,” the RSS chief had said. Congress has been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of Chinese intrusion, accusing him of not naming China and the transgressions in Ladakh in his public interactions. Congress has also been demanding restoration of status quo ante along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh to the position as it existed in April 2020.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-government-rss-allowed-china-to-occupy-indian-territory-rahul-gandhi-907086.html

A bench of Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and Hrishikesh Roy ordered stay on the contempt proceedings pending in the High Court against ex CMs who have not yet started paying rent. The court issued notice to the Uttarakhand government and tagged the matter along with other similar petitions. Former Chief Ministers B C Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, Vijay Bahuguna and Narayan Dutt Tiwari are also parties to the matter. The HC had, on May 3, last directed the former CMs to pay market rent for the period for which they occupied the government bungalows after demitting office.

According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) figures, India’s unemployment rate is 6.7% which means J&K has a much higher unemployment rate than the national average. Rajasthan has reported a 19.7% unemployment rate which is the highest. The unemployment rates are produced by CMIE using its Consumer Pyramids Household Survey machinery. According to the periodic labour force survey of urban areas for July-September 2019, Jammu and Kashmir was among six states that saw rising joblessness. The other states are Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Besides, other data sources also indicate the severity of unemployment in J&K in the last 12 months.  For example, the employment registration carried out by the Directorate of Employment last year witnessed three lakh registrations by post graduates and PHD degree holders. According to the 2011 census, the total population of the insurgency-hit Himalayan region is 1.25 crore. More than 70% of the population in J&K is below 35 years of age and chronic unemployment and under-employment have spawned the problem. The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries also in its preliminary report suggested that five lakh job losses were recorded in Kashmir region only post abrogation of Article 370 last August which was followed by lockdown to combat Covid-19 pandemic in March. Many unemployed youths believe that mis-governance, poor administration and corruption have been the biggest problems in J&K. “Earlier the jobs in the government sector were distributed by ministers, bureaucrats and top officials among their kith and kin. After abrogation of Article 370, no jobs are being advertised and our future seems to be bleak,” said Suhail Ahmad, a post-graduate in Science. After the abrogation of Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation had said the move would usher in a new dawn in the region and his government was committed to fill up all vacant job posts. In the months that followed, the government reiterated that it would create new jobs and fill up thousands of vacant posts on a fast-track basis. But more than 14 months on, these job promises have fallen flat and J&K’s unemployment graph is soaring. A few months back, J&K Service Selection Board advertisement for 8000 class IV jobs saw a whopping 5.4 lakh aspirants applying. Dr Asima Hassan, who has done research on youth in Kashmir, says one of the causes behind the rising drug addiction in Kashmir is unemployment. “Due to unemployment, marriages are not held at a proper time. It also causes depression and pushes youths towards drug addiction. When there are no jobs, it impacts society negatively,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/at-162-jammu-and-kashmir-has-second-worst-unemployment-rate-in-the-country-907096.html

Rahul Gandhi termed the Punjab incident as a “dangerous precedent” and urged the Prime Minister to reach out to the farmers in the state and provide a healing touch. Nadda hit out at the Congress, and described the burning of the Prime Minister’s effigy as a “Rahul Gandhi-directed drama”. “The Rahul Gandhi-directed drama of burning PM’s effigy in Punjab is shameful but not unexpected,” the BJP President said. “After all, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has NEVER respected the office of the PM. This was seen in the institutional weakening of the PM’s authority during the UPA years of 2004-2014,” Nadda said in a tweet. The Rahul Gandhi-directed drama of burning PM’s effigy in Punjab is shameful but not unexpected. After all, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has NEVER respected the office of the PM. This was seen in the institutional weakening of the PM’s authority during the UPA years of 2004-2014. Farmers in Punjab have been protesting the passage of the three farm sector laws, which they believe would put an end to the minimum support price regime for agri produce in the country. Punjab assembly had passed bills rejecting the three farm sector laws passed by the Centre in September. Congress-ruled states of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan are scheduled to pass similar legislations in their respective assemblies. BJP has accused the Congress of misleading the farmers and asserted that the MSP regime would continue. It has been arguing that the new laws allow them to sell their produce anywhere in the country by easing the curbs and restrictions under the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nadda-rahul-face-off-over-effigy-burning-of-pm-modi-in-punjab-907125.html

Disha, 28, died on June 8 after falling off the 14th floor of a residential building in Malad in west Mumbai. Six days later, on June 14, 34-year-old Rajput was found hanging in his Bandra home. The matter came up for hearing before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde. “Why don't you go to the Bombay High Court? They know the case and they will take an informed decision and then you may come here if there is any difficulty,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked the petitioner's counsel. The petition was filed by advocate Puneet Dhanda who claimed that the deaths of Salian and Rajput are interconnected as they occurred under suspicious circumstances. Advocate Vineet Dhanda, appearing for the petitioner, said a CBI probe was ordered in a similar connected case. “You may be having a case or not. But why are you not going to the high court? What is wrong with the Bombay High Court. They know all officers and they have evidence. Come here if you have a problem,” the bench said while allowing the petitioner to withdraw the plea with the liberty to approach the high court. According to the plea, “...after the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, various rumours and conspiracy theories have been linked between the deaths of Disha and Sushant, because both died in suspicious circumstances and at the peak of their successful professional career.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-petitioner-seeking-cbi-probe-into-disha-salian-s-death-to-approach-bombay-hc-907128.html

The BJP workers were protesting PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s recent remarks that she would hold the tricolor only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state of J&K was restored. Following Mufti’s remarks, the BJP accused her of “disrespecting” the national flag. Reports said some BJP workers tried to hoist the national flag at the Ghanta Ghar. But they were prevented from unfurling the tricolor and three among them were detained by the Police at Kothibagh police station. Ahead of detention, one of the workers identified as Basharat told reporters that they wanted to hoist tricolor to send a message to members of Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). “Our message is for Mehbooba Mufti, Omar Abdullah and all other members of the alliance that only tri-color will be unfurled in Kashmir,” he said. The PAGD was formed recently by six political parties in Kashmir to restore the special status of the erstwhile state. The parties include Mehbooba’s PDP, National Conference, CPI (M), Awami National Conference, J&K People’s Conference and J&K Peoples Movement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-workers-detained-for-trying-to-hoist-tricolour-in-srinagar-907138.html
26-10-2020||National||India's Covid-19 fatality rate at 1.50%, lowest since March 22||India's Covid-19 fatality rate has dropped to 1.50 per cent, the lowest since March 22, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday crediting the focused efforts of the Centre, states and UTs on effective clinical management of hospitalised cases. There are 14 states and Union Territories including Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Odisha, Assam and Kerala where the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) is lower than one per cent, the ministry said. With an effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on holistic standard of care protocol across government and private hospitals, the number of new deaths has significantly dipped, it said. Less than 500 deaths (480) have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country, according to the data updated at 8 am on Monday. "India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. The case fatality rate is lowest since March 22 and is continuously declining," the ministry said as it underlined that the case fatality rate was 3.23 per cent on May 4. As part of the Covid-19 management and response policy, the Centre has had a sharp focus on not only containing the spread of the disease but to reduce deaths and save lives by providing quality clinical care to critical and severe patients, the ministry said. Collaborative efforts of the Centre, states, and union territories have resulted in strengthening of the health facilities across the country. Presently, 2,218 dedicated Covid hospitals are providing quality medical care, it said. As part of a unique initiative to build the capacities of ICU doctors in clinical management of critical patients towards reducing fatalities, e-ICU has been started by AIIMS, New Delhi, it said. Twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, tele/video-consultation sessions are held by knowledge and domain experts for doctors manning the ICUs in the state hospitals. These sessions started from July 8. Till date, 25 tele-sessions have been held, and 393 institutions across 34 states and UTs have participated in them. Also, many states have conducted population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with comorbidities.  This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities. At the ground level, frontline health workers like ASHAs and ANMs have done a commendable job of managing the migrant population and to enhance awareness at the community level, the ministry said. "As a result, there are 14 states and UTs with CFR lower than 1 per cent," the ministry underscored. The ministry said that 59,105 new recoveries were added in a span of 24 hours as against 45,148 new infections being reported during the same period.  The total number of recoveries have crossed 71 lakh (71,37,228). A higher number of single-day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is 90.23 per cent at present, the ministry highlighted. "India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases. Presently the active cases comprise merely 8.26 per cent of the total caseload of the country standing at 6,53,717. This is the lowest since August 13 when the active cases were 6,53,622," the ministry said. Seventy-eight per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and a UT -- Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Karnataka has contributed the maximum to the single-day recoveries with more than 10,000 cases followed by Kerala with more than 7,000 cases. A total 45,148 new coronavirus infections were registered in a day in the country on Monday which is "the lowest since July 22 when 37,000 new cases were added", the ministry said. Eighty-two per cent of the new cases are from 10 states and a UT -- Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha.  Kerala and Maharashtra contributed the maximum to the new confirmed cases with more than 6,000 cases each followed by Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal with more than 4,000 cases, the ministry said. Also, 480 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 80 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and a UT -- Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. More than 23 per cent of the new fatalities were reported from Maharashtra (112 deaths).  India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to  79,09,959 with  45,148  new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,19,014 with 480 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am on Monday showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-covid-19-fatality-rate-at-150-lowest-since-march-22-907140.html

Joined by Defense Secretary Mark Esper for the two-day visit, Pompeo will hold top-level talks following a spike in tensions between India and China since a deadly border clash in June. India has sought US cold weather equipment as the showdown goes into the freezing Himalayan winter and officials said this could be raised when Pompeo and Esper meet India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. The world's two biggest democracies are expected to sign an agreement on sharing geo-spatial intelligence, paving the way for the United States to ship sophisticated missile technology, officials said. Esper will also be discussing ways to increase cooperation between the two countries' military forces. This could include intelligence sharing, stepping up joint exercises, and arms sales -- including possibly US F-18 fighter jets. Pompeo will go on from India to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia, all of which have a key role in Indian Ocean maritime traffic where China has cast a greater shadow. The secretary of state said ahead of the trip that his meetings would "include discussions on how free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mike-pompeo-in-india-for-talks-on-china-threats-907145.html

In a statement, the Guild said it was painful to see the "unedifying spectacle of hundreds of FIRs" being filed against journalists of Republic TV, which is under probe for allegedly manipulating Television Rating Points (TRPs) and spreading discontent against the Mumbai police. Asserting that it did not wish to influence the probe by the authorities, the Guild said it recognised it has the potential to bring in much-needed transparency on the manipulation of popularity, and creation of “proceeds of crime” as claimed by the police. However, it added, "but the victimization of the journalists should immediately stop. The use of arbitrary state power is not and has never been in the interests of working journalists." The Guild said the stand-off between the Mumbai Police and Republic TV was "unprecedented and threatens the tenuous but important" balance between media freedom and the imperative for it to reside within the rule of law. "Right to free speech does not mean a licence to promote hate speech," it said. “It is high time the channel behaves responsibly and not compromises the safety of its journalists as well as hurt the collective credibility of the media. The police must ensure that its investigation does not hurt the channel’s journalists or makes any arrests. And that the investigation does not become a tool to suppress media rights," it added. Mumbai Police has registered a case in which it has accused Republic TV of manipulating TRP. In turn, the Republic TV has accused Mumbai Police of targeting it for its high-octane coverage of the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, which had attracted criticism from several quarters. "Besides the unsavoury details pertaining to the manipulation of TRPs, the Republic TV’s high-strung conduct during the unfortunate demise of film actor, Sushant Singh Rajput also raises issues about media credibility and the limits to reporting," the Guild said. It referred to the Mumbai High Court recently asking the channel's lawyer about harangue directed at actress Rhea Chakraborty. "The High Court asked a question that must be addressed by all: Is this part of investigative journalism? Asking the public about their opinion on who should be arrested? Also, the bench wondered whether the channel in the name of investigative journalism was encroaching into the domain of police." Similar reservations about its conduct have been expressed even by News Broadcaster’s association (NBA) that disagrees with its reporting, the Guild said. "These are important issues that should have been resolved long ago, but were allowed to fester,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/high-time-republic-tv-behaves-responsibly-object-use-of-arbitrary-state-power-against-journalists-editors-guild-907204.html

The actor, who has been vocal about her criticism of the state government’s handling of the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and labelled Bollywood a drug haven, lashed out against Thackeray a day after his Dussehra address. "People who have no means of livelihood in their home come to Mumbai and betray it. Calling Mumbai PoK is in fact the failure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had said he would get back PoK into India," Thackeray said on Sunday. Ranaut’s remark equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir had led to a furore, drawing the battle-lines between the Shiv Sena and her. "Those crying for justice for Bihar's son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra's son," the chief minister said at the Sena's annual Dussehra rally,, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Rajput death case.   Ranaut, known for her provocative statements, struck back in a series of tweets and a video on the social media platform and said Thackeray had abused her in his speech by calling her ‘namak haraam’.   "As a chief minister, you have let down an entire state only because you are angry with a woman who is of your son's age. You were very angry with me when I compared Mumbai with (Pok) after I was threatened because slogans of 'Free Kashmir' were raised there. Your 'Sonia Sena' had defended all that, that's why I had compared it with PoK,” she said in the video.  The actor said Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had abused her and now it was Thackeray. “Shame on you, I am your son’s age. This is how you speak to a self-made single woman. Chief minister, you are the worst product of nepotism.” She also took umbrage at Thackeray’s reference to ‘ganja fields’ in Himachal Pradesh and said it is actually ‘dev bhoomi’, land of the Gods.            “What I want to tell you is: governments come and go. You are just a government servant and the people of Maharashtra are not happy with you. Governments come and go but if a person loses respect, he can't get it back,” she said. The actor said opportunities that Mumbai offered belong to everyone and both Himachal Pradesh and Mumbai were her homes.   Ranaut has been in the headlines for locking horns with the Shiv Sena following Rajput’s death, be it for criticising Mumbai Police over its investigation into the case or lambasting the film industry for alleged drug use.   Ranaut had again compared Mumbai with PoK after the Shiv Sena-led BMC demolished "illegal alterations" at her Bandra bungalow. She also said the Maharashtra government was trying to put her in jail after a complaint against her at a Mumbai court for "spreading hate and breaking the brotherhood, integrity of the country" through her provocative statements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kangana-calls-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-worst-product-of-nepotism-907223.html

A survey has now shown that almost three in every four people say that they would not visit the cinemas for the next two months due to fear of Covid-19. Those surveyed were asked, "now that the multiplexes and theatres are open in many states and the remaining states will also open them soon, will they be going to watch a movie in the next 60 days?" According to the survey by LocalCircles, only 4% said they would go to watch if any new releases come and 3% said they will go regardless of new or old movie. This means that only 7% of the 8,274 responses from across the country said they would be visiting the theatres in the next two months. It said 74% said they will not go while 2% were unsure and 17% said they don’t watch movies in theatres. The government had allowed the opening of cinema halls and multiplexes from October 15, almost seven months after it was closed due to the pandemic. States like Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have opened theatres and multiplexes while cinema halls remain closed in states like Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and many north-eastern states. Going to the theatre to watch a movie was one of people’s favourite pastimes but the Covid-19 pandemic has forced them to stay indoors and watch movies on OTT platforms, the survey said. A handful of movies, including ‘Ponmagal Vanthal’, ‘C U Soon’ and ‘A Halal Love Story’, were released on OTT platforms. Similar surveys conducted in the past few months had shown that 72% said in July that they were not going to theatres and multiplexes when they open while it rose to 77% in August. In October, it came down to 74%.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/coronavirus-lockdown-74-of-indians-still-not-willing-to-visit-cinemas-says-survey-907234.html

"We were thinking of asking the government to give us a satellite for better network and connectivity for virtual courts. Satellites are not that costly now. You also have many satellites in sky. We could use one," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said. The court, however, added, "But we will be okay if we get access to the optical fiber network." The court said it needs access to optical fibre network for better video conferencing for courts across the country. Senior advocate Harish Salve pointed out Jio has the best optical fibre network. The court asked him to make a formal suggestion in writing with the e-committee. Senior advocate and former president of Supreme Court Bar Association, Vikas Singh suggested measures for use of better technology for conducting hearings in the courts. Attorney General K K Venugopal  said, "live-streaming of proceedings should be something on the court's mind." Singh pointed out there was a judgment for live-streaming "There are problems which should not be discussed publicly.There are certain abuses of it. We will take a decision soon enough, otherwise successive Chief Justices will do," the bench said. In view of Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court had on April 6 authorised all the courts to adopt measures required to ensure  robust functioning of the judicial system through the use of video conferencing technologies. The court had then registered a Suo Motu case 'In Re Guidelines for court functioning through video conferencing during Covid-19 pandemic". "Faced with the unprecedented and extraordinary outbreak of a pandemic, it is necessary that courts at all levels respond to the call of social distancing and ensure that court premises do not contribute to the spread of virus. This is not a matter of discretion but of duty," the bench had then said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-supports-use-of-dedicated-satellite-for-better-network-for-virtual-courts-907257.html

On Saturday night Railway Protection Force (RPF)  from Lalitpur Railway Station in Uttar Pradesh received a complaint from a woman who said that her daughter was kidnapped from home near the station and suspected that they might have boarded a train. When RPF scanned CCTV footage, it was found that a person with a girl had boarded the Raptisagar Express train at 5.57 pm on Saturday, and the train had left the station. Soon the RPF staff swang into action and alerted railway operating control in Bhopal, which was the next destination of the train. The RPF requested railways not to stop train enroute to prevent kidnapper deboarding it, a senior railway official said here. The railway ensured that the train reaches Bhopal staton at 9.15 pm without halting enroute station covering the 201 km journey. Interestingly, the train did not have an official halt in enroute stations between Lalitpur to Bhopal but had only technical halts. The railways also ensured that the train did not stop even for technical halt and gave the route a clear signal so that it reaches Bhopal quickly. When the train reached Bhopal, the RPF men searched the train and were able to reacue that child and arrest the accused, said the official. The RPF officials handed over child to its family safely, the official added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/train-made-to-run-non-stop-to-rescue-child-from-kidnapper-907259.html
26-10-2020||National||India's energy will energise the world; to up oil refining capacity to 450 million tonnes by 2025: PM Modi||With the pandemic pummelling global demand, India will drive the energy consumption in the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday as he pitched for global oil and gas suppliers to adopt responsible pricing and move towards transparent and flexible markets. Speaking at the 4th India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, he showcased his government's reforms in oil and gas exploration licensing policy and natural gas marketing as well as unveiled an ambitious plan to almost double refining capacity. This while sticking to India's commitment to reduce carbon footprint, he said, adding the nation was on track to meet its target of generating 175 gigawatts of electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind by 2022. "The theme (of the conference) this year is relevant. It is - 'India's Energy Future in a world of change'. I can assure you India is full of energy. India's energy future is bright and secure," he said. "India's energy will energise the world." The Prime Minister said 2020 has been a challenging year for the energy sector globally, with demand falling by almost one-third. Also, there were bouts of price instability and investment decisions were impacted. "Leading global bodies project that there will be a contraction in global energy demand over the next few years also. But, these agencies project India to emerge as a leading energy consumer. India is set to nearly double its energy consumption over the long term," he said. India consumes 5 million barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. The Prime Minister, however, added that energy suppliers should adopt responsible pricing. "For too long, the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster. We need to move towards responsible pricing. We have to work towards transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas," he said. Stating that there were many areas of vibrancy, Modi said India is the third-largest and the fastest-growing aviation market and domestic carriers are projected to double their fleet size to 1,200 by 2024. "India believes that access to energy must be affordable and reliable," he said. Even during the pandemic, investment flowed through the oil and gas value chain. India's energy plan aims to ensure energy justice while fully meeting its global commitments of a smaller carbon footprint, he emphasised. "Our energy sector will be growth-centric, industry-friendly, and environment conscious. That is why, India is among the most active nations in furthering renewable sources of energy," he said. "India is the most attractive emerging market for clean energy investment." India, he said, was well on track to meet its commitment on carbon emissions. "We had aimed to increase the renewable energy installed capacity by 175 GW by 2022. We have further extended this goal to 450 GW by 2030. India has one of the lowest carbon emissions than the rest of the industrialised world. Yet, we will continue to make efforts to fight climate change," he said. Highlighting recent efforts of his government, Modi said India has achieved 100 per cent electrification and LPG coverage has increased. Distribution of over 36 crore energy-efficient LED bulbs and installation of 1.1 crore smart LED street-lights have saved 60 billion units of energy annually, reduced green-house gas emission by over 4.5 crore tonnes and saved Rs 24,000 crore in the energy bill. On reforms in the energy sector, he said in February 2019 changes were made in oil and gas exploration and licensing policy to shift focus from revenue maximisation to raising production. Also, increasing gas production to help achieve the goal of a gas-based economy was a priority, he said, adding greater marketing freedom was granted earlier this month. "We plan to grow our refining capacities from about 250 to 400 million tonnes per annum by 2025" to sync fuel production with rising demand, he said. The 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' or self-reliant India campaign will be a force multiplier for the global economy, the Prime Minister said. India's energy map will have seven key drivers -- accelerating efforts to move towards a gas-based economy, cleaner use of fossil fuels particularly petroleum and coal, greater reliance on domestic sources to drive bio-fuels, achieving the renewables target of 450 GW by 2030, increasing the contribution of electricity to de-carbonise mobility, moving into emerging fuels including hydrogen and digital innovation across all the energy systems, he said. "There will be continuity of these robust energy policies that have been in place over the last six years," Modi added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-energy-will-energise-the-world-to-up-oil-refining-capacity-to-450-million-tonnes-by-2025-pm-modi-907264.html
26-10-2020||National||UK court rejects Nirav Modi's bail plea for seventh time||A UK court on Monday rejected the latest bail plea of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who has been lodged in a London prison since his arrest on an extradition warrant in March last year. The application was reportedly made on the basis of "new evidence", but Westminster Magistrates’ Court District Judge Samuel Goozee was not convinced to reverse previous bail rejections in Modi's case. The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition to India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, has made around six previous attempts at bail – at the magistrates’ court as well as at the High Court level. However, each of the applications, which came with an offer stringent conditions akin to house arrest and a bail bond security of 4 million pounds, have been rejected each time as he has been deemed to have the financial means and motivation to abscond. "The repeated rejection of bail application is a result of excellent coordination among the CBI, the Ministry of External Affairs and Crown Prosecution Service of the United Kingdom," a senior CBI official said in New Delhi, commenting on Monday's development. At Modi’s last High Court bail hearing in March this year, Justice Ian Dove had said, "My central concern of a risk of absconding are not obviated by the measures presented." Modi's legal team had offered a package of measures, which included a 24-hour electronic tag as well as a private security guard service and strictly-monitored access to gadgets and telephones. The court has also repeatedly been told of Modi’s fragile mental health and that his psychological condition was "deteriorating with the ever-increasing detention". "He has increasingly suffered from severe depression and the latest assessment shows he is on the threshold of being subject to hospitalisation unless given proper treatment… and his fitness to plead may be in doubt here or in the requesting state (India) given a high risk of suicide," Modi’s barrister, Clare Montgomery, had told Westminster Magistrates’ Court last month as part of the defence arguments against inadequate prison conditions in India. Modi is next scheduled to appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London on November 3, for the hearing in his extradition case when Judge Goozee will be presented with arguments to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities. There is at least one further final hearing in the case, expected either in December or early next year, for closing submissions by both sides. A judgment in the case is expected only after the closing submissions. At a five-day hearing held in September, Justice Goozee presided over arguments for and against the case for his extradition brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, played videos in court in support of additional charges of Modi’s disruption of the CBI’s investigation by causing the disappearance of evidence and criminal intimidation of witnesses. Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including additional commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited. The defence team, led by Montgomery, sought to not only establish that Modi’s actions related to PNB-issued letters of undertaking (LoUs) did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight mental health concerns. The defence has claimed that the conditions at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where Modi is to be held on being extradited, do not meet the UK court’s human rights criteria. The first set of hearings in the case took place back in May, with the hearings in September completing the process to establish a prima facie case and determine if the jeweller has a case to answer before the Indian courts. The case is being heard in a partial remote setting to accommodate coronavirus-related social distancing norms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uk-court-rejects-nirav-modis-bail-plea-for-seventh-time-907267.html

However, the process must be carried out with dignity, responsibility, and privacy. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao told Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, known for his own style of debate, that he does not have to conform to the model standards as he can be old fashioned and report differently. "Frankly speaking, I can't stand it. This has never been the level of discourse in this country," the CJI told senior advocate Harish Salve. The court asked senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, to submit a list of FIRs lodged against Goswami, as he contended how the entire investigation can stay in such a manner.  "Nobody is doubting the power of the police to investigate but the impression being given in the present case isn't proper," the bench said. Singhvi challenged the validity of the Bombay HC's order staying the probe into FIRs lodged against Goswami for his programme telecast after the lynching of two Hindu seers in Palghar in April, this year. "The state is willing to concede that Goswami won't be arrested if the investigation is revived. He will be given a notice of at least 48 hours before a summons is issued for questioning. Let there be no impression that someone is above law," Singhvi said. "But there are somebodies against whom the investigations are conducted with much intensity," the court shot back. "We also want from you to act with more responsibility. You must also understand there are certain areas you have to tread with caution," the bench told Singhvi. Giving detail on the turn of events after April 2020 as Goswami criticised Sonia Gandhi, senior advocate Harish Salve contended it was not a genuine FIR. "I understand the society is fragile and nobody should do anything to disturb it. But I must also bring to your notice what's happening in that state." The court asked Salve to put it on affidavit as to what he proposed to do. "We have one or the other case coming up everyday," the court said, posting the matter for consideration after two weeks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-says-arnab-goswamis-style-of-debating-different-asks-maharashtra-govt-to-act-with-dignity-907269.html
26-10-2020||National||More than Rahul, Congress needs Tejashwi to shore up its numbers||The battle of Bihar has taken a dramatic turn in the last fortnight. The first Assembly poll being held amid Covid-19 pandemic, till a month back, looked like a clean sweep by the NDA. But so fast has changed the permutations and combinations at the ground level in the last two weeks that Tejashwi-led Mahagathbandhan is now giving the BJP-led alliance a run for its money. So much so, that Bihar could be heading for a photo-finish by November 10, the counting day. Posing a serious challenge to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, under whom he served as his deputy in 2015-17, Tejashwi now has an additional responsibility to shore up the numbers of Congress too, if he wants to come to power. The RJD is contesting on 144 seats while the Congress has fielded its nominees on 70 seats out of 243 constituencies in Bihar. Rest of the seats have been left for the three Left parties. Ground reports suggest that RJD’s stocks are up compared to any other party. However, it’s not the same for the grand old party, which continues to be plagued with moribund organisation and listless campaign.  Sample Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav’s speech for the Mahagathbandhan nominees. “Aap ko note-bandi se fayda hua? GST ne aapki kamar tod dee? (Did you benefit from the demonetisation? GST might have wreaked havoc?),” the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi told a gathering while campaigning for his party nominee Neetu Singh at Hisua in Nawada. And then he adds more boredom for the crowd by mentioning about Ambani, Adani, Leh-Ladakh and China. Now contrast this with Tejashwi, who, like his father - the maverick Lalu Prasad, has struck an emotional chord with the crowd. “Naukri chahiye? Sarkari wala? (Do you want jobs? That too, the Government employment?)”, asks Tejashwi. And the crowd roars: “Yes.” “Sarkari naukri milegi, toh achchi biwi bhi mil jayegi. (If you get a government job, you will get a beautiful bride too),” adds Tejashwi, as the same crowd turns frenzy and assures the RJD leader of their rock-like support. Unlike Rahul, Tejashwi is raking up local issues (jobs, failure of prohibition, migration) and has connected well with the electorate, thereby changing the poll equations very fast. Lady luck is also smiling on him as the more the top BJP leadership clarifies that “Nitish is the NDA chief ministerial candidate,” the more the voters are getting confused and, at the ground level, NDA workers are looking at their alliance partners with more suspicion. “I have noticed Congress leaders’ campaign too. In this age of communication, Congress is miles behind in communicating. Neither they are highlighting UPA Government’s achievements, nor able to target their opponents through facts and figures. At this juncture, Tejashwi will have to give Congress a genuine piggy ride to help the grand old party emerge victorious. If the RJD leader really wants to touch the magic figure of 122 (in the 243-member Assembly), he will have to ensure that Congress too wins maximum seats. And only Tejashwi can help Congress romp home,” veteran political commentator Rakesh Pandey, having covered Bihar polls for years, told Deccan Herald.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/more-than-rahul-congress-needs-tejashwi-to-shore-up-its-numbers-907283.html

A bench of Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and Hrishikesh Roy ordered stay on the contempt proceedings pending in the High Court against ex CMs who have not yet started paying rent.  The court issued notice to the Uttarakhand government and tagged the matter along with other similar petitions.  Former Chief Ministers B C Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, and Vijay Bahuguna are also parties to the matter. The HC had on May 3, last directed the former CMs to pay market rent for the period on which they occupied the government bungalows after demitting office. A PIL was first filed by Uttar Pradesh-based NGO 'Lok Prahari' in the top court which led to a verdict on August 1, 2016 against the allotment of bungalows to ex-CMs in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-contempt-proceedings-by-uttarakhand-hc-against-ramesh-pokhriyal-nishank-907304.html
26-10-2020||National||West Bengal: Bimal Gurung’s siding with Mamata may cost BJP dearly||The sudden U-turn of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) supremo Bimal Gurung in seeking to join forces with Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief may jeopardise BJP’s prospects in North Bengal and especially in the Darjeeling Hills in the 2021 Assembly elections. Following his sudden appearance in Kolkata last week, Gurung accused BJP of not keeping the promises they made to him and walked out of the NDA accusing the saffron party of making false promises. BJP’s main cause of concern with Gurung’s change of mind is losing its political ground in North Bengal where it almost wiped out the TMC in the last Lok Sabha elections. Out of the 294 Assembly seats in West Bengal 54 are in North Bengal. According to the results of the last Lok Sabha elections, BJP led in 37 out of the 54 seats. Mamata Banerjee’s target will be to wrest the seats from BJP in the next Assembly elections and Gurung will be her main weapon in a considerable number of seats with his influence on several Nepali-speaking communities. With Gurung on Mamata’s side, BJP’s success in the last Lok Sabha elections in North Bengal with the twin factors of tribal and Nepali speaking voters may not work in the 2021 Assembly elections. With the exception of the Chopra Assembly constituency, all the three Assembly seats in the plains under the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat have the presence of Nepali speaking voters. Overall the presence of Nepali speaking voters will put at least 14 Assembly seats in North Bengal under Gurung’s influence. Since Gurung had returned to public life after a long gap of three years since the Gorkhaland agitation the question remains whether his influence on Nepali-speaking voters is still the same. The Benoy Tamang faction of the GJM may also become a key factor. It remains to be seen whether the TMC supremo can successfully deal with the sensitive Gorkhaland issue and the key players associated with it or BJP retains its hold in North Bengal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west-bengal-bimal-gurung-s-siding-with-mamata-may-cost-bjp-dearly-907335.html
26-10-2020||National||Modi didn't accept even tea during 9-hour questioning by Gujarat riots SIT: Raghavan||Without parrying a single question out of the 100-odd ones put to him by the 2002 Gujarat riots SIT, Narendra Modi as the then Gujarat chief minister "kept his cool" throughout the marathon 9-hour questioning and did not accept even a cup of tea from investigators, the probe team's chief at that time R K Raghavan has said in a new book. Modi had also readily agreed to come to the SIT office in Gandhinagar for the questioning and brought his own bottle of water, Raghavan has written in his autobiography, 'A Road Well Travelled'. Before being asked to head the Supreme Court-appointed SIT that probed the 2002 Gujarat riots, Raghavan had also served as head of premier probe agency CBI. He was also involved in several other high-profile investigations over years, including those relating to the Bofors scam, the 2000 South Africa cricket-match fixing case and the fodder scam. Talking about the time the SIT had called Modi for questioning as the then Gujarat chief minister, Raghavan writes in the book, "We had it conveyed to his staff that he had to come in person to the SIT office for this purpose and that meeting him elsewhere would be misconstrued as a favour." "He (Modi) understood the spirit of our stand and readily agreed to come to the SIT office within the government complex in Gandhinagar," Raghvan said. The former police officer further said he took the "unusual step" of asking Ashok Malhotra, an SIT member, to do the questioning, mainly to avoid any "mischievous allegation" later that Modi and he had struck a deal. "This stand was endorsed months later by no less a person than amicus curiae Harish Salve. He told me that my presence would have vitiated Modi's statement and would have robbed it of its credibility," Raghavan said, adding that he had never consulted Salve prior to the event. It was my personal decision flowing from sheer intuition, said the retired IPS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, who was also appointed as High Commissioner to Cyprus in 2017. "Modi's questioning lasted nine hours in my own chamber at the SIT office. Malhotra told me later that Modi kept his cool right through the marathon session which ended late at night," Raghavan said. "He (Modi) never parried questions. Nor did he give the impression of padding up his responses. When Malhotra asked him whether he would like to break for lunch, he initially turned down the offer. He brought his own bottle of water and did not accept even a cup of tea from the SIT during the marathon questioning comprising a hundred- odd questions," he said. Raghavan said it required "tremendous persuasion" to make Modi agree to a short recess. "This was possibly Modi’s concession to the need for a respite for Malhotra rather than for himself. Such was the energy of the man." In February 2012, the SIT filed a closure report, giving a clean chit to Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was "no prosecutable evidence" against them. In the book, the former CBI Director also asserted that the probe into the Gujarat riots by the Supreme Court-mandated SIT under him was "clinical and professional" and the SIT's "unequivocal stand" on the chief minister's role was "unpalatable to his (Modi's) adversaries" in the state and in Delhi. "They engineered petitions against me, accusing me of favouring the chief minister. The grapevine had it that they misused central agencies to monitor my telephonic conversations. They were, however, disappointed not to find anything incriminating," he said. Raghavan said false charges were aired against him on the sly to start with, and later openly. "Fortunately, the apex court stood by me and backed me to the hilt. I was found inconvenient because I refused to buy the argument that the state administration connived with the rioters who were targeting the Muslim community. Our investigation was clinical and professional," he asserted. "If I displayed a measure of professional acumen and objectivity, it was not a little due to the sterling assistance of Ashok Kumar Malhotra, whom I inducted into the SIT in 2009," said Raghvan praising Malhotra, who was asked to oversee the team's work after the apex court allowed Raghavan to be relieved from the duty in 2017. Without naming anyone, Raghavan said it was unfortunate that he was the target of attack by those instigated by "highly placed persons at the helm of affairs in Delhi". Talking about the Ehsan Jafri case, he said there was no record to establish that the Congress MP had tried to reach the chief minister by phone. "A few others, including Sanjeev Bhat, had also alleged that the chief minister, at a late-night official meeting on 28 February 2002, had directed senior police officers present at the meeting not to intervene if Hindu emotions overflowed. Here again, there was no corroboration to the charge," Raghvan asserted. None whose presence at the meeting was established beyond doubt told SIT that they saw Sanjeev Bhat at the meeting, held essentially to review the law and order situation arising from the Godhra train attack, he said. "In our report to the apex court we absolved the chief minister of the alleged illegal direction to the police," he said. Raghavan assumed office as head of SIT in early 2008 and carried on for nine years, until April 30, 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-didnt-accept-even-tea-during-9-hour-questioning-by-gujarat-riots-sit-raghavan-907337.html

Independents won two seats in the election, the first since Ladakh was made a Union Territory in August last year. BJP president J P Nadda termed the party's victory in the Thursday vote as historic. "Gratitude to the people of Ladakh for their faith in BJP," he tweeted and congratulated party leaders and workers. The party had won 17 seats in the 2015 election. The Congress had won four, the National Conference had two seats and the Independents had three. A turnout of 65.07 percent had been recorded in Thursday's election. The Aam Aadmi Party, which had contested for the first time, failed to open its account. The National Conference and the PDP had stayed away. "Out of 26 seats of whose results were declared today, BJP won 15 seats and Congress bagged nine seats. Two seats were won by Independents", an official told PTI. BJP candidates won from the last village of Turtuk on the Indo-Pak border but lost in the last hamlet of Chushul on the Sino-India border. The Independents bagged seats of Nyoma and  Chushul. The BJP won Diskit, Tegar, Hundar, Panamik, Tangtse, Kungyam, Martselang, Karzok, Thiksay, Chuchot, Sku-Markha, Lamayouru, Khaltse and Lingshet, officials said. The Congress won Saspol, Igoo, Temisgam, Basgo, Lower Leh, Upper Leh, Phyang, Sakti and Skurbuchan council seats. Ninety-four candidates were in the fray and over 65 percent electorate had exercised their franchise. In the election held in 2010, the Congress had 22 seats, while the BJP had four. The counting of votes for the sixth LAHDC elections was organized at the Amphitheatre of SSK, Tisuru, Leh. Adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines, all standard safety measures like wearing masks, using sanitizers and following social distancing were sincerely followed at every counting booth. An electorate of 89,776, including 45,025 women, were eligible to exercise their franchise in 294 polling stations spread over 26 constituencies across Leh. The LAHDC-Leh has a total of 30 seats, with four of the councilors nominated by the government. Since the formation of the hill council in 1995, the Congress had swept the polls thrice, while the Ladakh Union Territorial Front had won the elections in 2005.

A bench presided over by Justice U U Lalit declined to entertain the appeal filed by UBHL and affirmed the winding up of the 102-year-old parent company of the UB Group. Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the SBI-led consortium of banks, informed the top court that so far around Rs 3,600 crore have been recovered but Rs 11,000 crore was still needed to be recovered from Mallya and UBHL. Senior Advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for the UBHL, contended that there was more than sufficient for all creditors and this was not a case for winding up. He said even the banks acknowledged that all these assets have been attached by the ED.  Vaidyanathan said the bulk of the assets are in the form of shares and these attachments are at the instance of the banks for the money they had loaned to the tune of Rs 900 crores, which was wrongfully diverted. However, all these assets had been acquired before Kingfisher had even availed of the loan, he added.  Rohatgi, for his part, claimed Rs 15,000 crores dues as on date. He contended that it was a bogus argument that they have the money. "We have been able to recover Rs 3595 crores. Rs 11000 crores are remaining," he said, adding no bona fide offer had so far been made.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-plea-by-ubhl-against-karnataka-hcs-order-for-winding-up-of-ubs-holding-company-907347.html
26-10-2020||National||India, US to ink landmark defence pact on October 27: Officials||With its army still engaged in a stand-off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh, India is set to step up defence cooperation with the United States, by institutionalising sharing of maritime and geospatial intelligence. India and the US will sign the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) on the sidelines of the bilateral 2+2 dialogue on Tuesday. The agreement will enable exchange of geo-spatial information between the two countries, enhancing the operational efficiency of the US defence platforms being operated by India. The two sides, according to the sources, are also discussing an agreement on maritime domain awareness cooperation -- a pact, which will institutionalise sharing of information bilaterally on potential sea-borne security threats and thus will help keep watch on the activities of the Chinese PLA Navy. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his US counterpart Mark T Esper had a meeting in New Delhi on Monday, ahead of the 2+2 dialogue. They reviewed bilateral defence cooperation, spanning military-to-military cooperation, secure communication systems and information sharing, defence trade and industrial issues and discussed ways to take bilateral cooperation forward, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Defence after the meeting. “They discussed potential new areas of cooperation, both at service-to-service level and at the joint level.” Esper and the US Secretary of State Michael R Pompeo arrived in New Delhi earlier on Monday. Pompeo and his counterpart External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also had a meeting in the evening and they discussed ways to build on India-US strategic convergence in the Indo-Pacific region and countering the hegemonic moves by China, sources told DH. Separately, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, focussing on a broad spectrum of issues of mutual interests. Jaishankar and Singh will hold the third India-US 2+2 dialogue with Pompeo and Esper on Tuesday. This is going to be the last engagement between New Delhi and Donald Trump’s administration in Washington DC before the final day of voting for the US presidential elections on November 3. "India is delighted to host the US Secretary of Defence, Dr Mark Esper. Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence cooperation in a wide range of areas. Today’s discussions will add new vigour to India-US defence relations & mutual cooperation," he said in the tweet. India is delighted to host the US Secretary of Defence, Dr. Mark Esper. Our talks today were fruitful, aimed at further deepening defence cooperation in a wide range of areas. In its statement, the defence ministry said Singh and Esper reviewed bilateral defence cooperation spanning military-to-military cooperation, secure communication systems and information sharing and defence trade. "Both the Ministers expressed satisfaction at the close engagements between the respective Armed Forces. They discussed potential new areas of cooperation, both at service to service level and at the joint level," it said. What is likely to add to the significance of the India-US high-level talks is that it is being held amid growing belligerence of China -- not only along its disputed boundary with India, but also in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and elsewhere in the region. That the BECA will be signed on Tuesday was confirmed after the meeting between Singh and Esper. The proposed agreement between the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency of the US Department of Defence and the Ministry of Defence of the Government of India will pave the way for sharing of maps, charts, imagery and other geospatial information and data, including geodetic, geophysical, geomagnetic and gravity data. The BECA is going to be last of the four “foundational pacts”, which Washington DC has since long been nudging New Delhi to sign, promising that they would make it easier for India to access advanced military technologies from the US, thus paving the way for further strengthening defence partnership between the two nations. The first such pact India signed with the US was the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement or the LEMOA. It was inked in 2016 and made it obligatory for both India and the US to support each other’s aircraft, ships and personnel with logistics, fuel and spares. The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) was signed on the side-line of the first India-US 2+2 dialogue in New Delhi in September 2018. It facilitated India’s access to advanced defence systems of the US. It also enabled India to optimally utilise its existing military hardware sourced from the US. The Industrial Security Annex (ISA) was signed during the second 2+2 dialogue in December 2019 to be added to the already existing General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The ISA provided a framework for exchange and protection of classified military information between the US and Indian industries in order to elevate the defence relations from the seller-buyer level to the level of joint research and development and joint production. Malabar naval exercise It said the US Secretary of Defence welcomed Australia’s participation in the upcoming Malabar naval exercise. Singh also highlighted recent reforms in the defence manufacturing sector and invited US companies to make best use of the liberalised policies and the favorable defence industry ecosystem in the country. Apart from strengthening military-to-military cooperation and boosting partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, the issue of expeditious supply of contracted weapon systems by the US to India figured prominently in the deliberations. India-China dispute The issue of China's aggressive military behaviour is expected to figure prominently during Tuesday's talks, sources indicated. In the last few months, the US has been strongly critical of China over a range of contentious issues including the border standoff with India, its military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the way Beijing handled the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. India: 'Major Defence Partner' of US The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years. In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner" intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The two countries inked the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provide for deeper cooperation. The two countries signed another pact called COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India. According to the US government, India maintains the largest fleet of C-17 and P-8 aircraft outside of the US, and as of 2020, Washington has authorised more than USD 20 billion in defence sales to India. The first edition of the 2+2 dialogue was held in Delhi in September 2018 after the mechanism was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump. The second edition of the dialogue took place in Washington in December last year. The new framework of the ministerial dialogue was initiated in order to provide a forward-looking vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries.    (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-us-to-ink-landmark-defence-pact-on-october-27-officials-907348.html

Chugh described it as “unfortunate” and said such incidents have hurt the sentiments of millions of people in the country. He alleged that effigies of the PM were set on fire at the behest of the Congress-led government in the state and said it showed how the ruling party could “stoop to such a level” just for the sake of “petty politics”. “It cannot be tolerated,” he said. Chugh claimed that the Amarinder Singh-led dispensation in the state was trying to create tension through such acts in order to “please” Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Meanwhile, in a letter to Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore, Chugh sought action against those behind the burning of effigies.

26-10-2020||National||Prime Minister Modi brainstorms with global CEOs on energy paradigm||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday brainstormed with global energy sector leaders on the post-pandemic world order and discussed strategies for accelerating investments in the oil and gas value chain. The fourth annual meeting deliberated on demand scenario as well as ways to revive investment, particularly in oil and gas exploration and production, official sources said. The meeting stretched beyond the allotted two hours as Modi engaged with the industry leaders to discuss reforms and future blueprint. The meeting, held over a virtual platform, was attended by nearly two dozen top CEOs, including UK's BP Plc head Bernard Looney, French energy giant Total's Chairman Patrick Pouyanne and Russian oil major Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber and Qatar Petroleum President Saad Sherida al-Kaabi also attended the meeting. The Indian side included Reliance Industries Ltd Chairman Mukesh Ambani and Vedanta Resources head Anil Agarwal. Oil cartel OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol and International Energy Forum Secretary-General Joseph Mc Monigle also attended the meet. US LNG firm Tellurian CEO Charif Souki and Lyondell Basell Industries chief executive Bhavesh V Patel too participated in the meeting that also saw attendance from leading service providers such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. India, the third-largest oil consumer, and fourth-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, is keen to accelerate investment across the oil and gas value chain, beginning with exploration and production to midstream pipelines and refineries and downstream retailing and last-mile connectivity to consumers. Modi's first such meeting was on January 5, 2016, where suggestions for reforming natural gas prices were made. More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas prices for the yet-to-be-produced output in difficult areas like the deep sea. Sources said this year's focus was on raising investments in domestic oil and gas exploration and production. The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually. India is dependent on imports to meet 85 per cent of its demand and more than half of its natural gas requirements. The Prime Minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 per cent to 67 per cent (based on import dependence of 77 per cent in 2014-15) by 2022. Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output. Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor made a presentation on an overview of the oil and gas sector at the meeting organised by Niti Aayog and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also spoke at the event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prime-minister-modi-brainstorms-with-global-ceos-on-energy-paradigm-907358.html

In the last 24 hours, the pandemic killed 480 Indians taking the cumulative death toll in excess of 1.19 lakh. The number of fresh cases also dropped to 45,148 in the past day, taking the overall tally to 79.09 lakh. The last time India recorded less than 500 deaths was on July 12. The number of cases was on a continuous rise till September 16 when nearly 98,000 new cases were registered in a single day. Since then the curve has been trending downwards. The fatality rate too dropped to 1.5% - the lowest since March 22, the Union Health Ministry said in a statement. There are 14 states including Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Odisha, Assam and Kerala where the fatality rate is lesser than 1%. The case fatality rate is lowest since March 22. It reached two peaks on May 4 (3.23%) and June 22 (3.22%). Since then it has been declining continuously. Nearly 80% of Covid-19 deaths on Sunday were recorded in ten states with Maharashtra topping the chart (112 deaths) followed by West Bengal (60) and Delhi (33). On Monday, Maharashtra after many months registered less than 100 toll and less than 5,000 daily cases, which would be reflected in the official records on Tuesday. An analysis of the caseload in September shows that daily cases were between 90,000 and 98,000 between September 9-19 and reportage of daily cases reduced by around 10,000 every 10 days since that period. Between September 20-30, the recorded daily cases were between 80,000 and 90,000 (except 69,671 on Sept 28). Between October 1-10, the recorded daily cases were between 70,000 and 80,000 (with exception of 60,128 cases on Oct 5). From Oct 11-20, the number varied between 54,000 to 68,000 (with an exception of 46,498 cases on Oct 19). "We need to wait for a couple of weeks to confirm if the peak has indeed arrived. We have now been 5-week past-peak and as such declare that peak was on September 16. While passing of the peak is indeed an important goal, subsequent surges can come, as seen in several countries of Europe," Ishwar Gilada, Secretary General, Peoples Health Organisation, Mumbai.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-s-daily-covid-19-death-toll-falls-below-500-after-three-months-907383.html

The party also announced Naresh Bansal as its Rajya Sabha nominee from Uttarakhand. Puri, Shekhar and party general secretary Arun Singh are all sitting MPs who have been renominated. Besides them, Geeta Shakya, Haridwar Dubey, Brijlal, BL Varma and Seema Dwivedi have been nominated. Earlier this month the Election Commission had announced elections to 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and one in Uttarakhand, falling vacant on November 25. With the BJP having 304 members in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the election for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from the state may turn out to be a nearly one-sided affair for the party, feel poll analysts. The BJP's all eight nominees for Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh are likely to win as the party has the three-fourth majority in the state assembly. Similarly, party's nominee for Rajya Sabha from Uttarakhand is also expected to win. With these nine new possible members, the BJP's own tally in Rajya Sabha will cross 90 in the 245-member house. The ten Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant are three of the BJP, four of the Samajwadi party, two of the Bahujan Samaj Party and one of the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajya-sabha-polls-bjp-announces-8-names-from-up-1-from-uttarakhand-907409.html
26-10-2020||National||EC lets off Kamal Nath with advice over 'item' remark, serves notice to Vijayvargiya, Sajjan Verma||The Election Commission on Monday let off former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath with an advice, after he conveyed to the poll panel that he had no intent to disrespect Bharatiya Janata Party leader Imarti Devi even as he had recently referred to her as an ‘item’. The EC advised Kamal Nath, a senior leader of the Congress, that “he should not use any such word or statement” while “making public utterances” during the period when the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) would remain in force. The poll panel, however, issued a notice to Congress MLA in Madhya Pradesh, Sajjan Singh Verma, for referring to senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya as “Ravana” – apparently comparing him with the demon king whom Rama had killed in Ramayana. It also issued a separate notice to Vijayvargiya for referring to Nath and another senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, Digvijay Singh, as “chunnu munnu”. The EC asked Vijayvargiya and Verma to send their replies within 48 hours. The poll-panel on October 21 issued a notice to Nath, after receiving a complaint from the National Commission for Women as well as the BJP about his October 18 comment about Imarti Devi. It asked him to explain his stand on his controversial remark by October 23. Nath in his response on October 22 stated that his comment about Imarti Devi was “an admonition of the political scenario” which was “replete with drama”. He also said that “upholding the dignity of women” had been the “cornerstone” of his “public life” and would find “reflection in his actions and administrative policies in a public career spanning over 40 years”. Imarti Devi won the 2018 state assembly elections from Dabra as a candidate of the Congress. She was a minister in the Congress Government led by Kamal Nath. She was among the 22 MLAs, who left the Congress and joined the BJP with Jyotiraditya Scindia earlier this year, leading to the fall of the Kamal Nath’s government and necessitating the bypolls to fill the vacancies in the state assembly. Imarti Devi is now contesting the bypolls as the BJP’s candidate. Kamal Nath made the controversial remark about her on October 18 while campaigning for Suresh Raje, whom the Congress fielded against her in Dabra.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ec-lets-off-kamal-nath-with-advice-over-item-remark-serves-notice-to-vijayvargiya-sajjan-verma-907410.html

The Congress is Shiv Sena's ally in the state's ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi, which also includes the NCP as a partner. Talking to reporters here, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut reiterated that Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, be given to the "great and Hindutvavadi leader" Savarkar. During the Shiv Sena's annual Dussehra rally on Sunday, party president Thackeray delivered his speech at the Savarkar hall in Dadar area here due to COVID-19 norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park. Later, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye accused the ruling party of compromising on Hindutva for power. "Uddhav Thackeray did not say a word about the Congress criticising Savarkar and now he had to address the Dussehra rally from the Savarkar auditorium. This is poetic justice," Updhaye further said. Reacting to the comments, Raut on Monday said the Shiv Sena has "never kept quiet on the issues relating to Savarkar and it will never do so". Without naming the BJP, Raut said the party should browse through history to know the Shiv Senas stand on issues involving Savarkar. "Veer Savarkar has always been the mentor of the Shiv Sena and Hindutva. Those who are raising questions on us...why are they not giving the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar?" the Rajya Sabha member asked. "You have given it to many people during the past six- seven years. What are the difficulties before you in giving the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar?" Raut sought to know. The Shiv Sena parted ways with long-term ally BJP after the Maharashtra Assembly elections last year following differences over the issue of sharing of the chief ministerial post on a rotational basis. The Thackeray-led party later formed the government in the state in alliance with the ideologically different NCP and the Congress, which has been a bitter critic of Savarkar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-hits-out-at-bjp-asks-why-no-bharat-ratna-to-savarkar-yet-907100.html
26-10-2020||National Politics||The more Congress hates PM, the more people support Modi: JP Nadda||Hitting out at the Congress for its criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief JP Nadda on Monday said the more the opposition party and its leaders "lie" and "hate" Modi, the more people will support him. In a series of tweets, Nadda lambasted both Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son and MP Rahul Gandhi for their reproval of the Prime Minister on a range of issues. “Combination of despondency and shamelessness is dangerous. Congress possesses both. Empty rhetoric of decency and democracy by the Mother is ‘complemented’ by live demonstrations of politics of hate, anger, lies, and aggression by the Son. Double standards galore,” Nadda said. The BJP president made these remarks in response to an article written by Sonia Gandhi in an English daily alleging that democracy is being hollowed out in the Modi dispensation. “One of dynasty’s deep personal hatred against a person who was born in poverty and became PM is historic. Equally historic is the love people of India have showered upon PM. More Congress’ lies and hate increases, the more people will support PM Modi,” Nadda said. Recalling the emergency the BJP chief said the Congress can never pontificate on the freedom of speech, claiming that they have had contempt for dissenting voices for decades. “We saw glimpses of it during the Emergency. Later on, the Rajiv Gandhi government made a brazen attempt to weaken press freedom. A free press rattles Congress,” he alleged. Dubbing the Congress "blessed" Maharashtra government as a “laboratory of usage of brute state power”, Nadda said troubling opponents and curbing freedom of speech in "trademark Congress style" are visible in the working of the state government. He also hit back at Rahul Gandhi for his remarks on social media citing a media report claiming that farmers across Punjab burnt effigies of Prime Minister Modi. Describing the torching of Modi's effigies as a “Rahul Gandhi-directed drama”, Nadda said it was shameful but not unexpected. “After all, the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty has never respected the office of the Prime Minister. This was seen in the institutional weakening of the Prime Minister’s authority during the UPA years of 2004-2014,” he said. Alleging that atrocities against SC/ST communities are at an all-time high in Congress-ruled Rajasthan and that women are unsafe in Rajasthan as well as Punjab, Nadda said, "Except governing, they are doing everything else”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/the-more-congress-hates-pm-the-more-people-support-modi-jp-nadda-907222.html

On Sunday, Congress MLA from Damoh Rahul Lodhi joined the BJP after resigning from the assembly. His resignation from the Congress came ahead of the November 3 bypolls on 28 assembly seats whose results will be declared on November 10. The BJP has anticipated the result coming on November 10 so the BJP is not waiting for the result and has started the game of bargaining, he said. "Now they are left with only this option. I am getting calls from many Congress MLAs. They are telling that the BJP is luring them and offering money," Nath told reporters here. The BJP dismissed the Congress allegations and said Nath is not able to manage his party. The former Chief Minister said the electorate of Madhya Pradesh is very simple and straightforward, but very aware politically. "Election is a celebration of democracy. But this has become a celebration of bargaining. I don't believe in such politics," he said. I have written a letter to the Election Commission today. Lower-level government employees are being pressurised to work in favour of the BJP, the Leader of the Opposition in Assembly said. Nath said the BJP knows that it is not getting the numbers to save its government in the bypolls so it has started luring Congress MLAs. Since March this year, 26 Congress MLAs have resigned and joined the BJP. Reacting to Nath's allegations, state BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal said the state Congress chief is not able to manage his party. "So many Congress legislators and leaders have left the party under Nath's leadership. This puts a question mark on Nath's leadership. He should not make baseless comments against the BJP," Agrawal said. The BJP spokesman said Nath is not even listening to the advice of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has condemned certain controversial remarks of the MP Congress chief. In March, 22 Congress MLAs, most of them loyalists of Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, had resigned from the party and the state Assembly. This had led to the collapse of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath-led Congress government and cleared the way for the BJP to again come to power. Scindia and his loyalists joined the BJP with some of the rebel MLAs becoming ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/fearing-bypoll-loss-bjp-engaging-in-bargaining-game-says-former-madhya-pradesh-cm-kamal-nath-907236.html
26-10-2020||National Politics||Kamal Nath, Digvijaya Singh 'biggest gaddars'; BJP will win majority of seats in MP bypolls, says Jyotiraditya Scindia||Accusing former chief ministers Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh of being the "biggest traitors" in Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday said they betrayed voters' trust by running a "corrupt" government and he had to leave the Congress after people's issues raised by him were not addressed despite approaching "every port of call". He also expressed confidence that the BJP will "win a majority", if not all, of the 28 assembly seats where bypolls will be held on November 3. In an interview with PTI, Scindia said 27 out of the 28 assembly seats which are going to polls were Congress seats, so the BJP has everything to gain, while the Congress has everything to lose. By-elections were necessitated after 22 rebel Congress MLAs, loyal to Scindia, resigned from the party in March this year leading to fall of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Later, three more MLAs resigned and joined BJP, while further three seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting MLAs. "The Congress needs to win 28 out of 28 seats to be able to even think of coming close to forming the government and they have just lost another MLA (in Rahul Lodhi) who has joined the BJP. It is very clear that people do not have any hope in the Congress party, not only at grassroots, but also in sitting MLAs of the Congress," Scindia said. "I do not think in any other state you would have seen MLAs in such a large number -- almost about 30 per cent -- leaving. It very clearly shows the lack of trust and faith in the state leadership of the Congress party which is Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, and who are in a partnership," the Rajya Sabha MP said. Asked about the Congress campaign narrative of betrayal and being called 'gaddar' by Congress leaders during canvassing, Scindia said it is not a term that he normally uses in politics as he believes that there must be a certain level in politics that should be adhered to. "If they indeed are using that term then the biggest gaddars (traitors) in Madhya Pradesh are Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh who have been 'gaddars' towards seven and a half crore people because none of the poll promises were fulfilled, they were busy in rent-seeking activities and holding on to power and chair rather than serving the people of the state," Scindia said. Talking about Kamal Nath's 'item' jibe at BJP candidate Imarti Devi, the 49-year-old leader said public figures must adhere to certain values and morals and set an example. Scindia said the remark was directed at a woman who has risen from the grassroots-level, fought a sarpanch election, became MLA three times and was a Cabinet minister in the Kamal Nath government. "Kamal Nath says he cannot remember her name, which shows his arrogance of power that he cannot remember the name of a colleague who was part of his cabinet. After all, he was only the Chief Minister, who is the first among equals, and she was a colleague," Scindia said. To top that, he calls a woman and that too a Dalit woman "an item", which speaks of his mentality towards both women and Dalits, he said. "What is very sad is that he has not been alone in this. He has been followed very arduously by the former leader of the opposition Ajay Singh who in a statement said 'Imarti should be made into a 'Jalebi' after the election'," he said. Scindia also alleged that former chief minister Digvijaya Singh had also made a derogatory comment about Meenakshi Natrajan two-three years ago "This shows the attitude of the Congress party towards women and scheduled castes. If Baba Saheb Ambedkar was alive today, he would be very deeply grieved and pained," Scindia said. Kamal Nath has maintained he did not say anything disrespectful. Asked if like Arjuna of Mahabharata, he feels any dilemma in taking on people with whom he was close to and fought together, Scindia said he is fighting for the cause of the people of Madhya Pradesh and for their well being. Scindia said his father Madhavrao Scindia, grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia and he joined politics only for the welfare of the people. "For me, a political party is a medium to be able to reach that goal of public service. So for me, politics is not important, what is important is the goal of public service," he said. Scindia said he is willing to do whatever it requires to fulfil the aspirations of people, and if it "entails sometimes fighting with those with whom you have worked for over 20 years, so be it". "I tried to change the way the (Kamal Nath) government was functioning for 15 months, I went to every single port of call that one can to try and address these issues, but when they lay unaddressed, what option was I left with," the former Union minister said. Scindia said when the Congress came to power, aspirations of citizens of the state rested squarely on the shoulders of Kamal Nath, but he ran a "corruption-riddled government during the span of 15 months". Accusing the Nath government of indulging in corruption in numerous areas from "sand mining to liquor mafia", Scindia said the Congress dispensation "literally ridiculed and belittled" the aspirations of the people. "Not fulfilling any of the election promises left me no options but to look for a better governance mechanism for the people of the state. I firmly believe that the Shivraj Singh government would be able to provide that to the people under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president J P Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kamal-nath-digvijaya-singh-biggest-gaddars-bjp-will-win-majority-of-seats-in-mp-bypolls-says-jyotiraditya-scindia-907253.html
26-10-2020||National Politics||Kamal Nath violated poll advisory: EC||The Election Commission on Monday said former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath had violated its advisory related to campaigning by using the word "item" against a woman BJP candidate and advised the Congress leader not to use such terms in public during the period of the Model Code of Conduct. The poll panel had issued a notice to Kamal Nath after he had used the jibe against BJP candidate Imarti Devi at a poll rally a few days ago, drawing an angry reaction from the ruling party. Addressing a poll meeting last week in Gwalior's Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Kamal Nath had said that the Congress candidate was a "simple person" unlike his opponent who was an "item". Bypolls to 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will be held on November 3. Following a complaint by the state BJP and reference by the National Commission for Women, the EC had served the notice to Kamal Nath. The Commission on Monday issued orders against the Congress leader. " ... the Commission, hereby advises Kamal Nath, ex-chief minister Madhya Pradesh that while making public utterances he should not use any such word or statement during the period of Model Code of Conduct," the order said. It said Kamal Nath used the word "item" for a lady and that "this constitutes a violation" of advisory issued by the Commission relating to the model code.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kamal-nath-violated-poll-advisory-ec-907360.html
26-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality in 'very poor' state, stubble burning contribution may increase||The national capital's air quality was recorded in the 'very poor' category on Monday morning and the share of stubble burning in the city's PM2.5 pollution is likely to increase, according to a central government agency. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the wind direction and the wind speed is favourable for the transport of the pollutants from farm fires in Haryana, Punjab, and other neighbouring regions to Delhi. The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 19 per cent on Sunday, it said. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 343 at 10 am on Monday. The 24-hour average AQI was was 349 on Sunday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Calm winds and low temperatures allow accumulation of pollutants while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.   The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System For Delhi said the predominant surface wind direction is northwesterly with wind speed up to 12 kmph, favourable for transport of pollutants from farm fires. A large number of farm fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which is likely to impact Delhi-NCR's air quality, it said. The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 15,000 metre square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.   A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-in-very-poor-state-stubble-burning-contribution-may-increase-907037.html

A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar asked the Election Commission of India (ECI) to take an appropriate decision with regard to political rallies as per law and keeping in mind Covid-19 guidelines. The top court was hearing pleas of the ECI and Madhya Pradesh Energy minister Pradyuman Singh Tomar challenging the high court’s order of October 20. The top court also asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Tomar, to make a representation to the ECI for loss of time in electioneering due to HC’s order. The poll panel has assailed the HC order, saying the conduct and management of elections are overseen by it under the Constitution and Article 329 puts an express bar on judicial interference in midst of electoral process. The plea said the poll panel's Covid-19 guidelines on election rallies or meetings were formulated on September 25 in the exercise of its powers. As per guidelines and the SOP of the state government, political gatherings of over 100 people with safety measures can be allowed, it said.   Tomar, who is contesting as a BJP candidate from Gwalior constituency for the bypoll in Madhya Pradesh, submitted in his plea that the high court has erred in its finding as the ECI under Article 324 of Constitution has issued its Covid-19 guidelines dated September 29, permitting “physical gatherings” for election campaigns subject to specified restrictions. Bypoll for 28 assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/physical-rallies-can-be-held-in-madhya-pradesh-bypolls-supreme-court-stays-hc-order-907089.html

The minister also said the 'Red light on, Gaadi off' campaign will cover all the 70 assembly constituencies in the national capital starting Monday. By November 1, the campaign to curb vehicular pollution will cover all the 272 wards in the city, he said. The minister said he had invited opposition MLAs to join the campaign but "there has been no positive response from them so far". "But I hope that they will take steps at their own level. Air pollution is not a problem of just the AAP or the Delhi government. Tackling it is everyone's responsibility," he said. Asked if Delhi BJP MLAs should join the campaign, he said, "Yes, everyone should…We have appealed to everyone. They also have to breathe in the same air." Rai said that switching vehicles off at red light can reduce vehicular pollution by 15-20 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pollution-isnt-a-problem-of-just-one-party-or-govt-gopal-rai-907112.html
26-10-2020||North and Central||Senior doctors of NDMC hospitals go on mass casual leave, threaten indefinite strike||Senior doctors of North Corporation-run hospitals went on a day-long casual leave en masse on Monday as the crisis over pending salaries of medics of civic-run facilities deepened with no resolution in sight, officials said. R R Gautam, president of the Municipal Corporation Doctors' Association (MCDA) on Monday said, "If our demands are not met, we will go on indefinite strike from tomorrow." The MCDA, an association of senior permanent doctors of the civic hospitals, was established in 1974 and has about 1,200 members. It also includes doctors from hospitals run by other two municipal corporations. The MCDA on Saturday had issued a statement and threatened that its members from NDMC hospitals would go on a mass casual leave if their pending salaries of the last three months were not released. The association already has given sufficient time to authorities concerned to resolve the issue and pay our salaries, "but they have not done anything to solve the problem, and instead they appear to be unconcerned with the plight of doctors," it had said. Recently, it had also issued a statement expressing solidarity with their agitating colleagues -- resident doctors -- of Hindu Rao Hospital and Kasturba Hospital, both under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), who are also protesting over their pending salaries. The MCDA had recently threatened to go on an indefinite strike from October 19, but it had later decided to defer the strike in "public interest". The association after holding an emergency General Body Meeting on Saturday had "unanimously decided to protest against non-payment of our salaries for the past three months," MCDA general secretary Maruti Sinha had said. "The first decision taken in the General Body Meeting was mass casual leave by all senior doctors of the NDMC on Monday. And total strike for an indefinite period of all senior doctors from Tuesday, if salaries of all doctors, including resident doctors are not released by Monday, and if a permanent solution like handing over MCD health services to the central government, is not decided," the MCDA statement said. The authorities are to be held "solely responsible for this unprecedented strike, as they are neither bothered about their doctors -- so-called 'Corona warriors' -- nor are they concerned about patients and general," the statement said. The crisis over the pending salaries has deepened as five of the resident doctors of the 900-bed Hindu Rao Hospital are sitting on a hunger strike since Friday with the Resident Doctors Association (RDA) saying the step was taken as no one is resolving the issue of their pending salaries. Resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital on Sunday took their protest to the streets as they demonstrated at Connaught Place and later burnt an effigy of Ravana on the premises of the facility to draw attention to their plight.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/senior-doctors-of-ndmc-hospitals-go-on-mass-casual-leave-threaten-indefinite-strike-907124.html
26-10-2020||North and Central||Dussehra worsens Delhi's air pollution woes||New Delhi's appalling air quality turned a lot worse over the weekend as Hindus in the capital burned effigies of the mythological demon king Ravana and lit firecrackers to celebrate the triumph of good over evil during the Dussehra festival. As pollution spiked on Monday morning, India Gate - a monument near Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office - was blanketed in smog, and the mega-city's 20 million people breathed in "very poor" air, even "hazardous" in some places. US President Donald Trump cited India for its "filthy" air during the final presidential debate last week, prompting Democratic rival Joe Biden to tweet: "It's not how you talk about friends — and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change." But, for all the angst displayed on social media by some Indians over Trump's comment, the country's own pollution watchdog delivered the inescapable truth with another dreadful daily reading. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality index (AQI) any reading above 100 on the scale of 500 becomes progressively unsafe for health. On Monday afternoon in the capital the AQI struck 347, while for some areas like Sonia Vihar it was as high as 439, well into the hazardous zone. Doctors have already noted a jump in respiratory problems among residents in the capital, where over 353,000 of India's 7.9 million coronavirus cases have been reported. So far this month, Delhi's AQI has averaged a "poor" 227, as residents paid a price for farmers in surrounding states burning off stubble before planting a new crop. While the climax of the Dussehra festival on Sunday was harmful enough for people's lungs, environmentalists have warned that Diwali in mid-November could be a lot worse, as people light many more firecrackers for the festival of lights. Next month, farmers would typically still be burning stubble in some states, and low winds would let the smog settle over the capital. Authorities have launched a campaign urging people to take steps to control pollution while ordering sprinkling of water and banning the use of electricity generator sets.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dussehra-worsens-delhis-air-pollution-woes-907132.html

A bench, presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde, directed to keep its order in abeyance till further directions, as the Centre, led by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, said it would set up a permanent body by enacting a legislation to deal with annual air pollution problem arising from stubble burning in northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  The Centre also submitted the new legislation would be brought in very soon and a proposal would be placed before the court within three to four days. It asked the court to keep the order in abeyance. Amicus Curiae, senior advocate Harish Salve supported the proposal by the Union government. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioner, however, contended hat the legislation would be possible only by next year. Mehta, for his part, retorted, saying, "this government acts fast". The court posted the matter for consideration on October 29. Acting on a PIL by a minor, Aditya Dubey, the top court in October said inspite of measures, there have been reports of increase in stubble burning which will pollute air in NCR inevitably.  There needs to be some monitoring of stubble burning before it assumes unhealthy proportions, as the people of Delhi and National Capital Region must breathe fresh and clean air, the court added. The court had then said the all authorities, EPCA (Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority and of States shall report to the committee for the information sought.  It had then brushed aside objections by the Centre to the decision, saying Justice Lokur's consent has already been taken. Justice Lokur had earlier presided over a three-judge bench to hear the case related to stubble burning, arising out of a PIL filed by environmental activist M C Mehta.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-suspends-order-appointing-justice-lokur-to-monitor-stubble-burning-907134.html

Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) seeking its stand on the plea which claims that her son's passport was damaged when he was in Italy and had applied for a duplicate one in 2012 which has not been issued to him. He moved to Paris for work as without a valid passport he was finding it tough to get work in Italy, her plea has said. The Indian consulate in Italy had refused to issue him a passport as a dowry case was pending him here, she has said in her plea. The woman has said that she, her husband and her son were falsely implicated in a dowry case by her then daughter-in-law in 2009. Her husband passed away during the pendency of the case and her son was declared a proclaimed offender as he could not come back to India due to lack of a valid passport, the petition has claimed. She was acquitted in the case in 2016 and meanwhile, her ex-daughter-in-law obtained a divorce in 2011 and got married again, the plea said.

Pilot, a former Rajasthan Congress President, is scheduled to address election rallies on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Gwalior-Chambal, a region considered as the stronghold of Scindia, who dumped the Congress to join the BJP in March. The Gwalior-Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh is contiguous with the Dausa-Tonk-Alwar belt of Rajasthan where the Gujjar community holds sway and is known to tip the scales in an electoral battle. Pilot is scheduled to address nine public meetings across Shivpuri, Morena and Bhind districts covering 10 assembly constituencies. The political trajectories of Scindia and Pilot are similar with both the scions entering the electoral fray after the sudden deaths of their fathers Madhavrao Scindia and Rajesh Pilot in 2001 and 2000 respectively. Both the scions witnessed a sharp rise in their respective political careers much to the dismay of the local satraps in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Scindia rebelled against the Congress in March and walked out of the party with 22 MLAs in tow, bringing down the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Pilot, feeling sidelined in Rajasthan despite being the state Congress chief and the deputy chief minister, attempted a similar rebellion but saw it fizzle out, forcing him to remain as a “loyal party soldier” in the Congress. Bye-elections to 28 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh is scheduled for November 3. The BJP will have to win at least nine seats to gain majority and continue to be in power, while Congress will have to win all the 28 seats to oust Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The results for the bypolls will be declared on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-sachin-pilot-set-to-storm-scindias-gwalior-chambal-bastion-907156.html

I think we are on the right track,” Lieutenant General B S Raju, General-Officer-Commanding (GOC) of the Army’s Srinagar-based 15-Corps, told reporters in central Kashmir’s Budgam district. He said that infiltration has been stopped substantially due to a combination of a lot of efforts that is being put in the ground forces, including additional personnel, additional technology along the Line of Control and drones to monitor the movement. However, the army commander said that there was no desire on the part of Pakistan to stop infiltration. “Ahead of snowfall and winter, the attempts may increase, but our men are maintaining a tight vigil to foil any infiltration bids,” he said. The Corps commander said that the Army will go tough against militants “but will facilitate the return of those who want to shun violence.” “Whosoever is holding guns will face tough action from the army. However, those willing to return by shunning the path of violence are welcome. We will facilitate their return. I appeal to the local militants to get ready to quit militancy and return as the environment is feasible to start a new and peaceful life,” General Raju said. He said that they have been able to keep the violence in Kashmir at a threshold. “Today there are over 200 militants active at any given point of time in Kashmir which was like 260 in the beginning of the year,” the top army commander said. According to the army data, out of 207 active militants in Kashmir at the moment, 90 are Pakistanis while the rest are locals. Of the total militants present in Kashmir at the moment, 89 are with Lashkar-e-Taiba, 56 with Hizbul Mujahideen while Jaish-e-Mohammad has 52 active militants. Al-Bard, which had been dormant for years, has been successful in recruiting 16 local youths this year out of which 10 are active, the data reveals. General Raju said the Army will now focus more on surrenders “because for us, getting a man back is more important than neutralising him.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/kashmir-now-past-stage-of-uneasy-calm-number-of-active-militants-reduced-indian-army-907165.html

Saini was summoned to join the investigation at the Mataur police station in Mohali. He reached the police station at around 11 am to appear before the Special Investigation Team and came out at around 1:30 pm. To queries by mediapersons after he came out after being questioned, Saini said, “I will speak at length some other time". The former Director-General of Police had last appeared before the SIT on September 28. However, on September 30, he had failed to appear before the police. Saini was booked in May in connection with the disappearance of Multani in 1991 when he was working as a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation. The Supreme Court had granted him interim protection from arrest in this matter. The police had added a murder charge under section 302 of the IPC in the FIR in the Multani disappearance case after two former Chandigarh police personnel--former UT police Inspector Jagir Singh and former ASI Kuldeep Singh, who are also co-accused, turned approver. Saini, a 1982-batch IPS officer, was the youngest DGP in the country when he was appointed the state police chief in 2012. He was removed from the DGP's post in 2015 after protests erupted following sacrilege incidents. Saini retired in 2018. Multani, who was a resident of Mohali, was picked up by the police after the terrorist attack on Saini, who was then the senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh, in 1991. However, the police had later claimed that Multani, son of a former IAS officer, had escaped from police custody of Qadian police in Gurdaspur. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Balwant Multani's brother, Palwinder Singh Multani, who is a resident of Jalandhar. The case was registered against them under sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/multani-case-former-punjab-dgp-sumedh-saini-appears-before-sit-907233.html

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the interim plea of Tamil Nadu and parties like AIADMK which had moved it for grant of 50 per cent quota in medical seats surrendered by the state in all-India reservation for under-graduate, post graduate and dental courses for the 2020-21 academic year. The Madras High Court had a couple of months ago held that the OBC students have a right to reservation in All India Quota Seats and had directed the Central and State Government authorities to work out the procedure in “terms of implementing State Specific reservation”. "While the Committee has been constituted, it is indeed disappointing that the OBC reservation will not be implemented in the current Academic Year itself. As such, it is a disheartening that the dreams of thousands of OBC students and medical aspirants may not be fulfilled in the present year," Stalin said in a letter to Modi. Contending that the politics of the country has been founded on social justice principles, Stalin said in spite of ideological differences, political parties have always united to strive for the advancement of underprivileged and socially downtrodden communities. "I, therefore, urge you to immediately intervene in the interest of the Other Backward Classes’ students and ensure that the Committee finalizes the Terms of Implementation for the execution of the state-specific quota, in accordance with the judgment of the Hon’ble Madras High Court, so that reservation can be implemented during this Academic Year," he said. He also sought to target AIADMK by seeking to know whether Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami would muster the courage to say that his party will not align with the BJP if it did not implement the quota. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri, CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan, and PMK founder S Ramadoss also asked Palaniswami to exert pressure on the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dmk-asks-pm-to-ensure-implementation-of-obc-quota-in-medical-courses-907339.html
26-10-2020||North and Central||Major setback to PDP in Jammu; three senior leaders resign||In a major setback to the People's Democratic Party (PDP), three of its senior leaders, including a former MP, on Monday announced their resignation from the party, days after its president Mehbooba Mufti stoked a controversy by her remarks on the national flag. In a joint letter to Mehbooba, former MP T S Bajwa, Ved Mahajan and Hussain Ali Waffa said, "We feel uncomfortable and suffocated, forcing us to make a difficult decision of leaving the party." Waffa is a former PDP state secretary, and Mahajan a former MLC. In her first press conference after over 14 months of detention, former chief minister and PDP supremo Mehbooba on Friday had said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back. The PDP leader had also said that she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was restored. The Centre on August 5 last year had abrogated the erstwhile state's special status and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. The trio in their two-page letter said, "We, your party colleagues in Jammu region, most of whom remained associated with the party through every thick and thin, since its formation, are feeling quite uncomfortable over some of your actions and undesirable utterances, especially which hurt patriotic sentiments." PDP founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had broader objectives behind the formation of the party which included the creation of a viable political alternative in Jammu and Kashmir to represent the regional aspirations of the people, the letter read. Forming the PDP was also meant to channelise dissent, especially among the youth, and prevent them from falling in the trap of anti-India elements in the absence of any credible platform to represent their genuine feelings, besides secularism and broader interests of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and interest of the nation, it said. These were the underlying principles behind the formation of the PDP, the letter read. "The party received an overwhelming response to these initiatives and it could emerge as a meaningful political force to attain power in a very short span and formed the government in coalition with Congress which performed very well and delivered in accordance with the set goals, achieving a lot in the direction of restoration of peace, harmony and ensuring equitable development of different regions," it said. Referring to the last PDP-BJP government, which collapsed after the saffron party pulled out in 2018, the leaders said the party under the leadership of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed took a difficult decision of joining hands with the ideologically opposite BJP but the experiment did not work on the expected lines. "The sudden death of Sayeed derailed the whole process and the later developments are a history and another phase of the struggle, and test of the leadership started post the August 5 last year development when the Centre abrogated the special status and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two union territories," they said in their letter. "Despite several undesirable developments and steps, we stood like a rock with the party and the leadership in spite of serious reservations on the handling and response of the party to the challenges of the situation in front of the party," the leaders said. Instead of overcoming the challenges from within and outside by a process of broader consultations and trust, "some elements within the party started pulling the party and leadership in a particular direction, thus deviating from the basic principles, agenda and philosophy, making it further difficult to face the saner voices in society", the letter read. "Some of the actions and utterances are unpardonable and unforgettable by the people, for the party to emerge out and move in the direction of its fundamental approach and identity, besides regaining its image as a political alternative to the people," it said. BJP leaders have hit out at Mehbooba for her remarks, saying seditious statements will not be tolerated. Over the past two days, the PDP headquarters in Jammu saw repeated attempts by various groups and individuals to hoist the national flag, prompting authorities to deploy police personnel in strength to avoid any untoward incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/major-setback-to-pdp-in-jammu-three-senior-leaders-resign-907344.html

The state government had sent a detailed project report of ERCP to the Central Water Commission for necessary approval in November 2017.  Gehlot said that in the past, the Centre has given national project status to drinking water and irrigation projects in 16 different states, but no such project of Rajasthan has this status. "Due to the serious problem of drinking water in many districts of the state, it is necessary to give this project the status of a national project and ensure its quick implementation," the statement said.  The ERCP project will ensure adequate water availability for drinking and irrigation by the year 2051 in 13 districts including Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Tonk, Jaipur, Dausa, Karauli, Alwar, Bharatpur and Dholpur.  According to the detailed project report of the ERCP, the project is supposed to access the surplus waters of the sub-basins of the rivers Kunnu, Kul, Parvati, Kalisindh and Mej during the monsoon into the sub-basins of the Banas, Morel, Banganga, Gambhir and Parbati rivers.  The chief minister had previously in July this year written a letter to the prime minister in this regard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot-writes-to-pm-modi-demanding-national-project-status-for-east-rajasthan-canal-project-907353.html

Later the Manch officer bearer, identified as Gaurav Thakur, waved the saffron flag and recited the 'Shiv Chalisa' while sitting on a bench inside the Taj complex. Thakur also posted a video showing himself reciting the hymns while sitting on a bench and another person standing behind him carrying a saffron flag. Thakur said that his organisation considered Taj Mahal to be a Shiva temple, which was 'demolished' by the Mughal emperor Shahjahan and converted into a mosque. ''For us it (Taj) is an ancient Shiva Temple....we have earlier also performed puja inside the complex,'' he claimed. Reports said that the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which was in charge of the security of Taj Mahal, had apprehended the saffron outfit's activists when they waved the flags and recited the hymns but let them off later. The security agency said it would check surveillance footage to confirm the reports. Last year also a saffron leader had tried to perform 'jalabhishek' (offering of the sacred Ganga waters at Shiva temples) inside the Taj complex but was thwarted by the security personnel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/saffron-flag-waved-shiv-chalisa-recitation-inside-taj-mahal-on-dussehra-907356.html

26-10-2020||North and Central||Allahabad High Court raises concern over misuse of Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act||The Allahabad High Court has raised concerns over misuse of the anti-cow slaughter law in Uttar Pradesh to target innocent persons and lack of forensic evidence to prove that the recovered meat is beef. Granting bail to one Rahmuddin who was allegedly involved in cow slaughter, Justice Sidharth in his order said the misuse of the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955, has been leading to innocent persons languishing in jail. "The Act is being misused against innocent persons. Whenever any meat is recovered, it is normally shown as cow meat (beef) without getting it examined or analyzed by the forensic laboratory. In most of the cases, meat is not sent for analysis. Accused persons continue to remain in jail for an offence that may not have been committed at all,” the High Court order said. In the order passed on October 19 but made available days later, the high court also observed that there is a need to take care of old or non-milking cows which are abandoned by owners, if the law against the slaughter of cows is to be implemented in letter and spirit. "Goshalas do not accept non-milking cows or old cows and they are left to wander on the roads. In rural areas cattle owners who are unable to feed their livestock, abandon them. They cannot be transported outside the state for fear of locals and police. There are no pastures now. Thus, these animals wander here and there destroying the crops. "Whether cows are on roads or on fields their abandonment adversely affects the society in a big way. Some way out has to be found out to keep them either in cow shelters or with the owners if UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act is to be implemented in letter and spirit,” the order said. Rahmuddin, the petitioner in this case, had said there were no specific allegations against him in the FIR and he was not arrested from the place of the incident. Further, no exercise was done by police to check whether the meat recovered was cow meat or not.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/allahabad-high-court-raises-concern-over-misuse-of-uttar-pradesh-prevention-of-cow-slaughter-act-907388.html

He also hit out the BJP-led Centre over the three recent farm laws, saying the farmers are not getting proper price for their produce and the three legislations will push them into economic distress and financial ruin. "If farmers oppose the policies of the government, then their voices are silenced by batons and sent to jail by filing false cases against them," the Congress leader said. Attacking the Manohar Lal Khattar government over the "rising prices" of essential commodities, Hooda said, "Prices of commonly consumed vegetables and other essential commodities have increased so much that it has become difficult for the common man to run the kitchen." The entire state is troubled by inflation and corruption, he said. "Today, prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes have increased manifold. Pulses, rice, flour and sugar have all recorded record-high prices. Power tariff has increased, petrol and diesel prices are constantly skyrocketing despite low international prices of the crude oil. "All this is happening when people's income and employment are decreasing. This is the reason why every section is on the streets against this government," said the leader of the opposition in the state. Asserting the Baroda bye-election was an opportunity for people to show a mirror to this government which has failed on all fronts, Hooda said people should not consider it just an election to elect a legislator, but to send a signal "the countdown of this non-performing government". Hooda said the victory of Congress candidate Induraj Narwal in Baroda "will be the victory of every poor and common man of the state". "Induraj's victory will send a message to the government and the entire state that the common man has been troubled by the policies of this government. Now he has made up his mind to teach the government a lesson. Therefore, every section of the society in Baroda should vote for the change and vote in support of Induraj," he told the electorate. BJP has fielded Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt, who is backed by saffron party's ally JJP, Congress has put up Induraj Narwal as its candidate while Joginder Singh Malik from the INLD has entered the fray from Baroda constituency which falls in Sonipat district. The bypoll was necessitated due to demise of Congress' Krishan Hooda in April.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/baroda-bypoll-hooda-slams-bjp-jjp-govt-over-rising-prices-of-essential-commodities-907390.html

26-10-2020||Opinion||Zero hour is coming for emissions||By David Fickling, It’s only natural to be skeptical when a political leader stands up and makes a promise about a target that’s far off, hard to achieve, and lacks a clear pathway. So one reaction to a report that Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, will pledge next week to reduce the country’s net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 might be: Really? After all, public and private Japanese banks are still funding new coal-fired power stations in Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh, exploiting a loophole in Tokyo’s previous promise to reduce financing to such projects — a fact that’s causing some consternation among European investment funds. For all the publicity garnered by South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s Green New Deal and pledge last month of a 2050 net zero target, Korean engineering companies, too, are working with Japanese funders on Vietnam’s Vung Ang 2 coal plant. Chinese President Xi Jinping also garnered plenty of positive headlines last month for promising to bring the world’s largest emitter to net zero status by 2060 — but China still has 250 gigawatts of coal plants under development, more than the total existing fleets in India or the US.  Doubts are warranted when so many nations are falling far short of their own climate pledges. At the same time, it can be pushed too far. The promises of political leaders have real-world effects that we’re already seeing. On the path to getting the binding and comprehensive emissions policies that the world needs, there will be plenty of partial, vague and unenforceable pledges. Each of them, though, sets a new baseline that will help create the conditions for further, more ambitious policies. Take the broadly accepted target that the world must stabilise atmospheric carbon dioxide at or below 450 parts per million. Until relatively recently, this was generally considered the most radical reasonable option. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2001 synthesis of scientific research took 450ppm as the lower bound of a range of outcomes stretching up to 750ppm. The influential 2006 U.K. government review of the economics of climate change by Nicholas Stern advised aiming for 500ppm to 550ppm. That ambition was considered bold at the time but is now accepted as grossly inadequate. Similarly, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius was rarely treated as a serious option until the 2015 Paris Agreement set a target “well below 2 degrees Celsius” at the behest of small island states that risk destruction from higher levels of warming. What target skeptics miss is the feedback relationship between the stated goals of political leaders and the behavior of investors, engineers and lower-level officials whose work will help decarbonise the economy. As should be obvious from the $3.5 billion a year spent on lobbying in the US alone, the decisions of political leaders shape the field of what’s possible for businesses. When a politician embraces a net-zero ambition — and especially when, as in the European Union, those words are enshrined into law — the risks associated with carbon-intensive projects go up, while those associated with low-carbon technologies go down. That's particularly the case when, as we’re seeing, the path starts to be followed by leaders in multiple countries. Lower-carbon approaches then become more viable. That shift in the technological frontier in turn makes it easier for politicians to set still bolder targets, because the political and economic costs of doing so have declined. We’re seeing this sort of virtuous circle playing out. As we’ve written, the best guide to the path of power sector emissions in the 2010s wasn’t the International Energy Agency’s politics-as-usual scenario, but the one where radical action was taken to limit atmospheric carbon to 450ppm.  Just over a month ago, I greeted PetroChina Co.’s announcement of a 2050 “near-zero” emissions target by fretting that China may be more addicted to coal than oil. That’s still a reasonable concern, but Xi’s 2060 net zero promise two weeks after that column drastically changes the landscape. Within weeks of that speech, influential Chinese academic research institutes have already released a range of roadmaps that would illustrate how to put those words into action, with coal falling from nearly 70% of primary energy at present to 10% or less in 2050. Any targets laid out by politicians will find themselves up against institutional inertia, unintended consequences and political pushback. That doesn’t make them worthless. Political rhetoric changes reality, and even a cursory examination of recent history shows you how quickly that can happen. Not one question was asked on the subject of climate during the 2016 US presidential debates. This year, it’s been one of the most-discussed topics. Turning round an oil tanker takes time. That doesn't mean it’s impossible.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/zero-hour-is-coming-for-emissions-907023.html
26-10-2020||Opinion||Why Mercedes and BMW are the cars of choice in a pandemic||By Chris Bryant  “My chauffeur has difficulty parking our limousine” is the definition of a first-world problem but it’s one Mercedes-Benz was determined to solve with the latest iteration of its top-of-range S-Class saloon. The rear wheels can turn in the opposite direction to those at the front, which gives the hulking vehicle a smaller turning circle. “Wie praktisch!” (How practical!) Mercedes’s parent company, Daimler AG, has shown similarly impressive maneuverability during the pandemic. After delivering an astonishing 5 billion euros ($6 billion) of free cash flow during the July to September quarter, the German luxury car and truck maker has raised its full-year financial outlook. Operating profit is now expected to be about the same as last year’s 4.3 billion euros. True, this is a low bar — 2019 wasn’t a great year for Daimler. But it’s a remarkably resilient performance when many western markets are in recession and Mercedes is having to increase sales of less profitable hybrid and electric vehicles this year to meet Europe’s emissions targets. It’s also a much better outcome than the one investors feared when the company, like peers, shuttered factories in the spring. Some analysts had said Daimler would have to raise capital. An equity raise looks less likely now, provided the pandemic doesn’t get a lot worse. Daimler’s industrial businesses have 13 billion euros of net liquidity and the shares have more than doubled since March. There are signs that BMW AG and Volkswagen AG have done almost as well. BMW’s car sales rose 9% year-on-year in the third quarter and it produced 3.1 billion euros of free cash flow. The three German automakers generated almost 15 billion euros of free cash flow between them during that three-month period, estimates Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. Euro zone economic data also show the manufacturing sector is faring much better than services. So what’s gone right for Germany’s automotive export champions? In one respect, their outperformance was almost preordained. French and Italian automakers have what’s called negative working capital: put simply, they try to hold little inventory and settle with their suppliers long after they’ve received payment from dealers. This helps generate cash when revenues are growing, but the effect is reversed when production stops suddenly. Supplier bills come due and cash rushes out the door. More than half of the 6.4 billion euros of cash that France’s Renault SA burned through in the first half of this year was down to working capital. The German carmakers don’t operate like this. Mercedes has in fact generated cash by reducing stocks of unsold cars and trucks and restarting production only gradually. BMW said working capital effects boosted its free cash flow, too, during the third quarter.  More surprising has been the quick rebound in demand for luxury cars. Germany’s valued-added tax cut have helped sales at home. But China’s swift recovery from the virus is the biggest factor. Mercedes China sales rose 23% year-on-year in the third quarter. German carmakers’ globe-spanning sales team and assembly plants were considered a problem when investors’ biggest worry was the US-China trade war. The large regional differences in containing the virus make that international presence an advantage. Peugeot SA’s sales, by contrast, are heavily concentrated in Europe. It also helps that Mercedes’s white-collar clientele still have jobs mostly. Some have even more spare cash because they’ve not had so many luxury holidays and expensive meals out this year. Sales of Mercedes sports-utility vehicles, which usually generate higher profit margins, jumped by almost a quarter in the three months to September. For the same reason, the pandemic has had only a modest impact on the company’s enormous car loan and leasing unit. Earlier in the pandemic Mercedes offered customers a payment holiday and warned of a possible rise in credit losses. But most customers have returned to a normal payment schedule. Used car prices have also stabilized. Meanwhile, the sense of urgency created by Covid-19 has given impetus to Daimler’s efforts to cut its bloated costs and curtail wasteful investment. After expanding for years, the Mercedes employee count has declined slightly in 2020.  Shareholders will still wonder whether the current performance is sustainable and what Daimler might achieve in a “normal” year.

Those sparkly bits of plastic that make ornaments twinkle, wrapping paper glimmer and wreaths shimmer are increasingly seen as an environmental hazard. In response, three British retailers are eliminating them from gift bags, Christmas crackers and other holiday staples. Thus a more sustainable and guilt-free Christmas will be had by all. Or so the thinking goes. It’s not a crazy idea. Tiny pieces of plastic are indeed a threat to the environment, and retailers can make a difference in reducing them. But doing so will require far more than banning holiday baubles. It’ll mean rethinking how everyday plastics are manufactured and marketed to consumers in the first place. Plastic pollution, especially in the ocean, is typically associated with single-use items such as bags and straws. But in recent years, scientists have also focused on the profusion of so-called microplastics, which are about the size of a sesame seed or less. Some of these are generated by the breakdown and abrasion of larger products. But a significant percentage are “primary microplastics,” such as synthetic clothing fibers, worn tire treads, and the microbeads used in products like toothpaste and body scrubs. They add up. Humans release 1.5 million tons of primary microplastics into the ocean annually, a sum equivalent to one disgorged plastic bag for every person each week. Such pollutants now make up as much as 31% of all ocean plastic, and they turn up all over the marine environment, from the ocean surface to the seafloor to the guts of a wide range of fauna. Fixing the problem isn’t easy, in part because the major sources of microplastics aren’t easily regulated. A comprehensive 2017 study of the problem found that just 2% of such plastics are derived from microbeads, which several countries have started restricting. The leading source — at 35% — turned out to be clothes made from synthetic textiles (such as holiday-themed polar fleece pullovers) that had been run through the laundry. In second place, at 28%, were the abraded bits of car and truck tires that wash from roads into waterways. Glitter didn’t even make the list. But it has become something of a pop-culture pariah nonetheless. In 2017, glitter-skeptical studies inspired a British daycare chain to stop ordering the stuff for its preschoolers. In 2018, “Strictly Come Dancing,” a British television show, announced that glitter would no longer be welcome on contestants’ costumes. Retailers soon followed, with Waitrose Ltd. making plans to ban glitter from its own-brand products. In recent weeks, John Lewis Partnership Plc and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc have taken similar steps. These efforts won’t do much to reduce marine plastics (boat paint, not Christmas, is the leading market for glitter). But they do offer retailers a way to burnish their environmental bona fides without having to meaningfully alter how they operate. Morrisons recently went so far as to tell the BBC that it adopted its anti-glitter stance so customers can enjoy the holidays “without worrying about the environmental impact.” Shoppers are unlikely to be fooled by such rhetoric for long. As anti-plastic sentiment grows globally, British consumers are already demanding sustainable products and shopping experiences. In time, they’ll expect retailers and brands to address the products that are actually contributing to the problem. The good news is that several companies are on the right track. Leading apparel brands, including Patagonia Inc., Adidas AG and Hennes & Mauritz AB, have acknowledged that their synthetic garments are a major source of plastic microfiber pollution. Some are researching better manufacturing methods, while others are educating consumers about how to care for garments so that they pollute less. Retailers could play an important role in amplifying that message. They could start by marketing best practices for managing synthetic garments and offering products such as filter bags and front-loading washers that help reduce fiber pollution. In the long term, these efforts should pressure manufacturers into creating more sustainable products and nudge consumers to think twice about the environmental impact of their clothing. That won’t bring back the once-beloved holiday glitter. But it’ll ensure that retailers aren’t just faking it when they say they’re going green.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/plastic-waste-banning-glitter-won-t-save-the-oceans-907407.html
26-10-2020||Opinion||US: The shine is coming off the boom stocks of 2020||As investors think about which stocks to hold going into 2021, there may be no bigger red flag than a huge third-quarter earnings beat. That's because of what the pandemic has done to consumer behaviors and corporate earnings this year — impacts that may turn out to be more transitory than real-time-obsessed investors may anticipate. We're already seeing the shine coming off the stocks of some of the early pandemic winners, an impact that may broaden as people turn their attention to next year's business prospects. Two companies where this "pandemic boom followed by bust" arc has played out are Netflix Inc. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. During the most intense phase of the pandemic in March and April, video streaming services and toilet paper were the ultimate shelter-at-home amenities. That shift in consumer behavior flowed through into first-quarter results. Netflix subscriber growth soared above the rates it had seen during the same period in earlier years. Kimberly-Clark, maker of toilet paper brands like Cottonelle and Scott, similarly showed strong growth. In mid-April, as they were reporting earnings, both companies' stocks were up on the year while the S&P 500 Index had fallen more than 10%.  But with two more quarters of earnings reports behind us, we've seen that those gains were more like a one-time windfall. Netflix is still on pace for a strong year of subscriber growth, but it has added very few new customers since April. And Kimberly-Clark's revenues tied to supplying office buildings have slumped, while consumers are now well stocked, leading to the company’s disappointing guidance in its third-quarter earnings report. Both companies' stocks fell about 5% after reporting their results last week, and their stocks are little changed since mid-April, despite the S&P 500 rallying around 20% since then. This is the lens through which investors should examine strength in third-quarter earnings. To the extent companies are reporting better results than they ever have, how much of that represents being winners in some post-pandemic world versus a one-off windfall as consumers shifted their behavior over the past few months? A great example of this phenomenon might be Whirlpool Corp., which reported earnings per share of $6.91, smashing consensus estimates of $4.20. An appliance maker reporting strong results isn't a surprise when it's been difficult to find items like refrigerators in stock for months. Yet after rallying strongly after hours on Wednesday afternoon, the stock closed down on Thursday, with investors perhaps wondering if this is as good as it gets for pandemic-related home-improvement purchases. What we might be seeing in the third quarter is a peak, whether in actual sales or investor expectations, of pandemic-related goods purchases. Over many decades the purchase of goods like automobiles and home appliances has shrunk relative to services in the consumer spending basket, but as my colleague Tim Duy notes, that has reversed dramatically during the pandemic. Assuming the public-health crisis fades in 2021 through a combination of mass vaccinations and other medical advances, it's likely that consumers will shift their spending back to services to some degree, perhaps even overshooting in the opposite direction. If 2020 was the year that Americans bought a second refrigerator or did an extra home-improvement project, then 2021 might be the year Americans take that bucket-list trip to a national park or splurge on dining out after being unable to do so for months. If so, that would be bad news for the fortunes of companies that made products like recreation vehicles, which have already seen their sales boom this year. Notably, the stocks of companies in that industry, such as Thor Industries Inc. and Camping World Holdings Inc., had sagged over the past few months even before a downturn in sales. It also means caution for pandemic-related e-commerce winners like Etsy Inc., Wayfair Inc. and Overstock.com Inc., because of the risks of consumption shifting back to services away from goods, and to stores away from shopping online. Housing might be the wild card in all this, with the industry's many structural tailwinds related to demographics, low interest rates, low supply and growing production. That being said, despite robust economic data for the housing industry over the past few months, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF remains stuck around mid-August levels, suggesting that a lot of optimism is already built into prices. Even if it's now looking like it will be at least the middle of next year before society gets fully back to normal, forward-looking investors are trying to price that in ahead of time. So any blowout earnings reports we get over the next few weeks might signal the end of the good times rather than a trend to ride into 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-the-shine-is-coming-off-the-boom-stocks-of-2020-907411.html
26-10-2020||South||Hindu Munnani opposes govt bid to 'acquire' land belonging to temple in Tamil Nadu||The Hindu Munnani on Monday alleged that the authorities intended to acquire 35 acres of land belonging to a temple to build a collectorate complex for the newly carved out Kallakurichi district in Tamil Nadu and strongly opposed the move. Rather than showing concern about the state of ruin of the Veera Cholapuram Sri Ardhanareeswara temple in Kallakurichi district, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department has placed advertisements in newspapers about the intended sale of that shrine's land, Munnani, a Tamil Nadu-based affiliate of the RSS said in a statement. According to the advertisement, Rs 1.98 crore has been fixed as the price for 35 acres owned by the Shiva temple and the bid to acquire the land is to build a new collectorate complex for Kallakurichi district, State Secretary of the Munnani, T Manoharan said. The government department has invited objections if any to the proposal and office-bearers of the Munnai from Kallakurichi district have forwarded representations to authorities opposing the 'sell-off.' The proposed alienation not only went against the intention of the donors of the land, which was to create an endowment to support the temple perpetually for its regular functioning but also a 'betrayal,' he alleged. Even according to the government's guidelines, 35 acre land should fetch about Rs 100 crore and fixing a value of Rs 1.98 crore is "fraud and an illegal move," the Munnani alleged. "It is illegal for the government to take up construction activities in the site which is yet to become the property of the government. This is condemnable," he alleged. He also urged the people to protest against the endowment department's bid to sell the land belonging to the centuries-old temple. Authorities were not immediately available for comment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hindu-munnani-opposes-govt-bid-to-acquire-land-belonging-to-temple-in-tamil-nadu-907136.html

While the state government claimed the amendment was made to curb misuse of social media for insulting others, especially women, but did not specify which social media. It says "any means of communication" in general. Moreover, threatening, insulting and harming the reputation of others would come under the purview of the proposed amendment by including a new Section, 118-A, to the Kerala Police act. Punishment under this Section would extend up to five year imprisonment and fine of Rs. 10,000. Various forum of journalists, human rights activists and opposition parties had earlier flayed the move. Causing serious embarrassment to the CPI(M)-led front, CPI, the second-largest party in the coalition, on Monday expressed concerns over the move through an editorial on its mouthpiece 'Janayugam'. It said that the concerns raised by the media and human rights activists that the proposed amendments could be misused by the police could not be ruled out and such amendments need to be introduced only after detailed discussions in the society. The immediate provocation of the government for introducing the new section was the delay in police action on a complaint by women activists against a vlogger for allegedly posting defamatory comments and the women activist manhandling the vlogger accusing of police inaction. The police's justification was the absence of provisions in the law to act against the offence. The Supreme Court had earlier scrapped section 66-A of IT Act and section 118-D of Kerala Police Act which dealt with the publishing of objectionable contents of social media. Various sensational cases, including an email troll of a palatial house, said to be that of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, was registered using those sections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/concerns-within-kerala-left-front-over-new-law-to-curb-social-media-misuse-907255.html

Political party leaders are making a beeline to the house offering support to ensure justice. Many of the accused were having CPI(M) links and the left-front government in Kerala faced allegations of helping the accused. The sisters, aged 13 and nine were found hanging in their one-room thatched house in Valayar near the Kerala - Tamilnadu border within 50 days of each other on January 13, 2017 and March 4. The five accused in the case were local people having close connections with family. Medical reports of the deceased indicated sexual assault on the children. State police filed a charge sheet against five, including a minor, for rape and abetting suicide. But a POCSO court in Palakkad acquitted three of the accused in October 2019. An appeal filed against it was still pending. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan earlier announced that the government would even go for a CBI probe into the case to ensure justice to the victims and family. But the government later ordered a judicial probe. The parents of the children allege that even one year after the acquittal of the accused, they were yet to see any ray of hope of justice and hence they were forced to launch a stir. Police officer who headed the probe was even given promotion, they said. Congress leaders including leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala who called on the parents on Monday said that if Congress comes to power in Kerala, it would ensure justice to the parents. BJP demanded that the probe should be handed over to CBI.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/parents-in-kerala-launch-protest-seeking-justice-against-those-who-killed-daughters-907307.html

DMK chief M K Stalin said that the top court's ruling was a disappointment and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure 50 per cent quota implementation from the current academic year itself. Hitting out at the state government and Chief Minister K Palaniswami, he said the latter must exert political pressure on Modi for getting in place the reservation immediately without enacting a 'drama' like guarding social justice. Also, the DMK leader asked Palaniswami to announce that "there will be no question of any electoral alliance with the BJP if the reservation is not provided this year itself." Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri alleged that the stand taken by the BJP-led Centre and the AIADMK's 'negligent' handling of the matter in the apex court led to the "betrayal" of backward students. CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan said the court's judgment has shattered the belief of students belonging to Other Backward Classes that they would get a reservation. He accused the Centre of betraying the cause of social justice and wanted 'democratic forces' to rally against "the injustice". The PMK, an ally of AIADMK, said the court verdict was very disappointing and wanted the Centre to come forward to immediately implement the reservation for OBCs. "This is possible", party founder leader S Ramadoss said adding it would be a doable task if the Centre is determined. He also urged Palaniswami to lead a delegation of leaders of all parties in Tamil Nadu to meet Modi and urge him to put in place the quota for medical courses. The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the interim plea of Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK for grant of 50 per cent quota in medical seats surrendered by the state in all India reservations for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses for the 2020-21 academic year. A three-member bench dismissed the interim prayer on the petition challenging the July 27 Madras High Court order on the limited point by which it had cleared the decks for OBC reservation under AQI medical seats in non-central institutions and gave the Centre three months' time to take a decision on the percentage. The state government and the ruling AIADMK in their limited point had sought relief saying that the high court had not specified that the OBC quota should be implemented in the current academic year itself.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-asks-tn-cm-to-mount-pressure-on-modi-for-obc-quota-this-year-in-medical-courses-907320.html

The Madras High Court had a couple of months ago held that the OBC students have a right to reservation in All India Quota Seats and had directed the Central and State Government authorities to work out the procedure in “terms of implementing State Specific reservation”. "While the Committee has been constituted, it is indeed disappointing that the OBC reservation will not be implemented in the current Academic Year itself. As such, it is a disheartening that the dreams of thousands of OBC students and medical aspirants may not be fulfilled in the present year,"(sic) Stalin said in a letter to Modi.  Contending that the politics of the country has been founded on social justice principles, Stalin said in spite of ideological differences, political parties have always united to strive for the advancement of underprivileged and socially downtrodden communities. "I, therefore, urge you to immediately intervene in the interest of the Other Backward Classes’ students and ensure that the Committee finalizes the Terms of Implementation for the execution of the state-specific quota, in accordance with the judgment of the Hon’ble Madras High Court, so that reservation can be implemented during this Academic Year," he said.  He also sought to target AIADMK by seeking to know whether Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami would muster the courage to say that his party will not align with the BJP if it did not implement the quota. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K S Alagiri, CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan, and PMK founder S Ramadoss also asked Palaniswami to exert pressure on the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-asks-pm-modi-to-ensure-implementation-of-obc-quota-in-medical-courses-907336.html

Rabins K Hameed, 42, who is the tenth-accused in the case pertaining to smuggling 30-kilogram gold, was deported to Kochi International Airport Monday afternoon from Dubai. The NIA special court in Kochi earlier issued a non-bailable warrant against Rabins. The NIA recorded his arrest and was being quizzed. He is a native of Muvattupuzha in the rural part of Ernakulam district and a close aide of third accused Faisal Fareed, who was suspected to have sent the gold from UAE using diplomatic baggage cover. According to the NIA, Rabins conspired with fifth accused Ramees K T, sixth accused Jalal A M and others and arranged funds and purchased gold from Dubai for smuggling through diplomatic baggage. He is accused of attempting to conceal gold in electronic and electric devices for smuggling. Some other accused, including Faisal Fareed, were also held by UAE authorities and are being interrogated as the role of some diplomats was also suspected in the smuggling using diplomatic baggage cover. NIA had issued INTERPOL blue notices for the accused. The NIA had recently stated before the NIA special court in Kochi that Faisal and Rabins were the main conspirators in the case. An NIA team had also visited UAE and the UAE authorities had extended cooperation to the probe. The NIA also maintained that the gold smuggling case could affect India's relationship with the UAE and security of India, including economic security. The NIA even suspected links of some of the accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case with proscribed terrorist Dawood Ibrahim.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-gold-smuggling-accused-deported-from-uae-to-kochi-907340.html

The notification comes after the Andhra Pradesh High Court's direction to the government last month to let people carry alcohol into the state in the permissible limits. Avowing a policy of reduced alcohol consumption “to improve the physical quality of people's life,” Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy has set several regulations last year that restricted alcohol availability in the state. Removal of 43,000 belt shops (unauthorised liquor outlets), reduction of permitted outlets too from 4380 to 2934, scaling down of sales hours, permitted quantities and unavailability of usual, popular alcohol brands, have established a bootlegging business in Andhra Pradesh. To eradicate illicit trade, Reddy's government had even constituted a Special Enforcement Bureau in May this year. According to the AP CMO officials, 48,182 cases of illegal transportation, unauthorised sale, processing of illicit liquor etc., were registered and 59,438 persons arrested till now. However, few individuals who were booked by AP police for carrying in liquor bottles from Telangana approached the High Court contending that they were in possession of alcohol in the permissible limits as per the GO 411. As per the order issued in September 2019, a person can have in his possession up to three bottles of any size of Indian Made Foreign Liquor, three bottles of foreign liquor, six 650 ml bottles of beer, two bulk litres of toddy. In a later government order, the beer allowance was reduced to three bottles. "The court was right in basing its direction on those earlier orders. We have now brought in the new GO which explicitly prohibits the transit of even one bottle of liquor into the state, unless with a valid permit granted in advance,” Dr Rajat Bhargava, special chief secretary, Revenue Department told DH. According to Bhargava, legal restrictions on interstate alcohol transit without payment of applicable duties, taxes, are in place from long in Andhra Pradesh and other states like Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu. “Since we are restricting alcohol supply, there has been lot of smuggling activity from the neighbouring states defeating our prohibition idea, while denting our revenues too,” Bhargava says.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-bans-carrying-of-alcohol-into-state-without-permit-907350.html

Yediyurappa performed puja to the Nandi Dhwaja near the Balarama Gate of the Palace at 3 pm during the Makara lagna. He performed ‘pushparchane’ (offering of flower petals) to the idol of Chamundeshwari Devi, placed in the golden howdah carried by elephant Abhimanyu at 3.55 pm, during Kumbha lagna, amid a 21-gun salute.  ‘Grand fete next year’ Yediyurappa said he prayed to Goddess Chamundeshwari to save people from the Covid-19 pandemic and also for peace and unity.  “People of the state are in distress due to the pandemic and also due to floods. The government is taking all steps to help the people. If all problems are solved, we will celebrate Dasara in a grand manner next year,” he said. The procession was limited to four folk art troupes, two companies of the Mounted Police and two tableaux, apart from the elephants.  Besides Abhimanyu, Nishane elephant Vikrama, Nowfath elephant Gopi and Kumkis elephants Vijaya and Kaveri also took part. Instead of the usual 5-km procession route from the Palace up to Bannimantapa, this year the procession was limited to 300 metres within the Palace precincts. Covid-19 awareness A tableau of the Health department created awareness on Covid-19, while the ‘maragaalu’ (balancing act on wooden leg extensions) artists depicted the slaying of coronavirus by Goddess Chamundeshwari.     The second tableau was a replica of the Aane Gaadi (elephant cart), carrying the Police Band playing music.

"On one hand, Congress leaders are asking for votes based on caste. On the other, the BJP has done 'vote-fixing' on similar lines as match fixing by misusing its power," he alleged. "The bypoll was necessitated in the first place because the then Congress MLA and now BJP candidate from RR Nagar, Munirathna, sold his MLA seat for money," Saravana said, alleging corrupt practices against both national parties. "It is being alleged that JD(S) candidate V Krishnamurthy is corrupt. This is being done only to weaken the morale of our party's cadre," Saravana said, seeking the Election Commission to take action in this regard. On Monday, the JD(S) filed a complaint to the Election Commission against Kempegowda Vokkaligara Meesalathi Horata Samithi for defamatory posts against its candidate Krishnamurthy. Further, the regional party's Bengaluru district incharge R Prakash alleged that Congress candidate Kusuma's father Hanumantharayappa was asking votes from Vokkaligas, seeking help get 'justice' to his daughter. "However, any day, it is HD Devegowda and HD Kumaraswamy who are the leaders for Vokkaligas," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-rajarajeshwarinagar-bypoll-rigged-says-jds-leader-t-a-saravana-907366.html
26-10-2020||State||Ahead of reopening, schools stare at teacher shortage||Apart from the risk of Covid-19 infection, the government is likely to face shortage of teachers in its efforts to reopen school, especially in private schools.  According to private school management representatives, many of the teachers have changed their profession due to uncertainty over reopening of schools, while many of those conducting online classes are not prepared to attend physical classes as their family members are not ready to send them back to work.  “When we tried contacting our teachers for consultation once a week, they refused to come. Some even communicated to us saying they will not be able to come to school to take physical classes,” said a management representative of a private unaided school in Bengaluru.  A majority of the teachers working with budget private schools have shifted to other professions as they were not paid for the last eight months. “In the beginning, we thought the job shifting was temporary. But now, we are scared that we will experience scarcity of teachers,” said the representative of another school management.  D Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said, “We will definitely face shortage of teachers as a majority of them have relocated to their native places during the lockdown and found alternative means of earning.” Another set of teachers currently engaged in online classes are not ready to come back as their family members are resisting. “Especially, women teachers have an issue from their families due to the Covid fear. They are saying they will not attend school till there is a vaccine for Covid-19,” Kumar said. “I shifted to a new job on a temporary basis. It’s been eight months and I am finding it better than teaching. I don’t think I will go back to teaching,” said a teacher who quit his job after his school failed to pay him during lockdown. As per the analysis by the private schools managements, at least 40% of the teachers will be unavailable, leading to unprecedented shortage when schools reopen for physical teaching.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ahead-of-reopening-schools-stare-at-teacher-shortage-907370.html

One lakh tests were conducted on Saturday. In the previous seven-day period from October 13 to 19, the state registered 52,689 cases. However, the numbers in the next week (Oct 20-26) came down to 35,343 new cases.  A majority of the new cases revealed on Monday were from Bengaluru Urban (1,603). In the rest of Karnataka, Dakshina Kannada registered 153 cases, followed by Mysuru (139), Davangere (124), Bengaluru Rural (87) and Chitradurga (86).  Monday also saw 42 more deaths of which 20 were from Bengaluru Urban. Only two of the deaths had actually happened on Monday.  In Bengaluru  Testing dropped by 28.2% to 36,045 in Bengaluru on Sunday after hitting a peak of 50,259 on October 21. The data suggests that this is the reason for the low case numbers published by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Monday. Over the last 10 days, 17% of new cases have been identified in Bengaluru South, followed by West Zone with 16%, Mahadevapura and East Zones, both with 15% each and Bommanahalli with 13%. The city’s official positivity rate stood at 11.73% on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-covid-cases-drop-to-3000-in-karnataka-due-to-low-testing-907374.html

Gowda, who was campagining for BJP candidate Puttanna contesting from the Bangalore Teachers' constituency in the upcoming MLC elections, attacked the Congress for putting farmers in jeopardy. "The party brought farmers to the streets to agitate against Centre's farm reforms, ignoring Covid-19," Gowda said. "Manpade, a farmers' leader, died of Covid and I hold Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar directly responsible for this,” he said. "They were responsible for spreading Covid because of these protests. If we ask them to maintain social distancing, they complain that we are anti-farmers." Responding to this, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Shivakumar dared Gowda to lodge a complaint against him. Further charging at JD(S), Gowda said the teachers' constituency voters were not foolish to believe allegations against Puttanna. Gowda's retort was for a recent allegation against Puttanna made by JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy, who claimed that he had helped him get Class-1 government jobs to his relatives. Puttanna, a JD(S) rebel, recently joined BJP. "Both Congress and JD(S) have become irrelevant," Gowda said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/siddaramaiah-d-k-shivakumar-responsible-for-manpades-death-d-v-sadananda-gowda-907389.html

26-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Encouraging trends emerge in Karnataka in fight against coronavirus||The steep decline in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Karnataka indicate that the infections are shifting from high population density areas to other places, a noted epidemiologist said. After clocking up to 10,000 cases daily for over a week early this month with fatalities even touching 200 on certain occasions, the caseload has come down to about 5,000 to 6,000 in the last week. The fatalities too have dipped from three digits to two digits. According to epidemiologist Giridhara R Babu, the fall in the number of cases and deaths due to coronavirus is quite evident and an encouraging trend. Some experts, however, attribute the drop in daily cases to the high testing rates and early detection of infections. "This reduction indicates that the coronavirus infection is shifting from high population density areas to other areas," Babu, an epidemiologist at the Indian Institute of Science and a member of the Covid-19 technical advisory group for the Karnataka government, told PTI. He explained in the other areas, higher population density may not be there. "So, therefore, it might be in alignment with what's happening in the country. So, let us wait and watch," he said. However, chief of the Karnataka Covid-19 War Room, Munish Moudgil attributed the high testing rate to the slump in the number of new infections. In general, the cases are coming down as the infection is coming under control, Moudgil said. He said holidays too have seen reduction in cases. "But the general reduction trend is correct and proves the success of the Karnataka model of high testing leading to control of the disease," he added. According to a health official, Karnataka has started conducting tests extensively and opened sample collection centres at crowded places in urban areas. It is a common sight to see people sporting PPE kits under a makeshift canopy in Bengaluru at crowded places such as KR Market, Kalasipalya, Majestic, Gandhi Bazaar, Kumaraswamy Layout, Banashankari, BDA complexes, near shopping malls and bus stands, he said. "We are taking the coronavirus head on. Instead of collecting samples at the designated places with unprecedented precautions, we have opened camps at every nook and cranny in urban areas and other crowded places," the official added. According to him, health workers have turned into corona warriors in the true sense.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/encouraging-trends-emerge-in-karnataka-in-fight-against-coronavirus-907154.html
26-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19 puts ‘casteless’ hostels plan on hold||Citing cash crunch, the B S Yediyurappa administration has junked a Rs 100-crore plan to set up “casteless” hostels where students of all communities can live together.  Vetoing this project, the Finance department said the Covid-19 pandemic had impacted the state’s revenue collection.  “In the current financial situation, it is not possible to provide additional funds. Therefore, the proposed project has been deferred for two years,” the Finance department said in response to its concurrence sought by the Social Welfare department.  These combined student hostels were to be started in every district for SC, ST, OBC, minority and general category students to live together. The project was formally announced with an outlay of Rs 100 crore in the 2019-20 budget by the then chief minister H D Kumaraswamy who headed the Congress-JD(S) coalition.  This project of creating general hostels where students across caste and community could stay was intended to counter the long-held notion that the government itself promoted casteism through separate hostels for students belonging to different social groups. According to sources, funding these general hostels was to be shared among the departments of Social Welfare, Backward Classes Welfare, Minority Welfare and Education. Also, there was no clarity on whether existing hostels should be converted into general ones.  The state government runs 3,500 hostels across Karnataka out of which the Social Welfare department has 1,200 pre-matric and over 600 post-matric hostels for SC/ST students. The Backward Classes Welfare Department has 2,438 hostels for OBC students and the Minority Welfare department operates over 300 hostels.  Also, the plan to introduce sweeping changes to root out corruption in the management of student hostels went into cold storage because of the pandemic. Former additional chief secretary Renuka Chidambaram’s report on revamping the hostels is yet to be taken up.  Many projects, including the ones Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa announced in his 2020-21 budget, have been put on the backburner because of the Covid-19 pandemic and its resultant economic crisis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-puts-casteless-hostels-plan-on-hold-907369.html

Addressing a poll rally in support of BJP candidate Jitu Chaudhary in Kaprada town of Valsad district, Rupani said these by-elections have been necessitated because eight Congress MLAs resigned. "The Congress is getting disintegrated across the country. It is a sinking ship. Time has come to bury the Congress by putting the last nail in its coffin," he said. He claimed that Congress workers do not have any trust in their party's leadership. "Questions are also raised on Rahul Gandhi's ability to lead. The party workers are trying to get freedom from dynastic leadership. The party workers are still unhappy and the Congress will see more defections after this bypoll," the Chief Minister claimed. "The MLAs realised it is difficult to do people's work while being in the Congress, because the party believes in keeping only one family happy. Jitubhai (Chaudhary) has joined the BJP for the betterment of his constituency," he said. Rupani noted that a number of Congress MLAs left the party in the past too. In 2017, Congress heavyweight Shankersinh Vaghela left the party with 13 other MLAs, followed by the exit of six next year and now eight legislators, he said. Jitu Chaudhary is the BJP's candidate from Kaprada seat, one of the eight constituencies where by-elections have been necessitated as eight Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in June this year. The defection helped the BJP to win one extra seat in the Rajya Sabha elections. Out of the eight MLAs who resigned, five, including Chaudhary, joined the BJP and the ruling party has nominated them for the bypolls. Besides Kaprada, the other seats where bypolls will be held on November 3 are -Limbdi, Karjan, Abdasa, Gadhada, Dang, Morbi and Dhari.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/congress-will-see-more-defections-after-gujarat-bypolls-cm-vijay-rupani-907142.html

He said that Sunday’s Dussehra rally by Uddhav was just to give a clean chit to Aditya. “Those crying for justice for Bihar's son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra's son…the Thackeray family became a target…Aaditya became a target,” Uddhav had said in the rally.

Picking holes in Thackeray's speech made during the Sena's annual Dussehra rally here on Sunday evening, Shelar termed it as a "maha flop show" which was laced with "jealousy". Shelar also charged Thackeray with misconstruing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat's annual Dussehra speech and asked the chief minister to not compare the Shiv Sena's Hindutva with that of the RSS. Citing Bhagwat's speech in Nagpur on Sunday morning, Thackeray had stated, "the RSS chief said Hindutva has been narrowed down to only observing puja rituals". "Those who wear a black cap like him should understand this if they have brains," Thackeray had said, in a veiled attack on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on his remarks over Hindutva while asking for reopening places of religious worship earlier this month. Speaking to reporters here, Shelar said, "The RSS chief's speech was mentioned in the speech (by Thackeray). Uddhav ji compared the Hindutva of the RSS and that of Shiv Sena of today. We humbly ask him not to compare the two." The Hindutva of the RSS "is the skin", while Thackeray removed the shawl of Shiv Sena founder the late Bal Thackeray's Hindutva for power, the former Maharashtra minister said. "It would have been better had he heard Bhagwat's speech in its entirety. He picked convenient parts from the RSS chief's speech," Shelar alleged. Shelar also targeted Thackeray for mooting the idea of e-bhoomi pujan for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya due to the COVID-19 outbreak as well as for "supporting the CAA first and then opposing it". Bhagwat never mixed his positions on issues as the Shiv Sena does, the former BJP minister alleged. "Uddhav ji, your Hindutva has become adulterated in the company of the Congress and NCP. Yes, we reiterate, you will need a certificate of Hindutva. "You will need to take it from the RSS and the BJP. And yes, from the black cap too," Shelar added. On the chief minister daring the opposition to bring down his government, Shelar said Thackeray's comments stemmed for insecurity, adding that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would collapse "due to its own deeds". Shelar asked the MVA government to properly administer Mumbai at least before questioning the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. In a further taunt, Shelar said the "only effective speech" made at the Sena's Dussehra rally was by its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut. Meanwhile, BJP leader Narayan Rane also brushed aside Thackeray's speech and called it "vacuous and a tirade". He said Thackeray had no right to speak on Hindutva after forming alliances with "secular parties" in a "dishonest manner" by snapping ties with old ally BJP. "The Shiv Sena could win 56 seats (in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls) due to the blessings of PM Modi," Rane claimed. At the rally, Thackeray had broken his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, saying, "Those crying for justice for Bihar's son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra's son." Responding to Thackeray's remarks, Rane reiterated his earlier claim that actor Sushant Singh Rajput was "murdered". "Those accused of the murder will go behind bars one day. Among them will be a minister, who is his (Thackeray's) son?" he said. Rane, a former Shiv Sena leader, however, did not substantiate his claim with proof and also did not name the minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/senas-hindutva-adulterated-in-company-of-congress-ncp-bjp-907312.html

Rane’s diatribe came a day after the annual Dussehra rally of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray during which the latter had lashed out at the BJP. Targeting his bête noire, Rane said Uddhav lacks the knowledge to become Chief Minister. “He does not listen to the secretaries…we are seeing where the state is going whether it is issues of farmers, agriculture or economy,” he said, adding that the state’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic situation is alarming. “Over 43,000 people have died, which is the highest in India,” he said. Rane, a veteran politician, who was expelled from Shiv Sena, later joined the Congress and now BJP, accused the Chief Minister of having no knowledge of GDP and economy. “Does he know the laws and the Constitution,” he asked. On Uddhav’s charge that the state was owed about Rs 38,000 in GST dues, he said: “The state will get it…there could be delays…as far as what he (Uddhav) said about going backing to old system, let me remind that extensive consultations were held between Centre and states before GST was formally rolled out.” Rane said that the state should be capable of raising resources.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/uddhav-thackeray-is-buddhu-chief-minister-says-narayan-rane-907326.html
