India has been saying on global platforms that Pakistan supported terrorism. Now, Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhry has openly accepted that by saying that Pakistan was behind the Pulwama attack. Pakistan MP Ayaz Sadiq saying that Abhinandan was released fearing an attack by India shows how strong the leadership in India is, and its firm stand against terrorism and commitment for its defence forces, Joshi noted. Ruling out the possibility of imposing another round of lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 infection, he said, "There is no such proposal. Preparations required to manage the pandemic were made during the previous lockdown. The vaccine may come by November-end, but all should take precautions like wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing".||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/pralhad-joshi-slams-congress-for-demanding-proof-for-balakot-airstrike-909096.html

The distance between Earth and Moon on this day will be around 4,05,000 kilometres. On October 1, 2020, all could witness the first smallest moon of this year and the second and the last smallest full moon of this year is on October 31. October-end is all set to present an astounding spectacle in its night-sky in the form of ‘Blue Moon’ and quite rightfully so, the often-heard proverbial idiom of ‘Once in a Blue Moon’ will ultimately come under our observation embellishing the sky from its wonder.  The moon will be blue in name only, but it’ll be near in the sky to a bright red ‘star’. The similar type was witnessed on March 31, 2018. The next seasonal Blue Moon will be on August 22, 2021. The second smallest full moon can be witnessed without the use of binocular or telescope, according to amateur astronomer S A Mohankrishna.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/watch-smallest-full-moon-today-909254.html

30-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||MM Hills sanctuary: Caution boards installed to prevent illegal activities||Hereafter, those stopping vehicles midway at Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary, either to feed the wild animals, or take pictures of selfie, would have to pay a fine of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Caution boards are being installed at every kilometre from Koudalli to M M Hills. The Forest department had implemented the rule in January, and collected around Rs 30,000 in 10 months, from those stopping the vehicles on the road passing through the sanctuary. But, the vehicular riders and passengers to M M Hills were resisting this, as there were no warnings or instructions in this regard. This led to frequent quarrel between the visitors and the personnel. Hence, the department has decided to install caution boards on the stretch to prevent illegal activities like taking a break midway, having food, over-speeding.  There were many incidents where the wild animals were run over by the speeding vehicles. Besides, the public used to dispose junk and other food items, posing threat to the wild animals, which come in search of food on the roadsides. The animal deaths were more especially during the temple jatras, weekends and other special days. The department has also issued orders banning taking pictures in the wild, stopping vehicles and impose fine on the violators. The Forest department will deploy a patrolling vehicle and also personnel to check any violation. If any vehicle is found stationed midway, the patrol vehicle would rush to the spot, according to the officials. The department has also decided to lay road humps to prevent over-speeding of the vehicles, that have been claiming the lives of the wild animals, inside the forest. A discussion has been held with the Public Works Department, who have agreed to lay humps. Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Deputy Conservator of Forest V Yedukondalu said, "The department would identify sensitive places frequented by animals to cross the roads and road humps laid. With M M Wildlife Sanctuary to be Tiger reserve soon, all conservation steps are being taken."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mm-hills-sanctuary-caution-boards-installed-to-prevent-illegal-activities-909256.html

Some miscreants are making baseless allegations to disgrace the village, said Paluru resident Bolliyanda Harish. Speaking to media persons, he said that following a recent incident where a labourer drowned in a stream near the village, the whole incident was being presented in a distorted way. The labourer who died is identified as Vasanth. “Some vested interests are making it appear that he died due to illegal sand extraction. Rumours are being deliberately spread that the Napoklu police have manipulated the case,” he said. Harish said, “There is no illegal sand extraction in the region for the last year. Labourers Vasanth and Krishna had been transporting stones for road works. When Vasanth got into the stream, he was washed away by currents, as stated by his co-worker Krishna.” Planter Mandaneravanda Nanda Ganapathy said that the two labourers Vasanth and Krishna were collecting stones to repair the pothole-ridden road leading to his plantation. “After loading stones into the jeep, they both went to wash their legs and Vasanth was swept away by the currents in the stream. How can one interpret this as illegal sand mining?” he asked. Napoklu Bajrang Dal president B M Prateep said that some miscreants had created stories to tarnish the image of Napoklu police and Paluru. The villagers should be cautioned against such acts, he said. Pradeep urged the police to initiate stern legal action against the spreading the rumours.

The story of the Shivamogga sub-registrar office is no different. Scores of people, including the elderly and women throng the office every day, but many return disappointed due to the sluggish pace of work and server issues. According to visitors to the office, around 40 tokens are issued every day. But not even 10 properties are being registered a day due to server problems. The visitors are being greeted with ‘server down, come tomorrow’ replies from the officials every day, a visitor complained. Add to it, the sub-registrar office at Vinobhanagar lacks bare minimum amenities like seating and toilet facilities. An elderly woman, who visited the office thrice enduring all inconveniences, left to the hospital in an ambulance without registering property on Thursday. The people from villages are the worst affected. With most of the private and KSRTC buses off roads, they are forced to make their own transport arrangement to visit the office only to be told to come tomorrow. Anna Hazare Horata Samithi general secretary Ashok Yadav said, “The server down” issue is not new. The technology is so advanced today...  People are made to suffer because of the apathy of the officials and the government. Barring a few, the office is manned by outsourced employees. They have failed to discharge their duties effectively. The office has no space to accommodate buyers and sellers of properties. Even the ceiling fans in the office are not in working condition. It is high time the office should be moved to a new building.” Sub-registrar Subramanya said earlier around 70 properties were registered in a day. Now, it has come down drastically due to a technical snag. Due to heavy load, the server becomes slow. “We are unable to expedite the registration works. We are helpless in this regard.” Deputy Commissioner K B Shivakumar told DH that the server issue has been brought to the notice of Inspector General of Registration and Commissioner of Stamps, Kandaaya Bhavan, Bengaluru. “We are hopeful that the issue will be resolved in two to three days.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/server-snag-hits-registrations-in-smogga-sub-registrar-office-909295.html

The All India Station Masters Union (AISMU) said they have been protesting the move from October 7 and the decision to organise a token hunger strike was taken after their demands remained unanswered. They demanded that the government withdraw an order which stated that all officials above the basic pay of Rs 43,600/ per month were not to be paid night duty allowance. "We demand that the sealing of the allowance and the orders to recover the night duty allowance already made since 2017 be withdrawn, a Rs 50 lakh insurance be provided to the line staff and the privatisation and corporatisation of railways be stopped. We will hold a 12-hour hunger strike, which will be the fourth phase of our protest," AISMU said in a statement. The union said that they will send letters to all railway board members in the first phase, then all station masters on night shift on October 15 will light candles at all railway stations registering their protest and in the third phase, from October 20 to October 26, they will wear black badges. The Railway Ministry, however, said that as per DoPT instructions in July 2020, all officials above the basic pay of Rs 43,600 are not to be paid the night duty allowance. These instructions are effective from July 1, 2017. "The directives have already been implemented in other ministries. Implementation of the directives of DOP&T is in line with the implementation all across the government. Nothing exclusive is being implemented for Railways. In government, all employees are treated on par across the board on the basis of the basic salary. "As far as the issue of recovery of the Night Duty Allowance, the matter is being examined," a railway spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rail-station-masters-to-work-on-empty-stomach-on-october-31-protesting-sealing-in-night-duty-allowance-908858.html

Sisodia had filed the complaint against Hans and other BJP leaders -- Members of Parliament Manoj Tiwari and Pravesh Verma, MLAs Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Vijender Gupta and BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana -- for allegedly making corruption charges against him in relation to Delhi government schools' classrooms. The other accused were granted bail earlier after they appeared before the court, while Hans had moved an exemption application. “As accused Hansraj Hans is appearing for the first time before the court, he is admitted to bail on furnishing of bail bonds in the sum of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount as offence is bailable in nature. Bail bonds furnished and accepted,” the court observed. It further said, “All accused persons are directed to appear in person on next date of hearing without any excuse. Put up for framing of notice on November 18.” Sisodia in the defamation case had stated that all the allegations made by the BJP leaders jointly were false, defamatory and derogatory and intending to harm and damage his reputation and goodwill.   If convicted, the offence of defamation entails a maximum punishment of two years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-bjp-leader-hans-raj-hans-in-defamation-complaint-by-manish-sisodia-908870.html

The remarks on the issue by External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava came when asked to comment on Washington's move to scrap the computerised lottery system to select H-1B visas. The H-1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. "People-to-people relationship is an important foundation of the special relationship between India and the US. In our engagements, we have emphasised that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured," Srivastava said. "We are engaged with the US government for increasing predictability in the visa regime and to minimise the inconvenience being faced by those in the US or those who need to travel to the US for bonafide reasons," he said at a media briefing. Srivastava said India will continue to monitor any developments on this issue. The Donald Trump administration has proposed to scrap the computerised lottery system to grant H-1B work visas to foreign technology professionals and replace it with a wage-level-based selection process. A notification on the new system is being published in the Federal Register on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/engaged-with-us-for-ensuring-increasing-predictability-in-visa-regime-mea-908887.html

Another 25,000 tonnes of onions are expected to land at Indian shores before Diwali on November 15 which would be followed by the late Kharif crop from domestic farmlands. Goyal said that 30,000 tonnes of potatoes were expected to reach Indian markets from Bhutan in the next few days, while contracts for importing tur from Mozambique and urad from Myanmar were being renewed to ensure steady supplies of the pulses. “We are going to import about 10 lakh tonnes of potatoes and bring prices under control,” he added. Goyal added that retail prices of onions have been stable for the past three days at Rs 65/kg, while potatoes have been retailing at Rs 42/kg, as the Centre took “timely measures” to boost domestic supplies. The minister said that onion was being imported from countries like Egypt, Afghanistan, and Turkey by private traders. He said Nafed has invited private parties to import onions with an offer to procure it after it lands at Indian shores. The government has relaxed fumigation norms for the import of onion and the export of onion seeds has been banned. Among other measures, stock limits have been imposed on traders to curb hoarding and black marketing. Nafed, which has a buffer stock of onion on behalf of the government, has offloaded 36,488 tonnes of the bulb in the market to cool down prices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-looks-at-imports-to-tame-rising-prices-of-onion-potatoes-908902.html

In the ongoing Bihar polls, he attacked the opposition Grand Alliance for allegedly trying to bring "jungle raj" in the state once again. Addressing an election rally at Daraunda here, the BJP star campaigner mentioned the beginning of construction of a grand Ram temple at Ayodhya, enactment of a law against instant triple talaq and abrogation of provision of Article 370. Coming back to Bihar, he said "Who had created the jungle raj situation? These casteist and nepotistic forces have to be defeated". Rivals describe the RJD's 15 years rule in Bihar from 1990 to 2005 as "jungle raj" for bad law and order situation. Siwan was firmly in control of muscleman-politician Mohd Shahabuddin during the RJD rule.  Targeting the opposition, especially the RJD, he said the way people defeated coronavirus by going out to vote the previous day, they should defeat the parties indulging in casteism and nepotism. Without naming RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, he said 15 years ago, the youth of Bihar felt compelled to hide their identity, but those responsible for creating such a situation are trying to "mislead" them by dangling the jobs carrot. Tejashwi has announced that his future government would approve 10 lakh jobs in the very first cabinet meeting. He said those who promoted their families through casteism and let corruption flourish due to nepotism have destroyed Bihar. He said the world recognises the talent of the youth of Bihar, but casteist and nepotistic forces have blunted that talent. He said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar brought Bihar back on the track of development and took it forward over the past 15 years. "The Congress and the RJD have formed as alliance with forces that are against the society and that spread violence. They want to obstruct the state's development. The RJD- Congress-CPI(ML) alliance wants to bring jungle raj in Bihar again," he alleged. But they should know that after "ending terrorism from Kashmir, it's turn of Naxalism to be eliminated from across the country", he said. He said he wanted the people from Bihar to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the Ram temple at Ayodhya, but they could not be allowed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Talking about the abrogation of provisions of Article 370, he said that due to the policies implemented by past Congress governments, nobody could purchase land there but now anybody from Bihar also can do so. He said withdrawing the special status granted to J&K under Article 370 was the last nail in the coffin of terrorism. He said it was encouraging that the voter turnout in the first phase of Bihar elections was over 54 per cent and appealed to the youth to take it up to 70 per cent. He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi works on the agenda of "sabka sath sabka vikas (inclusive development)" and his welfare policies cover all without discriminating on the basis of caste and religion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/yogi-adityanath-targets-grand-alliance-over-bihars-jungle-raj-identity-908921.html
30-10-2020||National||US court asks Antrix to pay $1.2 billion compensation to Bengaluru start-up for cancelling satellite deal||A US court has asked Antrix Corporation, the commercial arm of ISRO, to pay compensation of USD 1.2 billion to a Bengaluru-based startup, Devas Multimedia, for cancelling a satellite deal in 2005. As per the agreement in January 2005, Antrix agreed to build, launch and operate two satellites and to make available 70 MHz of S-band spectrum to Devas, which the latter planned to use to offer hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication services throughout India. The agreement was terminated by Antrix in February 2011. Over the next several years, Devas approached various legal avenues in India. This included the Supreme Court, which directed for a tribunal. In his order dated October 27, Judge Thomas S Zilly, US District Judge, Western District of Washington, Seattle, ruled that Antrix Corporation pay a compensation of USD 562.5 million to Devas Multimedia Corporation and the related interest rate amounting to a total of USD 1.2 billion. In its lawsuit filed in the US District Court, Western District of Washington in September 2018, Devas Multimedia said three separate international tribunals and nine different arbitrators have found the termination of the Devas-Antrix agreement to have been wrongful, with one of the tribunals describing it as “conduct 'which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety,’” and another finding it to be “a clear breach of simple good faith” by India. Antrix, in November 2018, had sought the dismissal of the lawsuit citing jurisdictional issues. The court, however, asserted that it had jurisdiction over the issue, but stayed the matter for one year and asked the two to file a joint status report by April 15, 2020. On July 16, 2020, both Devas and Antrix filed the instant motion, a Joint Status Report in which they disputed whether the court should lift or extend the stay, and, if the latter, whether Antrix be required to post security. Devas, according to submissions, has argued that the US court has jurisdiction over these cases, as Antrix engages in business in this district and across the United States. Antrix and Spaceflight Industries, which is headquartered in Seattle have an agreement to provide satellite launch services using India’s PSLV rocket. Antrix and RBC Signals LLC, which is headquartered in Redmond, Washington have a worldwide agreement to provide space communications services to satellite operators. Antrix in 2018 launched a satellite for Redmond, a Washington-based Planetary Resources. Antrix agreed in 2015 to launch two satellites for Colorado-based PlanetiQ. Antrix is contracted with DigitalGlobe, which has headquarters in Colorado and other locations in Florida, Virginia and Washington to procure certain satellite data, which is then distributed by the Indian Space Research Organisation's National Remote Sensing Centre. Devas said that after the initial signing of the agreement, the two companies performed in good faith for five years. Among other things, in May 2009, Dr. Appanna Bhaskarnaryana, the Director of the Satellite Communications Program Office of ISRO, spent four to five weeks in the US with Devas personnel meeting with Hughes Networks, Sirius XM SkyTerra, Qualcomm and ICO North America to understand the technologies used by, and operation of, hybrid satellite-terrestrial operators providing telecommunications services. Devas subsequently conducted experimental trials in India (attended by Antrix officials, including the then-Chairman of Antrix), Chengdu and Beijing in China, and Stuttgart in Germany, which successfully demonstrated the hybrid satellite-terrestrial systems and end-user terminals that Devas had developed in conjunction with a global network of leading technology players such as Alcatel Lucent, it said. On February 25, 2011, Antrix issued a termination notice to Devas, which among other things stated that the policy decision was of the central government, acting in its sovereign capacity is the event of force majeure, which was an occurrence on February 23, 2011. “The scope and duration of the said decision cannot be anticipated. It is likely to be indefinite. It is not possible for Antrix to take any effective step to resume the obligations under the agreement,” Antrix said. Devas disputed Antrix’s repudiation of the agreement and sought to conduct discussions among senior management as contemplated by that agreement. In June 2011, Devas commenced arbitration proceedings under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Antrix initially refused to participate in the arbitration and obtained an injunction from the Indian Supreme Court enjoining the arbitration. After one year, the Supreme Court lifted the injunction, allowing the arbitration to proceed. Thereafter, Antrix participated fully in the arbitration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-court-asks-antrix-to-pay-12-billion-compensation-to-bengaluru-start-up-for-cancelling-satellite-deal-908928.html

Stressing that he used "Pulwama" as a broad term for the face-off between India and Pakistan, he said, "My statement is very clear. It was about Operation Swift Resort that we undertook after India dared to enter into Pakistan territory on Balakot. I was talking about the post-Pulwama operation that Pakistan undertook," he said. Earlier, reacting to the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ayaz Sadiq's comments on IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, Chaudhry said, "Humne Hindustan ko ghus ke maara (We hit India in their home). Our success in Pulwama is a success of this nation under the leadership of Imran Khan. You and us are all part of that success." Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019, after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets. As his statement sparked an uproar in the Pakistan assembly and received flak by the BJP, Chaudhry backtracked and said, "Pulwama ke waqiyeh ke baad, jab humne India ko ghus ke maara (When we hit India in their home after the incident at Pulwama)". The international community led by the US has pressed Pakistan to deny safe haven to terror groups operating from its soil and bring the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack to justice.

In a "silent call" the receiver can hear background noise, but the caller, who remains on the line, does not speak, the official, who is with the service, said. CHILDLINE '1098' is a round-the-clock helpline number that covers 595 districts and 135 Railway child help desks to help children in distress. Of the 2.15 crore calls received by CHILDLINE between January 2018 and September this year, as many as 86 lakh were "silent calls", according to data shared by the service. "Mostly these calls mean that somebody is actually trying to call or wants to seek help, but doesn't have the courage at that point in time to speak up, we do not disconnect such calls," the official said. On many occasions a person speaks after counselling by staff members, he said. Sometimes calls are made from the same number several times, but the caller does not speak, "but finally after 100 calls they spoke up in the 101st call", the official said. However, the number of silent calls have reduced in the past three years, he said. In 2018, 42 lakh or 42 per cent out of 1.01 crore calls were silent calls, while in 2019, 27 lakh or 39 per cent of 69 lakh total calls were silent calls, according to the data. In 2020, till September, 16 lakh or 36 per cent of 43 lakh calls were silent calls, it stated. The reason behind the drop in the number of silent calls could be attributed to people becoming more aware of CHILDLINE's services and actions, the official said, adding that with more awareness people are "gathering the courage to speak up". "The number of silent calls has been reducing in the past three years and through that, we assume that as awareness grows and through our actions, more and more people are able to speak up as they know they will get help through the number and not land in trouble," he said. The official said that in several instances, a child who is in a "vulnerable environment" tries to "test the waters" by calling the helpline number and know "what happens when I call". "Now many of them are able to speak up," he added. The official said that even during the Covid-19 lockdown period, a drop in the number of "silent calls" was observed. "Even during the lockdown period if you see the percentage of silent calls, it was much lesser because awareness was there and people were calling for the right reasons and speaking up," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/40-of-total-calls-received-by-childline-since-2018-were-silent-calls-909029.html

The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has also sought directions to declare that use of party symbol on EVM is illegal, unconstitutional and violative of the Constitution. The plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said the best solution to weed corruption and criminalisation in politics is to replace political party symbols on ballot and EVM with name, age, educational qualification and a photograph of the candidates. It said that ballot and EVM without political party symbol have many benefits as it will help electors to vote and support intelligent diligent and honest candidates. “Ballot and EVM without political party symbol will control dictatorship of political party bosses in ticket distribution and forced them to give ticket to those who religiously work for people's welfare,” the plea said. Referring to a study done by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a non-government organisation working in electoral reforms, the plea said that out of 539 MPs, 233 (43 per cent) MPs have declared criminal cases against themselves.  “Out of 542 winners analysed after 2014 election, 185 (34 per cent) had declared criminal cases against themselves and out of 543 winners analysed after 2009 Lok Sabha election, 162 (30 per cent) had declared criminal cases against themselves.  “There is an increase of 44 per cent in the number of Lok Sabha MPs with declared criminal cases against themselves since 2009, and the root cause of this bizarre situation is the use of political party symbol on ballot paper and EVM,” the plea said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-plea-seeks-to-replace-party-symbols-on-evms-with-educational-qualification-of-candidate-909071.html

The delegation, led by Omar Abdullah, is now in Kargil to begin consultations with the people "on the road ahead" for Jammu and Kashmir. Seven mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the NC and the PDP, have formed the PAGD for restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. On August 5 last year, the Centre had abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. "Warmly received by the people of Drass, who in one voice endorsed the agenda of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration," Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister, tweeted. "People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration is heading to Kargil to hold consultations with the people to chart out the road ahead," he said on Twitter. Commenting on the Ladakh visit of the PAGD delegation, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said it was high time someone reached out to the people of Kargil as they "too have grave apprehensions" about the future. NC's Farooq Abdullah is the PAGD's chairman and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti its vice-chairperson. "Glad to see all of you at Kargil to engage with the people. High time someone reached out to them since they too have grave apprehensions about the future," Mehbooba, also a former chief minister tweeted. The members of the delegation, which is visiting Ladakh, comprise of NC leader Nasir Aslam Wani, PDP leaders Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura and Waheed Para, and Awami National Conference leader Muzaffar Shah. This is the first visit of leaders of mainstream political parties of Jammu and Kashmir to Ladakh after the August 5 last year decision of the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/people-of-drass-have-endorsed-peoples-alliance-for-gupkar-declarations-agenda-omar-abdullah-909076.html

In a letter to state governments, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has also urged them to put in place effective communication plans in place to also watch out for over-eagerness among the people to get themselves vaccinated. Bhushan said the Covid-19 vaccine introduction would span over a year with multiple groups being included “sequentially starting from health care workers”. “Therefore, it is important to create strong advisory and coordination mechanism at state and district level to guide the process of Covid-19 vaccine introduction while ensuring minimal disruption of other routine health care services including immunisation,” said the letter dated October 26. He sought constitution of committees at state and district levels which will review preparatory activities in terms of cold chain preparedness, operational planning, strategies for state-specific challenges in terms of geographical terrain and hard-to-reach areas.  The Union Health Secretary suggested setting up of a State Steering Committee (SSC) chaired by the chief secretary, a State Task Force (STF) led by Additional Chief Secretary or principal secretary (health), and a District Task Force (DTF) to be headed by the district magistrate. The letter also outlines the terms of references for the committees to ensure active involvement of all departments concerned and devise innovative strategies for improving community engagement (Jan Bhagidaari) for improved coverage of the Covid-19 vaccine once it is available. The STF has been tasked with providing guidance, including funding and operational guidelines, fixing timelines for districts to plan and implement Covid-19 vaccine introduction and identifying vaccinators across government and private sectors so as to minimise disruption of routine immunisation services. The DTF will monitor the progress of database of beneficiaries on Covid-19 vaccination, ensure training of all concerned HR on Covid-19 Vaccination Beneficiary Management system (CVBMS), monitor progress on key activities such as micro-planning, communication planning, cold chain and vaccine logistics planning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-asks-states-to-form-committees-for-smooth-covid-19-vaccination-drive-909128.html
30-10-2020||National||India key pillar in collaborative global efforts to fight Covid-19: WEF chief Klaus Schwab||India stands out as an essential component to a concrete global action plan being readied to fight Covid-19, including for large-scale vaccine manufacturing, World Economic Forum's Founder and Chairman Klaus Schwab has said. Besides, India has a very important role to play for ensuring greater international cooperation in the post-Covid-19 world to fight any future pandemic and for addressing some other serious global challenges including those posed by climate change and economic inequality, he said. Schwab, who founded WEF over 50 years ago, said Covid-19 is the most devastating and immediate crisis the world is facing, but we are equally going through the worst environmental crisis in human history as well. "And socio-economically, the division and inequalities we are facing are the worst in a generation. To deal with it incrementally will not suffice. We need a Great Reset -- a fundamental rethinking of our economies and of our societies. We must not only repair the damage but address major deficiencies in our economic and social systems which were apparent before the pandemic broke out," Schwab told PTI in an interview from Geneva. "One of the priorities for the Great Reset is to re-define our social contract. That is particularly relevant for emerging economies like India, who have not yet built up social welfare systems to the same degree as some countries in Europe, such as the Scandinavian countries," he said. The WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private partnership, has been playing a key role in bringing together the public and private sectors in dealing with this pandemic. Asked about these efforts by the WEF, Schwab said, "We have indeed worked with all our global partners to accelerate the health response, and India certainly stands out." "Concretely, we have been working with the Developing Country Vaccine Manufacturing Network (DCVMN) on a potential Vaccines Manufacturers Alliance. And of this DCVMN, about 80 per cent of capacities are in India," he said. Schwab further said, "We received a letter of support from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, about the principles of global equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines, and this was very important. "This new mechanism could take the form of a large multi-country contract manufacturing network to be built, with the goal of increasing the global manufacturing volumes to an additional capacity in line with the enormous global demand. India should be the essential hub of this network." Schwab has recently co-authored a book, titled 'The Great Reset', which deals with top priorities before business leaders and policymakers around the world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The book also talks about whether the world should get back to where it was before, or should it take the opportunity to make society fairer, smarter and greener, and get humanity off the road to climate catastrophe. Asked what are the most important steps that businesses and governments need to take to make them ready for such pandemics in the future, Schwab said businesses and governments should devote a lot of their time and energy to make sure that the decisions they are making today, are not only helping them weather the current crisis, but allow them to build a more sustainable, resilient and inclusive system for the long-term future. "Governments have a small window to ensure that the USD 10 trillion that they are spending in response to the crisis, bring about the 'Great Reset' they are seeking. One way to invest smartly is to embed climate and environmental resilience into stimulus packages and recovery programmes," he said. He also said the pandemic has highlighted our fraught relationship with the natural world. "We only have one planet and we know that climate change could be the next global disaster with even more dramatic consequences for humankind. We need to decarbonize the economy in the short window which is still available," he said. Schwab cautioned that those who will be affected most by climate change are the least well off and we need to ensure existing inequalities are not exacerbated as result. "Resetting the environment should not be seen as a cost, but rather an investment that will generate economic activity and employment opportunities, and there should be no contradiction between the need to protect nature and the need to reinvigorate the economy," he said. Schwab further said businesses need to move from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism in the post-Covid-19 world, as those who invest in society and for the long-term, instead of prioritising short-term profit gains, will perform much better. "In achieving the Great Reset, and to really address the global challenges posed by climate change, epidemics, and economic inequality, and many more issues, a very important role lies with India when it hosts the G20 presidency in 2022, after Saudi Arabia this year, and Italy next year. None of the above issues can be solved without increased cooperation," he noted. Schwab said "we have to start the Great Reset, rebuilding the Post-Covid world, immediately, but 2022 will be a particularly crucial year." "It will hopefully be the first year when the world can say that it has mastered the Covid-19 virus. It can then devote its full energy not only to rebuild its economic and social system, but to turn to a more future-oriented mindset, and to take care of its responsibility towards the next generations," he said. The WEF's 50th annual meeting, held in January 2020 in Davos, was the last major global event before almost the entire world got locked down due to the pandemic. The next annual meeting has now been postponed to May 2021 and will be held in Lucerne-Burgenstock in Switzerland, instead of Davos.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-key-pillar-in-collaborative-global-efforts-to-fight-covid-19-wef-chief-klaus-schwab-909145.html

To begin with, the ministry has launched the API integration between the SVANidhi portal and SBI’s eMudra portal, to avoid delay in sanctioning loans. The API enables the exchange of data between two or more applications. "This will help quick disbursal of loans," said an official in the Ministry. The Ministry launched PM SVANidhi Scheme on June 01, 2020, to provide affordable working capital loan to street vendors to resume their livelihoods adversely affected due to Covid-19 lockdown. The Urban Affairs Ministry has received 25 lakh applications mostly from vendors of street food, fruits and vegetables, in which loans have been sanctioned to 12 lakh applicants. The scheme targets to help over 50 lakh street vendors who had been vending on or before March 24, 2020, in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, with a working capital loan of up to Rs. 10,000, repayable in monthly installments within a year. On timely/early repayment of the loan, an interest subsidy of 7% will be credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. There will be no penalty on the early repayment of the loan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-to-expedite-loan-sanction-for-street-vendors-909162.html

The Navy said the missile hit the target at maximum range with precise accuracy. "Anti-ship missile fired by Indian Navy's Guided Missile Corvette INS Kora hits the target at max range with precise accuracy in the Bay of Bengal. Target ship severely damaged and in flames," the Navy tweeted. Last week, the Navy released a video of an anti-ship missile destroying a sinking ship with "deadly accuracy" somewhere in the Arabian Sea. The missile was fired by frontline corvette INS Prabal as part of a mega drill involving aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and a number of warships, attack helicopters, aircraft and other assets of the Navy. The Indian Navy has significantly increased its deployment in the Indian Ocean Region in an attempt to send across a message to China in the wake of escalation in tension between the two countries over the border standoff in eastern Ladakh. The Indian Navy has participated in a number of joint maritime exercises in the last few weeks, including a three-day drill with Japanese navy from September 26-28. Last month, Indian Navy also carried out a two-day mega exercise in the Indian Ocean Region with the Australian Navy that featured a range of complex naval manoeuvres, anti-aircraft drills and helicopter operations. In July, the Indian Navy carried out a military exercise with a US Navy carrier strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/navy-fires-missile-as-part-of-military-drill-in-bay-of-bengal-909163.html

Here are the top news of October 30, 2020: After admitting that Pakistan was responsible for the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40 CRPF personnel and brought the two countries to the brink of war, the senior Pakistani minister Fawad Chaudhry reportedly said that he was misinterpreted.   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said steps taken by the social media giant have helped protect the integrity of more than 200 different elections around the world, including in India, and have also played an important role in stopping abuse ahead of US elections. Noting that next week will certainly be a "test" for Facebook, Zuckerberg said the company will continue "fighting to protect the integrity of the democratic process".   A new suspect is in custody Friday in the investigation into a gruesome attack by a Tunisian man who killed three people in a French church, as France heightened its security alert amid religious and geopolitical tensions around cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The suspect is a 47-year-old man believed to have been in contact with the attacker the night before the attack on the Notre Dame Basilica in the Riviera city of Nice, according to a judicial official.   An employee of a diagnostic centre in RT Nagar was on Thursday caught offering fake Covid-19 negative results for Rs 12,000. This comes days after two staffers and a doctor were sacked for selling fake Covid negative reports.   Speaking to DH, an employee at the centre said he was ready to supply fake negative result certificates for Covid-19 patients who sought clearance documents for international travel. “The negative result can be obtained, which will also be reflected in the SRF record,” he said.   If you do not wear masks on the roads of Mumbai – and are not ready to pay fine, you will need to sweep the roads. Wielding the stick, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to instil fear so that people start wearing masks. Over Thursday and Friday, more than 100 persons have been made to sweep the roads when found not wearing masks and not ready or unable to shell out Rs 200 as fine.   The Karnataka government has proposed a ban on government servants acting in films and television programmes. In the draft Karnataka State Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 2020, which was published on Tuesday, the Karnataka government has laid down a set of dos and don'ts for government servants. The government has given 15 days time for people to submit their suggestions and objections in the draft gazette notification. Once it is finalised, it will come into force immediately.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-pak-minister-backtracks-on-pulwama-remark-fb-helped-protect-integrity-of-200-elections-says-zuckerberg-909165.html

Earlier, only 7,000 pilgrims were allowed to visit the shrine due to Covid-19 restrictions. In a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP), the administration said, "As such, in the exercise of powers conferred under the disaster management act, the State Executive Committee hereby orders that the guidelines and instructions shall continue to remain valid till 30.11.2020, subject to the following modifications that instead of a ceiling of 7000, the upper limit for a permissible number of pilgrims to SMVD Shrine, Katra, shall be 15000, w.e.f. 01 .11 .2020". The shrine atop the Trikuta hills was reopened on August 16 after a gap of nearly five months due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Initially, the administration imposed a cap of 2,000 pilgrims daily, including 100 from outside Jammu and Kashmir. The board officials said the registration of pilgrims will continue to be done online to avoid people gathering at the yatra registration counters. They said accommodation facilities of the board at the Bhawan, Adhkuwari, Katra and Jammu are open for the pilgrims following all prescribed SOPs. All other supplementary facilities set up by the board such as battery-operated vehicles, passenger ropeway and helicopter services are also operating smoothly by strictly following social distancing norms and other precautionary measures, the officials said.

The video clip of Namgyal saluting a team of ITBP personnel has been widely shared online. It was tweeted by the border patrolling force from its official handle on October 11. "Namgyal had won the love and respect of an entire nation when a video him giving a crisp salute to the ITBP personnel passing through Shushul in Ladakh emerged," Chandrasekhar's office said in a statement. "Namgyal's spirit of patriotism encouraged many to call upon for helping the young Ladakh boy to realise his dreams. I have contributed Rs 2.5 lakh for him through Flags of Honour Foundation and a cheque of the same amount has been issued in his father's name," the BJP MP said in the statement. Since its formation in 2009, the Flags of Honour Foundation supported and advocated the cause of the armed forces, the men and women who serve and the veterans who have made tremendous sacrifices for the nation, the statement reads. In line with this endeavour, Chandrasekhar has sought to reach out to Namgyal's parents so as to ensure that he shines and someday inspires others to stand tall for the motherland, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-mp-rajeev-chandrasekhar-gives-rs-25-lakh-to-ladakh-boy-whose-video-of-saluting-soldiers-went-viral-909202.html

A three-judge bench presided over by Justice U U Lalit by a majority view of 2:1 ruled that it would be in the best interest of the child if his custody is handed over to the father. The court, however, directed the father to obtain a mirror order from the court concerned in Nairobi, which would reflect the directions contained in this judgement. The mirror order is passed to ensure that the courts of the country where the child is being shifted are aware of the arrangements which were made in the country where he had ordinarily been residing. Such an order would also safeguard the interest of the parent who is losing custody so that the rights of visitation and temporary custody are not impaired, it said. Such orders are passed keeping in mind the principle of comity of courts and public policy, the court added. Going through the factual matrix of the case, the bench, also comprising Justice Indu Malhotra, noted the child was the heir apparent of a vast family business established by the family of the father in Kenya and the UK and it would be necessary for him to imbibe and assimilate the culture and traditions of the country where he would live as an adult. After 11 years of exclusive custody of his mother, he was now entitled to enjoy the protection and care of his father, for his holistic growth and development, it said. The court rejected the mother's allegations of racism, excessive drinking, marital infidelity and pendency of a criminal case of manslaughter pending against the father for dam burst tragedy in 2018 in Kenya, resulting in the death of 48 persons. It said the charges were found not correct by the family court and Delhi High Court. Further, a natural disaster can't be blown out of proportion to declare the father unfit for custody of the child. This would, however, not imply that the mother would be kept out of the further growth, progress and company of her son. She would be provided with temporary custody of the child for 50% of his annual vacations once a year, either in New Delhi or Kenya. She will also be provided access to the boy through emails, cellphone and Skype during the weekends. Justice Hemant Gupta disagreed with the majority view, saying in this case, since the child has grown up in India in the last 11 years, at this age, he would be exposed to physical and psychological harm if he is shifted to Kenya amongst fellow students and teachers but without any friends, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-tells-man-to-get-mirror-order-from-kenya-to-get-sons-custody-909211.html

In a memorandum of demands submitted to Goa Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar also said that the state's six offshore casinos are parked in the Mandovi river (Mahadayi is also referred to as Mhadei or Mandovi in Goa), whose water levels may decrease on account of the alleged diversion carried out by the Karnataka government via the Kalasa-Banduri canal, and cause further degradation of the river.  "To protect our 'Mother Mahadayi' from further degradation, casinos should not be allowed to re-open in the Mandovi river, till any sustainable solution is found for the Mahadayi crisis," Mardolkar said.  The demand to not re-open Goa's casinos comes two days after Chief Minister Pramod Sawant announced that the casino industry in the state could restart from November 1 with 50 per cent capacity.  The announcement comes at a time when the state government is trying to generate tourism-related traction in the coastal state.  There are currently six offshore casinos anchored in the Mandovi river and around 10 onshore casinos operating in the state. Mardolkar however has alleged that restarting offshore casinos would cause further environmental degradation of the Mahadayi river.  "Through the Kalasa-Banduri projects, the Karnataka government has diverted the Mandovi river water excessively and completely changed the natural flow of the Mandovi river from its original basin... If casinos are allowed to restart in the Mandovi river, pollution will increase tremendously and it will be of serious nature due to low-levels in the Mandovi river this year. The increase in pollution will adversely affect ecology and marine life," Mardolar also said.  Goa and Karnataka are battling out a two-decade-long dispute over the sharing of the Mahadayi river in the Supreme Court after both parties expressed reservations about the award by the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018. Maharashtra is the third state which is a part of the dispute, as the river traverses through a small portion of Maharashtra. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Banduri project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dont-restart-goa-casinos-until-mahadayi-issue-resolved-youth-congress-909232.html

Irrespective of their professional experience, a majority of respondents agreed being more comfortable with tele-working, with 64 per cent saying they find it easier to work remotely, while 36 per cent of respondents said they find it challenging, according to a survey by IP-driven incubation lab BridgeLabz. The survey was done online with over 1,000 BridgeLabz alumni from October 16 to 28. The respondents possessed different levels of work experience in the categories of less than one year, a professional experience between 1 and 2 years and more than five years. 'Trying to balance work at home' emerged as the most popular answer when probed about how they are trying to cope up with work from home, the survey showed. Out of the total, 58 per cent of the employees are simultaneously taking part in household chores to strike a healthy work-life balance to deal with the ongoing remote work effectively, it added. About 22 per cent of respondents connect with peers, while the remaining 20 per cent take regular breaks to relax, it added. The survey further showed that extended work hours are the biggest obstacle for 37 per cent respondents during tele-working. It is followed by frequently occurring technical errors and glitches (29 per cent), it noted. It found that respondents with more than five years of working experience faced more (40 per cent) technical issues compared to their counterparts. This may be attributed to an irrelevant skill set or lack of upskilling opportunities over the years that could have widened the skill gap for those job roles, it observed. Colleagues (20 per cent) and lack of concentration (13 per cent) were some of the other challenges reported by the employees, it said. "The survey speaks out and loud about the issues faced by the global workforce today. What makes it more interesting is that even coders with half a decade of work experience are struggling with technical issues," BridgeLabz founder Narayan Mahadevan said. He added that continuous learning and upskilling is the need of the hour for all, no matter what industry or domain one belongs to.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/37-engineers-find-stretched-working-hours-most-challenging-during-wfh-survey-909235.html

The second phase of the mega exercise is scheduled to be held from November 17 to 20 in the Arabian sea, they said. Last week, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively makes it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition. China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the 'Quad' member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region where China has been expanding its military influence. "The exercise will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies in the reflection of their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order," said a military official. The officials said the first phase of the drill would witness complex and advanced naval exercises, including surface, anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations, besides cross-deck flying, seamanship evolutions and weapon firing exercises. The exercise will be conducted as a "non-contact and at sea only" drill in view of Covid-19 pandemic, they said. The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. The annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019. The Indian Navy will deploy a number of key platforms in the exercise which will include destroyer Ranvijay, frigate Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel Sukanya, fleet support ship Shakti and submarine Sindhuraj. In addition, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and a number of helicopters will also be participating in the exercise, the officials said. US Navy ship USS John S McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, Australian Navy's long-range frigate HMAS Ballarat with integral MH-60 helicopter and Japan Maritime Self Defence Force's JS Onami, a destroyer, will be among key platforms to be part of the first phase of the Malabar exercise, they said. During the recent Indo-US 2+2 talks, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper welcomed India's invitation to Australia to join the Malabar exercise. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness. India and China are locked in an over five-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. After the invitation to the drill, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds CSC said the Malabar exercise marked a "milestone opportunity" for the Australian defence force and that it will showcase the "deep trust" between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests. For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise. Defence and security ties between India and Australia have been on an upswing in the last few years. In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/first-phase-of-malabar-exercise-to-take-place-from-november-3-6-in-bay-of-bengal-909285.html
30-10-2020||National||US, Brazil see room for global ethanol growth before transition to EVs||The United States and Brazil, the two leading ethanol producers, see the potential for a large increase in global use of the biofuel as an outright way to cut carbon emissions while the world transitions to all-electric cars, according to industry representatives this week. "There is a lot of hope (to cut emissions) related to electric vehicles, but the current fleet will still be around for a long time," said Brian Healy, director for ethanol market development at the US Grains Council, adding that biofuel blending in combustion engine cars is the quickest way to improve air quality. Speaking during the Datagro's International Conference on Sugar and Ethanol this week, Healy said countries should move faster to implement plans to blend ethanol to gasoline. Several countries and regions around the world are discussing or setting targets to increase the use of biofuels such as China, Canada, Britain, India, Mexico, Vietnam, South Africa and Australia. But there have been delays everywhere. Analysts see an unwillingness from some countries to depend on renewable energy sources if they can not produce them, as is the case with China which postponed its target for a national E10 blending policy. Lara Bacellar, trading manager at Brazil's Copersucar SA, one of the world's largest ethanol merchants, said that if all mandates and policies for blending in the world were fulfilled, including the US E15 proposition, demand could jump as much as 55 billion litres (12.1 billion gallons) per year. "Those actions would go in the direction to meet the Paris climate agreement, using a product that is efficient to cut emissions and is available," she said. Experts see blending as a particularly wise strategy to cut pollution in emerging economies, where the EV revolution is seen taking much longer to happen due to the need of heavy investments in the charging infrastructure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-brazil-see-room-for-global-ethanol-growth-before-transition-to-evs-909302.html
30-10-2020||National||After US meet, India treads softly on China||Just days after hosting India-America 2+2 dialogue, New Delhi drove home the point that its vision for the Indo-Pacific region was distinct from that of the United States and not aimed at containing China – notwithstanding its six-month-long military stand-off with the communist country. “We are not seeking to target or exclude any country, but create an environment that induces all countries to operate with respect for the sovereignty of others and in a manner consistent with international norms in global commons,” said Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla, who was on a visit to Paris on Thursday and Friday. He was speaking on New Delhi’s vision for the Indo-Pacific region while speaking at Institut Français des Relations Internationales (IFRI) – a leading think-tank of France. His comment was apparently aimed at sending out the message that India had no intention to be seen moving closer to the United States or tweaking its own Indo-Pacific strategy to make it overtly adversarial to China. “The (Covid-19) pandemic period has witnessed geopolitical repositioning primarily by China and the United States,” said the Foreign Secretary. “The EU (European Union) has also formulated its position which has striking similarities with India particularly with regard to maintaining strategic autonomy and our commitment to effective and reformed multilateralism.” External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hosted US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Defence, Mark Esper, in New Delhi on Tuesday for the third India-America 2+2 dialogue. China’s belligerence – not only along its disputed boundary with India but also in Taiwan Strait as well as in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and the East China Sea and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region was on the agenda of the talks. Pompeo used his opening remarks at the 2+2 dialogue as well as the joint press conference after the talks to continue the tirade launched by US President Donald Trump’s administration against the Communist Party of China. Though Jaishankar and Singh joined Pompeo and Esper at the press-conference, they refrained from publicly making any comment against the communist country – even as the soldiers of the Indian Army are still engaged in an eyeball-to-eyeball stand-off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh. Jaishankar, however, said that the Indo-Pacific region was a particular focus of his and Singh’s talks with Pompeo and Esper during the 2+2 talks. He also said that peace, stability and prosperity for all countries in the Indo-Pacific could be ensured “only by upholding the rules-based international order, ensuring the freedom of navigation in the international seas, promoting open connectivity and respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-us-meet-india-treads-softly-on-china-909311.html
30-10-2020||National Politics||Opposition targets LDF after arrest of Bineesh Kodiyeri; CPI(M) rejects demands for CM Pinarayi Vijayan's resignation||The Congress and BJP on Thursday stepped up their attack on Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan after the ED arrested CPI-M state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son Bineesh Kodiyeri, alleging anti-national activities were being carried out under the Left front rule in the state. The CPI-M led Left Democratic Front suffered twin blows as the arrest of Bineesh in a money laundering case linked to a drug seizure in Karnataka came a day after the Enforcement Directorate took into custody suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar in the gold smuggling case. Bineesh, who has essayed roles in few Malayalam films, was arrested in Bengaluru after he was summoned for the third time for questioning in connection with his alleged links with an accused in the Bengaluru drug case, busted by the Narcotic Control Bureau recently. The central agency's move comes following charges of links between a key accused in the gold smuggling case in Kerala and a prime accused in the drug racket. Following the arrests, the Congress and BJP went hammer and tongs against the government demanding the resignation of Vijayan and Balakrishnan and also took out protest marches. CPI(M) Central committee member M Govindan Master said there was no question of Vijayan's resignation, while the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) said Bineesh was not a member of the Marxist party and it was not responsible for his deeds. Vijayan refused to take any questions on the arrest of Bineesh, which came amid the opposition turning the heat on the government over the gold smuggling case but read out from a prepared text his reaction on Sivasankar's arrest. He asserted that his government will neither tolerate any sort of corruption nor protect any corrupt person. Sivasankar had been removed from the post of IT secretary and his Principal Secretary after reports emerged suggesting that the IAS officer had links with a prime accused in the gold smuggling case and a departmental enquiry is underway, the chief minister said. "The state government, which had sought a comprehensive probe, is of the strong opinion that corruption, tax evasion and the country's economic crimes should be combated at all costs."  "The government has demanded that cases be registered in accordance with the prevailing laws of the country and those involved in such acts be brought before the courts of justice", Vijayan said. The government was not responsible for the relationships or personal involvement of an officer in the All India Service. Action has been taken when it was found that it affected the government. So there was no need to attack the government in the name of Sivasankar, Vijayan said, adding his was not a political appointment. "The former IT secretary was not known to him until the government was formed. There was no need to doubt an official, who was appointed to the office of Chief Minister and had previously held various responsible positions. It's been repeatedly stated that his was a political appointment. The party does not recommend anyone to any post", he added. CPI-M secretary Sitaram Yechury asserted the arrest of Bineesh would not affect the party, saying Balakrishnan has made it clear that the law will take its course. Balakrishnan had earlier this month made it clear that the party was not responsible for the deeds of Bineesh and said the probe agencies can take any action if his son was found guilty. Chennithala, the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, said with the arrests the state government and the party were "now under custody". "Kerala is ruled by a gang of robbers. This is a total disgrace to Kerala. The party and the government are working together to carry out mafia activities in the state. Under the patronage of the CPI-M and the Pinarayi government, anti-national activities are being carried out in the state. The latest example of this is the arrest of the son of the party-state secretary in a drug case," he alleged while talking to reporters here. BJP state chief K Surendran said the allegation against Bineesh was that he arranged funds for the drug mafia and said the communist party should answer these matters "politically and morally". Talking about the gold smuggling case, Vijayan said as in the past, this government has not been willing to place conscience above a court of law. That was the core difference between the previous Congress headed UDF government and the current LDF regime in their approach towards corruption, he said. Hitting out at the opposition, the chief minister said efforts were being made to link the state government and the CM's office to the case. Currently, the Customs, Enforcement Directorate, CBI and the Income Tax department are probing the matter. Let the investigations continue independently, he said. Pointing that the government was not responsible for any personal transactions made by Sivasankar and had no legal or moral responsibility in this, he maintained his government had not tried to protect any offender at any stage. It was the Congress which had been alleging that the union government was using the probe agencies and even its leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had expressed this publically, he said and wanted the state leadership of the opposition party to make its stand clear. The arrests have hit the ruling Left front as it is gearing up for the local body polls and assembly elections due in December and early next year respectively. Central agencies -- National Investigation Agency, Customs and the Enforcement Directorate - are conducting separate inquiries into the seizure of gold worth nearly Rs 15 crore from diplomatic baggage at the international airport here on July 5.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-targets-ldf-after-arrest-of-bineesh-kodiyeri-cpim-rejects-demands-for-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-resignation-908862.html

In a statement, PAGD spokesperson Sajad Lone condemned the state administration for putting a blockade outside the resident of Abdullah and demanded that it be removed. No official from the administration was available for comment on the issue. Abdullah is also the president of the recently floated PAGD – an alliance of seven mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir seeking restoration of the erstwhile state's special status as it existed on 4 August last year. Earlier in the day, the National Conference (NC) claimed in a tweet that the administration had blocked Abdullah's residence and stopped him from offering prayers at Dargah Hazratbal on the occasion of Milad-un-Nabi. Lone said, "Abdullah was slated to go to Hazratbal in order to participate in the religious congregation on account of Eid-Milad-Un-Nabi, however (he) was barred from leaving his house." "We strongly condemn the actions of the state administration which are tantamount to interference in the religious rights of Dr Farooq Abdullah. This marks a new low in the curtailment of fundamental rights of the people of J-K. We demand that the blockade be removed so that Dr Farooq Sahib is able to perform his religious duties," he said. The PAGD also "unequivocally and unambiguously" condemned the killings of three BJP workers by militants in Kulgam district of south Kashmir on Thursday. "Political differences cannot justify use of violence. Violence has always and will crowd out sanity. We will always fight aggression in all its forms irrespective of the source of aggression," Lone said. The three BJP workers -- Fida Hussain, Umer Hajam and Umer Rashid Beigh -- were shot dead by militants in Kulgam's Y K Pora area. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be a shadow group of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the killings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farooq-not-being-allowed-to-leave-house-a-new-low-in-curtailment-of-rights-in-jk-gupkar-alliance-909038.html

Tasked with conducting the organisational elections, Madhusudan Mistry, Chairman of the Central Election Authority of the Congress said in a letter that the meeting of the AICC is to be convened “as soon as possible”. “You will be intimated as dates and venue is finalised,” Mistry said in the letter to AICC General Secretaries and in-charges; and PCC chiefs. The presidential election was necessitated after Sonia Gandhi asked party leaders to choose her successor amid a revolt by 23 leaders, who had questioned the day-to-day functioning of the Congress party and sought a full-time president. The 73-year-old leader had stepped in as interim president in August last year after Rahul quit the post accepting responsibility for the defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. After the July rebellion by the Group of 23 in the Congress, Sonia had offered to step down as Congress President but was persuaded by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and senior leaders A K Antony among others to continue in the saddle till a successor is appointed. Congress President recast the party organisation giving representation to both the young and the veterans in running day-to-day affairs of the party. The election process is expected to be completed soon with the AICC meeting expected in January, well before the next round of assembly elections in 2021. The dissenters have been demanding election to the Congress Working Committee as well and the party is likely to consider it favourably.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/aicc-meeting-soon-congress-sets-out-to-elect-sonia-gandhis-successor-909219.html

Vijayvargiya, who is BJP's in-charge of West Bengal, told this to reporters here a day after WB Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. "It is my personal opinion that free and fair election is not possible there (West Bengal) without the imposition of President's rule as the politicisation of bureaucracy has happened in that state. It is ok up to that, but now criminalisation of bureaucracy has also happened there," he said. "I am confident that if elections are held in a free and fair manner in West Bengal, the BJP would form the next government in that state," he said. Assembly elections are due in West Bengal in April-May next year. He, however, added that the Centre has already clarified that no action will be taken against the West Bengal government with a "feeling of revenge" in mind and the elected government will be given adequate opportunities. Vijayvargiya said that the Union home minister has in an interview to a TV channel said that the law and order situation in West Bengal is very bad. "But we have full faith in democracy and we will take steps regarding an elected government within the constitutional framework," he said. "We should wait for it as the West Bengal governor has submitted his report (on the current situation in the state) to the Union home minister only yesterday (Thursday)," he said. On the possible truck between Left parties and Congress in the upcoming Assembly polls, he said it will not have much impact as a vote bank that supports the BJP's ideology has already been created there. "In the Assembly elections, there will be a direct fight between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress," he said. On the issue of projecting a face in West Bengal, Vijaywargiya said the BJP usually doesn't announce its election-face in the states where it is not in power. "In West Bengal, BJP's lotus symbol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party chief J P Nadda will be the party's poll faces," he said. The BJP leader sought to know why the police have not arrested criminals involved in the murder of party workers in West Bengal. He also expressed fear that the West Bengal police may "implicate" him in some false case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/free-and-fair-polls-not-possible-in-west-bengal-without-presidents-rule-kailash-vijayvargiya-909230.html

In a sensational admission, senior Pakistani minister Fawad Chaudhry Thursday admitted that his country was responsible for the Pulwama terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 that killed 40 CRPF personnel and brought the two countries to the brink of a war. Addressing an election rally here, Nadda said Friday, "What should I say about the Congress party and Rahul babu. They became Pakistan advocates (Vakil). Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhry said yesterday that 'we did the Pulwama, Imran Khan did the Pulwama. Their minister is saying so in an answer in their National Assembly." He said Rahul Gandhi "used to say that Pakistan was not involved, and we (the ruling party) are talking about Pakistan just to trick people". "You should apologies to the country," Nadda told the former Congress president. He also attacked Gandhi over his statements on the abrogation of Article 370, alleging that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan used his remarks to argue his country's case in the United Nations. "Do you speak for India or Pakistan?" Nadda asked Gandhi. Attacking the Bihar's Mahagathbandhan, the BJP chief said: "it is a coming tougher of an anarchist (the RJD), a destructor (the CPI-ML) and a Pakistan apologist (the Congress)". On February 14, 2019, 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed when a jeep laden with explosives had hit a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu-Srinagar highway at Lethpora in Pulwama.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-should-apologise-after-pakistan-ministers-admission-on-pulwama-j-p-nadda-909236.html

There are a shortage of 60 per cent doctors and 71 per cent nurses across Bihar, Surjewala claimed and said that after coming to power in the ongoing assembly elections, the Grand Alliance will fill up these posts quickly in a special drive, simplifying the lengthy recruitment process and bypassing the Public Service Commission (PSC). A huge gap also exists between the required number of health sub-centres and primary health centres and the actual number of those facilities, the Congress national general secretary said. "Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi have not only pushed the states health services in the ICU but also put them on a ventilator and the sector is counting its days," he said. Out of the 12,206 sanctioned posts of doctors, only 5,205 are filled, showing that the state has a shortage of 7,001 doctors. Similarly, 5,634 nurses are working at various health centres against 19,155 sanctioned posts, which means that Bihar has a shortage of 13,521 nurses, Surjewala said. The information was furnished by the Nitish Kumar government to the Supreme Court, he said, without mentioning the year or the case in which the state administration provided the data to the apex court. The Congress leader also said that the central government informed the Lok Sabha that as per 2011 census, Bihar needed 18,637 health sub-centres, but the state has just 9,949 such facilities, which is 50 per cent of the requirement.  Nitish Kumar, who is seeking a fourth term in power, has been the chief minister since 2005. The Centre also told the Lower House of Parliament that Bihar needs 3,099 primary health centres and 774 community health centres, but the state has only 1,899 PHCs and 150 CHCs, according to Surjewala who did not mention when the matter was informed in the Lok Sabha. In a health index report issued by the World Bank and the Union health ministry, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP is in power, have ranked at the bottom, he said. The healthcare scenario in the state has turned from bad to worse between 2015-2018 and NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had to say that India's overall Human Development Index lagged behind because of poor performance of states such as Bihar on various health parameters, Surjewala said. To improve the healthcare services in Bihar, the Grand Alliance government will fill up the vacant posts by an 'open recruitment system', the Congress leader said. Explaining the system, he said that eligible candidates will appear with their educational certificates which will be verified on the spot and they will be interviewed by the Director-General of Health Services, thus bypassing the PSC. Specialists will also be appointed on 'special salary', which will be higher than normal, for a particular period of time, he said adding that Ayushman Bharat scheme can only be implemented properly when there are doctors and nurses are available in appropriate numbers. "There is a medical crisis in the state. A Covid patient was being treated in Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) while a body was lying on an adjacent bed," he said. Videos purportedly showing bodies lying unattended while patients are being treated at NMCH in Patna had gone viral in July-August. Voting for the Bihar assembly elections is being held in three phases. The first phase was conducted on October 28, while the next phases will be held on November 3 and 7.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/large-number-of-posts-vacant-bihar-health-services-on-ventilator-randeep-singh-surjewala-909249.html

Selling this idea, two self-styled 'tantriks' in Meerut conned a London-returned doctor of Rs 2.5 crore.  The two conmen sold 'Aladdin's lamp' to the doctor saying that it would fulfil his wishes. Khan's first encounter with the 'lamp' was in the year 2018 when he started visiting a woman named Sameena at her house for dressing her post-surgery wounds. The doctor told the police that he met a 'tantrik' named Islamuddin at the woman's house, who promised to make him a billionaire. Islamuddin allegedly promised to give him 'Aladdin's lamp'. According to Khan, the two 'tantriks' even made him see a 'genie'. The doctor stated that whenever he asked them to take the lamp to his home, Islamuddin would warn that it would do bad things to him if he touched it. Khan, who paid Rs 2.5 crore to them in instalments, later realised that the 'genie' was actually Islamuddin himself, who was Sameena's husband.  He then approached Meerut Superintendent of Police (SSP) and sought help. The police have arrested two accused, including Islamuddin, but Sameena is still at large.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/the-long-con-london-returned-doctor-falls-for-aladdin-ka-chirag-loses-rs-25-crore-909035.html

Although the body was identified as that of one Manoj Mishra, a resident of Vrindavan town in Mathura, and the postmortem report revealed that he died after being hit by a heavy object on his head, the police had failed to make any headway in the case. The cops were about to close the case when they stumbled upon the cell phone of the 17-year-old son. They were startled to find that the boy had watched 'Crime Patrol' serial more than a hundred times before the incident. His questioning revealed that he had been angry with his father for beating him even over petty mistakes and that he had killed his father in a fit of rage. He also told the cops that he followed what he had seen in the serials to destroy the evidence. It also came to light that his mother had also aided him in his attempts to destroy evidence. Police said that the boy had repeatedly hit his father with an iron rod on his head, killing him on the spot after the latter had thrashed him over some mistake.  The youth, with the help of his mother, hid the corpse in a sack after burning its face with acid to prevent identification. He then threw the body in a forested area before burning it with petrol. ''We have arrested the duo....they have admitted to their crime,'' said a senior police official in Mathura.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/17-year-old-takes-cue-from-crime-patrol-to-destroy-evidence-after-killing-his-father-909043.html

30-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', likely to improve by October 31||The national capital's air quality was recorded in the 'very poor' category on Friday, while a government forecasting agency said some improvement is likely due to favourable wind speed. On Thursday, the city's air quality index (AQI) touched 'severe' levels for a brief period before slipping back into the 'very poor' category. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 374 on Friday. It was 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, and 349 on Sunday. Several monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (417), Patparganj (406), Bawana (447) and Mundka (427), recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  On Thursday, PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR peaked to 424 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am, the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data.  PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mould spores. The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 231 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 19 per cent on Friday. It was 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, 18 per cent on Wednesday, 23 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and nine per cent on Saturday. The number of farm fires in neighbouring states dropped from 2,912 on Wednesday - the highest so far this season - to 1,143 on Thursday. Delhi's overall air quality index (AQI) has improved marginally as predicted and remains in the high end of the 'very poor' category, it said. The wind speed is expected to pick up and the improved ventilation is likely to influence air quality positively, SAFAR said. A significant improvement is predicted by November 1 and the air quality is likely to slip back into the 'poor' category, it said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.1 degrees Celsius. It was 12.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday – the lowest in October in 26 years. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 10,000 meter square per second on Friday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. On Thursday, the Centre introduced a new law through an ordinance that put in place a powerful oversight body to curb air pollution. Under the ordinance released by the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, the 22-year-old Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has been dissolved and replaced by a powerful commission comprising 18 members. The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas will specifically look at Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas only and it will be binding on the states to follow its directions||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-likely-to-improve-by-october-31-909058.html

The commission had issued a notice to the BJP leader on October 26 seeking his reply. According to the notice, the statement made in Sanwer, Indore, during an election rally on October 14 against the two was found to be in violation of the provisions of the model code. The BJP leader had also dubbed them as “gaddar” or traitors. Bypolls to 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will be held on November 3 for which campaigning is on. In his response, Vijayvargiya said the remarks quoted in the notice are in complete misunderstanding of its context. The complaint is in an election driven narrative of the Congress party to change the course of the election, he said. The BJP leader also said that "abiding by the directions of the Election Commission and the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct is paramount for him as well as every party worker of the BJP, and he has highest regard of the same." The order said the commission has carefully considered the matter "and is of considered view that Kailash Vijayvargiya has violated Para (2) of Part I of the General Conduct Model Code of Conduct for the Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates". The commission advised Vijayvargiya that "while making public utterances he should not use any such word or statement during the period of Model Code of Conduct."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ec-pulls-up-bjps-kailash-vijayvargiya-over-chunnu-munnu-remark-909074.html

"Political differences cannot justify the use of violence. Violence has always and will crowd out sanity. We will always fight aggression in all its forms irrespective of the source of aggression,” PAGD spokesperson Sajad Lone said in a statement.   Expressing grief over the incident, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said people of Jammu and Kashmir were paying with their lives for the policies of the Centre.  "Saddened to hear about the killing of three BJP workers in Kulgam. Condolences to their families. At the end of the day, its people of J&K who pay with their lives because of GOI's ill thought out policies," she tweeted. NC vice-president Omar Abdullah termed the incident a "terrible news." "Terrible news from Kulgam district of South Kashmir. I unequivocally condemn the targeted killing of the 3 BJP workers in a terror attack. May Allah grant them place in Jannat & may their families find strength during this difficult time," he tweeted.  The Pradesh Congress Committee described the incident as a highly condemnable, mindless and shameful act and demanded exemplary punishment to killers. The JKPCC also expressed serious concern over the "deteriorating" security situation in Kashmir and asked the government to take effective measures to prevent attacks on political persons and ensure their safety, a spokesperson of the party said. The three BJP workers -- Fida Hussain, Umer Hajam and Umer Rashid Beigh -- were shot dead by militants in Kulgam's Y K Pora area. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be a shadow group of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the killings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gupkar-alliance-unequivocally-condemns-killing-of-three-bjp-workers-in-jammu-and-kashmir-909132.html

The spread of the virus can be stopped to a large extent if everyone wears a mask. Masks have more benefits than a lockdown, the minister said. Delhi has reported record jumps of over 5,000 Covid-19 cases for the past two days. It reported 5,673 cases on Wednesday and 5,739 on Thursday. "People should consider masks as a vaccine till there is one. The spread of the virus can be stopped to a large extent if everyone wears a mask," Jain told PTI. "A mask has more benefits than a lockdown," he added. The Delhi government has cited its new strategy involving aggressive contact tracing and testing as one of the reasons behind the sudden surge in the number of infections in the city. The Union Health Ministry, however, has attributed the rise to social gatherings during festivities, deteriorating air quality, and increasing incidence of respiratory disorders. The positivity rate in Delhi also jumped to 9.55 per cent on Thursday as the infection tally mounted to 3.75 lakh. The number of active cases in the city rose to 30,952 on Thursday from 29,378 the previous day. Twenty-seven more fatalities were reported on Thursday, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 6,423.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/consider-masks-as-vaccine-against-covid-19-satyendar-jain-909151.html

An official communique to the sleuths of the local intelligence units (LIU) has asked them to ''gather information'' about the ''love affairs'' between couples from different castes or communities as they may turn into law and order problems, especially during the panchayat polls. The communique has used the term ''illicit love affairs'' to explain the relationship between couples hailing from different communities and castes. ''It is specifically about inter-caste and inter-faith love affairs....such affairs often create problems and result in violence,'' said a senior police official here. The intelligence sleuths have also been asked to gather information about other issues that may ignite trouble during the polls. They include disputes relating to properties, religious places and others, according to the officials. The directive came in the wake of several incidents involving the marriage of Hindu girls with Muslim boys by allegedly keeping the girls in the dark about the religion of the boys in some parts of the state.  Saffron outfits have been quite vocal against incidents of alleged 'love jihad'. The RSS too had recently indicated that it wanted an effective strategy to prevent such cases. The directive came close on the heels of the UP government's move to enact a law to prevent incidents of alleged 'love jihad' (Muslim youths marrying Hindu girls under false pretenses) in the state. The government was mulling to bring an ordinance to stop religious conversions, specifically aimed at preventing 'love jihad'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/inter-caste-lovers-under-uttar-pradesh-polices-scanner-909178.html

The move will result in total financial benefit to the transport sector to the tune of Rs 100 crore, according to an official statement. The Chief Minister also directed Transport Minister Razia Sultana to discuss and resolve other issues of concern to mini private bus owners by the next week. The decisions and directives were announced by the chief minister at a virtual conference with various private transport associations in the state. Besides Razia, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and Transport Secretary K Siva Prasad were present at the meeting. Though the transport department had initially suggested waiver up to 50 per cent of tax till December 31, the chief minister, responding to the concerns of transporters, overruled the department to announce 100 per cent relief, the statement said. The transporters were earlier provided 100 per cent relief for two months, till September 30, by the state government. “The chief minister took note of the problems faced by the transporters, who pointed out that with less than 10 per cent commuters availing the bus services, they were unable to meet even the cost of diesel to run their vehicles.    “Though the state transport and PRTC (state transport), being prime routes, were in demand, private bus operators continued to suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic," representatives of the transport associations told the chief minister.  Amarinder agreed with the transporters that their industry, run entirely by Punjabis, needed further support from the state government in the present situation and accepted their demand for total tax waiver till the end of this year, the statement further said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/amarinder-extends-100-tax-waiver-for-bus-operators-till-dec-31-909200.html
30-10-2020||North and Central||Over 23,000 farm fire incidents in Punjab so far this season: Official data||Punjab has witnessed more than 23,000 incidents of farm fire in the past over one month during the ongoing Kharif marketing season, according to official data. With many paddy growers continuing to defy the ban on burning crop residue, the authorities concerned have imposed a fine of over Rs 85 lakh on erring farmers. An official of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) attributed the rise in stubble burning incidents this year to the early arrival of paddy crop and expressed hope that the number of such cases would decrease. The spurt in stubble burning incidents came despite the state government appointing 8,000 nodal officers to check farm fires, besides giving more machines for the management of crop residue. Punjab has reported a total of 23,177 farm fire incidents for the period September 21 till October 29, according to Punjab Remote Sensing Centre data. The state had seen 19,869 stubble burning incidents in the corresponding period of last year, according to the data. On Thursday, the state reported 1,541 farm fire incidents with Sangrur district seeing 265 stubble burning cases, the highest in the state, it said. Among other districts, Patiala saw 165 incidents of farm fire, followed by 156 in Ferozepur, 127 in Bathinda and 102 in Mansa. Rupnagar district saw only one farm fire incident, according to the data. The PPCB authorities have imposed an environmental compensation of Rs 85.76 lakh in 3,172 farm fire cases. So far, about Rs 2 lakh has been recovered from defaulting farmers, an official of the PPCB said. A total of 16 FIRs have been registered so far under section 188 (disobeying orders) of the Indian Penal Code against farmers for burning residue, the official said, adding 39 cases had also been filed in the court under the relevant provisions of the Air Act. The state government appointed 8,000 nodal officers in paddy growing villages to check stubble burning this season. These officers were supposed to create awareness in villages through demonstration of machines used in straw management and also work in close coordination with the revenue, rural development and panchayats and agriculture departments. Besides, the state authorities had also planned to give more 23,500 machines to farmers for paddy straw management. In the last two years, 51,000 paddy straw management machines have been distributed among farmers in the state. The Punjab government has been seeking from the Centre Rs 100 per quintal as compensation to enable farmers to manage paddy straw without burning it. But farmers have been seeking Rs 200 per quintal as a bonus or Rs 6,000 per acre for the management of paddy straw. "Farmers cannot bear expenditure on the management of crop residue and the government should give compensation for the same to them," said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said. Every year, Punjab and Haryana are blamed for rising air pollution and smog, caused by crop residue burning by growers. Punjab alone generates 20 million tonnes of paddy stubble annually.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-23000-farm-fire-incidents-in-punjab-so-far-this-season-official-data-909206.html

In an order, the Commission said, "...for repeated violation of Model Code of Conduct and for completely disregarding the advisory issued to him, the Commission hereby revokes the status of leader of political party (Star Campaigner) of Kamal Nath, Ex-Chief Minister, Madhya Pradesh, with immediate effect for the current Bye-elections of Legislative Assembly of Madhya Pradesh." It said no permission will be granted by authorities to Nath as a star campaigner. "However, if any campaign is done by Kamal Nath from now onwards, the entire expenditure related to travel, stay and visit will be completely borne by the candidate in whose constituency he carries out campaigning," it said. While the political party pays for the expenditure of a star campaigner, the candidate pays for the expenditure of other campaigners. The EC said it has carefully considered the matter and has observed with "displeasure that Kamal Nath despite being a leader of a political party is repeatedly violating the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and breaching the ethical and dignified behaviour". The Commission referred to his remarks against Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. He had used the words "mafia" and "milawat khor" against a political rival at a recent campaigning event. Last week, the EC had asked Nath not to use words like "item" in campaigning. He had used the jibe to hit out at state minister and BJP candidate Imarti Devi at a rally. Campaigning is underway for the election to 28 Madhya Pradesh assembly seats on November 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-kamal-naths-star-campaigner-status-revoked-909207.html

In his address to students of Ashoka University in Haryana's Sonepat, he also said it is important for students to understand that for a successful policy, the 'public bind' is essential. "If you want to be a part of the change, we should not shy away from joining politics. The youth of the country can impact policies and get involved in governance. The government needs skilled and knowledgeable professionals," he said. "It is important for students to understand that for a successful policy, the 'public bind' is essential. During the Right to Information Act movement, lawmakers, and policymakers involved us. I wasn't in politics then but we mobilised enough people, and stakeholders to create a policy pressure group on the government. When the government heard us, it was a positive sign for the policy," he added. Sisodia, who is also Delhi's education minister, emphasised that there are many ways in which young professionals can get involved with policy-making. On being asked by one of the students about how to replicate a movement as powerful as the anti-corruption movement in India for other causes, especially pollution, he said, "The first job is to make the public understand the issue and create awareness. The information is there, but we fail in driving a collective public sentiment. Is your dream (as a policy-maker or change-maker) the same as the dream of your people?" "That's the job of a leader, and basis for any powerful movement. Mobilise people through local interventions so they feel for the cause on a daily basis, he said. Sisodia also asked them to use the skills of education to work in grass-roots levels, that is where the real changes happen. "You don't have to necessarily stand in elections, but by simply becoming a member, or even a party worker, you can engage in various departments where work on research, analysis, and policy-drafts is being done regularly," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/youth-of-the-country-should-not-shy-away-from-politics-manish-sisodia-909209.html

"We will fight politically and legally as well, but our fight will be peaceful. We have no intention to vitiate the atmosphere in this state," NC vice president Omar Abdullah told reporters in Kargil, over 200 km from here. A delegation of the PAGD led by Omar Abdullah visited Ladakh and held consultations with the people in Kargil "on the road ahead" for Jammu and Kashmir. Seven mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the NC and the PDP, have formed the PAGD for the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Vowing to fight for the rights of the people of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir using all peaceful means, Omar said the PAGD was ready to talk to anyone to develop a wider consensus over their demands. "We are ready to talk to anyone and we will not hesitate in doing so," he said when asked whether the delegation was ready to talk to an apex body recently formed in Leh. The former chief minister said he wants the representatives from Kargil to become part of the PAGD. "We had not held any discussions with them (representatives from Kargil) so far, so how could we have included them in PAGD? Now that we have held consultations with them, we want the voices from Kargil to attend the meeting of PAGD," he said. Earlier, addressing people in the Drass area, Omar said the fight against last year's decisions by the Centre would continue as the decisions were imposed on the people of the erstwhile state "illegally" without consulting them. He said the delegation was visiting Kargil on the directions of PAGD president Farooq Abdullah, who is also the chief of the NC, and his deputy and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti to meet the people and take their viewpoint. The visit was to take the feedback right from the ground-level, Omar said, adding that they did not want to have such a situation where they say one thing in Srinagar and the people in Kargil felt otherwise. "It was very important to come here to bring more weight to our fight so that whether it is Srinagar or Jammu or even Parliament, we can tell the rulers at the Centre that the people of Kargil are not with your August 5, 2019 decisions," he said. Terming the Centre's decisions as "injustice", Omar said the decisions were thrust upon the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. "This is injustice. It was for the very first time such a decision was taken without the people's consent. Whenever a state was divided, the decision was taken with the people's consent. Whether it was Punjab, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh or recently in Andhra Pradesh – the people were with the decision to divide the state. This is for the first time that such a decision was thrust upon people," he said. The NC leader said they were not ready to accept the Centre's decision. "Neither was this decision taken by our assembly or Parliament nor was it signed by an elected chief minister of J&K. The powers were taken by the governor of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir illegally and without talking to us and the state was divided and downgraded into two UTs. We are not ready to accept this decision," he said. Stressing that the need of the hour was to keep political rifts between various political parties in J&K at bay, the former chief minister said the parties came together to fight for reversing the decisions of August 5 last year. "It is our responsibility today to forget all such things – no election, no government, no chair and no power – we have come on a single platform with the sole aim to reverse the decisions of August 5 last year. God willing, if you continue to support us, we will not back down in this fight and will reach our objective," Omar Abdullah said. He assured the people of Kargil that they were not alone in the fight seeking restoration of their rights, saying "we will not rest till we overturn the decisions of August 5, 2019, and succeed in joining back the (erstwhile) state of J&K". Omar Abdullah got nostalgic about the visit saying he felt something different when he entered Kargil. "Whenever we used to come here, we came thinking we were in our home only, that it was our state, our nation and our people even as we were separated by mountains. But, today, when we crossed Zojilla pass, we felt something different when we saw all names related to J&K have been replaced by Ladakh. We felt like we were entering into some neighbour's house and not ours like we were coming as guests," he said. Later, Omar tweeted, "A delegation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration met leaders of the Kargil Democratic Alliance in Kargil this afternoon. All of us united that the pre-August 5th, 2019 position must be restored." Commenting on the visit, PDP president Mufti said it was high time someone reached out to the people of Kargil as they too have "grave apprehensions" about the future. "Glad to see all of you at Kargil to engage with the people. High time someone reached out to them since they too have grave apprehensions about the future," Mufti said in a tweet. The members of the delegation, which visited Ladakh, comprise of NC leader Nasir Aslam Wani, PDP leaders Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura and Waheed Para, and Awami National Conference leader Muzaffar Shah.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-fight-politically-legally-for-restoration-of-articles-370-35-a-omar-abdullah-in-ladakh-909282.html

Sinha reviewed the preparedness and logistical arrangements of various departments for the winter in a meeting at Raj Bhavan here, the spokesman said. He said the Lt Governor directed the officers concerned to adopt a proactive approach to address the needs and requirements of the people, especially those living in far-flung and snow-bound areas. Sinha asked them to be responsive and take comprehensive measures to minimise the difficulties of common people, work at the grassroots level and reach out to the people to address their genuine concerns. The LG also directed the officers to put committed efforts to ensure uninterrupted drinking water and power supply and timely restoration, availability of public utilities such as firewood, ration, medicines and other basic amenities and essential supplies. Necessary directions were passed to maintain sufficient stock of firewood, fuel, food grains, and medicines, especially in remote and difficult terrain areas, the spokesman said. He said the Lt Governor directed the Power Development Department to maintain the availability of buffer stock in the district headquarters, besides ensuring proper functioning of existing transmission lines, transformers, electrical equipment, repair workshops, timely repairs and replacement of the damaged infrastructure and equipment. The Lt Governor set a deadline of 24 hours for urban areas and 48 hours for rural areas for replacement of transformers, barring difficult and inaccessible areas, the spokesman said. The Lt Governor stressed upon close monitoring of the functioning of the power distribution and transmission channels in order to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the harsh winter days. Reviewing the preparedness of Jal Shakti Department, he set the deadline of the same day in urban areas and within the next day in rural areas for resolving water supply and repair problems. Laying special emphasis on ensuring uninterrupted road connectivity and proper Traffic management, Sinha directed the officers to rationalise the deployment of snow clearing machinery and equipment for snow clearance from all main and internal roads, the spokesman said. All the requisite arrangements must be made in advance for the stranded passengers on the national highway and other important district and town roads, besides putting a check on unnecessary and unruly movements on the national highway for smooth vehicular movement, Sinha told the officers. The Lt Governor directed the officers concerned to issue weather advisories in time and make every necessary emergency facility available to render critical help in any contingent situation. Sinha also passed directions for setting up of control rooms in every district headquarters and asked deputy commissioners to monitor and resolve grievances of the people pertaining to power, water, essential supplies, health services, road connectivity, and emergency evacuation and rescue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/adopt-proactive-approach-to-fulfil-peoples-needs-during-winter-months-jammu-and-kashmir-l-g-manoj-sinha-909326.html

Why no celebration?||By Tae Kim For a second straight quarter, Big Tech displayed its unparalleled ability to generate impressive profits during a global pandemic. Investors shouldn’t get too complacent, though. The industry’s sizable share-price gains this year, along with embedded high expectations, make betting on a “three-peat” a riskier proposition. Even the tech giants may be vulnerable in a Covid-19 winter. Late Thursday, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Twitter Inc. all reported better-than-expected financial results. As with many companies, they benefited from a rebound in economic activity following government stimulus programs and a general lifting of shelter-in-place restrictions around the world. But unlike many other businesses, the tech giants were able to make money even during worst the parts of the earlier lockdowns thanks to their dominant business models and market positions. The latest quarter continued that trend, with Apple beating Wall Street estimates on strong sales of its iPads and Mac laptops and Amazon surging on the back of soaring e-commerce sales and demand for its cloud-computing services. Meanwhile, the big players in digital advertising — Facebook, Google and Twitter — all handily beat sales estimates as marketers opened up their ad budgets amid the improving economic environment. As good as earnings were on an absolute level, they are still backward-looking. The market may quickly move beyond these numbers toward prospects for the important holiday quarter. And that’s where things are a bit more uncertain. We have already seen a flurry of corporate job-cut announcements lately, including from Walt Disney Co., Boeing Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. If more companies lay off employees, that may spook investor sentiment on the sustainability of the recovery and dampen consumer spending. Then there is the recent surge in Covid-19 cases around the world. On Wednesday, Germany and France announced new lockdown measures, which could presage similar moves in other countries this winter. Finally, all the technology companies are facing increasing levels of regulatory scrutiny like they never have before. Beyond the economic backdrop, each company faces a different sets of risks. Apple investors are betting the new 5G-enabled iPhone will be a huge success, with its shares of trading at about 31 times next four quarters’ earnings, roughly double its historical five-year average. But as I wrote earlier this month, the new smartphones may meet tepid demand when consumers realize the current state of high-speed wireless networks are lackluster at best. Facebook and Google could feel the pinch if marketers cut ad spending if further Covid-related restrictions lead to a worsening economic environment. As for Twitter, it’s falling behind on innovation and needs to move faster to match the competition’s ad-platform technologies. The one exception out of the group may be Amazon, which has a pretty clear runway for further gains. Consumers are still increasingly shifting spending online as more physical stores shutter. And the rising demand for digital internet services such as remote-working software and video streaming continues to boost demand for Amazon Web Services. Both trends are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. While the technology sector has been resilient and a good place to hide for investors during the worst of the Covid crisis, valuations now leave little room for error. In fact, with the exception of Alphabet, the rest of the group’s stocks fell markedly in after-hours trading following the earnings reports, a sign of how much investors expect from these companies. Simply beating expectations isn’t enough. And what if the economic situation worsens? Consumers could delay purchases or lower their spending for the holidays. Then not even Big Tech will be immune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/big-tech-raked-it-in-again-why-no-celebration-908934.html
30-10-2020||Opinion||How to hold onto your paychecks in this IPO frenzy||By Shuli Ren Now that we’re all stuck at home, speculating on new initial public offerings has become a thrilling pastime. But as Hong Kong experiences its best IPO market in a decade, a word of caution is in order. You can lose a lot in this game, especially if you use borrowed money. Hong Kong’s IPO market works a bit like a lottery. You borrow as much as you can to apply for as many shares as possible. With hot listings, you’re lucky to get just one out of every 100 shares you applied for. The cost is repayment of margin loans, while the upside is an IPO pop.  Good money can be made from betting on sharp price rises of newly listed shares. In early September, more than 700,000 people bought into mineral-water bottler Nongfu Spring Co.’s $1.1 billion IPO. The stock had a 54% first-day gain and is trading over 60% above its offer price. About a third of the investors put in just HK$4,300 ($551) each, earning enough for a nice dim sum meal. Many investors were way more adventurous, applying for millions worth of shares to hit it big — and with debt, borrowing as much as 90% from their brokers. In the end, everyone went home happy. With a list of companies waiting in line to dazzle us, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First, cornerstone investors don’t mean a thing. In Hong Kong, companies often invite heavyweights, such as sovereign wealth funds or local tycoons, to invest in the IPO as a show of confidence. It turns out, such investors don’t boost short-term returns. Looking at IPOs since 2017, those with more than 10% of shares allotted to cornerstones haven’t outperformed those without one, data compiled by Soochow Securities show. Earlier this week, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Ltd posted the worst first-day decline for a $400 million-plus IPO in more than two years. Shares closed 20% lower on debut trading, despite having courted prestigious Hillhouse Capital as a cornerstone. Retail investors, who had crowded into this IPO, are nursing their wounds. Second, valuation doesn’t matter — until one day it does. Small caps, as well as growth stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios, tend to be more popular and offer larger IPO pops. The reasoning is simple: They are proxies for hot industries, such as consumer tech or healthcare.  We’ve seen a few cracks lately. Joy Spreader Interactive Technology Ltd., which raised HK$1.6 billion, tumbled on debut trading in September. Granted, its shares are now more than 50% above the offer price, but with an allotment rate as low as 0.07%, some investors are barely breaking even. Joy Spreader, which attracted over 360,000 applicants for its IPO shares, turned out to be a joy killer.  Third, don’t ride with whales. To bet on IPO pops, you must believe someone will want to buy off your shares in the public market at a higher price. With Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. staging the world’s biggest IPO, all eyes — and brokerage loans — will go there. Who will want your shares in some obscure company then? It’s important to check the IPO pipeline carefully. Ultimately, a bet on an IPO pop is a bet on momentum, which has been a major factor this year and helped notch almost 39% of excess return, portfolio analysis conducted by Bloomberg shows. But be warned. In the last week, it was also the biggest losing factor.  I get it, we’re all bored. But with as much as 10% of the city’s population betting on one IPO, I can’t help wondering if this market has gotten too frothy. Sure, we all enjoy putting money on the horses at the Jockey Club once in a while, but don’t use leverage to boost your odds. There are more productive ways to part with your paycheck.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-to-hold-onto-your-paychecks-in-this-ipo-frenzy-908976.html
30-10-2020||Opinion||Jeremy Corbyn suffers his own 'day of shame'||By Therese Raphael, British voters dealt Jeremy Corbyn a devastating defeat in last December’s general election. But it was the report published Thursday on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party under his leadership that will truly define his legacy. He has been suspended from the party that he claims to have loved, but in which a nasty culture of bigotry flourished while he was in charge. Keir Starmer, Corbyn’s successor, still has a tough battle ahead to make sure this tendency is rooted out of the organization. The 101-page report couldn’t have been more damning. The UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission said the party was guilty of discrimination against Jews and breaking the law. It breached the 2010 Equality Act, introduced by a Labour government, through political interference with anti-Semitism complaints and a failure to provide proper training for those handling the complaints. It also found the party guilty of harassing Jewish members “through its agents” by suggesting claims of anti-Semitism were fake or politicized. While Labour had effective procedures for sexual harassment, it didn’t for this ugly form of prejudice. This is strong stuff and a validation of many complaints over many years. Back in 2019, one of Labour’s own members of Parliament, Luciana Berger, resigned from the party over “institutional anti-Semitism” and what she called “a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation.” The report is a victory for her and others like her.  Corbyn’s reaction to the report’s findings was typical. anti-Semitism is horrible and wrong, he said, as he has on many occasions. And then came the inevitable “but.” But his record in office had improved over time. But the charges of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party were “dramatically overstated for political reasons.” The most generous possible interpretation is that Corbyn has a blind spot when it comes to this issue, and that he genuinely believes it was often a convenient stick with which to beat him. But — that word again — there is little reason to be generous. The damage done to those who suffered discrimination, and the impact on the Jewish community, justifies the anger. Whatever the root cause, Corbyn’s failed leadership on the issue sullied Labour’s reputation as the party of social justice and non-discrimination and contributed to the staggering scale of its election defeat to Boris Johnson’s Conservatives. Tories have rushed to note that Starmer was part of Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. But he spoke out repeatedly against anti-Semitism and forged closer ties with the Jewish community. His integrity isn’t in question. Starmer’s ambitions meant he wasn’t willing to put his job on the line the way Berger did. And yet his response to Thursday’s report signaled his seriousness. Starmer called it “a day of shame for the Labour Party,” before promptly suspending Corbyn pending an investigation. Corbyn, who didn’t accept all of the report’s findings, will contest the suspension. “Never again will Labour let you down,” Starmer told Jewish people.  What matters now is whether he wins the bigger existential battle against the Corbyn-supporting hard left of the Labour Party — a fight that was always going to happen at some point. Starmer has promised to implement all recommendations of the report in full within six weeks, including the establishment of an independent complaints process.  Changing the party culture — and winning the battle with the hard left — won’t be easy, as much of the reaction from Corbyn supporters testified. The far-left Morning Star tweeted, “The true day of shame is the day the most committed antiracist who has ever led the Labour Party is suspended for telling the truth.” Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the suspension as “profoundly wrong.” Just a week ago, a major figure in the party — Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite trade union — had to apologize after suggesting that veteran Labour politician Peter Mandelson “just goes into a room and counts his gold.” He denied that he’d used an anti-Semitic trope. Labour is a big tent with multiple power centers. What the left of the party is calling a “civil war” may determine how deep Starmer’s changes can go, and how far Jewish people will be able to trust it again. Elections are underway to decide its powerful National Executive Committee. Union leaders will have a major say. The suspension of Corbyn has been likened to Neil Kinnock’s expulsion of the militant wing of the party in the 1980s. If Labour is to become electable again, never mind respectable again, this is a contest Starmer must win.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/jeremy-corbyn-suffers-his-own-day-of-shame-908999.html

The siblings have found their names entangled in cases ranging from sexual abuse to financial frauds and now, drug peddling. Hence, Bineesh's nexus with Bengaluru-based Mohammed Anoop, an accused in a drug peddling case, did not come as a surprise to many in Kerala. Bineesh is known for his nexus with people with questionable backgrounds -- from local gangsters to NRI businessmen. In 2009, when a Malayali NRI businessman Madathil Raghu and his business associate, an Egypt-born UK citizen named Ahamed Mohamed, were intercepted by CISF personnel at the Thiruvananthapuram airport following a drunken ruckus, they allegedly told the security personnel that they were Bineesh's friends. Balakrishnan was Kerala's Home Minister back then. Bineesh's name has even figured in the ongoing gold smuggling row. A private firm, which was associated with the UAE consulate and paid commission to gold smuggling case accused and former secretary at the consulate Swapna Suresh, is alleged to be a benami firm of Bineesh. Bineesh also faced allegations of a nexus with R Sabarinath who is accused of swindling over Rs 200 crore by cheating hundreds of investors through a financial firm called 'Total4U'. His elder brother Binoy was recently accused of rape in a complaint filed by a Mumbai-based woman who was a former bar dancer in the UAE. She alleged that Binoy had impregnated her after sexually abusing her by promising marriage and later cheating on her. A Mumbai court had ordered a DNA test to prove the paternity of the child, which was prolonging mysteriously. Binoy had also faced a travel ban imposed by the UAE in 2018 following a complaint of a Rs 13-crore financial fraud filed by a sponsor of a Dubai-based firm. Though the case was settled, the source of the funds for settling the case was still unclear.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/keralas-kodiyeri-brothers-not-new-to-controversies-908859.html

Bineesh was placed under custody on Thursday by the ED in Bengaluru following which he was sent to custody for interrogation till November 2. His arrest came following his questioning over the past few days after apprehending an alleged drug peddler Anoop Mohammed. The ED has claimed that Anoop was Bineesh's benamidar, a person who holds the benami property for the beneficiary. Bineesh's arrest, which came a day after the arrest of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's former Principal Secretary M Sivasankar by the ED in a case related to gold smuggling, has cornered the CPI(M) and the Kerala government. The Opposition has been demanding Vijayan's resignation while the CPI(M) is maintaining that Sivasankar and Bineesh were acting on their own and the party or the government had no hand in it. The agency registered a complaint on the basis of a case filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after arresting Anoop and two others in August. The NCB had then cracked a racket allegedly involved in selling ecstasy pills and other party drugs to actors and others in the entertainment industry. It had taken Anoop into custody on October 17 and during his interrogation, the ED claimed, he told interrogators that he was indulging in the sale and purchase of narcotics drugs and was "closely associated" with Bineesh Kodiyeri. Anoop also held "various bank accounts and indulged in transferring/layering of huge proceeds of crime" into various accounts. "Fund trail investigation also established that a huge amount of unaccounted funds were being regularly credited in his accounts by Bineesh Kodiyeri. These were preceded by large cash deposits in Kerala into the accounts of Bineesh Kodiyeri," ED claimed. "Anoop is a Benamidar of Bineesh Kodiyeri and all his financial dealings were done on the instructions of Bineesh Kodiyer who had paid huge amounts of money to Anoop. He (Bineesh) could not explain these cash and fund transactions and was completely evasive in his replies," it added. Bineesh had earlier denied any wrongdoing though he admitted that he knew Anoop and his family and the latter had borrowed money from him and some others for setting up a restaurant in Bengaluru. Sources said Bineesh had told interrogators that he had loaned Rs 6 lakh to Anoop but the latter is claimed to have told ED that he received around Rs 50 lakh from him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bineesh-kodiyeri-remitted-huge-unaccounted-funds-into-drug-peddlers-account-says-ed-909031.html

"As soon as the opinion received, Hon'ble Governor has given assent to the Bill," the release added.  Hours after the Governor signed the Bill into Act, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami met Purohit and "thanked him." The issuance of the GO and subsequent assent to the Bill passed by the State Assembly paves the way for the conduct of counselling for medical admission in the state for the academic year 2020-21. The 7.5 per cent horizontal reservation that will ensure at least 300 students from government schools get into medical colleges every year. The government was forced to use the power to issue executive directions after it was pushed to the corner by the Opposition parties, especially the DMK, that accused it of not exerting "enough pressure" on the Governor. Palaniswami met Governor earlier this month and deputed a delegation of ministers to exert pressure on Purohit to sign the Bill. But the governor had last week said that he needed another "three to four weeks" to arrive at a decision on the Bill providing the 7.5 per cent reservation prompting the DMK to hit the streets. However, he signed the Bill much before the self-imposed deadline.  The horizontal reservation shall be provided in each category of vertical reservation followed in the State of Tamil Nadu within the 69% reservation from the academic year 2020-2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-45-days-tamil-nadu-governor-signs-75-reservation-bill-909199.html

The victim had earlier filed an application before the High Court seeking a transfer of the case from the trial court raising concerns over the attitude of the court towards the victim. The trial was earlier assigned to the CBI special court with a woman judge by the High Court considering the victim's plea. On Friday when the High Court considered the victim's plea to shift the trial, the prosecution also stated that victim often faced harassment during the trial and the court hardly controlled it. Around 20 lawyers representing the accused, which included actor Dileep, were present for examining the victim during the in-camera trial and the victim faced severe harassment. But the court did not make any interventions to protect the victim. The special prosecutor in the case A Sureshan would be submitting a detailed report in this regard in a sealed cover to the HC. The HC would be considering the case again on Monday. The prosecution had earlier filed an application before the trial court to stop the proceedings for moving the High Court. But the trial court dismissed it.  Around 80 witnesses were already examined. Many witnesses from the film fraternity turned hostile. A section of actors had strongly flayed the witnesses turning hostile. Many like Parvathy Thiruvoth had even quit the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists over the row. The actress was abducted and sexually assaulted by a gang, allegedly engaged by Dileep to settle personal scores in February 2017 at Kochi. The gang allegedly shot the video of the assault. Dileep was arrested in this connection in July 2017 and was granted bail in October.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-sexual-assault-case-victim-alleges-unfair-trial-909204.html

On Friday morning two wild boars barged into the house of Mohanan and started damaging furniture. Mohanan and family managed to escape the attack of the animals. With the help of some local people, Mohanan closed the doors of the house and alerted the forest officials. Subsequently, both the wild boars were shot dead. The local people staged a protest demanding a lasting solution to wild boar menace as farmers in Koorachunde, a hilly area bordering the forest, have been witnessing frequent raids by wild boars on their crops. The incident occurred at a time when wildlife protection activists are protesting against the Kerala government's decision to press the Centre to declare wild boar as vermin citing the frequent instances of man-animal conflict. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) has also petitioned the Centre against Kerala's request to legalise the culling of the animal. In a letter to the Union government, the FIAPO said that Kerala's demand for declaring wild boar as vermin was not based on any scientific studies. It also expressed fears that declaring wild boar as vermin may hit the existence of the species. As per 2002 data, the number of wild boars in Kerala was 60,940 and it came down to 48,034 in 2011, which was the last wild animal census by the Kerala forest department, FIAPO pointed out. In a representation sent to Union Forest Minister Prakash Javadekar and other top officials, the FIAPO suggested that instead of declaring wild boar as vermin, more focus should be given on setting up fences, digging well-replenished watering holes deep inside forests and providing enough feed to pre-empt wild animals from foraying into habitation centres during summer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/2-wild-boars-enter-house-in-kerala-amid-protest-against-state-govt-pushing-for-vermin-tag-909228.html
30-10-2020||South||Tamil Nadu: Covid-19 blows out Sivakasi's Deepavali sparkle||The Covid-19 induced lockdown led to the shutting down of fireworks' manufacturing units in Sivakasi for 55 days leading to a steep fall of over 30 per cent in the production of firecrackers. Now, the coronavirus scare threatens to play a spoilsport for the already suffering industry with dealers across the country reducing their orders for firecrackers due to “less demand” from people. Several manufacturers in the fireworks hub of Sivakasi, 540 km from here, say they could use only 70 per cent of their production capacity and are not sure of even selling the produced goods this Deepavali season. While large manufacturers claim to have pushed nearly 75 per cent of their goods out of Sivakasi, the small factories are the worst affected staring at losses to the tune of crores of rupees. The industry, which has been suffering losses for the past few years due to uncertainty over court cases, had hoped to turn the tide this year after adapting to green crackers that emit 30 per cent less 2.5 particulate matter reducing air pollution.  The manufacturers say that dealers, especially from those in North India, have reduced their orders from Sivakasi fearing a reduction in sales of firecrackers due to Covid–19. Adding to their woes is the state governments' restricting the number of cracker shops this year as part of the efforts to contain further spread of the novel coronavirus. Fireworks' manufacturers in Sivakasi begin production for the next Deepavali a few weeks after the festivities end based on advance payment from dealers and buyers across the country. "We have fulfilled all orders that we received from our buyers before the lockdown and the number of orders dwindled after we resumed production in May. Overall, there is a 50 per cent reduction in the sales when compared to last year," N Kartheeswaran, Partner, Sri Velavan Fireworks', told Deccan Herald. Another manufacturer agreed with Kartheeswaran and explained the loss. "If I had sent 5,000 huge packets of fireworks, I am sending only around 2,500 to 2,700 packets this year. Dealers are not willing to stock up as there is a slump in demand too this year. Only when dealers buy we will be able to clear the stocks," the manufacturer explained. With just a fortnight left for Deepavali, manufacturers are not too confident of the sales “picking up” as they feel people's “buying capacity” may have been reduced due to Covid-19. “We lost huge sales that usually come from states like Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa during Ganesh Chaturthi as there was no public celebration. Orders for marriage and other local festivals also got cancelled. I do not think the Deepavali sales will increase in the coming weeks due to a variety of factors,” T Kannan, General Secretary of The Indian Fireworks' Manufacturers' Association (TIFMA), told DH. Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA) President P Ganesan also acknowledged the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had its effect on production and sales. "Factories could only produce 70 per cent of their capacities and out of the products that have been manufactured, 70 to 80 per cent have been sold. We have another two weeks of production and we hope to sell as much we can," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-covid-19-blows-out-sivakasis-deepavali-sparkle-909239.html

30-10-2020||State||Debate on next Karnataka CM candidate immaterial, says Congress leader H K Patil||Amid debate among Congress leaders in Karnataka on who should be the next Chief Ministerial candidate in the state, senior leader H K Patil on Friday said that there was no need to give too much importance for such a debate. "Traditionally, the Congress has a system where elected legislators and the Congress high command decide who should be the chief minister. There is a clear system in the party and debate on the CM candidate is immaterial," Patil told reporters here. Patil, who is also party in-charge for Maharashtra,  said, "Some party workers must have suggested their leader's name as the chief ministerial candidate with affection. No need to take such things seriously." The issue of chief ministerial candidate in the Congress was triggered during campaigning of bypolls in the state where some leaders suggested former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah should be next Chief Minister if the party came to power.

During a programme organised at Cauvery Hall, Kodagu Hotels, Restaurants and Resorts Association president B R Nagendra Prasad expressed concern over the loss of employment among the educated youth due to Covid-19 pandemic. “The food delivery app is an effort to provide employment to the local youth. Youth should make use of it,” he said. Youth have returned to their native after losing employment. There is a need to give them a platform for employment. The Central government too has been giving several facilities for the unemployed to take up self-employment. Youth should make use of the opportunities, he added. Hotel association advisor Anil H T said that projects that aim at self-reliance were the backbone of the country. Muliya Jewellers Managing Director Keshava Prasad Muliya said that the app would benefit the unemployed. There is a need to expand the business activities by keeping Madikeri as headquarter. Jayaprakash, Pove app partner, said, “The app will provide service in Madikeri initially. Later, it will be extended to the entire district and state. Already, 20 youth from Kodagu have been employed.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-food-delivery-app-gives-jobs-to-unemployed-909269.html

For the past six months, passengers are hesitating to take the autorickshaws due to the fear of Covid-19. The autorickshaw drivers are seen waiting for passengers at bus stands in Kodlipet and Shanivarasanthe. Earlier, people getting down from the buses would take autorickshaws to reach their destinations. Now, people are not frequently traveling in buses, and as a result, bus shelters wear a deserted look. This has seriously affected the livelihood of autorickshaw drivers and owners. Even though the movement of private buses has started, passengers are not willing to travel. However, the autorickshaw drivers have been parking their rickshaws at auto stands from the morning and most of them return home empty-handed in the evening. Managing day-to-day expenses has become a challenge for them. Some are thinking of taking up alternative jobs to make ends meet. Karnataka Rakshana Vedike Kodlipet hobli unit Secretary D R Vedakumar said that the condition of autorickshaw owners and drivers had turned pathetic. They are dependent on auto-rickshaws for their livelihood. The government should formulate programmes for them, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-gives-auto-owners-drivers-a-rough-ride-909268.html

30-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||HC denies bail to Ravi Pujari in double murder case||The High Court of Karnataka has denied bail to gangster Ravi Pujari in the case pertaining to the fatal shooting at the offices of Shabnam Developers 13 years ago.  In 2007, Pujari’s henchmen had allegedly stormed into the offices of Shabnam Developers in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru, and shot down a receptionist named Shylaja and a driver named Ravi.  In February this year, Pujari was extradited to India from Senegal where he had been hiding for years and running an underworld syndicate. Police charged him in the Shabnam Developers case in June.  Pujari moved the high court for bail, contending that there are no eyewitnesses. His counsel said Pujari has been in custody for the last eight months and there was no progress in the trial. Further, the sessions court has acquitted three accused for want of evidence.  The charge sheet filed earlier was split between Pujari and other accused, especially because the gangster was absconding. Two sessions cases were numbered as 18/2009 and 713/2020.  Opposing the bail petition, the public prosecutor argued that Pujari was absconding for nearly 26 years and was brought back from abroad, where he had fled by impersonating one Antony Fernandes. He faces about 108 cases and if he is given bail, there are chances he will flee again, the prosecutor added.  “The trial court has to take a decision independently of the observations made in the sessions case 18/2009 (the first charge sheet in the Shabnam Developers case). The conduct of the petitioner shows that he hampered the trial in SC 18/2009. There are many cases pending against him. If bail is granted, it is not sure that he will appear before the trial court regularly,” the court said while dismissing the bail plea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/hc-denies-bail-to-ravi-pujari-in-double-murder-case-909288.html

In normal -- pre-Covid -- times, 80 lakh people travelled daily by Mumbai suburban local trains. The Western Railway said in a letter to the state on Thursday that it can transport a maximum of 9.6 lakh commuters even if it operated all 1,367 suburban services, while the Central Railway said only 12.4 lakh passengers can be ferried even if it operated all 1,776 services. "In the present Covid regime, a safe number of passengers per EMU service would work out to 700. So, even if we start all 1,367 EMU services, we can transport a maximum of 9.6 lakh passengers daily, which is much less than the 35 lakh passengers which were traveling in the Pre-Covid regime," said the letter sent by the Western Railway. The Central Railway wrote that it can ferry a maximum of 12.4 lakh of the 45 lakh passengers who travelled on its suburban network before pandemic. Average occupancy during normal times is 2,560 passengers per train. But during peak hours, occupancy rises to as much as 4,500 passengers per train. The Railway authorities also asked the state government to implement staggered timing and use available technologies such as mobile apps to segregate commuters. "The issue of segregation of passengers, thus enabling social distancing, has to be ensured by the state government, by some technological solution application," the Western Railway letter stated. As to the state's suggestion to run a ladies special train every hour, the railways said it"may be much in excess of the requirement of pre-Covid period".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/can-carry-only-25-commuters-in-mumbai-with-distancing-indian-railways-908908.html

Wielding the stick, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to instill fear so that people start wearing masks. Over Thursday and Friday, more than 100 persons have been made to sweep the roads when found not wearing masks and not ready or unable to shell out Rs 200 as fine. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had himself expressed concern repeatedly that he had noticed that several people in Mumbai are not wearing masks or not wearing them properly. Earlier this month, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had set the target of penalizing 20,000 people per day for not wearing masks. When the Covid-19 lockdown started, the BMC decided on a fine of Rs 1,000 if found not wearing masks, which was reduced to Rs 200 when the Unlock process started. “The Maharashtra government and the BMC have been requesting people to wear masks, but several people are not adhering to the new normal protocols. We are now asking people to do community service by asking them to sweep roads,” a BMC official said. The punishment is being handed out as per the BMCs Solid Waste Management Bye-Laws that give the civic body powers to ask citizens to do various community services for spitting on roads. The BMC teams have fanned out in several areas and as of now they are keeping a hawk-eyed vigil in the market areas. “While some people realize the mistake and apologise and even do community service, some of them are threatening us also,” said assistant municipal commissioner Vishwas Mote.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-no-mask-no-money-to-pay-fine-sweep-roads-in-mumbai-909078.html

Besides her, veteran politician Eknath Khadse, who switched over from the BJP to the NCP and farmers’ leader Raju Shetti are among the probables who are likely to enter Maharashtra’s Upper House through the Governor’s quota. At the weekly Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was authorised to send 12 names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Over the last couple of weeks, there were extensive discussions between the Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress and their smaller allies and within the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. The three parties have agreed on a 4-4-4 formula for the 12 vacant seats. The terms of the 12 legislators nominated to the Upper House under the Governor’s quota had expired in June. The Governor nominates 12 MLCs for a tenure of six years based on the recommendations of the state Cabinet. According to Article171(5) of the Constitution: “(5) The members to be nominated by the Governor under sub-clause (e) of clause (3) shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely: literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service.” There were several eligible candidates who were keen on joining the Council. However, only a few names were short-listed. From the Shiv Sena's side, the probables are Milind Narvekar, the secretary and man Friday of Thackeray, actor Urmila Matondkar, TV presenter and Chairman of Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati Temple Trust Aadesh Bandekar, and Shiv Sena leaders Sachin Ahir and Sunil Shinde. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP has proposed the names of Eknath Khadse, the veteran politician who left the BJP and joined the NCP, farmers’ leader Raju Shetti, the founder of Swabhimani Paksha and singer Anand Shinde. From the Congress side, the probables are party spokesperson and General Secretary Sachin Sawant, MPCC working President Muzaffar Hussain, former Rajya Sabha member Rajni Patil, Maharashtra Youth Congress President Satyajeet Tambe and veteran leader Naseem Khan. Incidentally, Tambe is the nephew of state Congress chief and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat. When asked about Urmila Matondkar, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “I have also heard about her name as one of the probables….the Cabinet has authorized the chief minister and he would take a final call and send the names to Governor.” It may be recalled that ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Urmila had joined the Congress and unsuccessfully contested the polls against BJP’s Gopal Shetty. However, before the Vidhan Sabha polls, she resigned from the Congress because of infighting and power centres in the Mumbai unit. Recently, when actor Kangana Ranawat, backed by the BJP, attacked the MVA government, the Thackerays and a large section of Bollywood, Urmila stood up and chose to reply.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bollywood-actress-urmila-matondkar-may-get-a-berth-in-maharashtra-legislative-council-909102.html

A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik on Thursday also said that the Mumbai police are considered one of the best in the world. "The job of a police officer is difficult during these times of pandemic. The Mumbai police are already under a lot of pressure. They have to do 12-hour duty and then there are processions and morchas for which bandobast is required," Justice Shinde said. "Among all these odds, Mumbai police is considered as one of the best in the world and is compared to the Scotland Yard police. Some amount of cooperation is required from people too," he said.  The remarks were made by the court while hearing a petition filed by a Navi Mumbai resident, Sunaina Holey, seeking to quash three FIRs lodged against her for allegedly promoting enmity hatred and ill-will among groups in the society after she posted offensive remarks against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and minister Aaditya Thackeray on social media. On Thursday, additional public prosecutor Jayesh Yagnik told the court that despite the notice issued to Holey, asking her to appear before the investigating officer of BKC Cyber Police for recording her statement, she did not appear. Holey's counsel Abhinav Chandrachud said she could not appear due to health issues and assured the court that she would appear before the police on November 2. The court accepted this and said, "We hope and expect that the petitioner (Holey) shall extend full cooperation for the investigation."

Speaking to reporters here, Deshmukh said the government has suggested certain time slots where general commuters can board these trains. The Maharashtra government had on Wednesday proposed to the Railways that the general public be allowed to travel on Mumbai local trains, which are currently available only for essential services employees and a select group of people in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Railway authorities appeared lukewarm to the proposal and on Thursday said only a little over 25 per cent of the normal number of commuters can be carried while following social distancing. In the pre-Covid-19 era, 80 lakh people travelled daily by Mumbai suburban local trains, called the "lifeline" of the metropolis. The Maharashtra government has given (the Railways) timings (when one can be allowed to use train services). The railway administration should cooperate with the Maharashtra government accordingly, Deshmukh said. People will not face inconvenience if the Railways cooperates well. Hence, the Railway administration should cooperate with the government without bringing any politics into this, he added. The government had proposed to the Railway authorities that the general public be allowed to travel by Mumbai local trains during non-peak hours. At present, only certain categories of persons, including essential services staff and women, can travel by local trains due to the coronavirus threat. In a letter to the Railways, the state government had suggested that any person holding a valid ticket be allowed to board local trains till 7.30 in the morning, between 11 am to 4 pm and between 8 pm till the end of the day. The time between 8 am to 10:30 am and 5 pm to 7.30 pm should be reserved for essential services staff having valid QR coded identity cards, and there should be ladies special trains every hour, the government had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/avoid-politics-over-mumbai-local-trains-anil-deshmukh-to-railways-909143.html

The report, which also gives details of the financial background of candidates, said a total of 20 or 25 per cent of them have declared financial assets worth crores of rupees. While a total of 81 candidates are contesting the elections, the report is based on an analysis of affidavits furnished by 80 of them. Seven or 9 per cent of the candidates have declared serious criminal cases against themselves, while 14 or 18 per cent have declared criminal cases against themselves, the ADR report said. Serious criminal cases are non-bailable offences with over five years of imprisonment. According to the report, one (50 per cent) out of two candidates analysed from Bhartiya Tribal Party, three (38 per cent) out of eight candidates analysed from BJP, two (25 per cent) out of eight candidates analysed from Congress and eight (15 per cent) out of 53 Independent candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits. One (50 per cent) out of two candidates analysed from Bhartiya Tribal Party, two (25 per cent) out of eight candidates analysed from BJP and four (8 per cent) out of 53 Independent candidates have declared serious criminal cases against themselves, the report said. Two (25 per cent) out of eight constituencies are red alert constituencies. Red alert constituencies are those where three or more contesting candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves. "The directions of the Supreme Court have had no effect on the political parties in selection of candidates as they have again followed their old practice of giving tickets to around 18 per cent candidates with criminal cases," the report said. "All major parties contesting in Gujarat bye-elections have given tickets to 25 per cent to 38 per cent candidates who have declared criminal cases against themselves," it said. The Supreme Court had in February asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates with a criminal background and why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected. The details of the financial background of the candidates were also given in the report. "Out of the 80 candidates, 20 (25 per cent) are crorepatis. Eight (100 per cent) out of 8 candidates analysed from BJP, 6 (75 per cent) out of 8 candidates analysed from Congress and 6 (11 per cent) out of 53 Independent candidates have declared assets worth more than Rs 1 crore," the report stated.

A tongue-in-cheek campaign #SarUthakeThuko by another local NGO Samachar Foundation to create awareness against the ills of spitting in public places has won a global bronze from the California-based SVUS Communications under the Covid-19 Business Response Awards.  The NGO highlighted the menace of spitting in public places during the pandemic. From the Prime Minister to the High Court-appointed Mangrove Committee, NatConnect has moved the authorities to check mangrove destruction by Navi Mumbai SEZ, JNPT and the threat to the sea forest from the upcoming Bullet Train project. The campaign helped generate awareness among the people on the need to preserve biodiversity and alert the powers that be. Japanese infra agency JICA that is financing the Bullet Train project has promised NatConnect that it would keep a tight vigil on the environmental compliance. NatConnect’s efforts along with other environmental groups have led to the High Court-appointed Mangrove Committee halting destruction of mangroves and wetlands in Uran. The Environment Minister has even halted fresh construction at Panje wetland following the concerted campaign. “The awards are a great recognition of our team efforts and they give us added strength to pursue with our mission to protect the environment which has been facing destruction under the guise of development,” said B N Kumar, who heads both NatConnect and Samachar Foundation. Expressing his happiness at the Mangrove Committee halting the widespread destruction of mangroves and wetlands by Navi Mumbai SEZ at Pagote and Bhendkhal in Uran, Kumar said that nothing much has been done in terms of correcting the situation. Despite the committee’s direction to preserve Panje wetland, there have been repeated violations there. NatConnect, Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, and Paaramparik Machhimar Kruti Samiti have been campaigning for getting the status of a bird sanctuary to Panje wetland and develop it as a tourism destination to help generate socio-economic activity in the backward region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/global-laurels-for-mangrove-anti-spitting-campaigns-909216.html
