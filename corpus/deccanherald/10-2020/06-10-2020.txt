The only two cities to figure in the first 100 science cities of the world are Bengaluru and Kolkata, and they have just made it. Bengaluru is ranked 97, having dropped from 93 last year, and Kolkata is close behind at 99, but with an improvement from 121 last year. Other cities are far behind. Mumbai went down four places, from 128 to 132, while Delhi dropped from 145 to 163. Pune, which had figured at the 169th place last time, did not make it to the top 200 this year. Beijing tops the list, with New York, Boston, San Francisco and Shanghai coming next in that order. Four other Chinese cities — Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Hefei — have ranked among the top 20, and there are 21 in the first 100.  The rankings are based on the output in selected science journals, patents and other reliable measures of scientific achievement. High research and development (R&D) expenditure, concentration of research facilities and specialist facilities and ability to attract global science talent are other factors. What the rankings have shown is that even the best city in India is behind 96 others that did better. India spends only 0.7% of its GDP on R&D, while China spends 2.1%, and that makes a difference. Whether even the meagre spending is best utilised is also a relevant question. The standards of science education are poor at school, college and university levels. There is not a single science and technology institution which is truly of world standard. The best students often migrate to other countries for study, research or jobs. There is no ecosystem that encourages and nourishes science and gives a boost to scientific talent. It is not realised that the much-touted ‘atmanirbharta’ policy will remain just a slogan and a farce without science and technology supporting it. Those who make the call for self-reliance should realise this.  Progress of science, performance of science students and researchers and scientific achievements call for adherence to a rational value system and demands the cultivation of scientific temperament. An open society where questioning of established truths is encouraged and where there is scope and freedom for new thinking and innovation is ideal for the growth and development of science. The room for this may be shrinking in the country. Even the Indian Science Congress witnesses claims about ancient India’s scientific feats and cow urine therapy is prescribed by ministers for all ailments, including Covid-19. The low ranks and no ranks for the country are therefore no surprise.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/science-ranking-should-ring-alarm-bells-897883.html

Even as cities like Delhi seem to be witnessing a decline in new cases daily, the situation in Karnataka is deteriorating. With 6.47 lakh cases as on October 5, Karnataka now stands third in the country with regard to the total caseload. Besides, it has the largest number of active patients in India. The state currently has 1,15,477 Covid-19 positive persons receiving treatment in hospitals or are in home isolation. Even more worrying is the situation in Bengaluru, which has a total caseload of 2.52 lakh. The city has 54,112 active cases at present. The number of active cases is growing at an increasing rate, even as the recovery rate is said to be declining. In the early months of the pandemic, Bengaluru and Karnataka were among the better performers in the country. Even in late June, Bengaluru was not doing too badly. It was reporting a daily rise of around 300 new cases when Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai were reporting several thousands of new infections per day. However, the situation has changed for the worse in the months since. Karnataka’s daily tally of new cases has been persistently above 10,000 over the past week. How did Karnataka come to this situation? Since the lifting of the lockdowns, authorities as well as the general public have become increasingly lax with regard to taking precautions. Public spaces are being opened up without adequate measures for sanitization or limiting crowding. People are not wearing masks or are wearing them incorrectly. Since many people are asymptomatic or showing mild symptoms, we seem to have been lulled into a false sense of security that is making us careless. Authorities have become negligent, too. The mandatory mask rule is no longer being enforced. Neither are hospitals, which are not setting aside the government-mandated number of beds for Covid-19 patients, being taken to task. Patients are not being subjected to follow-up tests to confirm that they are indeed cured. Such negligence is leaving an ever-widening circle of people vulnerable to infections. While our ministers insist that the state has enough medical oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients, their claims are at odds with the reality on the ground. Doctors are complaining that the shortage of oxygen persists. Multiplexes are expected to open in a week and a decision to open schools and colleges could follow. These decisions could prove disastrous if we continue to take the coronavirus lightly. The economy, entertainment and education sectors may have opened up, but it is too early to lower our guard. The worst is not yet behind us.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/karnataka-can-t-slacken-on-covid-19-precautions-898293.html
06-10-2020||Hubballi-Dharwad||Karnataka BJP not amused by C P Yogeshwar's 'mediation' over Vinay Kulkarni||The BJP high command is not amused by MLC and former minister C P Yogeshwar's 'efforts' to bring Congress leader and Dharwad strongman Vinay Kulkarni into the party fold. Senior leaders in the BJP informed DH that though attempts were made by Kulkarni to meet senior party office bearers, including party national president J P Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, he could not meet them over the last three days. Sources said, Yogeshwar had misused the names of BJP national Secretary B L Santosh and other office-bearers to arrange a meeting with top BJP leaders. However, the leaders were not interested in meeting Kulkarni, whose name is being dragged into the Dharwad ZP member Yogeshgouda Goudar's murder case. While local BJP leaders claimed that he might have tried to join the BJP after being 'neglected' by the Congress after his three defeats (two parliamentary and one assembly election), others claimed that it was last-ditch attempt to save himself from tightening nose in the Yogeshgouda case. 'Not leaving party' Meanwhile, Hubballi-Dhawrad Mahanagara District Congress President Altaf Hallur said, Vinay Kulkarni had no plans of joining the BJP. "Earlier, there were attempts made by local BJP leaders to poach him into the BJP by threatening to drag him in Yogeshgouda's case. Kulkarni did not budge and remained in the party," said Altaf. However, rumours are thick that Vinay has been knocking the doors of the BJP’s national leaders in New Delhi and seeking their permission to join the saffron party. Sources said he was camping in Delhi for the last five days, trying to meet the top leaders of the saffron party. Kulkarni was unavailable for response.   Shettar scotches rumours about Kulkarni Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar on Tuesday dismissed rumours about former Congress minister Vinay Kulkarni joining the BJP. These are all rumours. No BJP leader from the district is in touch with Vinay Kulkarni, Shettar told reporters on the reports of Kulkarni joining the BJP. "I am district in-charge minister. The party leaders, both state and national, have not spoken to me on Vinay joining the BJP. There's no discussion about it at the local level," Shettar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hubballi-dharwad/karnataka-bjp-not-amused-by-c-p-yogeshwars-mediation-over-vinay-kulkarni-898218.html
06-10-2020||In Perspective||Time to allow same-sex marriage||In a recent move, the Delhi High Court was approached for granting marriage rights to LGBTQ+ people. This was opposed by the Central government through Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who remarked that both Indian law and culture do not recognise the concept of same-sex marriages.  There is rich Indian literature on homosexual people and some arguments to show that same-sex marriage is not opposed per se. In fact, the law itself has laid down foundations of such claim by LGBTQ+ people. I shall also explore possible opposition to same-sex marriage and offer a counter. The SG has submitted before the Delhi HC that the law recognises only husband and wife and instantiates with the potential problem in cases of cruelty to wife under Section 498A of the IPC. It is notable that the Special Marriage Act uses the gender and sexual orientation-neutral term, that is, spouse. The Section 498A cases are also registered for couples married under the Special Marriage Act. Hence, the same-sex couple could be allowed to marry under the Special Marriage Act and then all rights and duties be granted to them in a gender and sexual orientation-neutral manner. The arguments of Mehta on tradition also do not hold ground. In this regard, it is important to trace the historical origins of marriage and literature of same-sex people in India. It is noteworthy that the state control of marriage is rather a Victorian phenomenon. Around 13th century, the Church would perform marriages which was later taken over by the state in Europe including the British who carried this to India. Since the British started administering laws in India, they also brought homophobia with them, excluding same-sex people in marriage registration.  It must be noted that in Indian history, homophobia is a recent phenomenon and a product of colonial rule. Prior to colonisation by the British, the queer community was recognised in the society. This evident from the fact that Sanskrit has a pronoun for the third gender and same-sex came to be penalised only during the British Rule. As Ruth Vanita notes, Indian men were often criticised by the British for not being masculine and being coward. Queer people in this regard were seen as even more unmanly. Therefore, in an attempt to ward off such criticism coupled with the ongoing nationalist movement to reclaim Indian superiority over the West in terms of morals and tradition, queer people were pushed to the sideline. They were then abhorred because of such a change. Hence, there has never been religious opposition to queer people. Ruth Vanita has noted some favourable position for the same-sex marriage. As she notes, one Hindu scholar, Pandit Shailendra Shri Sheshnarayan Ji Vaidyaka has opined that Hindu philosophy as such is not opposed to gay people. When he was questioned on same-sex marriage at the 2004 Kumbh Mela by a reporter of Hinduism Today, he said, “Whatever is done in a hidden manner becomes a wrong act and is treated as a sin. Whatever is done openly does invite criticism for some time but ultimately gains acceptance. Why not give them the liberty to live in their own way, if they are going to do it anyway? After all, we have kinnars, eunuchs, who have been accepted by the society. Similarly, these people can also be accepted. Like we have a kinnar-samaj, eunuch society, we can have a gay samaj.” No taboo From this discussion, it is abundantly clear that same-sex couple was neither a taboo nor stigma under Hindu philosophy and possible as well, as discussed by Pandit Vaidyaka. In fact, distortions against queer people are a result of the colonial rule. Interestingly, the United Kingdom which introduced these laws in India, now allows same-sex marriage. Many progressive nations across the globe also allow for same-sex marriage. Some sections of the society also oppose same-sex marriage on the ground that such marriages are not capable of producing children and the only sex permissible in marriage is procreative sex. This opposition, however, is unfounded. Several married couples across religions are not capable of procreation and in that sense, marital intercourse between them cannot be faulted for, on the grounds of only one permissible sex - procreative. In fact, the law freely allows for such marriage. Even inability to reproduce is not a ground for divorce. Also, it is out of deep respect for marriage that same-sex people want to marry. This reasoning has been upheld by the US Supreme Court in the famous case of Obergefell v Hodges, Director, Ohio Department of Health. Hence, it is amply clear that neither the tradition nor the law opposes same-sex marriage. Rather, they provide grounds for same-sex marriage. While this entire topic is debated, it must be borne in mind that constitutional morality must be adopted. Constitutional morality dictates that the state must take steps to be as inclusive as possible. To deny same-sex marriage would be to discriminate queer people on the grounds of sexual orientation which is impermissible in law. Recently, the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar v Union of India held that the state must take steps against discrimination of queer people and steps should be taken to include them within the societal fold to make a more inclusive society. Therefore, same-sex people must be allowed to marry without any prejudice against them.

06-10-2020||In Perspective||What banks can do with rising deposits||People’s deposit works like elixir for banks. Banks utilise the deposits to spread their loan business and invest them for profit while taking various measures to protect the depositors’ money. As Covid-19 has slowed down economies the world over, it has a negative impact on the Indian banking sector also. Many economic activities have dried up, which has squeezed banks’ loan business. According to the RBI, the loans and advances of banks have plummeted to Rs 102 lakh crore vis-à-vis the aggregate bank deposit of around Rs 143 lakh crore in September 2020. The ideal credit-deposit ratio is around 80-90% in a market economy. Credit shrinkage adversely affects the income of banks and the interest income of depositors. The banks’ credit flow has shrunk by Rs 1.48 lakh crore despite RBI reducing repo and bank rates to 4% and 4.25% respectively. When the Indian economy is integrated with the global economy, financial crises are bound to return from time to time as it has happened before. In view of the present financial crisis, the banking sector has to reorganise its loan and investment portfolios for a moderate profit. Despite banks offering low interest rates varying from 2.7% to 5.5% on various deposits, people still prefer to save their money in banks due to income uncertainties. The fixed deposits in banks increased by Rs 4.33 lakh crore in the two months between March 27 and May 22 when the lockdown had brought the economy to a standstill. Indian households saved Rs 15.62 lakh crore in 2019-20, compared to Rs 13.73 lakh crore in 2018-19. Among the various deposit schemes, the zero percent interest on Current Account deposits and 2.7-3% interest on Savings Accounts (the CASA deposits) are like gold mines for the banks; they give banks enough room to invest for profit. A dedicated survey of potential in different economic sectors would prevent banks from credit overflow or low credit flow. In Covid-19 time, banks can explore new areas to lend to and adopt development banking to nurture the credit absorption capacity of different sectors. For example, there are about five million artisans in India who add high value to their products. Banks can form ‘artisan clubs’ to improve the credit absorption capacity in the handicraft sector. The artisan club would be a small group of artisans promoted by a bank branch for its own benefit. The club would help banks explore potential new areas to channel credit into; it would help banks in the recovery drive and identify quality borrowers. The bank in coordination with the club, would invite marketing experts, designers, IT professionals, exporters and senior artisans who can guide the village artisans in innovating new products and in marketing them. Similarly, ‘farmers clubs’ among villagers can improve the performance of agriculture, fishery, horticulture, organic farming, zero budget natural farming, tourism and tap the huge potential of the unorganised sector. Banks can explore the vibrant but unorganised eatables sector where people have a steady income. More than credit, the majority of the illiterate and semi-literate small entrepreneurs need proper guidance from bankers, good governance and safety to increase their incomes. The risk involved in lending big loans to corporations continues to haunt banks which are under pressure to lend and at the same time have to comply with a maze of regulations. How to distinguish good corporates from the unscrupulous and wilful defaulters is the biggest challenge before the banking sector, which holds 70% share of the Indian financial sector. The two new farm laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Farmers Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act are likely to attract private investment into both farm and non-farm sectors, particularly in the area of food processing, in the cultivation of cash crops, in the supply chain and in various agriculture-allied activities like fishery, horticulture, organic farming, drip irrigation, cold chains, godowns, waterways and small farm activities, etc. With improved governance, banks can reap the benefit when private players enter the agriculture sector. The coronavirus crisis has given banks idle time to finetune their housekeeping skills, meet the training needs of staff, focus on research and innovation, improve cybersecurity and adopt new information technology, etc. In the banking sector, the majority of staff above 55 years are not computer savvy. In the core banking environment, top bankers should be equipped with a daily updated Management Information System (MIS) and should be in a position to tell the NPA status and project credit potential of economic sectors instantly. Bankers should have advanced computer knowledge to monitor loan and investment activities in an efficient manner. The pandemic-related crisis has created educated unemployment which can lead to cyber frauds and documentation fraud. Every bank should have a fraud detection team to nip fraud attempts in the bud. The crisis has also brought more savings to banks than in several years before it. Now, it is the responsibility of the banks to protect the depositors’ interest and at the same time to make the best use of people’s savings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/what-banks-can-do-with-rising-deposits-898294.html

However, the three accused abandoned the boar and fled the spot after seeing forest department personnel. As there were complaints that the farmers, in an effort to protect their crops from wild animals, have been erecting solar fencing around their land, the department personnel were patrolling the villages, at the fringes of the forest. They found three people carrying a big sack. The trio escaped abandoning the bag and the two-wheeler, upon seeing the personnel.

06-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||Now, BJP ST Morcha chief Tipparaju Hawaldar demands fresh caste census||BJP State ST Morcha president Tipparaju Hawaldar has contradicted the party’s official stand on the release of the caste-based census, a survey conducted by the previous Congress government, and demanded a fresh census to know the caste-wise population in the state accurately. Speaking to media persons at the party office here on Tuesday, he said, he would urge the State government to conduct a caste census afresh as the previous one conducted by the Congress government was not accurate and already 5-6 years old. Based on the caste census the government can provide better facilities to the downtrodden communities, he said. Officially BJP has been opposing the caste-based-census stating that such a census will divide the society. Congress government led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had conducted the survey at an estimated cost of Rs 140 crore. The report has not yet been tabled before the assembly, while selective ‘leaks’ of the report being circulated. Hawaldar said that he would speak to Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa in this regard and ask him to consider for fresh socio-economic and education survey. He also expressed confidence that the State government would implement the Union government’s 7.5% reservation to the members of the ST communities. “Being the backbone of the BJP, we are hopeful that the government will cede to our demands. Elected representatives and religious heads of the community are exerting pressure on the government in this regard,” he said. “There are no objections among the members of the community in including Kurubas and Gangamastharu community in ST category. However, the reservation should be increased according to caste population,” he said. Replying to a question regarding Dalit’s anger aginst BJP over the Hathras rape in Uttar Pradesh, Hawaldar said, "Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already handed over the case to the CBI and suspended four top police officials. Strict action will be taken against the accusers and none will be spared."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/now-bjp-st-morcha-chief-tipparaju-hawaldar-demands-fresh-caste-census-898232.html
06-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Shivakumar's brother disputes CBI claim on cash recovery during searches||Karnataka Congress President D K Shivakumar's brother and MP from Bengaluru Rural D K Suresh on Tuesday claimed that the CBI has accounted for only Rs 6.78 lakh cash seized at their premises, though it said Rs 57 lakh was recovered during the searches. In a series of tweets, he sought a clarification from the CBI on the remaining Rs 50.22 lakhs. The investigating agency had on Monday claimed that the searches at the premises of Shivakumar and others led to the recovery of cash of Rs 57 lakh and several incriminating documents including property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk. The CBI has registered a case against Shivakumar for allegedly amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 74.93 crore. "I also would like to clarify that the CBI has accounted for a total cash of Rs 6.78 lakhs between my brother's and my premises," Suresh tweeted. He said, "In my Delhi residence cash Rs 1.57 lakh, my brother's residence in Bengaluru cash Rs 1.71 Lakh, his home office in Bengaluru cash Rs 3.5 lakh was accounted for. No cash was accounted for in my brother's Delhi residence nor in my residence in Bengaluru." Pointing out that CBI has declared cash Rs 57 lakh was seized during the searches Suresh sought clarification with regard to balance Rs 50.22 lakhs "this amount was not found and accounted for in our premises". Shivakumar too on Monday disputing the CBI's claim of Rs 57 lakh recovery, had said, "I have panchnama with me.... How will I know if something has been recovered from houses not related to me? I'm answerable to what is in my house." The central agency on Monday conducted searches at 14 locations linked to Shivakumar, including Karnataka, Delhi and Mumbai, in connection with the allegations of possession of disproportionate assets. Further stating that Jewellery and ornaments assessed by the IT and ED earlier were re-assessed by CBI, Suresh said the CBI officials have collected all the documents submitted to IT and ED officials. Suresh also complimented the CBI officials for their professional conduct during the search at his premises and that of his brother on Monday "without any harassment." "We will continue to cooperate in every way possible with all authorities to clear our names. We will come out of this with your blessings and good wishes," he added. Shivakumar on Monday had termed searches conducted by CBI on properties linked to him at 14 places as "politically motivated" and said he would not bow down to "conspiracies or pressure tactics to shut him up". He was earlier arrested on September 23 last year by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the money laundering case and was lodged in the Tihar jail under judicial custody. The Congress leader was released from the jail on October 23 after the Delhi High Court granted him bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/shivakumars-brother-disputes-cbi-claim-on-cash-recovery-during-searches-898126.html
06-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka bypolls: JD(S) to field late MLA Sathyanarayana’s wife in Sira||JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda on Tuesday said his party decided to field Ammajamma as the candidate for the November 3 bypoll to Sira, which was represented by her husband B Sathyanarayana until his recent death. By fielding Ammajamma, the JD(S) is said to be banking on a sympathy wave to retain Sira, which Sathyanarayana won in the 2018 assembly polls. Sathyanarayana passed away on August 4 after a prolonged battle with advanced chronic liver disease. Gowda, who was speaking to reporters at the party’s headquarters, said three candidates were in the reckoning for the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll ticket. “A meeting will be held on October 8 to finalise the candidate,” he said. Sira has witnessed a direct fight between the JD(S) and the Congress. With Sathyanarayana as its candidate, the JD(S) won Sira twice in the last four elections - 2004 and 2018 - whereas the Congress won in 2008 and 2013 with former minister TB Jayachandra as its candidate. The Congress has already announced Jayachandra as its candidate. JD(S) legislature party leader HD Kumaraswamy has been making emotional appeals with the people of Sira. “Decide whether you want to give me milk or venom,” he said at a rally recently. Speculation is rife that the BJP will field radiologist Dr CM Rajesh Gowda, the son of former Congress Lok Sabha member CP Mudalagiriyappa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-bypolls-jds-to-field-late-mla-sathyanarayana-s-wife-in-sira-898225.html
06-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka bypolls: Congress banks on Kusuma Hanumantharayappa to retain RR Nagar||The Congress is almost certain to field Kusuma Hanumantharayappa as its candidate for the Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypoll. “It’s mostly Kusuma,” Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah said in Mysuru when asked about the Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypoll candidate. An official announcement is awaited from the party’s high command. The Congress is banking on Kusuma, 31, to win and the party’s poll managers say her candidature might swing the November 3 election. Kusuma was the wife of IAS officer DK Ravi, who died in March 2015. According to the Congress poll managers, Rajarajeshwari Nagar has some 4.8 lakh voters of whom one lakh are Vokkaligas, 70,000 Dalits, 70,000 OBCs, 50,000 Kurubas, 45,000 Lingayats and 25,000 Muslims. With Munirathna as its candidate, the Congress won Rajarajeshwari Nagar in 2018. Last year, however, Munirathna was disqualified and he later joined the BJP, necessitating this bypoll. “With Kusuma as the candidate, the Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypoll will be a photo finish,” a senior Congress leader said. “That it is a woman, she’s a Vokkaliga and her father Hanumantharayappa being an old-timer in the constituency will be enough to give the BJP a run for its money. We hope to consolidate the Vokkaligas and the Muslims will not vote for the lotus anyway,” the leader said. The Congress is also hoping that Bangalore Rural MP DK Suresh will use his personal clout to draw voters towards the party. Suresh has declared that he will be the face of the party in Rajarajeshwari Nagar , an assembly segment that falls under his Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha constituency. Kusuma’s father Hanumantharayappa unsuccessfully contested the 2008 election to Rajarajeshwari Nagar on a JD(S) ticket. “It depends on what Hanumantharayappa will do in attracting the support of the JD(S) at the local level for the bypoll, given that he was earlier with them. Otherwise, there’s no formal political understanding that we have with the JD(S),” the leader said. Kusuma holds an MS degree in information technology from the University of Massachusetts, Boston. She is currently an assistant professor of computer science engineering at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-bypolls-congress-banks-on-kusuma-hanumantharayappa-to-retain-rr-nagar-898235.html
06-10-2020||Main Article||Hathras case manifests the deep rot of a lawless state||The overwhelming feeling that comes to mind about the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh administration has handled the alleged rape and barbaric murder of a Dalit girl by her upper caste neighbours in Hathras, and the way the ruling party has responded to the unfolding sordid events, is like that of an occupation force that is at war with the people of India. Long lost are ideas of decency, fairness and at least the modicum of, at least the pretense of, adhering to the rule book and norms that are accepted and understood by all sides in a nation that got its freedom way back in 1947. We are in a different territory here. This is a new kind of administrative species, not exactly an occupying power but in some cases worse, that invents its own rules, that can be trusted to hit at the victims and perpetuate an atmosphere of fear and control to silence anyone who asks questions. This is the continuing slide in governance of the nation and a continued decimation, indeed eradication, of the very idea of democracy from a nation that had for long remained the lone hope of democracy in the developing world. If there was a democracy meter, we have long fallen below where we were during the Emergency. If there was a governance meter, we have long fallen below some of the nations that are known as banana republics. The facts of the Hathras case are too horrific to recount. Note that the unpardonable acts of UP police are happening under the direct command of the state’s Home Minister, who is also the state’s saffron-clad Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath. This is a CM who told a TV channel soon after the rituals for the Ram temple in Ayodhya: “My duty is to provide security to the 24-crore people of the state. It is my duty and my religion. And my religion says that evil should be destroyed and good should be promoted…” He clearly likes to take charge and direct operations. It is the same TV channel that has now been compelled to ask the government how the telephone conversation of its journalist covering the Hathras case was tapped into and then leaked in an attempt to malign and undermine the heroic efforts of the journalist in covering the case against all odds. What this reveals is the preponderance of illegal activity that is being run straight and direct from important centres of power in India, where sans any legal framework, the people in power are taking arbitrary decisions to arm themselves to fight political battles, to malign anyone standing up to them and spreading hatred and fear among the ordinary citizens of India. This is the same telltale signature of the crime that we can see in part in the case of Sushant Singh Rajput, where WhatsApp conversations were leaked to select channels and every attempt was made to sell a particular version of a story by political operators who often twisted what actually happened in the case. The nation continues to suffer from horrific crimes against the weak, the downtrodden, the backwards and the Dalits. As it is, UP leads the nation in crime, though the numbers by themselves do not tell us the full story. This takes an uglier turn when we have a government that acts like in a Hollywood Western, gun on the hip, ready to shoot and even take pride in that crime. The number of encounters seen in UP is a cause for alarm. An independent investigation into those who were targeted, killed and reportedly their houses demolished, equally illegally, will tell us a very different story from what the government might wish us to believe. It is beyond doubt that the illegal killings we see in UP are usually against the members of the weakest sections of society. How can the weaker communities feel safe under such a regime? How is it ever possible for a Yogi Adityanath to control crime when the big picture itself is of lawlessness by the State? The answer, of course, is even more lawlessness, in a downward spiral that will mean more violence, more friction, more deaths in the name of fighting “evil”. Indications are already there. Consider the culture that allows the general secretary of the BJP, Kailash Vijayvargiya, saying this: “Vehicles can overturn anytime in Yogi Adityanath’s state”. He was, of course, referring to the encounter killing of the gangster Vikas Dubey in July at the hands of the UP police. The brazenness of that incident that raises questions of a killing in custody, and the citing of that brazenness to set the stage for more crime, tells us about the depths we have fallen to. When it comes to handling the administrative machinery of the state, anystate, there is only one rule, one law and one method, and it is called due process. Anything that violates due process promotes crime. Anything that follows due process holds the administration to account for its actions. The police will dare not ever cremate the body of a rape victim, her family locked up in their home, not able to stand by and perform the last rites, a tortured victim on the pyre like a discarded, unwanted body, if it is given a clear message that the rule of the law is to be followed, that due process matters and that any violation will mean that they will have hell to pay. Such liberties are only taken when the team feels it can get away and maybe even get rewarded by pleasing one or the other boss. We must act against the police on the ground. But we must hold the leadership to account. What has happened in Hathras is a terrible and ugly reminder of the wages we will have to pay when we have a lawless administration running riot on its “evil”-cleansing drive. The Hathras case is only the latest and a cruel reminder to the people of India about where “evil” actually resides.

06-10-2020||Main Article||The face of UP Police||Nothing much appears to have changed after the criminal laws were made more stringent to deal with crimes against women in the aftermath of the Nirbhaya incident. Nearly eight years later, one more precious life has been snuffed out by the predatory behaviour of yet another pack of males in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. First, the local police dubbed the 19-year old girl’s story “a drama” and refused to file an FIR. Then, the local administration labelled media reports of her family’s clamour for justice “fake news.” More recently, a senior police officer waved in front of the media, parts of a forensic report based on samples collected two weeks after the brutal incident, claiming that the girl was not sexually assaulted at all. This, despite her recording a statement about the fact of gangrape before a judicial magistrate, shortly before she died. The forcible cremation of the mortal remains, in the dead of night, denied the grieving family a last glimpse of “India”—the  identity given her by Supreme Court Senior Advocate Menaka Guruswamy in a recently published scathing op-ed. Then, the cordoning off of the village where she lived, in the name of safeguarding law and order, made the UP Police’s motto – “surakhsa aap ki, sankalp hamara” (your safety, our commitment) -- sound deafeningly deceptive. Meanwhile, the local police are tight-lipped about the whereabouts of the four suspects who were arrested, albeit belatedly. In April 2019, we got first-hand knowledge of the ‘law-abiding’ profile of the UP Police administration when we tried to ascertain their compliance with a decade-old law Parliament had enacted to regulate the power of the police to arrest crime suspects. Since 2010, every district Police Control Room (PCR) in the country is duty-bound under Section 41C of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, to publish on its noticeboard details of every person arrested, within 24 hours. Every state Police Headquarters (PHQ) is also mandated to make this information accessible to the general public in the form of a database. Kerala Police were the first to implement this law. A few other states comply with this requirement. UP is not one of them. We pursued UP Police twice -- first in 2012, and then in 2018 -- through RTI applications, seeking information about action taken to implement this law. In 2018, we escalated the matter to the UP Information Commission by filing an appeal against non-disclosure. Several months later, after receiving notice of a hearing in this case, we went on a whistle-stop tour of western, southern and central UP. We visited a PCR and one police station each at the district headquarters, to record an eyewitness account of statutory compliance. Hathras was part of our tour itinerary. We found only two officers manning the PCR. Other officers had been deputed for election duty. Surprisingly, the PCR had preserved a copy of our RTI application transferred by the state PHQ, along with a reply that no information relating to compliance with Section 41C, CrPC, was available in their custody. The noticeboard meant for displaying details of arrestees was blank. Nobody had been arrested during the last 24 hours, we were told. We were advised to enquire with the police stations (PS) concerned whose personnel effected all arrests. Details would be on their noticeboards, we were assured. So, we visited Kotwali Sadar PS in Hathras. Most of the personnel were on election duty here as well. A head constable who was manning the police station was not aware of any such noticeboard. Nor could we spot one. “I have been recently posted here,” was his excuse. He was more interested in inquiring about our caste identity. We claimed none. The compliance status was no different in most other places. Of the 12 districts we visited, arrestee data was published on the noticeboards of Agra, Kanpur and Etawah PCRs only. The Operations Commander of the PCR at Lucknow -- UP’s capital city -- had not even heard of this transparency requirement. We submitted our findings in writing to the Information Commission, seeking issuance of binding directions to UP Police to start publishing details of all arrestees as per Section 41C, CrPC. Eight months later, the State Chief Information Commissioner closed the case ruling that all information had already been provided and advised us to approach the concerned PS if we wanted arrestee-specific information. We had never sought such information in the first place! A similar exercise in neighbouring Uttarakhand yielded positive results. The state police initiated action to comply with Section 41C, CrPC, soon after we submitted the RTI application. The Uttarakhand Information Commission appreciated the gravitas of the matter when we moved them over non-compliance. The commission issued a binding direction to the police, recognising that transparency was an important safeguard against the abuse of their powers to arrest people. Meanwhile, UP has turned a Nelson’s eye to such accountability-enforcing provisions, repeatedly. Successive state governments have claimed that they wanted to make Uttar Pradesh, “Uttam Pradesh”. Meanwhile, the rule of law has taken beating after beating, be it attacks on Dalits and religious minorities or the numerous incidents of crimes against women or the gunning down of crime suspects without bringing them to justice -- the most notorious incidents being the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey and his accomplices three months ago. Misgovernance with impunity smothers justice and breeds trust deficit. Interestingly, in every UP police station we visited, we saw duty officers perched on a platform higher than the ground level where visitors stand to make inquiries or register their complaints -- an architectural iteration of unequal power relations between the police and the policed. Moreover, several police stations have a Hindu temple functioning within the compound, complete with a priest performing aarti twice daily. The police’s claims of unbiased performance of public duties becomes highly suspect under such circumstances. The path to justice for Dalits and other marginalised communities is not even paved with noble intentions. Meanwhile, the Karnataka Police are yet to pull up their socks to make arrestee data transparent in the manner required by Section 41C, CrPC.

06-10-2020||Mysuru||For the mentally ill, this sanctuary in Mysuru provides a family||More than 100 people suffering from mental illnesses and shunned by society have got a new lease of life at a sanctuary, where a team of psychiatrists and psychologists not only treat them, but also help in successfully reintegrating them into society.  Chittadhama at Shanthipura, a village located about 4 km from HD Kote, is a rehabilitation and residential centre for homeless people with mental illnesses. The residents here are not drugged or locked up but are treated as equals of caregivers.  A long and systematic procedure is followed to rehabilitate them by engaging them in various activities. For a visitor, the cleanliness of the place brimming with activities, from cleaning and cooking to agriculture, Chittadhama feels more like an ashram.  The organisation is the brainchild of Dr T Murali, professor of psychiatry, MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital. Murali, along with Dr B R Ravi Shankar Rao, the present chairman, and another psychiatrist Dr Swaminath G brought together a team of people to form the Chittaprakasha Charitable Trust. Chittadhama got a form in 2010 when the Infosys Foundation built a 7,500 square foot building. "We don’t use the word 'patient' for our residents. Most of them are picked up from the streets and come to us after a court orders medical care. Some can’t even give us their names or place of origin,” Rao said.  Mahadeva Swamy, the administrator of the facility, chose to show the prizes won by the residents in sports competitions, before speaking about their condition. "The people are brought here in a disoriented state often with nothing but a few fragments of memory. Instead of looking at how unkempt they are, we see the years of rejection and suffering they have endured. Empathy and patience are two things that work faster than any medicine,” he said. After a week's observation and medical and psychological investigation, most of them become part of the residents. “While the doctors provide medicines, we help them realise their potential. It starts with trusting them to clean themselves and their room and then entrusting other activities,” he said.  Instead of isolation wards, the male and female residents in Chittadhama live in separate dormitories. From prayers in the morning to the work on the farm to grow their own food, focussed efforts are made to ensure all the residents feel part of a community. People more accepting now  Some of them show exceptional skills in agriculture, dairy farming, and even cricket, Dr Swaminath said. “It's satisfying to see a person climbing out of a crisis and evolve. The larger society’s attitude to Chittadhama has changed. Recently, teams across HD Kote are playing cricket with us and the Chittadhama residents have won,” he said. Of the 108 people brought to the sanctuary over the last 10 years, 48 have gone back to society. Some even got married and are living a normal life. The trust is now organising camps to spread awareness on mental health and provides free medicines to over 100 people every month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/for-the-mentally-ill-this-sanctuary-in-mysuru-provides-a-family-897874.html
06-10-2020||National||Women from disadvantaged social groups at greater risk of gender-based violence: UN in India||The UN in India Monday voiced concern over the “continuing cases of sexual violence against women and girls” in the country and said the rape and murder cases in Hathras and Balrampur remind that disadvantaged social groups are at a greater risk of gender-based violence. The External Affairs Ministry reacted strongly to the statement, saying the UN Resident Coordinator in India should be aware that these cases have been taken extremely seriously by the government and asserted that any unnecessary comments by an external agency are best avoided since the investigation process is still underway. In a statement, UN Resident Coordinator in India Renata Dessallien said it is essential that authorities ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice speedily and families are empowered to seek timely justice, social support, counselling, healthcare and rehabilitation. "The UN in India is profoundly saddened and concerned at the continuing cases of sexual violence against women and girls in India,” it said. “The recent cases of alleged rape and murder in Hathras and Balarampur are another reminder that despite the impressive progress made on a number of social indicators, women and girls from disadvantaged social groups face additional vulnerabilities and are at greater risk of gender-based violence," it added. The steps being taken by the Indian government to strengthen safety measures for women and girls are welcome and urgent, the United Nations said. "We support the Prime Minister's call for strict action against the culprits. Entrenched social norms and behaviour of men and boys that lead to gender-based violence must be addressed," it said. "The UN stands committed to providing continued support to the government and civil society to address violence against women. As we fight the challenge of COVID-19 with the determination to build back better India, building respectful relationships devoid of prejudices and gender biases is a top priority," it added. In response to the statement, MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said such incidents have been taken extremely seriously by the government. "Some unwarranted comments have been made by the UN Resident Coordinator regarding some recent cases of violence against women. UN Resident Coordinator in India should be aware that these cases have been taken extremely seriously by the government," Srivastava said in a statement. "Since the investigation process is still underway, any unnecessary comments by an external agency are best avoided. The Constitution guarantees equality to all citizens of India. As a democracy we have a time-tested record of providing justice to all sections of our society,” he said. The recent case of violence and sexual assault of a Dalit woman in Hathras has led to nation-wide protests and agitations. A 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. She was admitted to Aligarh Muslim University's Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital and later shifted to a Delhi hospital last Monday in an extremely critical condition with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She breathed her last on Tuesday. Her body was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging that the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. In Uttar Pradesh's Balrampur district, a 22-year-old Dalit woman died after allegedly being raped by two men. The victim''s mother has alleged that that the rapists broke the legs and back of her daughter, a charge denied by the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/women-from-disadvantaged-social-groups-at-greater-risk-of-gender-based-violence-un-in-india-897846.html

"The two leaders agreed to continue and advance bilateral cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus with emphasis on technological cooperation and tests," Israeli PM's official twitter handle said. India and Israel have been cooperating in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic with a high-level delegation from Israel carrying out trials on a rapid testing kit in India. Sources here said that the two countries will also be cooperating on the mass production of the vaccine against the coronavirus as and when time comes. "The two (leaders) also agreed to hold a digital conference on innovation in the field of solar energy in order to jointly achieve more inexpensive solutions that will benefit the economies of both countries and the entire world," Israeli PM's office tweeted. Informed sources told PTI that Israel is likely to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) soon, a global initiative launched by Prime Minister Modi. It was the fourth telephonic conversation between the two leaders since the outbreak of the pandemic. India sent a "much-needed" consignment of medicines at Israel's request which was reciprocated by Israel when it sent a consignment of ventilators to Delhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/netanyahu-speaks-to-modi-emphasises-on-continued-cooperation-in-fight-against-covid-19-897852.html
06-10-2020||National||Centre's sop fails to end GST deadlock||The GST Council on Monday failed to reach a consensus on the compensation issue, with 10 non-BJP-ruled states demanding that the full amount be paid this year and the Centre alone raise money for that. This despite the Centre agreeing to increase the compensation amount the states need to borrow and Council approving the extension of cess levy beyond 2022 to pay for states’ shortfall. Some of the states even reminded Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman not to take them “for granted”. Amid the stand-off, the issue was postponed to the next meeting on October 12. But the minister said the compensation cess of Rs 20,000 crore collected this year will be disbursed tonight. “I was reminded I can’t take anybody for granted. I don’t take anyone for granted. I am open to more talks,” Sitharaman said. Karnataka, Goa and Assam said that states which have given their preferences, should be allowed to borrow. The total shortfall in collection of GST is estimated at Rs 2.35 lakh crore. But the Centre has divided the amount between Covid and non-Covid shortfall and arrived at a decision that only Rs 97,000 crore is on account of non-Covid losses to states, which it said it would completely refund. The amount was raised to Rs 1.10 lakh crore on Monday. The cess amount due to Karnataka is over Rs 13,000 crore. The compensation cess issue is expected to snowball into a major debate with elections due in three crucial non-BJP ruled states of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala in May next year. These three have been vehemently opposing the proposed borrowing formula. Major decisions were, from January 2021, taxpayers with turnover of less than Rs 5 crore will not be required to file monthly returns and satellite launches of ISRO and Antrix are exempted from GST.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centres-sop-fails-to-end-gst-deadlock-897858.html
06-10-2020||National||Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai saw more murders than Mumbai in 2019, says NCRB report||Dubbed the country's underworld capital and the most populous city, one may think Mumbai's underbelly accounts for the highest number of murders in the country. But statistics on crime in metros say otherwise: the country capital Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai surpass the western metropolis in murders. Altogether, 19 metros with a population of over 20 lakh recorded 2,022 murders last year compared to 1,939 in 2018 and 1,976 in 2017. Delhi topped the list with 505 murder cases in 2019 followed by Bengaluru (204) and Chennai (172) while Mumbai was placed fourth with 168 cases. Only four of these cities had more than 100 murder cases. The four metros alone accounted for 52.4% of the total murders reported in the 19 metros. Among the cities, Mumbai has a population of 1.85 crore people followed by Delhi (1.63 crore), Chennai (86.96 lakh) and Bengaluru (84.99 lakh), according to the Census 2011. The latest Crime in India 2019 report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that seven out of the 19 metros showed a decline in murder cases while the rest either witnessed a rise in such incidents or had the same number as in 2018. Bengaluru was the only metro among the big four that registered a dip in murder cases last year compared to 2018. For the past two years, Bengaluru has seen a decline in murder cases from 235 in 2017 and 218 in 2018. Delhi, however, saw a sharp rise from 400 in 2017 and 416 in 2018. For Chennai, the rise was from 154 in 2017 and 172 the next year. Mumbai too saw a rise from 127 in 2017 and 164 in 2018. When it comes to motive, personal vendetta topped the list for Bengaluru with 106 murders while 42 murders were due to petty quarrel. For the other three cities, disputes were the main cause for murders —Delhi 125, Chennai 90 and Mumbai 84. In Bengaluru, 60 murders took place due to dispute, including petty quarrels. In Delhi, 78 cases were due to personal vendetta while it was 45 for Chennai and 13 for Mumbai. Illicit relationship led to 13 murders in Bengaluru while three were due to love affairs. Chennai has the highest number of 28 murders due to illicit relations while Delhi was a close second with 26 such cases. Among the victims in Bengaluru, eight were below the age of six years while three each were between 6-12 years and 12-16 years. Four others in the age group of 16-18 years were also killed last year in Bengaluru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-bengaluru-chennai-saw-more-murders-than-mumbai-in-2019-says-ncrb-report-897891.html

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by the prime minister, approved the names, the sources said. As per the RBI Act, the three new members would have four-year terms. The RBI had postponed the last meeting of the MPC, which must have a quorum of four, as the appointment of independent members was delayed. "The meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) during September 29, 30 and October 1, 2020 is being rescheduled. The dates of the MPC's meeting will be announced shortly," the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had said in a statement on September 28. The government moved the interest rate setting role from the RBI Governor to the six-member MPC in 2016. Half of the panel, headed by the RBI governor, is made up of external independent members. Bhide is senior advisor at the National Council for Applied Economic Research, while Goyal is a professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. Varma is professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The new members replace Chetan Ghate, professor at the Indian Statistical Institute; Pami Dua, director at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE); and Ravindra Dholakia, professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. As per the RBI Act, the external members can hold office for a period of four years and are not eligible for re-appointment. The other ex-officio members of the MPC are Reserve Bank Governor, Deputy Governor (in-charge of monetary policy) and one RBI officer to be appointed by the central board. The MPC has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2021, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and a lower tolerance of 2 per cent. The external members of the MPC are appointed by the central government from amongst persons of ability, integrity and standing, having knowledge and experience in the field of economics, banking, finance or monetary policy. The last meeting of the MPC was held from August 4 to 6, 2020. It was the 24th meeting of the rating-setting panel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ashima-goyal-jayanth-r-varma-shashanka-bhide-appointed-as-rbis-monetary-policy-committee-members-897899.html

The city-based drugmaker said in a press release that this will be a multi-centre and randomised controlled study, which will include safety and immunogenicity study. Earlier in September 2020, Dr Reddy's and RDIF entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine and its distribution in India. As part of the partnership, RDIF shall supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy's upon regulatory approval in India. G V Prasad, Co-chairman and Managing Director, Dr Reddy, said, "This is a significant development that allows us to commence the clinical trial in India and we are committed to bringing in a safe and efficacious vaccine to combat the pandemic." Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said, "We are pleased to collaborate with the Indian regulators and in addition to Indian clinical trial data, we will provide safety and immunogenicity study from the Russian phase 3 clinical trial. This data will further strengthen the clinical development of Sputnik V vaccine in India." On August 11, 2020, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the worlds first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the human adenoviral vectors platform. Sputnik V is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials in Russia and the proposed number of subjects is 40,000. Additionally, the Phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine commenced in the UAE last week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dr-reddys-gets-dcgi-nod-to-conduct-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-phase-2/3-human-trails-897906.html

Speaker, Rameshwar Sharma, who was appointed on July 2, said 22 former MLAs ceased to be members of the Assembly when their resignations were accepted by the erstwhile Speaker on March 10. He maintained the disqualification petitions against them were filed on March 10 and 15. The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh could not continue and the Chief Minister Kamal Nath had to put in his papers on March 20, 2020, after resignations of 22 Congress MLAs, owing allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia. He said the decision was communicated to Congress party leaders on July 30. "The delay in communicating the decision was because of the reason that the erstwhile Speaker was also appointed as a minister and the Legislative Assembly was not functioning to its full strength due to widespread Covid-19 virus and was even closed for some time to contain the virus," the Speaker said. Notably, the decision of dismissing the disqualification petitions filed by Congress MLAs Govind Singh and Lakhan Singh Yadav was taken by the Protem Speaker on the ground that resignations of 22 MLAs were accepted on March 10 and 15 by the then Speaker. The present Speaker was responding to a petition filed by Congress party's Jabalpur North MLA from Vinay Saxena, who contended that such MLAs can't be allowed to get appointed and remain as a minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government during the pendency of their disqualification proceedings.  He claimed during the pendency of disqualification petitions, 12 out of 22 MLAs have been appointed as ministers on July 2. They said even Jagdish Deora, who was earlier acting as the Assembly Speaker, has been appointed as a minister. In his reply, the Speaker said the contention made by Saxena that the disqualification petitions of 22 MLAs was intentionally not decided was "completely incorrect, baseless and erroneous." Saxena claimed the disqualification petitions should have been decided within three months as held by the top court in the Keisham Meghachandra Singh Vs Manipur Assembly Speaker (2020). A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian is scheduled to take up on Tuesday the writ petition by Saxena who, the Speaker claimed, did not have any locus standi as he neither had filed the disqualification petitions nor was there any violation of his fundamental rights. Now, Saxena has filed an application seeking a stay on June 12 order, saying it has been passed by Protem Speaker which was against the spirit of the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) and suffered from "mala fides, perversity, and grave violation of constitutional mandate and principles of natural justice". "The entire purpose was to frustrate the disqualification proceedings and safeguard the ex-MLAs who have now joined the ruling party’s fold and acting as ministers in the government," his plea stated. He contended when notice on disqualification petitions was issued on March 13 and 17, the pleas could not have been dismissed on the ground their resignations were accepted on March 10, their date of resignations. He also sought a direction to restrain former MLAs from acting as ministers during the pendency of the matter. A petition filed by advocate Aradhana Bhargava through advocate Vipin Nair is also coming up for consideration on Tuesday wherein she questioned the appointment of 14 former Congress MLAs as ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/madhya-pradesh-protem-speaker-dismissed-disqualification-pleas-of-rebel-congress-mlas-sc-told-897918.html
06-10-2020||National||US, Australia, India, Japan to discuss China's growing power||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, said they will lead a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific" aimed at countering China's growing assertiveness, a main issue they will discuss on Tuesday with the top envoys from Australia and India. The first in-person talks among the foreign ministers since the coronavirus pandemic began also brings together Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. Motegi, opening his working lunch with Pompeo ahead of the so-called Quad talks, said, “I hope Japan and the US will lead the international society to achieve the Free and Open Indo-Pacific." He also said the Japan-US alliance continues to be “the cornerstone of peace and stability in the region” under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga who took office on September 16, vowing to carry on his predecessor Shinzo Abe's hawkish security and diplomatic stance. Pompeo welcomed Suga's recent description of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific as the foundation of regional peace and stability and that “I could not agree him more.” On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate. Japanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China's growing assertiveness and influence. The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he cancelled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19. The president was released on Monday and returned to the White House. The talks follow a recent flareup in tensions between China and India over their border issue. Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months. Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China's claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China's growing military activity to be a security threat. Japan's annual defence policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarised manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea's key fisheries and waterways. Suga, who had been chief Cabinet secretary under Abe, will make his in-person diplomatic debut as prime minister when he meets the Quad ministers. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP. “The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga told Japanese media on Monday. He said he will pursue diplomacy that is based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP,” while establishing stable relations with neighbours including China and Russia. He said he also plans to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month. Japan sees the FOIP as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation. Suga has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan's main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, analysts say. Japan hopes to regularize the Quad foreign ministers' talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries. But each Quad member has its own political stance toward China and it would be difficult to agree on concrete steps even though they share perception of China as a common threat, analysts say.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-chinas-growing-power-897937.html

In an affidavit in a PIL filed by Satyama Dubey, the state government submitted that it has already recommended a probe by a central agency to "obviate hindrance created by certain vested interests in fair and impartial investigation." "This will ensure that no vested interests will be able to create a fake and false narrative with oblique motives," the state government said. The top court is scheduled to take up the matter for hearing on Tuesday. The state government said since the issue has been raised to be a subject of national concern by media and political parties, it is important that the investigation is carried out by a central agency, which is not within the administrative control of the state government. It also maintained that the Uttar Pradesh immediately registered the FIR after the incident on September 14 and subsequently arrested the four accused and added stringent provisions on the basis of revised statement of the victim on September 22. It also cited medial report of the treatment of the girl at JLN Medical College Aligarh as well as FSL report to contend that there was no prima facie finding of rape. The state government also claimed during the treatment of the girl at Safdarjung hospital here, the medico legal records stated that the victim sustained neck injuries and there was no active bleeding present in nose, mouth and ear, nor there was any other injury on the body. It defended its decision to cremate the body of the victim, who died on September 29 in Delhi after 15 days treatment, saying "the extraordinary circumstances and sequence of unlawful incidents forced the district administration to take extraordinary steps."

Plenty of opportunities are available for students who couldn't get their desired rank. Students should remember that an exam cannot define them," the minister said. The move highlights a certain education trend in India, as students choose to study abroad after their 12th exams.  In the past, Pokhriyal has envisioned a quality in the Indian education system similar to that of universities abroad, and also listed out possibilities for achieving the same with the implementation of the New Education Policy.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said the court would ensure smooth investigation into the case. The court also asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, to cite the scope of Suo Motu proceedings before the Allahabad High Court in the matter. Responding to which Mehta said an affidavit would be filed by Thursday. The court posted the matter for hearing next week. At the outset, he said the state government was not opposed to a plea for a CBI probe made by the petitioner, Satyama Dubey and others. "There are narratives being created. The said truth is a young girl lost her life," the Solicitor General said, adding there must be free and fair trial. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for an intervenor, asked the court to transfer the trial and ensure witness protection. The court said it was hearing her as the incident was very shocking and extraordinary otherwise it was not sure of her locus into the matter. Mehta, for his part, said that all the witnesses were being granted protection in the case. Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government filed an affidavit asking the court to allow the CBI to probe the Hathras incident under its own supervision in a time-bound manner.

06-10-2020||National||India may close its dirtiest coal plants as green focus grows||By Rajesh Kumar Singh India is considering a proposal that may force some of its dirtiest coal plants to close, as policymakers in one of the world’s top polluters increasingly focus on climate change. The plan under consideration by the power ministry would cap plants’ so-called heat rate, which is a measure of how much coal energy is needed to produce each unit of electricity, according to people with knowledge of the issue. Power stations totaling 10 gigawatts have been identified as breaching the proposed benchmark and more could be added, said the people, who asked not to be named as the discussions are ongoing and no policy has been finalized. That would account for roughly 5% of the coal power capacity in India, the world’s second-biggest consumer of the fuel after China. The power ministry wasn’t immediately able to respond to a request for comment. Efforts in India to close old coal plants have gathered pace amid rising outcry against air pollution and deepening concerns over climate change. Besides the environmental benefits, the shut downs can also boost the use of more-efficient facilities that have remained underutilized for years. The proposal would cap the heat rate for coal plants at 2,600 kilocalories per kilowatt-hour of electricity, according to the people. That’s still higher than what some newer plants are able to achieve. Tata Power Co. Ltd.’s 4-gigawatt plant in Gujarat, for example, runs at a heat rate of 2,050 kilocalories per kilowatt-hour, the federal power regulator said in an order last year. India has nearly 200 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity, nearly 54% of the nation’s total. During the first five months of the current fiscal year, coal plants ran at an average 48% of capacity and produced 64% of the country’s electricity, a share that’s been sliding with the rise in renewable power. There could be some resistance to the plan from state distribution firms that rely on cheaper power from some of the targeted plants, the people said, particularly those that are fully depreciated and located near coal mines. The central government in India has limited control over how states generate, sell and distribute power. India’s coal fleet is already facing requirements to add pollution control equipment by 2022 to help fight smog. Plants with about 5 gigawatts of capacity have already been identified for closure for failing to submit plans to comply with these new norms, Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh told lawmakers last month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-may-close-its-dirtiest-coal-plants-as-green-focus-grows-898014.html

Besides Jaishankar, the meeting is being attended by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Japan's Toshimitsu Motegi. "As vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, our nations have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific," Jaishankar said. "We remain committed to upholding the rules-based international order, underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes," he said. The external affairs minister also said that it was a matter of satisfaction that the Indo-Pacific concept has gained increasingly wider acceptance.

According to officials, mechanisms will be explored for starting multi-disciplinary and innovative programs, twinning and joint degree programs, cross-country designing of centres, facilitating online lectures by eminent faculty abroad, linkage between academia and industry, facilitate joint degree ventures and lateral entry to Indian higher education institutions. The committee will present its report within 15 days. "Due to the current Covid-19 situation, many students who wanted to pursue studies abroad have decided to stay back and pursue studies in India. There is also a rising number of Indian students returning to India with concern about completion of their studies," Nishank said at a session on "Stay in India and Study in India". "We should make all efforts to look into the needs of both these categories of students. Initiatives need to be taken to retain them by providing appropriate opportunities of education in premier institutions in India as well as concerns of students returning from abroad need to be addressed by supporting them to complete their programme here in India," he added. The minister said that last year around 7.5 lakh students travelled abroad to pursue their studies and because of this valuable foreign exchange moved out of India as well as many bright students moved abroad. "We should make all efforts to help bright students to pursue their education in India.

"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken its election manifesto seriously and has been implementing assurances given," Joshi said. "Congress has been opposing the very reforms it once assured, but the BJP has been honouring them to empower farmers," he said. Joshi, speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, said that Congress's preaching and practicing mechanisms are different from the BJP. "During the UPA regime, the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh constituted a committee on agricultural reforms which, had categorically represented that farmers should be made free from agents and middlemen," he said. "Congress had it in its manifesto and BJP too had it." Hailing the BJP, he said the party honoured promises made in the manifesto as they were committed to fulfilling assurances given, while Congress made a namesake manifesto to be presented before the election as a formality and was not serious about it. He also alleged that the Congress and its alliance partners were misguiding people and farmers about agriculture reforms saying that minimum support price (MSP) was not part of the new act. "Congress has ruled the country for almost 60 years and should make known when was MSP made law. Rahul Gandhi has more knowledge or maybe must have read it in law books and should tell us which laws mention MSP. Until now MSP in the country has been through executive order and not law," Joshi stated. The Minister also added that the new farm laws will free farmers from the clutches of commission agents and middlemen. They will be able to sell their produce to any individual or company without paying a commission. APMCs too were not closing and farmers could sell their produce there. "In contract farming too, buyers have to honour the prices agreed," he said. Training his guns at the Gandhi family, he said that the Congress wanted to retain commission agents in the government to benefit themselves. "The grand old party has been opposing new laws as they want agents to suck the blood of farmers. It’s a party of agents and middlemen," he alleged demanding that Congress apologise for misguiding farmers and the common man. Joshi said that the Shiromani Akali Dal succumbed under pressure by agents in Punjab and walked out of the alliance. "In Punjab, farmers have to pay 8.5% commission to agents to sell their produce, you can imagine the money being made," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-shahehshah-not-serious-about-promises-made-pralhad-joshi-898083.html

Since its first virus burial in April, the Islamic graveyard of Jadid Qabristan has seen more than 700 funerals on a patch of adjoining wasteground designated for pandemic victims. "We weren't expecting that we will have to clear more land for the graves," said head gravedigger Mohammad Shameem, a 38-year-old in a pale green traditional tunic, who is the third generation of his family to work in cemeteries. "But bodies just keep arriving." A respite in infections has cut virus burials to about four a day, from 10 in the summer, but Shameem said the graveyard, founded in 1924, would soon be at capacity. "The way things are moving, I think we will clear the last remaining patch of land for graves in the coming months." Hindus, who make up the majority of India's population of about 1.4 billion, are typically cremated after death, but its estimated 200 million Muslims typically bury their dead.

The Bandra police lodged the FIR against the duo on September 7, based on a complaint filed by Rajputs girlfriend and actress Rhea Chakraborty, who is currently in jail in connection with a drugs case related to the actor's death. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik took up the plea on Tuesday and then posted it for hearing on October 13, saying there was no urgency. In her complaint, Chakraborty accused Rajput's sisters and Dr Tarun Kumar of the Delhi-based Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital of forging a prescription of medicines supposedly for anxiety that were prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. As per the complaint, the medicines were for Rajput. The 34-year-old actor was found hanging at his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14 this year. In the petition, Rajput's sisters claimed the FIR was filed based just on media reports and that the complaint was fraught with material irregularities and discrepancies. They also said there was an inordinate delay of 90 days in lodging the complaint the medicines were prescribed on June 8, the day Rajput asked Chakraborty to leave his house, and the complaint was lodged on September 7. The petition by way of interim relief has sought a direction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to whom the FIR against petitioners has been handed over by police, from taking any coercive steps against them. The CBI is already probing a complaint lodged by Rajputs father K K Singh, who accused Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his sons suicide. "A bare perusal of the complaint and the FIR shows it does not make out any cognisable offence. The drugs that have sought to be allegedly given by Dr Tarun Kumar are not banned drugs, the petition said. There is no evidence to show the medicine prescribed was administered to Rajput or anyone else, it said. "There is nothing in the FIR to suggest that the petitioners had used the prescription to buy the alleged drugs from any third party or induced it to Rajput, the plea said. "The present FIR has been lodged on a very vague complaint based on alleged conjectures and surmises with ulterior motive to frame the petitioners (Priyanka and Meetu), it said. The plea alleged that Rhea Chakraborty was tarnishing Rajput's image by suggesting he was suffering from mental illnesses and was a drug addict.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sushant-singh-rajputs-sisters-move-hc-seek-quashing-of-fir-against-them-898095.html
06-10-2020||National||India to overtake China as world's largest LPG residential market by 2030||India is expected to overtake China as the world's largest cooking gas LPG residential sector market by 2030, Wood Mackenzie said on Tuesday. "Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) demand in the residential sector will continue to see sustainable growth at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.3 per cent, reaching 34 million tonnes (MT) in 2030 as households' dependence on solid biomass diminishes in the long run supported by rising average household incomes and urban population," it said in a report. Driven by environmental and health concerns, the government has also been implementing schemes to help lower-income families cope with the cost of switching from dirtier biomass to LPG. The Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG (DBTL) gives out subsidies to the vulnerable population, while the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) provides families living below the poverty line access to free LPG stoves. Wood Mackenzie research analyst Qiaoling Chen said: "Although nationwide LPG coverage has reached 98 per cent, up 42 per cent from 2014, usage is still low. Average annual cylinder refills have not kept up with the pace of new connections, with average consumption remaining below the benchmark of 12 cylinders." Even with subsidy and the initial cost of set-up covered by the government, LPG is more expensive than biomass. Still, the Indian government is committed to roll out plans to further address affordability and infrastructure challenges in the LPG sector. These include smaller-size LPG cylinders which reduce upfront cash payment required for each refill, more LPG distributors as well as the 'Give it Up' campaign where households can voluntarily give up their LPG subsidies from the DBTL scheme to benefit lower-income families. Chen said: "Assuming the government continues to subsidise residential LPG throughout the decade, total subsidy for LPG could reach USD 5.7 billion annually by 2030. By then, it will overtake China as the world's largest LPG demand centre for the residential sector." However, the lack of infrastructure continues to restrain piped natural gas (PNG) penetration in areas outside of top tier cities and retail PNG prices continue to be at a premium to subsidised LPG prices, making PNG a less attractive alternative to LPG before 2030, Wood Mackenzie said. Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Vidur Singhal said: "Between 2020 and 2030, PNG demand will primarily be from urban households in tier I and tier II cities awarded under CGD bidding rounds. City gas companies will increase PNG connections and its related infrastructure, which typically takes five to eight years to construct and commercialise fully." "In addition, growing LPG demand in the residential sector requires more subsidies, which will increasingly become a huge burden for the government," Singhal said adding it is likely that subsidies will taper off over time, as growing income allows more households to pay the unsubsidised price. The combination of ready PNG infrastructure and less policy support for LPG help to support PNG demand growth post-2030. "We expect PNG demand in India's residential sector to grow at a CAGR of 12.7 per cent, reaching 2.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2030 from 0.8 bcm currently," Singhal said. By the end of 2030, India’s LPG demand in the residential sector will account for 82 per cent of the country's total LPG demand while natural gas demand in the same sector will only account for three per cent of total natural gas demand in India, Wood Mackenzie added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-overtake-china-as-worlds-largest-lpg-residential-market-by-2030-898099.html

Earlier, one staff member posted in its record section had tested positive on September 30, which necessitated the suspension of work on October 1 in order to carry out the sanitisation of the NCLAT premises and required judges and other staff to undergo testing. After that test, four more staff members, out of which three are from the record section, tested positive for Covid-19 on October 4, 2020. "Now, therefore, a fresh exercise of sanitisation/disinfection has to be undertaken and the record lying in the record room has to be subjected to the process of disinfection/sanitisation before laying before the benches. "Hence, as directed by acting chairperson, the court work (virtual hearing) and filing etc, in the NCLAT will remain suspended till October 6, 2020," said an NCLAT notification issued by the Registrar on October 4. Presently, like other judicial/quasi-judicial bodies, the NCLAT is conducting virtual hearing through video conferencing, which was started during the lockdown.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nclat-suspends-court-works-after-staff-members-test-covid-19-positive-898102.html

The mandate of the bioassay laboratory at the Faridabad-based THSTI, a premier research institute under the DBT, is to provide validated assays for vaccine development at par with global standards. The CEPI network will initially involve six laboratories, one each in Canada, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Bangladesh and India. Under the CEPI global network, the laboratories will use the same reagents and follow a common set of protocols to measure the immune response of multiple vaccine candidates under development and trial. "This will greatly harmonise the vaccine trial process, allow different vaccine candidates to be compared and speed up the selection of the most effective candidate," the DBT said. The Ind-CEPI mission for the establishment of a BSL-3 facility is a translational laboratory for platform technologies and a bioassay laboratory for development of assays to measure clinical immunogenicity. The DBT has been implementing the Ind-CEPI mission, "India Centric Epidemic Preparedness through Rapid Vaccine Development: Supporting Indian Vaccine Development". The objectives of the mission are aligned with the Global Initiative of Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness for Innovation (CEPI), a foundation that takes donations from public, private, philanthropic and civil society organisations to finance independent research projects for developing vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and aims to strengthen the development of vaccines and associated competencies or technologies for the diseases of epidemic potential in India. Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT said, "The Department of Biotechnology is supporting efforts for Covid-19 vaccine development and testing." More than 30 vaccines are at different stages of development with three in human trials and nearly four in advanced stages of preclinical, she noted. "We are very pleased that the bioassay laboratory at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute has been identified by the CEPI for centralised immunoassay analysis for Covid-19 vaccines under development globally. "It is well-positioned to run comparability studies with other laboratories internationally and will form an important part of the global network. This is another excellent example of Ind CEPI and CEPI Partnership," Swarup said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-lab-thsti-to-be-one-of-the-six-assessment-centres-for-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-898114.html

Carried out by UK-based humanitarian organisation Plan International, the survey, titled "State of the World's Girls Report", involved 14,000 women aged 15-25 from 22 countries including India, Brazil, Nigeria, Spain, Australia, Japan, Thailand and the United States. Ahead of the International Day of Girl Child 2020 on October 11, the survey highlighted that 58 per cent of the respondents accepted having faced online harassment or abuse on different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and TikTok. The percentage of affected women was similar for different regions around the globe. "In Europe 63 per cent of girls reported harassment, followed by 60 per cent of girls in Latin America, 58 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region, 54 per cent in Africa, and 52 per cent in North America," the report found. Ranging from threats of sexual violence to racist comments and stalking, online harassment of young women was directed in different manners. Of the girls who have been harassed, 47 per cent have been threatened with physical or sexual violence, while 59 per cent faced abusive and insulting language online. A large number of women from minority and LGBTQ+ communities said they were harassed because of their identities. "Of the girls who were harassed, 42 per cent of the girls who identified themselves as LGBTIQ+; 14 per cent who self-identified as having a disability; and 37 per cent who identified themselves as from an ethnic minority said they get harassed because of it," found the survey conducted from April 1 to May 5. Despite the anonymity that social media provides, girls and young women do know something about their harassers. Harassment from strangers was more frequent and more frightening than from people they knew. "While 11 per cent of the surveyed girls were harassed by a current or former intimate partner, 21 per cent pointed towards friends and 23 per cent knew their harassers from school or work," it said. Thirty six per cent of the respondents said they were harassed by strangers and 32 per cent by anonymous social media users. Whilst women were listed in the examples of known harassers, none of the girls interviewed suggested women were behind the unknown accounts, many directly mentioned they thought they were men. The abuse and harassment faced online also had its effect on life outside social media. A total of 42 per cent women registered mental or emotional stress, and the same percentage of respondents accepted decrease in self-esteem and confidence because of online harassment. Affected by the ill treatment online, one in five girls (19 per cent) have left or significantly reduced use of a social media platform after being harassed, while another one in ten (12 per cent) have changed the way they express themselves. "Girls are being silenced by a toxic level of harassment. Activists, including those campaigning for gender equality and on LGBT+ issues, were often targeted particularly viciously, and their lives and families threatened," said Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, Plan International's chief executive. "Driving girls out of online spaces is hugely disempowering in an increasingly digital world, and damages their ability to be seen, heard and become leaders," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/58-young-women-face-online-harassment-abuse-report-898121.html

The 'National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for Management of Covid-19' was released by Vardhan in the virtual presence of Shripad Naik, Minister of State for AYUSH. "This protocol dealing with preventive and prophylactic measures is a significant step not only in the management of Covid-19 but also in making traditional knowledge relevant to solving problems of the modern time," Vardhan was quoted as saying in a statement. "Unfortunately, Ayurveda did not receive much attention after independence until Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up this cause with the importance it deserves," he said while stressing that Ayurveda “had a significant impact in the foundations of modern medicine”. The AYUSH ministry, in the protocol document, pointed out that the current understanding indicates a good immune system is vital for the prevention of coronavirus infection and to safeguard from disease progression. The protocol suggests use of medicines such as Ashwagandha, Guduchi Ghana Vati or Chyawanaprasha as prophylactic care for high-risk population and primary contacts of patients. It recommends consumption of Guduchi Ghana Vati, Guduchi and Pippali or  AYUSH 64 for asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients for prevention of disease progression to symptomatic and severe forms and to improve recovery rate. Guduchi and Pippali, and AYUSH 64 tablets can be given to mild coronavirus infected patients, it said. The protocol also mentions the dose of these medicines that is to be taken. The guidelines stated that in addition to these medicines, general and dietary measures have to be followed.  Individuals with moderate to severe coronavirus infection may make informed choice of treatment options and all severe cases will be referred, the protocol said. Physicians have to decide useful formulations from the list or substitutable classical medicines based upon their clinical judgement, suitability, availability and regional preferences.  Dose may be adjusted based upon the patient's age, weight, and condition of the disease, the ministry said. The document also listed Ashwagandha, Chyawanprasha or Rasayana Churna for post-Covid-19 management in order to prevent lung complications like fibrosis, fatigue and mental health. Further, to improve respiratory and cardiac efficiency, to reduce stress and anxiety and enhance immunity, the ministry has listed Yoga Protocol for Primary Prevention of COVID- 19.  The document also mentions Yoga Protocol for Post Covid-19 care (including care for Covid-19 patients) in order to improve pulmonary function and lung capacity, reduce stress and anxiety and improve mucociliary clearance. "This protocol and its annexure are approved by the Chairman, Interdisciplinary Committee for the inclusion of Ayurveda and Yoga in the management of mild Covid-19 and approved by the empowered committee of the Interdisciplinary AYUSH Research and Development Taskforce on Covid-19, both constituted by the Ministry of AYUSH," the document said. Effective management to address this infection is still evolving and attempts are being made to integrate traditional interventions along with the standard of care, the preamble read. "Ayurveda and Yoga can certainly play a pivotal role to augment preventive measures provided in the guidelines by the Ministry of Health. The current understanding of Covid-19 indicates that good immune status is vital to prevention and to safeguard from disease progression," it said. The ministry also recommended gargling with warm water added with a pinch of turmeric and salt, nasal installation/application of medicated oil (Anu taila or Shadbindu taila), plain oil or cow's ghee once or twice a day, especially before going out and after coming back home, steam inhalation with Ajwain, Pudina or Eucalyptus oil once a day, moderate physical exercises and following Yoga protocol as general measures. Dietary measures include use of warm water or boiled with herbs like ginger, coriander, basil or cumin seeds etc., for drinking purpose, drinking golden milk (half teaspoon turmeric powder in 150 ml hot milk) once at night (avoid in case of indigestion) and taking Ayush Kadha or Kwath (hot infusion or decoction) once a day. Vardhan expressed satisfaction with the inclusion of easily available and common Ayurvedic herbs and formulations like Guduchi, Ashwagandha, AYUSH-64 in treating mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, the statement said. Three aspects -- knowledge from Ayurveda classics and experience from clinical practices, empirical evidence and biological plausibility and emerging trends of ongoing clinical studies -- were considered while preparing this protocol, the ministry said. This consensus document is developed by expert committees from All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), Delhi, Institute of Post Graduate Training and Research in Ayurved (IPGTRA), Jamnagar, and National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur, Central Council for Research in Ayurveda (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), other national research organizations, the ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/union-health-minister-releases-covid-19-management-protocol-based-on-ayurveda-yoga-898123.html

As on October 4, 2020, over 20 lakh loan applications from street vendors have been received under the PM SVANidhi Scheme. Out of these, over 7.5 lakh loans have been sanctioned and over 2.4 lakh loans have been disbursed, said the Ministry. Under PMSVANidhi scheme, the Centre is providing interest-free loans of Rs 10,000 to street vendors. Most of the loan seekers are sellers of fruits, vegetables, snacks, 'chaat' and 'gol gappa'. The Ministry launched PM SVANidhi scheme since June 01, 2020 for providing affordable working capital loan to street vendors to resume their livelihoods that had been adversely affected due to Covid-19 lockdown. This scheme targets to benefit over 50 lakh street vendors who had been vending on or before 24 March, 2020 in urban areas, including those from surrounding peri-urban/rural areas. Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri recently held a meeting with stakeholders to review the scheme after a complaint of slow progress in loan distribution. The Minister instructed officials to adopt simple methods to sanction loan. He also asked officials not to insist on too many documents from street vendorsm like CIBIL reports. Since most of the applicants are small street vendors like cobblers, sellers of electronics goods, sellers of flowers and puja items, beauty products, shoes, kitchen items mobile phones and chargers, the Minister also asked the officials to expedite the distribution of loan. Under the scheme, the vendors can avail a working capital loan of up to Rs 10,000, which is repayable in monthly installments in the tenure of one year. On timely/early repayment of the loan, an interest subsidy @ 7% per annum will be credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer on quarterly basis. There will be no penalty on early repayment of loan, the Ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-sanctions-loan-to-over-7-lakh-street-vendors-under-pm-svanidhi-scheme-898130.html

The trade union said it was ready for a "long and continuous" agitation, including a general strike if the government does not give any heed to its demands for withdrawing the provisions in the Codes that goes against the interest of workers. The decision was taken at the recently concluded 19th national conference of the BMS held virtually last week. A resolution was also adopted in the conference. The Resolution No.1 passed in the conference asked the government to "immediately withdraw" the anti-worker provisions in the new Labour Codes and call a consultation meeting with BMS and other trade unions to make the Labour Codes beneficial to both worker and industry. It also said that it resolved to hold country-wide "Warning Week" from October 10 to 16 as part of preparatory activities for the October 28 protest. In the recently concluded Monsoon Session of the Parliament, the government had passed the Industrial Relations Code, the Social Security Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code. The Wage Code Bill was passed by the Parliament last year. After the three Codes were passed in the Monsoon Session, the BMS has said that the provisions were "tilted too much in favour of the employers and bureaucrats and the last minute mutilations will adversely affect industrial peace in the country". It had then said that BMS and other trade unions have given detailed objections to the previous draft of the Industrial Relations Code but none of the objections raised by them as well as that of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour in favour of workers were considered. Besides this, the BMS also passed five other resolutions in its conference, which included a call for a round table of stakeholders on formulating a National Employment Policy. "The imported predatory economic and labour reforms and defective policies of the capitalist paradigm are responsible for landing our job generation in a sorry state of affairs," one of the resolutions said. The BMS also demanded the review of all pension schemes in favour of employees which included pension schemes under CCS (Central Civil Services) Rules, NPS (National Pension Scheme), financial sector schemes, EPS (employees’ pension scheme run by EPFO) and unorganised sector among others. "It demanded pension which shall not be less than 50% of salary linked to cost of living index and medical scheme and minimum pension of Rs 5,000 for the unorganised sector," the resolution said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bms-announces-nationwide-protest-on-october-28-against-anti-worker-codes-898131.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, "All of us here on the bench have studied in English throughout our life. But we don't want to impose our view on others." The top court was hearing a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh government against the HC's order of April 15 that quashed a decision allowing government schools to teach in English medium between class I to VI. Appearing for the Andhra Pradesh government, senior advocate K V Vishwanathan said the choice to study in Telugu medium was not taken away. "If someone wants their children to study in Telugu medium, they will be accommodated in Mandal schools. There are statistics that show 96% of the parents want English medium. This will help the marginalised sections also," he said. He claimed that one who studied in vernacular language cannot practise before the Supreme Court. Even though Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the contention was inappropriate, Vishwanathan said he had friends who studied in vernacular, think in vernacular, translate it in English. By the time they utter their arguments, the cases get over, he said. The court posted the matter for consideration next week. Earlier, the Centre has come out against the decision by Andhra Pradesh directing all government schools, to adopt English as medium of instruction for students between class I to VI students. It has relied upon the National Educational Policy, 2020, which stated, "wherever possible, the medium of instruction until at least grade V, but preferably grade VIII and beyond, will be the home language/ mother tongue/local language/ regional language". Renowned Telugu scholars, poets and cultural activists, including M Buddha Prasad, former Deputy Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative have opposed the move by the state government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/divergent-views-on-medium-of-instruction-in-schools-sc-898132.html

Tuesday's petition, signed by 1.5 million people including migrant workers, street vendors and home-based labourers, calls for cash handouts of Rs 6,000 ($81) for at least the next four months to help prevent risky borrowing, human trafficking and child labour. "This assistance will provide liquidity to the vulnerable families below poverty line," said P Balamurugan, a member of the Tamil Nadu Alliance - a coalition of 100 charities seeking to improve the conditions of garment industry workers. The petition, which was initiated by the charity coalition, included signatories from 23 Indian states, the organisers said. Asked about the appeal, Principal Government Spokesman K S Dhatwalia said "a slew of measures for all categories of workers" had been announced since the start of the pandemic. "These initiatives have been updated along the way to meet the needs of people," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Modi's administration has pledged to spend Rs 3,500 crore ($463 million) on food for migrant workers and offer them local jobs under a rural employment scheme. But many informal workers fear lacking documentation or a bank account will hinder their access to government aid, and labour rights activists say large numbers have turned to informal lenders often charging high rates of interest. India's home affairs ministry issued an advisory in July urging state governments to launch anti-trafficking awareness campaigns, amid increasing fears that countless people without work, food or money may fall prey to traffickers. The petition said the cash aid would act as a "safety net", minimising hunger and reducing the likelihood of human trafficking, child marriage and child labour among the informal labour force. "The cash aid will give them access to essential food commodities, medical care, payment of rent, and other supplementary expenses," it said.

On Tuesday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar announced the standard operating procedures (SOPs) that cinema halls must put in place before they open on October 15 after seven months of being closed.   The SOPs include one seat distance in theatres, 50 per cent capacity, masks at all time, proper ventilation and air conditioner temperature settings at above 23 degrees Celsius.   “Cinema halls have been shut for the last seven months. They are now opening from October 15. For the safety of people, we have come out with SOPs to be followed,” Javadekar told reporters.   It was good news for multiplex and theatre owners who have long maintained that it was time for the curtains to go up and also for movie aficionados missing their big-screen experience.  But the wariness persisted. Was it safe? How many people would actually brave the threat of Covid-19? What about the cost factor involved in getting theatres ready for the corona era? Given the extreme caution, there is unlikely to be any fresh content in the next few months, industry insiders indicated. No one wants to take a chance. Sibashish Sarkar, Reliance Entertainment Group CEO, said the reopening of cinemas is a positive sign for the industry but screening new releases will be difficult. "We are not releasing any film on Diwali (on November 14)... It is not possible to release a film on Diwali now. As of now, all cinema houses are not opening from October 15. Even if it opens on November 1, how can you release a film in a 10 or 15-day notice period?” he asked. Films such as Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif starrer Sooryavanshi and Ranveer Singh’s 83 that are complete and ready for release won’t be seen on the big screen anytime soon. While many films moved to OTT platforms during the lockdown that started in March, the much-awaited Sooryavanshi and 83 did not.   “Sooryavanshi”, which was scheduled to release on March 24, just a day before the lockdown came into effect, was supposed to hit the screens on Diwali. "We are not sure whether we will change both Sooryavanshi or 83 or we will just shift one film... It is clear... from December to March is the realistic timeline,” Sarkar told PTI. In fact, some cinemas will screen old content even when they open. Raj Bansal, a multiplex owner from Jaipur, said the distribution and exhibition sector has been waiting since August for theatres to open but his own theatre will stick to old fare.   "We have 15 days to plan things. We have software for a few Dhoom series, Golmaal, Munnabhai..., Hera Pheri and some small films that are ready to be released in theatres, " Bansal told PTI. He said the cost of operating cinemas will go up by at least 10 per cent as the premises will need to be sanitised regularly.   Cinepolis India CEO Devang Sampat is clear that cinema halls can’t get back to the regular business unless there is fresh content.   He said they have implemented stringent safety protocols in line with global best practices and are ready to welcome patrons back to a safe and secure, world-class movie experience. “We request the state governments to provide clearance for cinemas to open in their respective states,” he added. T-Series president Vinod Bhanushali added that it is exciting to have cinemas make a comeback after months of uncertainty. In Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, theatres might open by November or pre-Diwali and the company is getting films ready for a theatrical release. The company has films such as Indoo Ki Jawani and the yet untitled biopic on badminton ace Saina Nehwal.    “We will be happy if our films that are to be released on OTT will come in theatres. However, this decision is between OTT and exhibitors and distributors,” Bhanushali told PTI. "We believe stars or superstars are made or born in theatres. The fun of watching films is on the large screen," Bhanushali told PTI. Producer Boney Kapoor said it will take a couple of weeks for the audience to get used to coming to theatres. "Footfalls will increase gradually. Hopefully, by Diwali, we should have a better understanding or how good the situation is. We will think of the release once we complete the shoot of our films. We are praying footfalls in theatres show positive signs," Kapoor told PTI.   Film exhibitor Akshay Rathi, who has cinema houses in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, said the audience will want a safe and secure environment and all SOPs would be implemented.   “We will ensure the best of movies are released in theatres for audiences to come in big numbers. For this producers, exhibitors and distributors will have to work together to rebuild the movie-going habit," Rathi told PTI.   Theatres across the country had to shut their doors in March due to the coronavirus-led lockdown. As the government started easing other businesses, theatre chains said they should be allowed to resume services as they were already facing losses to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore.   “We are committed to ensuring a safe, secure and a hygienic cinema going experience for the movie lovers of our country.

A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notice to the Centre and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on a plea as amicus curiae senior advocate Aparajita Singh contended states have failed to act as per their assurances to take steps to control stubble burning. A counsel submitted that stubble-burning will exacerbate Covid-19 transmission. The bench then asked if the smoke kill coronavirus. Senior advocate Vikas Singh said it may aggravate the Covid-19 situation. Senior advocate Shyam Divan said that there must be a replication of measures adopted to control forest fires in respect of stubble burning. "For forest fire, there is already a system, by which satellite imageries are captured, and messages are sent to the concerned forest officials for remedial measures. Why can't such measures be adopted with regard to stubble burning," he asked. He also suggested that a portion of Minimum Support Price should be withheld to verify if the farmer has indulged in stubble burning. "Who is going to supervise and verify if the farmer has indulged in stubble burning," the bench asked. To this, Divan said his submissions were based on the recommendations of the expert committee. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, opposed the plea, saying tinkering with MSP would not be in farmers interest. He said he would file the response to the plea. The court decided to consider the matter, arising out a PIL by environmental activist M C Mehta, on October 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-plea-for-withholding-msp-of-farmers-for-burning-stubble-898170.html

Festive events shall be permitted only outside the containment zones, while people residing in the restricted areas may be encouraged to observe all festivals inside their homes and not move out, according to the ministry. Releasing the 'Standard Operating Procedures', the ministry said that the period from October to December witnesses large gatherings for religious worship, fairs, cultural functions, processions, etc, and it is important that necessary preventive measures are followed for such events which may last a day, a week or more. As far as feasible recorded devotional music/songs may be played and choir or singing groups should not be allowed, the SOPs stated. Keeping in view the physical distancing norms, event sites should have adequate floor area and proper markings at all locations which are likely to be visited by the public, the SOPs said underlining that only those staff and visitors who are free of symptoms shall be allowed inside the venue. All staff and visitors will be allowed entry only if they are using face cover/masks, which have to be worn by all at all times and physical distance of a minimum of six feet, when queuing up for entry and inside the venue, as far as feasible has to be followed. Specific markings for the purpose may be done. "In case of events that run for days or weeks, the crowd density doesn't remain the same throughout and usually peaks around certain hours of the day and some previously known auspicious days. "Planning for the event should specifically factor this so that crowds are regulated and managed to ensure physical distance and frequent sanitization," the SOPs said. In the case of rallies and immersion processions, the number of people should not exceed the prescribed limit and proper physical distancing and wearing of masks must be ensured. Events such as rallies, and processions spread over long distances may require the support of ambulance services, it underscored. The competent authority may implement additional measures within their jurisdiction as per their local assessment and in line with activities permitted by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) as per its orders issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 from time to time. Disinfection of premises has to be undertaken if any person is found positive. "Identify spatial boundaries and prepare a detailed site plan which would facilitate compliance with thermal screening, physical distancing, sanitization etc," it said. Close-circuit cameras etc. may be considered to monitor compliance of physical distance norms, wearing of masks at each venue. In the case of rallies and processions, route planning, identification of immersion sites, ensuring cap on numbers, physical distancing, etc. must be planned and measures for enforcement outlined. All events must plan for medical care arrangements with linkages to the nearest hospitals to attend to health emergencies, the guidelines stated. The guidelines issued for theatre and cinema artists will apply to stage performers. According to the SOPs,  the event sites should have a designated isolation room or space for isolating any person found symptomatic during the events, till such time that medical help is available. Preferably multiple and separate entry and exit points for visitors shall be ensured, the ministry said adding the structure or venue for the event must also have adequate natural cross-ventilation and entrances should have mandatory hand hygiene and thermal screening provisions. Proper crowd management inside and outside premises like parking lots, waiting areas, stalls, eateries, etc. duly following physical distancing norms shall be ensured. For entry into religious places, footwear needs to be preferably taken off by the people inside their own vehicle. If needed they should be kept in separate slots for each individual or family by the persons themselves, the guidelines said. The SOPs outlined that seating arrangement in pandaals, food courts and shows must ensure adequate physical distancing. Any shops, stalls or cafeteria outside and within the premises too shall follow physical distancing norms at all times and there should be arrangements for safe drinking water. Community kitchen managers and business owners of food outlets have been directed to ensure adherence to the highest level of personal and environmental hygiene all the time. Persons above 65 years of age, persons with comorbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years are advised to stay at home. This applies to the event managers and staff as well, the guidelines said. Effective and frequent sanitation within the premises shall be maintained with particular focus on commonly touched surfaces and areas including lavatories, drinking and handwashing stations/areas. Cleaning and regular disinfection (using 1% sodium hypochlorite) of frequently touched surfaces (doorknobs, elevator buttons, handrails, barricades, seats, benches, washroom fixtures, etc.) should be made mandatory in all public utility common areas, the SOPs stated. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry put the caseload in India at 66,85,082.

A bench presided over by Justice N V Ramana said the High Courts should send recommendations along with the action plan, so that the court may issue necessary directions. The court noted that some of the High Courts earlier favoured for establishing video conferencing facilities. The bench expressed concern over the Kerala High Court stating that “police personnel are reluctant to arrest and produce the accused legislators”. "We have also been told that police sometimes do not enforce the summons because of pressure from legislators. This is a serious matter," the bench said. Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, acting as amicus curiae, read out portion of his status report, stating only one special court in Bengaluru and West Bengal's 24 North Paraganas was not sufficient. The bench then said some of the cases were already at the end of the trial so it might not be feasible to transfer them to some other courts. In a report filed in a pending PIL by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, Hansaria, along with advocate Sneha Kalita said that the total number of cases have risen to 4,859 as latest information, whereas, as per earlier reports filed in March 2020, the cases were 4,442. The report suggested for taking steps for establishment of ‘safe and secure witness examination room’, video conferencing facility for each court, and creating a special website to show status of cases, among others. The court had earlier on September 17 asked Chief Justices of all High Court to decide within two months all those cases where stay has been granted in trial against sitting and former MPs and MLAs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-hcs-to-give-action-plan-for-speeding-up-trials-in-cases-against-mps-mlas-898185.html

The court is likely to pronounce the order on October 23. The other three accused cops have already been discharged from a trial that includes ex IPS officers P P Pandey and D G Vanzara. The special judge V R Raval reserved the order after concluding the arguments which were held virtually. The applications have been moved by accused IPS officer G L Singhal, retired Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) Tarun Barot, ex DySP J G Parmar and Sub-Inspector Anaju Chaudhary. Parmar passed away last month. The CBI on Tuesday produced a verification report along with a death certificate of Parmar following an order issued by the court. The accused policemen have moved separate applications but have similar prayers on identical grounds including parity with ex IPS officers Vanzara, Amin and ex-Director General of Police Pandey who has been discharged already. In the case of Vanzara and Amin, the CBI court discharged them on the ground the Gujarat government refused to grant sanction under section 197 of code of criminal procedure mandated for prosecuting government servants. The state government had denied permission on the ground of "larger public interest" and that Ishrat Jahan was an "operative of Pakistan-based terror organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba." During the hearing in the past, Ishrat's mother Shamima Kauser submitted in writing in the court saying that she has left the case at the mercy of CBI to prosecute all 11 accused policemen and officers from Intelligence Bureau. She stated that she felt "hopeless and helpless" that even after 15 years of her daughter's murder trial has "barely started."   In the discharge pleas, the four accused have said, "It is also made expressly clear that the present application has been filed only on the ground of non-existence of requisite sanction under section 197 of code of criminal procedure, 1973 without entering into the merits of the case and the accused crave leave to file a separate application for discharge on merits if such occasion arises in future." They have argued in their pleas that previous orders that exonerated Pandey, Vanzara and Amin have not been challenged in the high court and therefore those orders have attained finality. As a matter of fact, the CBI has told the court in writing that it would not challenge those orders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ishrat-jahan-encounter-order-reserved-on-discharge-of-four-accused-policemen-898188.html

In a public notice, the regulator said that only the IRDAI-registered insurance companies, or their authorised agents and intermediaries can sell insurance products. "Individuals who avail such services from unauthorised persons or entities shall be doing so at their own risk," it said. The list of insurance companies recognised by IRDAI are available on its website. It further said in case of doubt, the customers should contact the insurance company to ascertain the genuineness of the insurance plan and of the seller. Earlier, the regulator had also cautioned people against spurious calls from unidentified and unscrupulous individuals posing to be the officials or representatives of IRDAI with fictitious and fraudulent offers which are beyond the scope of insurance policies. The public should directly deal with insurance companies or registered intermediaries/insurance agents while purchasing a policy or having any financial dealing with the insurance companies for verification, it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/irdai-cautions-people-against-unauthorised-entities-selling-health-plans-898251.html

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests as well as the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. “Issue notice returnable on October 16,” the bench also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said. The apex court was hearing a plea filed by environmental activist and class 12 student Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka who sought directions to provide free of cost stubble removing machines to small and marginal farmers to check high particulate matters in the air. The petition contended that stubble burning contributes almost 40 per cent of air pollution in Delhi. The PIL referred to a Harvard University study that air pollution may now be an important factor that aggravates a mild Covid-19 infection into an acute one. It also referred to a study of the Louisiana State University, which found that increased air pollution can offer a direct pathway for airborne transmission of Covid-19. “Thus, any increase in the air pollution levels of Delhi-NCR this year while the Covid-19 pandemic is spiralling out of control will exponentially increase the mortality rates due to Covid-19, comprising the respiratory system of the citizens, more so in case of senior citizens and children,” the plea said. The PIL contended that the consequences of allowing any stubble burning to take place amid the ongoing pandemic may be catastrophic. The petitioners have sought directions to state governments to stop stubble burning and also fix a ceiling on rental of stubble removing machines from September to January 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-notice-to-centre-others-on-plea-to-ban-stubble-burning-898255.html

If the net is widened a bit, then 78% of the cases would be seen in 10 states. The weekly trend of active cases over the last four weeks is not showing a definitive trend in Maharashtra, but a clear case of steady increase is visible in Karnataka whereas in Kerala it is a sudden surge, possibly due to the Onam festivities when people lowered their guards and mingled freely. In Maharashtra, the number of active cases was 2,37,292 in the week starting on September 8. It rose to 2,91,630 in the subsequent week (starting on Sept 15) but started falling afterwards to reach 2,52,721 cases in the current week (Oct 6). But in case of Karnataka, it’s a steady rise from 97,020 on Sept 8 to 1,15,496 on Oct 6. Similarly in Kerala, there were 22,133 active cases on Sept 8, which ballooned to 84,958 on Oct 6 – nearly four times jump. "For Maharashtra, it is too early to take a call as the state has to be observed for a longer duration. In Karnataka, there is an increase in the case, but the highest increase has been seen in Kerala and the surge is possibly due to the Onam festivities,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said here on Tuesday. India’s Covid-19 death toll stands at 1,03,569, out of which 884 were added in the last 24 hours. Nearly 48% of the toll occurred in 25 districts, out of which 15 districts are from a single state – Maharashtra. The two Karnataka districts in the list are Bengaluru Urban and Mysuru. The Centre on Tuesday also released a national clinical management protocol for Covid-19 based on Ayurveda but made it clear that it was not a replacement of the standard treatment protocol released by the Union Health Ministry on the advice of the Indian Council of Medical Research. At most, it is a supplementary protocol. "There should not be any false sense of security among those who would be using this. This is in addition to the standard protocol. There is no firm cure for Covid-19 in this protocol, but it helps in Covid management,” said Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha, Secretary, the Ministry of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. The protocol which recommends the use of several medicinal plant product-based concoctions have been prepared by Ayurveda experts on the basis of empirical knowledge and the trend emerging from ongoing studies. A panel of experts headed by former ICMR director general V M Katoch vetted the protocol.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/karnataka-kerala-witnessed-increasing-number-of-covid-19-active-cases-over-last-four-weeks-health-ministry-898262.html

McKinsey Head (Global Analytics) Noshir Kaka said the development in the field of AI in India can add around USD 500 billion to the economy over the next four-and-a-half years based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's aspiration to make the country a USD 5-trillion economy. Speaking at the RAISE 2020 summit, Sawhney said AI is moving towards being an ecosystem that includes the database, authorised service provider, authorised service agency and authorised registrar, among others. "We are trying to move forward to make this happen in all the important domains in the economy, starting with health care. It's not just announced but being rolled out in pilot phase in six Union territories," Sawhney said. He added that data resources that are created to deliver a project can be shared across several projects in a structured manner to create new solutions on top of the projects. Kaka said that going by the vision of the prime minister to make India a USD 5-trillion economy, AI can contribute around 10 per cent to it in the next four-and-a-half years. "If you look at our prime minister's aspiration of reaching a USD 5-trillion economy by 2025, we think that a combination of AI plus data can deliver up to 10 per cent of that. "Ten per cent or USD 500 billion in 4.5 years is larger than what our tax services industry has created in 30 years," Kaka said. He said India is the most unique country where you can see opportunities from AI in agriculture as large as it is in banking. "There is no other country possibly in the world that you can see. Banking and agriculture sectors could be between USD 60 billion and 80 billion each." He added that the energy sector is another area that offers huge potential for the use of AI. The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence has highlighted the potential of AI in boosting India's annual growth rate by 1.3 percentage points by 2035 and identified priority sectors for the deployment of AI with the government's support.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-running-artificial-intelligence-based-pilot-projects-in-six-uts-it-secretary-898264.html
06-10-2020||National||CBI books Hanung Toys, directors for 'cheating' consortium of 12 banks of over Rs 2,040 crore||The CBI has booked Hanung Toys and Textiles Limited, along with its directors Ashok Kumar Bansal and Anju Bansal, for allegedly cheating a consortium of 12 banks to the tune of over Rs 2,040 crore, officials said on Tuesday. In November last year, authorities at the Delhi airport had detained debt-ridden Hanung Toys' promoter Ashok Kumar Bansal and his wife Anju Bansal, following a lookout circular issued by the Punjab National Bank (PNB). In the complaint filed on behalf of all the 12 banks, which is now part of the CBI FIR, the PNB alleged that the directors of the company indulged in criminal breach of trust, fraud, siphoning and diversion of funds, criminal misappropriation and cheating among others. It alleged that the directors of the company have siphoned off public funds to the tune of Rs 1,728 crore, apart from interest, the CBI officials said. The accounts of the company, a major supplier to global toys and home furnishing megastores in Europe, had turned non-performing assets during 2013-15, the bank alleged. A forensic audit opined that the company had indulged in fraud in its business transactions. It spotted differences in the figures of receivables, stocks and payables between the annual report and the stock audit report, signalling fabrication of the book of accounts, the bank said. The amount disclosed in the account books of the company and those of the creditors are not different, indicating fabrication of accounts, it added. The report showed transactions of over Rs 11,257 crore were routed through a company called Almondz Impex Private Limited, which did not exist at the address given, the bank alleged. Almondz Impex, engaged in the business of commission agents and commodity brokers, was incorporated in 2013, but did not file any balance sheets, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-books-hanung-toys-directors-for-cheating-consortium-of-12-banks-of-over-rs-2040-crore-898271.html

The agency said ex-chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain were arrested under the provision of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Both the accused were produced before a local court that sent them to seven days ED custody, it said in a statement. It had also searched the residential premises of the two former executives of the company in Mumbai in June this year. The beleaguered tours and travels company had told the BSE, post these raids, that the action was carried out by the ED at the residential premises of the suspended directors of the company and erstwhile key managerial personnel (KMP) who all have resigned from the company. These raids were carried out by the ED in the matter of loan availed by the company from Yes Bank under the tenure of the board of directors, which are now suspended due to commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process, it had said. The central probe agency said its probe found that Yes Bank had a total outstanding of Rs 3,642 crore against Cox & Kings Group of Companies (CKG).  It alleged that the two executives "purchased various immovable properties from the funds diverted from Cox & Kings Group". "CKG forged its consolidated financials by manipulating the balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries. In addition, some board resolutions submitted to banks for sanctioning the loans were also found to be forged," the ED claimed. Probe revealed that the loan sanction from Yes Bank was driven by then CMD Rana Kapoor and was given "bypassing" the norms, it said. "The ED gathered the evidences regarding clear instruction of Rana Kapoor to the concerned bank officials to get the said loan continued and not to take efforts to recover it," it alleged. "During the financial year 2015-2019, sales of Rs 3,908 crore were made to 15 non-existent/fictitious customers."  "Majority of collection shown in ledgers from Ezeego (another group entity of CKG) was not found in the bank statements. Also, there are fictitious 15 high value debtors reflected in the books of accounts," the ED said. Another 147 sets of customers, it said, also "appeared to be" suspicious and non-existent.  "Cox & King Limited (CKL) has diverted Rs 1,100 crore to another stressed company without any approval of board which has no business relationship with the company." "During this entire process, Khandelwal and Jain acquired the mortgaged property amounting to Rs 63 crore to their owned business entity Reward Business Solutions without paying a penny from their pocket," the agency said underlining the role of the two arrested accused. Probe found that from Ezeego, Rs 150 crore was diverted to Redkite Capital Private Limited which was promoted by family members of Khandelwal and Jain, it said. "Investigation conducted so far has revealed that the bank transactions of Cox and King Group are not matching with the books of accounts and Khandelwal and Jain created disparities between the books of accounts and the bank statements to camouflage the fraud," it said. Yes Bank co-promoter Rana Kapoor and DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan have been arrested in this case by the ED early this year and they are in judicial custody at present.  The ED had booked Kapoor, his family members and others under the PMLA after studying a CBI FIR that alleged that dubious multi-crore loans were given by Yes Bank to various entities in contravention of the law and in lieu of purported kickbacks given to the Kapoor family.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/yes-bank-ed-arrests-2-former-cox-kings-group-executives-898278.html

The CM said his government was not against the Centre, but it can not support these laws blindly. According to an official statement, Thackeray made the remarks during a meeting with representatives of farmer organisations called to discuss the three laws related to the agriculture sector whose passage in Parliament last month triggered protests in part of the country. Thackeray said all should come together in the interest of farmers irrespective of party affiliation, the statement said. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Ministers Balasaheb Thorat, Ashok Chavan, Chhagan Bhujbal, Jayant Patil and others. Parliament had passed The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the Monsoon Session and the president later granted his assent for them. The Congress and the NCP, constituents of the Shiv Sena-led state government, have already opposed the new laws. The Maharashtra government had on September 30 decided to set up a cabinet sub-committee to take a decision on the implementation of the new farm sector laws. The sub-committee will hold talks with representatives of farmer organisations and suitable amendments will be made to the laws. We are not against the Centre. But we also don't want to support the laws blindly. There is a need to remove the lacunas in the laws, the statement quoted Thackeray as saying at the meeting. The chief minister said there was a need (on the Centre's part) to take into confidence farmer organisations before enacting the laws. We are not opposed to development or reforms. But there was a need to share experiences of implementation of earlier different farmer-related laws, he said. The chief minister also called for assessing why farmers commit suicides despite green revolution in the country and added it is required to make time-to-time improvements in laws to ensure peasants are happy. A decision about (implementation of) the laws in the state will be taken after considering all the views expressed by representatives of farmer bodies, Thackeray said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/remove-flaws-in-new-farm-legislations-says-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-898283.html
06-10-2020||National||Quad meets in Tokyo, but fails to move closer to becoming a NATO-like joint front against China in Indo-Pacific||India, Japan, Australia and the United States failed to come out with a joint statement after a much-hyped ministerial meeting of the Quad in Tokyo on Tuesday, although the four nations agreed to work out “a common vision for the Indo-Pacific”, where they seek to counter the growing belligerence of China.   With the soldiers of the Indian Army resisting Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s moves to occupy vast swathes of its land in eastern Ladakh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called for “respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty”, as he joined the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and Australia, Toshimitsu Motegi and Maris Payne, for the meeting in Tokyo. Jaishankar, Pompeo, Motegi and Payne discussed the post-Covid-19 international order. New Delhi, however, avoided echoing the US and refrained from blaming China for the pandemic. It also avoided naming the communist country and criticizing it directly for its growing aggression and expansionism. India apparently treaded cautiously as it was keen to dispel the perception that the five-month-long military stand-off along its disputed boundary with China was pushing it closer to the US. “We remain committed to upholding the rules-based international order, underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes,” Jaishankar said in his opening remarks in the meeting. The External Affairs Minister also had bilateral meetings with the US Secretary of State as well as the Foreign Ministers of Australia and Japan. The four also had a meeting with new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.    India, Japan, Australia and the US re-launched the Quad in November 2017 as a coalition of four democracies to counter hegemonic aspirations of China in the Indo-Pacific region. The diplomats of the four nations had several rounds of consultation and the first ministerial meet was held in New York in September 2019. What, however, added to the significance of the Quad’s second ministerial meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday was the fact that it was held in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which was caused by a virus that was first reported at Wuhan in China. It was also the first ministerial meeting of the informal coalition of the four democracies after the communist country stepped up its belligerence – not only along its disputed boundary with India but in the South China Sea, East China Sea and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region too. The four nations, however, could not come out with a joint statement after the meeting and issued readouts separately in New Delhi, Tokyo, Canberra and Washington D.C. The statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in New Delhi tacitly acknowledged that the four nations were yet to reconcile divergence in views about dealing with China in the Indo-Pacific region. It noted that the External Affairs Minister, the US Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministers of Japan and Australia had “highlighted” during the meeting “their readiness to work towards realizing a common vision for the Indo-Pacific.” They discussed the post-Covid-19 international order and called for a coordinated response to the challenges, including financial problems emanating from the pandemic. They stressed on the need to share best practices to combat the SARS-CoV-2, increasing the resilience of supply chains, ostensibly to lessen dependence on China. They also exchanged views on enhancing access to affordable vaccines, medicines and medical equipment to fight the pandemic. Pompeo blamed the Communist Party of China for the Covid-19 pandemic. “We couldn’t have imagined the pandemic that came from Wuhan (China). That crisis was made infinitely worse by the Chinese Communist Party’s coverup,” the US Secretary of State alleged in his opening remarks, adding: “The regime’s authoritarian nature led its leaders to lock up and silence the very brave Chinese citizens who were raising the alarm.”   Jaishankar, Payne and Motegi, however, avoided blaming the Chinese Government for the pandemic. “The events of this year have clearly demonstrated how imperative it is for like-minded countries to coordinate responses to the various challenges that the pandemic has brought to the fore,” the External Affairs Minister said in his speech at the meeting. “As we collectively navigate these uncharted waters, we seek to emerge from the pandemic more resilient than ever before.” Pompeo also criticized China for its aggression along its Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India as well as elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region. “I also look forward to renewing our resolve to protect our precious freedoms and the sovereignty of the diverse nations of the region,” he said, adding: “As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the CCP’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion. We have seen it in the south, in the East China Sea, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Straits. These are just a few examples.” Jaishankar did not directly refer to China but said: “As vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values, our nations have affirmed collectively the importance of maintaining a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.  “Our objective remains advancing the security and the economic interests of all countries having legitimate and vital interests in the region. It is a matter of satisfaction that the Indo-Pacific concept has gained increasingly wider acceptance,” the External Affairs Minister said.    New Delhi treaded cautiously as it was not keen to send out a signal about India’s own vision for Indo-Pacific region turning overtly adversarial to China. The five-month-long military stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA in eastern Ladakh has brought the relations between the two neighbouring nations to a new low. But a section within the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government still has reservation about going the whole hog and allowing New Delhi to be seen as a zealous participant in the Quad, which is largely seen as a US-led move to bring the democratic nations of the Indo-Pacific region together in order to build a bulwark against expansionist and hegemonic aspirations of China. What added to New Delhi’s cautious approach on the Quad is Russia’s unease over India’s participation in the US-led move against China in Indo-Pacific. Moscow has been engaged in quiet back-channel talks with New Delhi and Beijing to defuse tension between the two neighbouring nations. New Delhi is also not keen to rely much on the US. A section within the Modi Government believes that the US might tone down its rhetoric against China after the November 3 presidential elections, no matter what the outcome of the polls might be.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/quad-meets-in-tokyo-but-fails-to-move-closer-to-becoming-a-nato-like-joint-front-against-china-in-indo-pacific-898284.html
06-10-2020||National||DCGI nod to Phase-1 human trials of 'antisera' with potential to treat Covid-19||Drugs Controller General of India has given permission for conducting Phase-1 human clinical trial for an "antisera" that was developed by injecting inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in horses and can be a potential treatment for Covid-19, ICMR officials said on Tuesday. The 'antisera' has been developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with a Hyderabad-based bio-pharmaceutical firm. "With Biological E Limited we have developed an horse 'antisera' and we have just got clearance for conducting clinical trials for that," ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava said at press briefing on Tuesday. The 'antisera' is yet to undergo human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy. Antisera are blood serum high in antibodies against specific antigens and are injected in humans to help kickstart the immune system to fight specific infections. "The ICMR and Biological E Limited, Hyderabad, have developed highly purified antisera (raised in animals) for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19," the apex health research body had earlier said in a tweet.   The pre-print version of the study regarding the development of the equine antisera has been posted on the Research Square platform. "The study provides evidence of the potential of generating highly purified F(ab')2 from equines against SARS-CoV-2 that can demonstrate consistent and high neutralisation activity," the study paper said. "Further, in-vivo testing for efficacy of this indigenously developed, cost effective product will pave the way to clinical evaluation. Additionally, being a donor independent method, this may prove as an efficient alternative to convalescent plasma for treatment of Covid-19 patients," it said.   Earlier such measures were used for controlling several viral and bacterial infections.   "Although, plasma recovered from patients experiencing Covid-19 could serve similar purpose, the profile of antibodies, their efficacy and concentration keep varying from one patient to another and therefore, make it an unreliable clinical tool for patient management," the ICMR had said in a tweet. "Standardisation achievable through equine sera based treatment modality thus stands out as yet another remarkable public health initiative supported by ICMR in the time of Covid-19," it said. As part of the study, 10 healthy horses were immunised with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and after 21 days of immunisation, plasma samples were tested. The results of the plasma samples indicated presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies as detected in ELISA with neutralising capacity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dcgi-nod-to-phase-1-human-trials-of-antisera-with-potential-to-treat-covid-19-898310.html

Earlier, exporters were required to seek licence from the government for export of these masks. "The export policy of N-95/FFP-2 masks or its equivalent is amended from restricted to free category making all types of masks freely exportable," the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said in a notification. In August, a monthly export quota of 50 lakh units was fixed for N-95/FFP2 masks or its equivalent for issuance of export licenses to eligible applicants. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in a tweet said, "India is making for the world: N95 and FFP2 masks can now be exported freely to countries across the world." Welcoming the decision, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) Chairman A Sakthivel said huge export demand is there in the global market for these masks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-centre-removes-export-curbs-on-n-95-masks-898311.html

She stopped just short of calling the Yogi Adityanath government's claim of some people trying to incite caste conflict in the aftermath of the incident an "electoral trick". However, she added, the government can "still rectify its mistake" and provide justice to the victim's family. On Sunday, Uttar Pradesh police lodged at least 19 FIRs across the state on charges ranging from attempt to trigger caste conflict to sedition in connection with the incident. One of the FIRs lodged at Chandpa police station in Hathras district against “unknown persons” mentioned alleged attempts to foment cast conflict, promoting enmity between groups and tarnish the image of the government and invoked section 124A of the Indian Penal Code -- the serious charge of sedition. The FIRs also deal with content posted on social media. "Time will tell whether UP government's charge against the Opposition that it was conspiring to incite caste and communal riots to impact development under the guise of Hathras case is right or electoral trick. But the public opinion demands that it is better if the government concentrates on bringing justice to the family of the victim," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi. The 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four "upper caste" men on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment. The victim was cremated near her home on September 30. But her family alleged they were forced by the local police to conduct her last rites in the dead of the night. Local police, however, said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family". "There's a lot of anger and outrage across the country over the wrong and inhuman treatment given to Hathras victim's family. The government can still rectify its mistake and be serious about bringing justice to the victim's family, otherwise it will be difficult to prevent heinous incidents," Mayawati added in another tweet. The state government has recommended a CBI probe and quoting an FSL report, it has denied the woman was raped. In his address to BJP workers on Monday, Chief Minister Adityanath referred to “recent incidents” and said “anarchist elements” were trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rectify-mistake-focus-on-ensuring-justice-to-hathras-victims-family-mayawati-tells-uttar-pradesh-government-897951.html

Rahul’s remarks at a press conference in Patiala came as a response to Modi’s assertions that the UPA government did not have the will power to implement farm sector reforms, despite favouring them. “We are aware of the shortcomings in the mandi system, the corruption there. We want to reform this system. It is a complex task, not an easy one. But Narendra Modi does not want to accept real challenges. He says I will finish it off,” the former Congress President told reporters. “Black money is a difficult challenge, but he came out with noteban and declared that he has dealt with the issue,” he said adding that in doing so the Prime Minister had destroyed the small and medium enterprises that generate a large number of jobs in the country.  He said the three farm laws, enacted by the Modi government, will end up destroying the food security system built up over decades. Rahul had embarked on a Kheti Bachao Yatra on Sunday in Punjab to oppose the three farm sector laws enacted by the Modi government. He addressed a public meeting at Noorpur and later drove a tractor to Haryana, where his rally was stopped briefly by the state government. Rahul addressed two corner meetings in Pehowa and Kuruskhetra before concluding the yatra. Rahul indicated that he was prepared for a long battle with the BJP and that the country would some day realise what Modi stood for. “I am a very patient man. I will wait…some day the youth will realise who the Prime Minister is waving to in an empty Atal Tunnel. Some day the truth will come out,” the former Congress President said. Rahul dismissed suggestions of a weak opposition and claimed that the BJP had firm control over the media and the judiciary. “To say the opposition is weak is incorrect. Give me a free press, give me institutions that are free and this government will not last,” Rahul said. Asked about his showdown with the Uttar Pradesh Police during his visit to Hathras, he said the real jolt was faced by the family of the victim of the gang rape. “It is our duty to stand with the country. The government is such that we will face cane charges. We will endure it,” Rahul said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-does-not-accept-real-challenges-farm-laws-will-end-up-destroying-food-security-system-rahul-gandhi-898057.html

The former finance minister said the states should not borrow as the liability to provide Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation as well as the onus to find resources fall on the Centre. "I compliment the 9-10 states that stood firm and rejected the two options given by the central government to bridge the gap in the GST compensation cess. "The liability to provide the GST compensation to the full extent falls on the central government, as reluctantly admitted by the FM yesterday. Naturally, the onus of finding the resources also falls on the central government," he said in a series of tweets. "It is unfair and unjust to ask state governments to borrow the money. States must stand firm at the next meeting on 12th October," Chidambaram said. At its meeting on Monday, the GST Council failed to reach a consensus on ways to compensate the states for the loss of tax revenue. The panel will meet again on October 12 to thrash out the state compensation issue, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said after a marathon eight-hour meeting. The council was divided on political lines, with 10 states ruled by non-BJP parties opposing the Centre's proposal of states borrowing to meet the shortfall in receipts. The state compensation issue appears headed for voting in the council, with the option chosen by the majority being implemented. Sitharaman said 21 states accepted one of the two borrowing options suggested by the Centre but 10 did not agree. When the GST was introduced in July 2017, the states were promised a 14-per cent incremental revenue over their last tax receipts in the first five years. This was to be done through a levy of a cess or surcharge on luxury and sin goods, but the collections on this count have fallen short with the slowdown of the economy since the last fiscal. To make up for this, the Centre has suggested that the states can borrow against future compensation receipts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/states-should-stand-firm-reject-centres-options-on-gst-compensation-cess-chidambaram-898080.html

Gandhi, who is holding a series of tractor rallies under his 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' in Punjab to protest the Centre's new farm laws, also took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he has not spoken "a word" on the Hathras incident. "The CM of Uttar Pradesh should have the decency to say this is a tragedy and will look into it and will protect this family and this girl," Gandhi told reporters here. He was asked by a reporter for his reaction over the UP government reportedly saying that there was an “international conspiracy” to defame it. “Yogi ji is entitled to his opinion. He is more than welcome to imagine whatever he wants to imagine. What I saw there was that a lovely girl was molested, her neck was broken, her family was threatened and the people who did it, no action was taken against them,” he said. "If Yogi ji sees it as an international conspiracy, well that is fine, that is his prerogative. What I saw was a tragedy,” said Gandhi. Before his tractor rallies, Gandhi visited the Hathras victim's family on his second attempt after being dramatically stopped outside Delhi by UP police. Gandhi said he visited the family wanted them to know that they are not alone. "A child is raped and murdered, but the whole administration attacks the family and country's PM does not utter a word,” he said. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gangraped and brutalised in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh on September 14. She died a fortnight later. The victim was cremated near her home on September 30. But her family alleged they were forced by the local police to conduct her last rites in the dead of the night. Local police, however, said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family". The UP government has recommended a CBI probe and quoting an FSL report, it has denied the woman was raped. On Sunday, UP police lodged at least 19 FIRs on charges ranging from attempt to trigger caste conflict to sedition in connection with the incident. In his address to BJP workers on Monday, Chief Minister Adityanath referred to “recent incidents” and said “anarchist elements” were trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/up-cm-should-have-decency-to-call-hathras-incident-a-tragedy-rahul-898085.html

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for a Congress MLA Vinay Saxena, submitted before a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde that the Protem Speaker is appointed only for a limited purpose of the confidence motion and he cannot decide on petitions seeking disqualification. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, suggested the petitioner to approach the High Court. Sibal, for his part, said the bypoll on the seats vacated by rebel MLAs was scheduled on November 8. The plea filed in the top court in July must be heard and decided. On this, the court put the matter for hearing after two weeks. The petitioner contended the rebel MLAs cannot be appointed as ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government during the pendency of disqualification petitions. The Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker, however, informed the court that the disqualification petitions filed on March 10 and 15 against 22 Congress MLAs, who switched side to BJP after resignation of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, were decided on June 12 by the then Protem Speaker within three months maximum time period, set up by the top court in a 2020 judgement. Speaker Rameshwar Sharma, who was appointed on July 2, said 22 ex MLAs were ceased to be members of the Assembly when their resignations were accepted by the erstwhile Speaker on March 10. He maintained the disqualification petitions against them were filed on March 10 and 15. In a related development, the court declined to consider a petition filed by advocate Aradhana Bhargava through advocate Vipin Nair, wherein she questioned appointment of 14 former Congress MLAs as ministers in Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/protem-speaker-cant-decide-disqualification-plea-congress-tells-supreme-court-898118.html
06-10-2020||National Politics||Congress tractor rally: Haryana authorities allow Rahul Gandhi, some party leaders to enter state||Amid high-drama at Haryana's border with Punjab, state authorities allowed former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and a few party leaders to enter the BJP-ruled state as part of his rally against farm laws. After winding up his last rally at Sanaur in Patiala, Gandhi drove a tractor to reach Haryana border on the concluding day of his "Kheti Bachao Yatra". He was accompanied on the tractor by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and senior party leader Harish Rawat. A number of Congress workers were accompanying Gandhi from Punjab's Patiala district, but the procession was stopped on the highway near Teokar village on Pehowa border for an hour. Before Gandhi arrived at the Punjab-Haryana border, senior Haryana police officials at the spot told reporters that they would not allow more than 100 people to gather at one place as per the guidelines in place due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Gandhi and a few Congress leaders were later allowed to enter Haryana where the former Congress chief has a couple of programmes scheduled. On Haryana side, state Congress chief Kumari Selja, senior leaders Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Kiran Choudhary, Ajay Singh Yadav and party's Haryana affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal were present.  Ahead of Gandhi's tractor rally in Haryana, the BJP-led government on Monday had said the Congress leader can bring a few people in the state but it will not permit a big crowd from Punjab which can "disturb" the atmosphere. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said Gandhi has the right to put forth his views but "if he comes with a big procession from Punjab, we won't allow it". Haryana's Home Minister Anil Vij had said if Gandhi comes with "a big crowd from Punjab to disturb Haryana's atmosphere, then we will not permit it. We are not going to allow that".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-tractor-rally-haryana-authorities-allow-rahul-gandhi-some-party-leaders-to-enter-state-898138.html
06-10-2020||National Politics||Opposition raising unreasonable apprehensions on farm laws, says Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman||Under attack from the Opposition parties on new farm laws, the Union government on Tuesday sought to turn the tables on the Congress by accusing the erstwhile governments led by the party of not providing Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops other than paddy and wheat. Without naming Congress, which headed the UPA-I and II regimes from 2004 to 2014, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman questioned why the party that did not care to extend MSP to other crops was now raising “unreasonable” apprehensions on the farm laws. Addressing a press conference here to highlight the benefits of the farm laws, Nirmala said the government introduced the Bills in the Parliament after discussions with farmers' organisations across the country and rejected suggestions that they were rushed through. She also said the Congress, though she did not name the party, had promised to bring reforms in the agriculture sector in its manifesto, but is opposing them when the NDA government got the Bills passed in the Parliament. To a question, the finance minister said the MSP for various crops was here to stay and farmers need not worry on that count. “I have to mention a few things. For years, under certain governments, the focus of granting MSP was only for paddy and wheat though there were other 20-23 items that were covered under the regime. Only after Narendra Modi became the prime minister in 2014, the scenario changed,” she said. She added that it was the NDA government that began shifting the focus of MSP on other crops such as coarse grains, oilseeds and spices to reduce dependence on imports. “MSP was there and will continue to be there. But because of the focus on increasing the MSP of only paddy and wheat annually, it brought a distortion in the agriculture sector as many farmers shifted from other crops to the cultivation of paddy and wheat,” she said. Nirmala did not give a direct answer to the questions on demands from states like Tamil Nadu for tweaking of rules in the options given by the Centre with regard to GST compensation. “We discussed the issues at the GST Council meeting on Monday for seven hours and we will meet again on October 12. We will discuss there,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-raising-unreasonable-apprehensions-on-farm-laws-says-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-898158.html

He was replying to a question by a journalist on why Punjabis should trust him. "Look at my actions, you will see that I am a person who, when I see some injustice is done, I feel for that person instinctively. If you see one strong man beating a weak man, automatically I am on the side of the weak. "In fact, this is why I get beaten up so much in politics. I am also thinking to myself, why. But I have that inside me. If I feel injustice is being done to Punjab I will stand for Punjab, no matter what. If I feel injustice is being done to a Dalit girl in UP, I will go there, I will take two-three 'lathis', no problem. That is my nature, that is what I have been taught. I don't know any other way," Gandhi said. Rahul Gandhi and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had recently travelled to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh to meet the family members of a 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gang-raped. She died a fortnight later. He said his political path would have been easier if he did not have this trait. "Frankly, I can see right now that my political path would have been much easier if I did not have this. But it is there how can I take it out. That is why the people of Punjab should trust me," he said. The former Congress chief said that he had often been abused and beaten while fighting for the rights of sections of society as in the case of the Land Acquisition Bill and MGNREGA among others. "Now, I am standing with the people of Punjab against this farm bill," said Gandhi on the final day of his tractor rally in Punjab. The Congress leader also said that he owed a debt to Punjab and Punjabis. "I have learnt a lot from Punjabi people. Punjab has given me a lot... The people of this state have a particular spirit which has taught me quite a lot," he said. He recalled an incident when his grandmother Indira Gandhi lost the parliamentary election in 1977. "I remember in 1977, my grandmother lost an election. There was nobody in the house, but there were Sikhs in my house. She was protected by Sikhs in 1977. I will never forget that," he said. "In my mind, it is a strange thing. But there is a debt that I feel I owe to the people of Punjab. In a similar way, I have a feeling that I owe the people of Tamil Nadu. I do not know why but I have that feeling inside," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/get-beaten-up-so-much-in-politics-maybe-because-i-instinctively-stand-with-the-weak-rahul-gandhi-898226.html

Various routes leading to Chautala's residence have been sealed but farmers are adamant to gherao his house, police sources said. The deputy chief minister has defended the new farm laws as “pro-farmers” and accused the opposition of misleading them. The Dussehra Ground has been earmarked for the protest, a police official said, adding that additional forces have been deployed to ensure that the event passes off smoothly. Several 'nakas' have been set up in the city to ensure there is no traffic disruption, he said. "Dushyant has betrayed farmers' interests for his greed to stick to power," alleged Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, who reached here for the protest. Yadav, who is also a member of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, told reporters this was not expected of Chautala, whose great grandfather was considered as farmers' 'messiah'. Chautala is the great-grandson of former deputy prime minister Devi Lal.     "He is silent and has failed to raise his voice on the issue of new farm laws," Yadav said, adding that the deputy chief minister should waste no time in resigning and stand up with the farmers. "Farmers are coming to your residence on October 6 to ask you questions. I am also accompanying them," Yadav said in a tweet. Chautala has said that he will not take another minute to step down the day farmers do not get MSP for their crops. Protests have erupted in many states, especially in Punjab and Haryana, against the legislations which were passed in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. The Congress and several other opposition parties have alleged these are "anti-farmer measures" and will "destroy" the agriculture sector. The government has, however, asserted that the new laws will free farmers from the clutches of middleman and allow them to sell their produce anywhere they want at a remunerative price.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/heavy-police-force-in-sirsa-as-farmers-bodies-plan-to-gherao-haryana-deputy-cm-dushyant-chautalas-home-897847.html
06-10-2020||North and Central||Hathras case: ED may file money laundering case to probe use of illegal funds to trigger caste-based protests||The Enforcement Directorate may soon register a money laundering case to probe if dubious funds were used for allegedly fuelling caste-based protests in the wake of the alleged gang-rape and death of a Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, officials said on Monday. ED Joint Director (Lucknow zone) Rajeshwar Singh told PTI that the central probe agency is "examining" a Hathras police FIR linked to charges filed against a website created on an online platform, http://carrd.co. A link, 'justice for Hathras victim', was uploaded on the platform and it is under probe for alleged dubious activities, official sources said. They said the ED may file a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The law empowers the agency to confiscate tainted funds collected for any alleged illegal activity through an online platform. Those involved can be arrested and prosecuted under the PMLA, they added. The Hathras police FIR has been filed under Section 153A (promoting enmity between groups) of the Indian Penal Code. This is a scheduled offence on which PMLA sections can be applied, the sources said. Once an ED case is registered under criminal sections of the PMLA, they said, the agency can make enquiries from foreign regulators and investigative agencies to probe the details of money collected and utilised by individuals. The agency, the sources said, will also examine the "ultimate beneficiaries" of the money collected by this web portal and the service provider (telecom company) can be asked to share the IP address or addresses from where the webpage was launched. The ED, they said, will also seek technical help from the Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-In) for analysing traffic on the website and to obtain email ids and phone numbers used to buy the domain name and hosting a topic related to the alleged gang-rape and death of the Dalit woman in Hathras. The web platform under the scanner has supposedly been developed by a US-based entity, they added. According to the Uttar Pradesh police, the facts and statements of the state government related to the Hathras incident were being forged, manipulated and circulated on social media. Some accused are circulating material that could trigger caste-based conflict and these are serious offences considering the current situation in the region, a UP police officer said. The Dalit woman died of grievous injuries in a Delhi hospital on September 29, a fortnight after she was allegedly raped by four upper caste men in her village. The victim had suffered spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She was cremated in the early hours of September 30. While her family claimed the cremation was carried out against their wishes, the police said the last rites were held "as per the wishes of the family". The incidents have triggered massive outrage across the country. Facing severe criticism over the incident, the UP government has recommended a CBI probe into the whole episode.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-case-ed-may-file-money-laundering-case-to-probe-use-of-illegal-funds-to-trigger-caste-based-protests-897849.html

We are working on a plan to prevent highway attacks,” Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar told reporters, on the sidelines of a wreath-laying ceremony of two slain Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men, who were killed in a highway attack in Pampore area of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Monday. He said that it was not possible to check each and every vehicle on highways as that would lead to chaos. “Frisking of vehicles is carried out only when there is specific information or a lead,” the IGP said. The Kashmir police chief said that militants in the valley were using virtual cell numbers to communicate with each other. “This is making it difficult for us to trace them but our technical team is on the job. We will soon come up with a counter solution for it,” Kumar added. The IGP said that the militants, who carried out yesterday’s attack, belong to the group that carried out an attack on the security forces last month in Chadoora area of central Kashmir’s Budgam district. “They will be killed soon,” he added. On reports of rifle-snatching incident in yesterday’s attack, he said, “No rifle was snatched by the militants and the claim is completely baseless.” Two CRPF personnel were killed and three injured in a militant attack in Pampore on Monday.

The state police, which lodged as many as 19 cases in this regard, have booked workers of the Samajwadi Party (SP), Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Bhim Army, a 'Dalit' outfit on charges of trying to instigate violence and violating Covid-19 guidelines. Former BJP legislator Rajveer Singh was also booked, sources said. Police sources said that five persons, who were associated with the Popular Front of India (PFI), an organisation that UP wanted banned, were arrested from Mathura while on way to Hathras on Tuesday.

06-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi HC initiates PIL to monitor pending criminal cases against MPs, MLAs||The Delhi High Court Tuesday sought replies from the Centre, the AAP government and its own registry on a plea initiated by it on the Supreme Court direction to all high courts to monitor the pending criminal cases against MPs and MLAs. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice asking them to file affidavits indicating the steps taken pursuant to the apex court's direction of September 16. "Highlight the work done by you (Centre, Delhi government and high court registry)," the bench said. The Chief Justice also said that he has already given orders to appoint four judges in the subordinate courts. The Supreme Court on September 16 had asked the chief justices of all high courts to forthwith list before an appropriate bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers where stay was granted. The direction came on a petition which was filed in 2016 and raised the issue of inordinately delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers. The apex court had issued the direction after observing that there has been “no substantial improvement” in disposal of pending criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers. It directed the high courts that “in the event that a stay is considered necessary, the court should hear the matter on a day-­to-­day basis and dispose of the same expeditiously, preferably within a period of two month, without any unnecessary adjournment." “It goes without saying that the Covid-­19 condition should not be an impediment to the compliance of this direction, as these matters could be conveniently heard through video conferencing,” the apex court also said. Referring to a report placed before it in the matter, the top court had said that it indicated that about 175 cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and 14 cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 are pending against sitting or former lawmakers. “These are in addition to the 4,442 criminal cases indicated to be pending as per the earlier report of the amicus dated September 8, 2020,” the Supreme Court noted. “With respect to increasing the number of special courts and rationalizing the pending criminal cases, we deem it appropriate that, before passing any specific direction in respect thereto, it would be appropriate to direct the chief justice of each high court to formulate and submit an action plan for rationalization of the number of special courts necessary.,” it added. It had said that the aspects to be considered, while making the action plan, were -- total number of pending cases in each district, required number of proportionate special courts, number of courts that are currently available, number of judges and the subject categories of the cases, tenure of the judges to be designated, number of cases to be assigned to each judge, expected time for disposal of the cases, distance of the courts to be designated and adequacy of infrastructure. The top had also said that while preparing the action plan the chief justices of the high courts should also consider whether it would be necessary and appropriate to transfer cases where trial is going in an expeditious manner. “The chief justices of the high courts shall also designate a special bench, comprising themselves and their designate, in order to monitor the progress of these trials,” it had said, “We further request the chief justices of all the high courts to list forthwith all pending criminal cases involving sitting/former legislators (MPs and MLAs), particularly those wherein a stay has been granted, before an appropriate bench(es) comprising of the chief justice and/or their designates,” it had also said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-hc-initiates-pil-to-monitor-pending-criminal-cases-against-mps-mlas-898069.html

We had a peak, and then it came down. The number went up again but now we are seeing a decline in admissions. "If the numbers persist for a week, we can safely say that we are past the second peak," said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, critical care and respiratory medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. Suresh Kumar, Medical Director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, said there is certainly a decline in the number of new coronavirus cases as compared to mid-September. "We can say that the second peak is over now. The number of cases is expected to decrease further," he said, adding that the high number of deaths over the last few days can be attributed to severe patients coming to Delhi for treatment from neighbouring states. Dr BL Sherwal, Medical Director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said, "We also saw an increase in hospital admissions around September 16-17 when the cases rose. But the number of admissions has decreased now and discharges have increased." "Bed occupancy has also gone down. It can be attributed to awareness and home isolation measures of the Delhi government," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-past-peak-of-2nd-covid-19-wave-says-cm-arvind-kejriwal-898082.html
06-10-2020||North and Central||Stubble burning: 'Bio-decomposer' to be sprayed in Delhi from October 11||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Tuesday the Delhi government will start spraying "Pusa bio-decomposer" solution from October 11 to prevent stubble burning in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital. Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, have found a low-cost, simple and effective way to deal with the problem of stubble burning, he said. "They have developed 'bio-decomposer' capsules, which are used to prepare a liquid formulation. The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure,” Kejriwal said after inspecting his government's centralized bio-decomposer system set up in Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi. The solution increases soil fertility and reduces the use of fertilisers, he said. This year, the Delhi government is going to use the solution on the land where non-basmati rice is grown. “We have estimated that only Rs 20 lakh is needed to manage stubble in 700 hectares of agricultural land in Delhi through this solution. It includes the cost of preparation, transportation and spraying,” he said. Farmers have to just give their consent and the Delhi government will spray the solution in their fields free of cost, he said. The first batch of the solution will be ready in seven days and the spraying will begin on October 11, the chief minister said. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said, “We want to create a model in Delhi so that no government can make an excuse (on the issue of stubble burning).” “When there is an alternative available…all those who seriously want to reduce pollution should use this,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/stubble-burning-bio-decomposer-to-be-sprayed-in-delhi-from-october-11-898088.html

According to the police sources in Lucknow, the girl, a resident of Hathras, had gone to a relative's house in the neighbouring Aligarh district, where she was allegedly raped by her maternal cousin last month. The minor was held captive at a relative's house in Iglas area of Aligarh district and was rescued on September 17, Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj G told PTI. It was alleged that the child was locked in the toilet after being raped. Her father, who came to know about the incident later, got her admitted to a hospital in Aligarh from where she was referred to a higher centre in Delhi. She died there on Monday. The accused, who was a minor and allegedly mentally retarded, was sent to a shelter home, sources said. The father of the victim, however, claimed that the cops had arrested the wrong person and that its the elder brother of the arrested minor, who had raped the child. "On a complaint by a social organisation police raided the house, which belonged to a relative of the victim, found the girl and admitted her to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College hospital where she was being treated till four days ago," the SSP told reporters. "The boy's mother, who is the maternal aunt (mausi) of the victim, is reported to be an accomplice in the crime and is absconding," SSP Muniraj said. The SSP said the Iglas police station SHO has been suspended for negligence. He also said two police teams have been constituted to trace the woman. Enraged over the incident, a mob blocked a busy road in the district on Monday night demanding the arrest of the culprits and suspension of the local police station in-charge, who had threatened the victim's family after they demanded action against the perpetrators. The blockade was lifted late at night after the administration announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and suspended the SHO of Sadabad police station.   (With PTI inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-sees-another-horror-six-year-old-girl-raped-by-relative-dies-898090.html

They have also been asked to immediately remove the posts and refrain from transmission of such pictures of videos on social media as they are widely circulated by their followers on social media, which is prohibited by law.   The NCW notice cited the Supreme Court order barring the disclosure of identity. The apex court had said the bar on disclosure under Section 228A(2) of the Indian Penal Code was not confined to just the name of the victim but actually meant that the "identity of the victim should not be discernible from any matter published in the media". The 19-year-old girl, who was gang-raped by four men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras on September 14, succumbed to her injuries later at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital. Amid claims by the UP Police that the girl was not sexually assaulted, Malviya had posted a 48 second video of the girl on Twitter, claiming that it was an "interaction with a reporter outside AMU where she claimed there was an attempt to strangulate her neck". A controversy has erupted over whether the girl was sexually assaulted with forensic reports claiming that there was no sign of rape while experts said the samples were collected on the 11th day of the incident and it would not indicate sexual assault. In her dying declaration, the experts said, the girl had said that she was raped and it would have precedence over anything else. In its notices to Singh and Bhasker he NCW said the pictures of the victim were posted on Twitter by them. On Monday, the NCW had issued a notice to UP police over the manhandling of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra while she was on her way to Hathras to meet the family of a woman who died after she was allegedly gang-raped. "@NCWIndia condemns the alleged manhandling of Priyanka Gandhi by police while she was on her way to Hathras. This insensitive behaviour is totally unacceptable. Considering the sensitivity of the matter, our Chairperson @sharmarekha has sought a reply from @dgpup at the earliest," the NCW tweeted. The incident had occurred at the Delhi-UP border on Saturday afternoon when Priyanka along with her brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders was on her way to Hathras to meet the victim's family. During a scuffle involving Congress workers and police, a helmet-wearing policeman had held the Congress General Secretary by her kurta.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ncw-sends-notices-to-digvijay-singh-amit-malviya-and-swara-bhasker-for-revealing-identity-of-hathras-victim-898107.html

"We have identified the militants behind the attack. They are from the Lashkar, led by a Pakistani terrorist named Saifullah. We are on the job and they will be neutralised soon," Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir Zone Vijay Kumar said. He was speaking to reporters after the wreath-laying ceremony for the two Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, who were killed in the attack. "Two militants came on a scooter, most probably from the Pampore side, and opened indiscriminate firing from an AK rifle," the IGP said. He admitted that the module of the Pakistan-based militant outfit had carried out an attack earlier in the Chadoora area of Budgam district as well, in which an assistant sub-inspector of the CRPF was killed. "We are conducting operations and soon, they will be neutralised," the officer said. Responding to a question on militants using two-wheelers to carry out attacks, Kumar said it is easy for the ultras to move around on motorbikes on roads where the vehicle movement is heavy. "We cannot check every vehicle, vehicles are checked based on information mostly. Checking every vehicle will cause traffic jams," he said. The IGP sought to assure people, saying there is no need to panic and "the situation is under control". On the use of virtual phone numbers by militants, he said this technology is a cause of concern but it has been used for subversive activities for years now. "Virtual numbers have remained challenging since the beginning. It is challenging across the world. We are trying to find technological answers," Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/let-militants-behind-mondays-attack-on-crpf-personnel-in-jk-identified-igp-kashmir-898125.html

The kit received a patent certificate from the Central government last week, following which the university has initiated the process of its commercial production, the official from the university said. "The government has been issuing soil health cards to farmers after testing soil from their land, but for this, cultivators have to bring soil samples to the agriculture department's labs and the entire process takes four to five days," IGKV's public relations officer Sanjay Nayyar said. However, with the IGKV's kit, farmers will be able to test soil's content themselves, he said. A team of scientists, led by vice-chancellor Dr S K Patil, had applied for a patent for the kit in 2016 through the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), which the Centre approved last week, he said. Farmers will be able to check organic nutrients, acidic or alkaline nature of the soil and other nutrients including nitrogen and potash using the kit, the official said. This will in turn help them fix the quantity of manure and fertiliser needed for different crops, he added. The kit, which will cost Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,500, will comprise chemical solutions, powders, testing equipment and instruction guide, he said. At least 25 samples can be tested with one kit and in future, farmers will have to buy only chemical solutions which will cost around Rs 2,000, not the entire kit, he said. We have tied up with a company for its commercial production, which will start soon and kits will be available in the market, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/raipur-varsity-develops-soil-testing-kit-for-farmers-898129.html

In the excerpts of the chats of the group filed in the charge sheet, one of the members alleged that RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) people have come to support them. The police further furnished some chats of the group in the charge sheet, in which the group members allegedly used communal slurs and talked about vandalising madrasas, mosques and killing of Muslims. The police filed the supplementary charge sheet on September 26 before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purushottam Pathak against nine persons in the case related to the alleged murder of Hashim Ali during the riots in Gokulpuri area. "As per the chat of Whatsapp group, the accused persons... conspired to teach Muslims a lesson for attacking the Hindus. Equipped themselves with lathis. danda, sticks, swords, firearms etc and killed nine innocent Muslims persons including Hashim Ali and his brother Aamir Khan. It is prima facie revealed that there was a well-hatched conspiracy amongst the accused persons. "Same is also evident from the fact that in order to take revenge from Muslims some youths of that area who failed to perceive the bottomless stupidity of the propaganda, they as saviours of their community created a Whatsapp group. The group members lost their individuality and started working with mob mind. 'Jai Sri Ram' and 'Har Har Mahadev' which are the sacred slogans and are attached to the victorious yelling, deaden their mind and paralyzed their creative nature. They planned the manner of committing offence of rioting, murder and other offences...," police alleged in the charge sheet. In the supplementary charge sheet, police have booked the accused under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) and 505 (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly assembling to take revenge against the other community and targeting the victims on the basis of their religious identity. The accused -- Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Summit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal, Rishabh Chaudhary, Himanshu Thakur -- are currently in judicial custody in the case. "During the investigation and from the report of retrieving data of seized mobile phones revealed that the above-mentioned report/result of Whatsapp group 'Kattar Hindu Ekta', group, it is also clear that there are averments in respect of promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion and acting in a way that are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony," the charge sheet claimed. They were earlier charge-sheeted in June for the offences under 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 427 (mischief), mischief by causing inundation or obstruction to public drainage), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of IPC. The offences entail a maximum punishment of death penalty. The supplementary charge sheet said that the police has sent a letter to the concerned authorities for obtaining the sanction required for prosecution for offences against the state and criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, which was awaited. It said co-accused Monty Nagar, Avdesh Mishra, Monu, Sahil, Shekhar, Mongli, Baba, Tinku and Vinay were to be arrested but their addresses could not be traced till now.             According to the charge sheet, some of the messages sent by the group members were "Do not give them flats on rent", "Their eyes are on our sisters, daughters, land", We will burn everything of theirs like we burned the madrasa today", "Do not leave them, kill them". They also allegedly discussed arrangements of stones, bricks, pistols and talked about the demolition of a madrasa by the mob of rioters, according to the excerpts. It claimed that the mob turned rioters and allegedly murdered Ali by inflicting multiple injuries in a brutal manner and with a view to conceal the evidence, all of them in furtherance of their common intention threw his dead body in the drain. "There cannot be any doubt that the accused who killed Hashim Ali were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly," it said. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/whatsapp-group-promoted-religious-enmity-delhi-riots-charge-sheet-898295.html
06-10-2020||Oasis||Doing one's duty||In the second chapter of the Bhagavad Geetha, in the well known ‘Karma Yoga’ portion, Lord  Krishna expounds on the importance of doing one’s duty in life. Maintaining mental equipoise in the face of life’s inescapable dualities like happiness and sorrow, loss and gain and so on and carrying out one’s work sincerely, to the best of one’s ability, without a casual and indifferent attitude brings great benefits and protects man from immense troubles and suffering. Such an approach makes the mind one-pointed and serene. At this stage, Lord Krishna makes a very important observation. Man is always engaged in doing some act and, save for a few, every act is carried out keeping in mind the benefit.  Whether it is the performance of some rituals or any other-worldly activity, it is personal gain that is the driver. It may be asked whether it is wrong to expect any benefits from one’s actions. The Lord provides the answer. “When you perform your duty, invariably your mind is always seeking the gains and benefits from carrying it out. The mind, instead of concentrating on executing the work efficiently and sincerely, gets distracted by the mirage of the beckoning scenario of rewards. Desire gets the upper hand, morphing into greed most of the time. Mind, already a ‘fickle monkey’ is teased further, making it even more unstable. Instead of attaining freedom from troubles and a poised mind, a man ends up with an even more disturbed mind,  vulnerable to still more disturbances and unsteadiness. One pointedness of mind is lost, leading to imperfections and inefficiency in work, thus causing further trouble. What was sought in the beginning- mental peace is not attained. Whatever little there was earlier is also lost. An unsteady mind can never be calm. Such a mind cannot be thorough and efficient in the performance of work”. The crux of the Lord’s exhortation is that doing one’s work always only with an eye on the final gains is not conducive for either worldly progress or for mental peace. As ordinary mortals, we may not be able to work with absolutely no desire for rewards. But pragmatism tempered with the aforementioned Lord’s advise, with a sane and balanced approach would perhaps be proper.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/doing-ones-duty-897888.html
06-10-2020||Opinion||'Protect preexisting conditions', why Bidencare would be a big deal||On Monday morning, America’s most prominent beneficiary of socialized medicine, in the process of receiving expensive, taxpayer-financed care at a government-run hospital, was tweeting furiously. One of President Donald Trump’s manic missives particularly caught the eyes of health care experts: his exhortation to “PROTECT PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. VOTE!” As always, it’s not clear whether Trump is merely being cynical or whether he is also genuinely ignorant. He’s definitely lying when he claims to have a plan that’s better and cheaper than Obamacare. No such plan exists, and he has to know that. But does he know that Americans with preexisting medical conditions are already protected by the Affordable Care Act, which his administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn? Does he realize that the reason his party has never offered an acceptable alternative to the ACA, in particular an alternative that would protect preexisting conditions, is that no such alternative is possible? That’s less clear. In any case, how the nation votes will indeed make a huge difference to the future of health care — and not just because Trump, if he holds on to power, will almost surely find a way to destroy Obamacare, causing tens of millions of Americans to lose health insurance. Joe Biden, if he wins (and gets a Democratic Senate), will make a big difference in the other direction, substantially expanding coverage and reducing premiums for middle-class families. The second part of this statement may come as news to many readers, because Biden’s health proposals haven’t drawn much attention so far. Why not? One reason is that the election is — rightly — being seen mainly as a referendum on Trump rather than on likely Democratic policy. Another is that since the Democratic primary fight pitted Biden against rivals calling for radical changes in health policy, many people assume that the winner of that fight, who rejected those radical proposals, wouldn’t change much. But while Biden is indeed proposing incremental change rather than “Medicare for All,” we’re talking about some big increments. Independent estimates suggest that under Biden’s plan, 15 million to 20 million Americans would gain health insurance. And premiums would fall sharply, especially for middle-class families. What policy changes are we talking about? To the extent that the Biden plan has received any attention at all, this attention has largely been focused on his proposed introduction of a “public option” — a Medicare-like plan that individuals could buy instead of purchasing private insurance. This option might be a first step toward a single-payer system, but it would be a small step, and in the near term would be much less important than other aspects of the plan. First and foremost, the Biden plan — Bidencare? ObamaBidencare? — would substantially increase the subsidies that currently help many but not all Americans who don’t get insurance from their employers. The Affordable Care Act, as passed in 2010, was underfunded, because Democrats wanted to hold down the headline cost. This meant that premiums and copayments were and are too high for many families. Since then, however, the politics have shifted: Public opinion has shifted in favor of the ACA, the Democratic Party has moved somewhat to the left and Republican willingness to ram through expensive, unfunded tax cuts has encouraged Democrats to be more aggressive. So the Biden plan would increase subsidies and also remove the upper-income limit that prevents many middle-class families from receiving aid. This would cost a fair amount of money: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the price tag at $850 billion over a decade. But it would cost far less than the 2017 tax cut, much of which went to corporations, which were supposed to respond by increasing investment, but didn’t. The Biden plan would also automatically enroll low-income Americans in the public option, which is more important than it might sound. One of the defects of our system is that it’s complex and confusing, and those who need help the most are often the least able to navigate their way to getting it. Ideally we’d just move to a simpler system, but for now auto-enrollment would be an important palliative measure. Oh, and the plan would also provide significant aid for long-term care, rural health, and mental health. None of this amounts to revolutionary change — in contrast to Trump’s efforts to kill Obamacare, which <em>would</em> drastically change American health care, for the worse. But Bidencare would still be, as Biden didn’t quite say when President Barack Obama signed the ACA into law, a pretty big deal. True, America would still fall somewhat short of achieving what every other advanced country has — universal health care. But we’d get a lot closer, and many who currently have insurance coverage would see their costs fall and the quality of coverage improve. So health care, including to PROTECT PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, really does need your VOTE! If Trump wins, Americans will lose that protection and many will lose their health insurance or see their premiums soar; if Biden wins, Americans will keep that protection and many will gain insurance or see their premiums fall.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/protect-preexisting-conditions-why-bidencare-would-be-a-big-deal-897978.html
06-10-2020||Panorama||Protect financial data on web||Notwithstanding the recent headwinds from Covid-19, India’s largely consistent economic growth for more than a decade has precipitated an unprecedented expansion of financial services in the country. With rising disposable incomes, more and more Indians are accessing banking, insurance and mutual funds, among others. However, in an era of the inter-connected world of devices with cyber technology at its core, lack of awareness as well as the prevalence of ill-designed or inadequate security systems is always a challenge. With 160 crore bank account holders, 32.8 crore life insurance and 47.2 crore health insurance policyholders, 2.78 crore registered investors with stock exchanges and 9.26 crore mutual fund accounts, India has a mammoth financial sector. As such, a large-scale cybersecurity enlightenment drive is the need of the hour.   Banks are becoming a popular target for new-age hackers despite being the most secure and sophisticated enterprises. Only last year, the RBI had to direct the banks to secure their customer data after reports of 1.3 million credit and debit card data of Indians found to be on sale on the dark-web came out. According to the latest RBI report, card and internet frauds, more than doubled to Rs 195 crore in 2019-20 from the previous year. Then this year, Religare is reported to have faced data leakage of five million customers and employees. In recent times, unscrupulous hackers have evolved ingenious ways using unique and complex arrays of cyber-attacks to get past the ordinary security systems. The hackers are attempting to get hold of sensitive financial information of individuals, either from banking servers or an individual’s personal devices.  One of the ways of extracting a person’s financial information is by infiltrating his smartphone with malicious applications. When a user wishes to use an app requiring access credentials, a data-theft overlay mimicking the desired app user interface gets displayed tricking the user to think that he is clicking on the genuine app. The unsuspecting user goes on to record the details of his access credentials which now get transferred to the hacker who now also has the app under his control. Going a step further, hackers also embed these fake applications with banking trojans, such as bank bots’ cabarets pink slips intending to attack banks and stock brokerage firms with an eye on making hacking operations easier. These malware lock users using an Active Directory attack further bolting it up with many login attempts. These bots and trojans are focused on stealing money from the bank accounts. Phishing is another type of attack which involves the hacker sending an email to the victim claiming to be a trusted sender (like a bank or online shop), or by way of setting up fake websites claiming to be genuine. A banking trojan is attached to this email. Once the victim downloads it and opens it, the Trojan activates and steals information.  Hackers also employ what is known as macro malware which is developed using programs like VB Script programming language used for MS-Word and MS-Excel. Legitimate-looking files are usually sent via phishing email which comprises of malware-infected attachments such as CV by job seekers and cover letter reports in the form of MS Word files. Now, malware can comfortably hide within a system for a long time that gives hackers ample time to infect the system of users.  First, financial institutions must identify micro malware during the initial phase itself with a view to pre-emptively block it. And for individuals, to protect your information and make India’s financial sector secure, some tips are as follows: never open or download any attachments on your device without knowing the context, Invest in a genuine and licensed antivirus software on all your devices, never click suspicious links within an email that claims to contain genuine intimation and abstain from sharing your personal details on social media.  Therefore, in order to mitigate financial risks and to rule out any breach, concerted steps are needed at both macro and micro levels. Banks and financial institutions must invest strategically towards improving cyber security with a view to protect customers as well secure the larger financial architecture of the country. More importantly, ordinary users need to be made aware of these risks.   (The writer is founder and CEO of a cybersecurity firm)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/protect-financial-data-on-web-897889.html
06-10-2020||Panorama||Language is a permanent political live wire in Tamil Nadu, do not touch, says former Union Minister A Raja||Language is a permanent political issue in Tamil Nadu and the BJP should not touch the sensitive issue of language which is a live wire. “Whoever touches current (live wire) will get an electric shock,” said former Union Telecom Minister and DMK leader A Raja. In an interview to DH’s E T B Sivapriyan, Raja spoke about Tamil Nadu politics, Hindi imposition and the 2G spectrum allocation. Edited excerpts:  Q. DMK has been out of power in Tamil Nadu for the past 10 years and the assembly elections are less than seven months away in the state. What are the DMK’s prospects this time? A. The chances for DMK are very bright on two counts. First, the DMK has proved that it is the only party that is concerned about people’s issues, the needs of the people and highlighting the errors of the governments. All the issues that concern the people have been democratically, legally and legitimately debated within and outside the Parliament. Hence, the DMK has proved under the able leadership of M K Stalin that it is a real democratic party that has stood by issues of the people. Second, the 10 years of AIADMK government has been marred by corruption, misrule, commission. People’s aspirations were not reflected both inside and outside the Assembly. The Edappadi government has miserably failed to fulfil the aspirations and expectations of the people. The government will change and DMK will come to power. Q. For the past 4.5 years, the DMK has been alleging that the AIADMK has surrendered before the BJP and now the BJP is also very aggressive in the state. It has gone on a recruitment drive and is also poaching leaders from the DMK. Why do you think the BJP is quite aggressive in Tamil Nadu now? A. The reason is very clear. It is an ideological fight. Almost the whole of India adopted or shifted to Hindutva politics except a few states. The real political off-shoot of the Dravidian movement is the DMK. In Tamil Nadu, the fight between the DMK and the BJP is not a political one, but the clash of ideologies. Our main opponent admittedly is AIADMK, but the BJP is aggressive because of the ideological war. They want to change the ideological mindset of the people. In Tamil Nadu, people believe in worship and God. Faith in the God or the spiritual value of the individual will not be labelled as Hinduism. People of Tamil Nadu have been cultured by E V R Periyar, C N Annadurai, and M Karunanidhi. They have been successful in making people believe that religion is a personal issue, and it should not come into politics. This distinction was made clear and has been inculcated in the minds of Tamilians. This is the reason we are not able to digest the BJP. Knowing that Tamil Nadu has been resisting this ideology all along, the BJP now wants to propagate themselves in the name of Hinduism. They also believe that Chief Minister Palaniswami (EPS) and his deputy Panneerselvam (OPS) may not survive for another tenure as they are not popular leaders. In the absence of charismatic leaders, they (BJP) think that the ideological alternative can be converted into a political alternative. It will not be acceptable in Tamil Nadu. Q. Do you think people will buy the BJP’s Hindu pride argument? They (BJP) also label DMK as an “anti-Hindu” party. Your comments. A. For the past 50 years, our Dravidian leaders were vociferous in talking about Hinduism. Yes, if at all, one needs to have spiritual space, he can go his way. We have made it very clear that Hinduism never existed as one religion. Yes, people in the past followed Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, Lord Krishna, and Lord Murugan and these were the different schools of religious thoughts that existed in India. When British came to India, they identified Christians and Muslims by their faith, but the remaining, which was the majority, were heterogeneous and they were not following a single god, and everything was different from one place to another. Then, the British wanted to call all these people under one name, and they called them Hindus. This is clear in the minds of the people of Tamil Nadu. I may be conscious about my caste and I may identify myself using my caste, but nobody will create chaos here (in Tamil Nadu) in the name of Hinduism. That is the training which has been given by our Dravidian ideology and that is the reason why Hindutva will not survive here. Q. DMK has been attacking the BJP not just on secularism, but on federalism and farmers legislations that were passed recently. Why does the DMK feel federalism is under threat now? A. Their (BJP’s) thought always is One India, One Language, One Culture, One Tax, and they want to have 'oneness' in India which is not possible. India was never one country before British came here. British came here and merged various princely states to form India. The idea of oneness is not agreeable to the DMK because the party has faith in federalism and our founder Anna stood for that and he said India is a composition of various cultures based on language, not based on religion. So many linguistic cultures have been merged into one box in the name of Union of India. I am a Tamilian as long as I speak Tamil, and I am an Indian as long as I am a citizen of the country. This should not be taken into consideration in contra-position. It should be taken into consideration on the basis of synchronization. I can be a Tamilian and can be an Indian at the same time. If you ask me a specific question on whether you are a Tamilian or an Indian, my preference will first go towards Tamilian. We are against one tax, and one language policy. Fundamentally, and philosophically, the ideology of the DMK and the Dravidian movement is diametrically opposite to the BJP’s ideology and its religious-based policy. Q: Not just the DMK, even common people feel Hindi is being imposed in Tamil Nadu, but the BJP says there is no harm in learning a third language. How do you respond to the BJP’s suggestion? A: Already there are Kendriya Vidyalayas and Hindi Prachar Sabhas where people can learn Hindi. The question is not whether one should learn Hindi. For necessity, any bureaucrat who works in North India or even a trader who goes there, can learn Hindi and that is altogether different. The problem is it should not be mandatory, and it should not be compulsory. When you insist on the compulsory learning of Hindi, we feel that our language is being sidelined and our culture is being assaulted. We want to keep our identity so far as the language and language-oriented culture is concerned. Tamil is a rich language; it is a classical language and it cannot be compared with Hindi. Do not impose Hindi on us. Q: The question that BJP asks is when students under the CBSE stream can learn Hindi, why can’t government school students also learn the language? A: If you make learning of Hindi universal, it is a threat to our language and assault on our culture. Tell me the purpose of a third language? English is the connecting official language and our first PM Jawaharlal Nehru gave an assurance on the floor of the Parliament that English will continue till the time people of Tamil Nadu want it. For all official communication, government to government and government to people and people to people communication, English is enough for us. Learning Hindi has not made us handicap. But imposition of Hindi will assault our ethnical identity and language based culture. Q: The BJP says DMK plays language politics especially before elections and the DMK has been raking up Hindi imposition in the past few months citing incidents involving party MP Kanimozhi and doctors from the state. Your response. A:  Who is responsible for DMK raising the issue? Did Kanimozhi voluntarily invite any problem? You are accusing that the DMK is raising issues at the time of elections willfully. My question is who invited the trouble? What prompted the people in Delhi who are conducting an official meeting to ask people who do not know Hindi to go out. You did it and we are forced to react. Kanimozhi was stopped, and she was confined to react. You are creating problems against our language and you are imposing Hindi on us despite our continuous opposition. Who is doing politics here? It is BJP, and not the DMK. Q: Will language be a major issue during 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly polls? A: Language is a permanent and perpetual issue of Tamil Nadu. When you touch current (live wire), you get an electric shock. It is up to you (Centre). And the moment you touch the language issue, there will be a reaction from the DMK. Please do not shift the responsibility or the onus on us. It is your (Centre’s) responsibility to keep mum and respect our sentiments. Q: Coming to the 2G spectrum case, the Delhi High Court has accepted the plea of the CBI and ED to hear the case regularly. Some say the timing is suspect as it is coming months before TN elections. Your comments? A: I do not want to add political colour to the judicial process. I am a practicing lawyer and I cannot suspect the judiciary because I was put in jail by our own government for reasons best known to them. They believed the CAG report. I have faith in the judicial system, and I do not know for what reasons they speeding it up. Whatever be the reasons best known to them, I do not want to attribute any motive. I can attribute motive to CBI as the BJP might want to make the 2G appeal as an election issue in Tamil Nadu. During the 2011 elections, the then Opposition Leader J Jayalalithaa asked how much physical space was needed to store 1.76 lakh crore. This type of political propaganda may be used by BJP through CBI. However, I have faith in the judiciary. Q: Do you think the 2G verdict will have any bearing on the assembly elections? A: There is no chance of any verdict before elections. The matter before the Delhi High Court now is whether the appeal can be entertained or not and the argument will start on whether the appeal can be admitted. This argument will go. We are raising some legal issues as we feel the appeal should not be admitted as the Prevention of Corruption Act has been amended by the BJP government. Under the amended act, no action can be taken against any government servant till the time there is evidence of receiving any bribe. And the CBI has not been able to provide any evidence against me. I am very clear that truth will prevail everywhere.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/language-is-a-permanent-political-live-wire-in-tamil-nadu-do-not-touch-says-former-union-minister-a-raja-897887.html
06-10-2020||Panorama||Social security for the unorganised: A case of creative story-telling||In his recent ‘Mann ki Baat,’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India has a cultural tradition of story-telling which needs to be revived and continued. The Social Security Code 2020 (SS Code), passed by Parliament without discussion recently, appears to be a serious effort in that direction -- of telling creative stories, promising universal social security to everyone, especially the 93% workers in the unorganised sector, whose total lack of social security was made obvious during the sudden Covid-19 lockdown Importantly, the late T S Sankaran, a former Additional Secretary, Ministry of Labour, had said, when the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security (UWSS) Bill 2006 was being framed, that the components of what constitutes adequate social security, the scale of benefits, the funding arrangements to meet the cost of social security, etc., for unorganised workers, should be built into the law itself and the law should not enable governments to do merely what is expedient.  But ‘expediency’ was what was done in the UWSS Act and has been done now in the SS Code.  The SS Code allegedly draws inspiration from the 2002 Report of the 2nd National Commission on Labour (NCL), which had recommended that the existing multiple labour laws relating to social security should be merged and rationalised into a single Social Security Code. Even the ‘National Labour Law Association’, of which doyens such as the recently-demised R K A Subrahmanya were members, had drafted an “Indian Labour Code” in 1994 itself and spelt out the need for a single unified institutional mechanism of a Social Security Authority of India to provide universal social security. But in the SS Code of 2019, multiple institutions were envisaged.  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour (henceforth, the committee), to whom the 2019 version of the SS Code was sent for review, gave thorough and painstaking comments in its report to the ministry in July 2020. The committee had noted that having multiple organisations would be “a mere continuation of the extant fragmented structure of social security”. The committee wanted the ministry to put in place a more compact system, with mandatory registration of establishments and workers with “one body, instead of with multiple organisations”. But this recommendation has not been heeded. Stakeholders who gave their opinions to the committee pointed out that the 2019 Code was full of stipulations like “as may be specified”, “as may be prescribed”, or “as may be framed” by the central government, bypassing Parliament, and not through ‘relevant provisions’ built into the Code. They pointed out that the government also reserved the right to grant exemptions and raise thresholds for compliance. In response thereto, the ministry stated that “flexibility” to the government was necessary to make modifications. Dissatisfied, the committee exhorted the ministry “to review all such equivocal and cryptic provisions” and bring in an inclusive legislation “with due regard to the powers and privileges of Parliament.” But this recommendation, too, has been thrown to the winds by the ministry in the final SS Code 2020. On the question of what constitutes social security, the committee opined that the definition of social security should be modified “to make it all-encompassing with specific mention of all the nine components contained in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention on Social Security 1952”. But the SS Code 2020 mentions only seven of the nine ILO benefits on which schemes for the unorganised shall be prepared “from time to time”. It excludes family/childcare benefit and unemployment allowance, which were seen to be sorely required during the lockdown. Moreover, there is no time-line prescribed for framing the schemes. Nothing is said about the quantum of benefits, which is a requirement under theILO Convention. The Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (Makaam), too, in its response to the SS Code of 2019 stated that the Code’s approach to social security benefits was problematic as it was “scheme-based, and not rights-based”. It lamented that “there is no unified and/or comprehensive scheme for unorganised workers”. On the raising of resources to fund social security benefits for the unorganised sector, the committee felt that there was a lack of firm commitment on the part of the government and recommended that it be “clearly spelt out in the law”, stipulating the contributions from the employees, employers, central and state governments and other sources. The SS Code was hence modified to say that “aggregators” of gig and platform workers will contribute 1-2% of their annual turnover for creating a fund for the workers, but no similar mechanism, or any mechanism, for raising money from employers of other unorganised workers has been specified. In fact, the Code in Section 141(5)(i) says, the State Social Security Fund is to be created out of the amount received from a ‘composition of offences’ under the Code (whatever that means). The other glaring lacuna is that no mechanism for raising the resources for making the government’s contribution to the funds for unorganised workers has been spelt out while merely saying that the government ‘may’ contribute.  On the manner of implementing social security benefits, the 2nd NCL suggested correctly that area-based schemes are suitable for workers in the unorganised sector, “who are too numerous to be covered under occupation-based schemes”.  The 2018 version of the Code had made the gram panchayats and municipal wards, which are proximate to the workers, responsible for registering workers and delivering benefits. The 2020 Code says that workers’ facilitation centres may be set up for registering workers, but it does not say where these will be set up and who will maintain the records. So, all in all, the 93% unorganised workers in the country will have to continue to wait for the promised social security, as they have always done, and make do instead with the government’s creative story-telling.

06-10-2020||Panorama||Protect your eyes while you work||A large number of people have been forced to stay indoors because of the pandemic. Work from home (WFH) has become the norm as offices remain shut to avoid the risk of infection. WFH means dependence on smaller screens and hand-held devices.   Unlike words printed on paper that have sharply defined edges, characters on a screen, which are made up of pixels, have blurred edges, making it more difficult for the eyes to maintain focus. Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain, describes a group of eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Symptoms and causes The most common symptoms associated with CVS are eyestrain, tired eyes, sore eyes, watery eyes, irritated eyes, blurred vision, slowness of focus change and double vision. Extraocular symptoms can be a pain in the neck, shoulder and back. These symptoms may be caused by poor lighting, glare on a digital screen, improper viewing distance, poor seating posture or uncorrected vision problems. All these causes can be directly linked to makeshift workspaces at home that were never designed to be offices.  However, a major contributor to CVS symptoms, by far, appears to be dry eyes. This condition also happens when you stare into a bright screen for a prolonged span.  While it may be impossible to create the right ergonomics and lighting at home, there are some basic precautions you can take. Here are some simple measures to help you minimise the impact of CVS. These techniques can help you work for longer hours too with the impact on the eyes being minimised.   The first and most important measure is the 20-20-20 technique. Every 20 minutes, spend 20 seconds looking at something 20 feet away. This helps you relax your eye muscles. Second, and equally important, keep blinking. Another unconscious effect of working constantly on a computer screen for long spells is a greatly reduced frequency of blinking. This results in dry, irritated eyes. Instead of a normal blink rate of 20 per minute, while working on a computer, the blink rate is often reduced to only about 5-6 blinks per minute. Keeping the eyes open for long without adequate blinking will result in dry eyes. This is a major symptom that is targeted in the therapy for CVS. The use of over-the-counter artificial-tear solutions can reduce the effects of dry eyes in CVS. Next, you should bend slightly to give the eyes a comfortable focusing distance. The screen should be about 20 inches away from your face. Also, when looking straight ahead, the eyes should be at the level of the top of the monitor. The center of the monitor should be about four to eight inches lower than the eyes. This minimises dryness and itching by lessening the exposed surface of the eyes because they are not opened wide. This distance also allows the neck to remain in a more relaxed position.  Simply put, it is always good to remember the ‘three Bs’ – break, blink and bend. Take a break every 20 minutes, blink 20 times per minute and bend slightly to view the computer monitor 20 inches away from your eyes. Finally, you need to get the right light. Your desk lamp should be shining on your desk, not you. Try to keep window light off to the side, rather than in front or behind you. Position the computer screen to reduce reflections from windows or overhead lights, or use blinds for the windows. In addition, using a flat-screen with an antiglare cover, and wearing glare-reducing or tinted lenses can help you minimise glare.  Talk to your doctor. Have a comprehensive eye exam done by an ophthalmologist every year. It’s an important part of your overall health routine. WFH does not seem to be a short-term measure. With the rising infections and vaccine still a long way away, it will be quite some time before people start moving back into their offices. And, many, going by the benefits of WFH, may continue with this new normal. Taking care of your eyes should therefore be a high priority.

06-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Vanity versus honesty||Some time ago, I happened to travel to Nagpur by train. My fellow traveller in the A/C compartment was a middle-aged businessman and a brief observation of his demeanour suggested that he was more interested in showing off his economic status than striking an acquaintance with me. When he got up to visit the restroom and returned, I noticed that he was about to sit on his glasses. I alerted him and instead of thanking me, he told me that my warning had saved him Rs 30,000. “You know, I got this from the most renowned optical dealer in Delhi and the brand ambassador for this frame is none other than Salman Khan!” he declared as he proudly handed over the subject of admiration to me with a flourish. It had a thin light frame holding a pair of unbreakable glasses and there was nothing special about it to justify the cost. As I wondered what exactly made some people cough up such prices without prompt, the train halted at Vijayawada station. A teenage vendor hopped into our bogie, carrying a bundle of magazines. My ‘august companion’ chose a magazine that cost Rs 20 and handed over a Rs 100 note to the boy. Since the boy did not have the change, my companion instructed the vendor to leave the bundle of magazines on his seat before going out to get the requisite change, while slyly winking at me to display his shrewdness. Plonking the entire bundle on the seat, the poor chap ran out to the book shop on the platform. Before he could return with the change, the train started moving. Sprinting as if his life depended on it, the vendor managed to reach our bogie and hurriedly thrust the change into the eagerly outstretched hand of my companion who counted the money and shouted that he had received only 30 rupees! Ignoring the desperate pleas of the boy that he be permitted to collect his bundle, my companion practically pushed the poor boy out of the moving train and slammed the door shut, even though the boy had provided the correct change! Returning to his seat fuming and pronouncing the entire clan of vendors as ‘cheats’, the fellow did not notice the Rs 50 note stuck to his folded shirt sleeve until I pointed it out! The scenario was so outrageous that I blurted out in utter disgust, “It is the poor boy who has been cheated by trusting you and keeping his bundle on your seat.” Not caring to even see his reaction, I turned my face away and totally ignored him until I reached my destination.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/vanity-versus-honesty-897886.html
06-10-2020||Right in the Middle||A vase from Sweden||There it sits, in a green swirl, elegant in its shape and form, and a daily reminder of a friendship of 65 years ago. Dipak Ghosh and I were 12-year-old compatriots in Calcutta playing Table Tennis for Bengal, when the game was at the height of popularity. Even as youngsters, we had made the grade in the senior section and as he would brush past me for his finals he would mutter a “congrats!” after my victory. I would just have time to call back, “good luck, Dipak!” We once travelled together with my mother to Delhi for a prestigious tournament. He had lost his mother as a child and on that trip, I saw that he grew attached to my mother.  As we entered our teenage years, we teased each other about our crushes, often setting up meetings for the other. Then came the special honour of being selected for coaching by the world-famous Victor Barna. I still remember how we both turned up at the venue with our squeaky new tennis shoes. Next stop-- the Delhi National Stadium and this time we were being coached by Ivan Andreadis, another world champion. This was in preparation for the Asian Championships in Manila. Both of us had been selected to represent India. Then the blow struck! Due to some internal squabbling, the women’s team was not to go. A juicy carrot was dangled by the organiser, “the World Championships will be held in three months at Stockholm. I promise you will be selected and I will make sure you go.” This was poor comfort when I could see the men’s team, which included Dipak, preparing for departure. The rest of the team got up at the break of dawn to wish them. I can still picture my friend looking at me with sadness and guilt. They did very well and later went on to Stockholm, but the women’s team was not sent that year! I had just read that the men’s team was back home from Stockholm when there was a knock at our door. Dipak it was, holding with great care a slim package. “I brought this for you from Stockholm,” he said bashfully. There was no need to say any more. Over the years we lost touch but the vase travelled with me through my life’s journey. Many times I would marvel that such a delicate item had made it safely through the years. Last week, my sister got the news through a friend. Dipak had not made it as safe. He passed away some years ago. Farewell, my friend. The vase will keep your memory alive always!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-vase-from-sweden-898297.html
06-10-2020||Second Edit||Trump’s affliction is irresponsibility||One would have thought that being afflicted by a deadly illness would make a person more sensitive and responsible with regard to dealing with it. Not so, it seems, in the case of US President Donald Trump, who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and is undergoing treatment at a top medical facility. On Sunday night, he left the hospital to go on a drive-by in a motorcade. Sitting in close proximity to him in the enclosed vehicle were Secret Service agents. That he was exposing these agents and their families to infection does not seem to bother him. This is quintessential Trump behaviour -- deliberately violating rules and protocols, selfishly doing what he wants to do, unmindful of the consequences of his conduct for others, and uncaring of the wrong message he is sending out to millions of people. Going by the medicines he is being given -- he is on the steroid drug dexamethasone, and his oxygen levels have dipped a couple of times – he has a serious infection. Yet, he went out of the hospital to impress his supporters. This is appalling behaviour. Right from day one of the pandemic, Trump’s conduct and policy decisions have been out of sync with scientific opinion. For months on end, he downplayed and dismissed the magnitude of the coronavirus threat. He also endorsed hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are unproven as remedies for Covid-19, as game-changing treatment. People listen to what leaders say, even when what they say is obviously stupid. This is especially the case during a pandemic, when no cure is in sight and public anxiety is high. Some Americans heeded Trump’s advice on drinking cleaning agents to keep the virus at bay. Trump has failed America on multiple fronts during the pandemic, whether it is by denying funds for treatment, opening up workplaces and schools too soon or by simply setting a bad example by not wearing a mask. The US has recorded nearly 7.5 million cases and over 210,000 deaths so far on account of Covid-19. Trump cannot escape responsibility for the situation that America finds itself in. Soon after testing positive, Trump said that he had “learned” more about the disease and understood it better. It triggered a flicker of hope that the illness would knock some sense into his head, that he would admit to having invited the infection by not wearing a mask. Instead of calling on Americans to follow protocols to prevent the pandemic’s spread, Trump broke every protocol to perform a political stunt on Sunday. Clearly, Trump is incapable of responsible conduct.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/trump-s-affliction-is-irresponsibility-897882.html
06-10-2020||Second Edit||Timely Nobel for work on another virus||There was special interest in the Nobel prize in medicine this year because the whole world is in the grip of a medical crisis created by Covid-19 and scientists and researchers everywhere are making their best efforts to tackle the challenge. Therefore, the award of the prize to a British and two American scientists for their contributions to identifying and tackling a virus, though very different from the coronavirus, would be considered particularly relevant and appropriate. The prize has been awarded to US scientists Harvey J Alter and Charles M Rice and British virologist Michael Houghton working in Canada for their joint discovery of the Hepatitis C virus, a major cause of liver disease. The Nobel committee said that their discovery has now made it possible to conduct highly sensitive blood tests which helped to eliminate Hepatitis, transmitted through blood, in many parts of the world.  The three scientists’ discoveries also helped in the development of antiviral drugs directed at Hepatitis C and raised hopes of eradicating the virus from the world. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Hepatitis C affects more than 70 million people, and kills 400,000 a year. Millions of lives have been saved by the discoveries of the scientists and the work done on the basis of their findings. It is to be noted that the three scientists worked separately and independently and made discoveries which were complementary, with one building on the other. Alter’s team found that a virus other than those which caused Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B existed and caused infections; Houghton’s team isolated and identified it. Rice finally proved that the newly discovered virus alone caused the till then unexplained cases of Hepatitis caused by blood transfusion. The discoveries led to a greater understanding of the virus and its behaviour.  While the award has been welcomed as a timely recognition of an important medical breakthrough, it is also likely to lead to fresh debates over a much-discussed issue about the Nobel prize. No-one disputes the merit of the award, but it has again drawn attention to the Nobel committee’s rule that limits the award to three scientists, though there are more researchers involved in the work. Houghton had in 2013 rejected an important award for his work because he said it had excluded two of his teammates who had contributed to his discovery. He has accepted the prize now but said that future award committees should recognise larger groups of scientists. This is important because most modern scientific research is a team effort. The contributions of all of them need to be recognised when the work gets recognition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/timely-nobel-for-work-on-another-virus-898292.html

Jose, who was summoned by the CBI, appeared before the investigation team on Monday morning. He was let off in the evening, sources said. The CBI had filed an FIR in a court here under Section 120 B of the IPC and Section 35 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 on a complaint by Wadakkanchery Congress MLA Anil Akkara, listing Santosh Eappen, Managing Director of Unitac Builder, Kochi, as the first accused and Sane Ventures as the second accused. The Kerala government has moved the High Court, seeking quashing of an FIR filed by the CBI, naming Life Mission for alleged violation of FCRA. The Life Mission CEO, in his petition, has submitted that the FIR was "illegal, arbitrary and nothing but an abuse of the process of law and is, therefore, liable to be quashed". The alleged FCRA violation and corruption in the project has snowballed into a major political issue with opposition parties alleging that Swapna Suresh, a key accused in the gold smuggling case, had admitted before an NIA court that she had received Rs 1 crore as commission from the project. Red Crescent, an international humanitarian movement, had agreed to provide Rs 20 crore towards the Life Mission project. The opposition has alleged that there was corruption involved in the selection of the contractor by Red Crescent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cbi-questions-ceo-of-life-mission-897851.html

In just four days there were two million views and this post has almost reached six million, said Rathi. Devika told DH that one of her teachers, Devi, suggested this song to her. Since the school authorities posted it on their social media page it got this much reach. Devika also received appreciation from many music lovers. Kerala law minister A K Balan, who came across her song, also rang up and appreciated her. Devika said that so far she did not get any professional music education.

The MLA, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste, had married S Soundarya at a simple ceremony in the presence of his family members on Monday amid drama as the girl’s father attempted to self-immolate outside the venue. Swaminathan, the father of the girl who works as a priest at a temple in Thiyagadurugam, 235 km from here, in the newly-formed Kallakurichi district, has also moved the Madras High Court accusing Prabhu of abducting his daughter. The court will hear the petition on Wednesday. With her father maintaining that she was kidnapped, Soundarya released a video message on Tuesday afternoon saying her marriage with the MLA took place with her “consent” and that she was neither abducted nor threatened. “I and MLA Prabhu have been in love for the past four to six months. Since my parents objected to my relationship with Prabhu, I stormed out of my house and has now married him. The marriage took place with my consent and not because of any threat. I was neither abducted nor threatened,” the 19-year-old said in her message. The girl’s father said that the family opposed the marriage not because of the groom’s caste but due to the age difference between the two. The first-time legislator is 36-year-old, while the girl is just 19. Prabhu was close to Soundarya’s family for the past 10 years and had enjoyed a good rapport with them and that is how the couple came to know each other. Prabhu told Deccan Herald that his father-in-law was “being tutored” by someone and is making “baseless allegations” against him and his wife Soundarya. The legislator said the family has not been able to conduct any post-wedding ritual due to the controversy owing to allegations raised by Soundarya’s father. The MLA further said though he had known Soundarya for the past 10 years, their relationship began only a few months ago. “The girl’s family did not accept our relationship, but the wedding took place with the consent of my family members. My wife is an adult and she took the decision consciously. To say I abducted her is absurd,” the legislator said. On allegations levelled by his father-in-law, Prabhu said: “Why should I lie? If I lie, people will find out. And this is the social media age where things can change in just a fraction of second and that is the power of the media. Everyone saw what happened on Monday. It is only because of the allegations we are attending phone calls instead of spending time with each other.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-dalit-mla-marries-brahmin-girl-father-alleges-daughter-was-kidnapped-898060.html

06-10-2020||South||AP CM Jaganmohan Reddy meets PM Modi; BJP, YSRCP refute rumours of parties joining hands||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi after a gap of about eight months. The meeting that lasted about 40 minutes at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg came amidst a speculation that the YSRCP, with 21 Lok Sabha (excluding the party’s Tirupati MP who expired last month due to ill health) and six Rajya Sabha MPs, could be joining the NDA government. This is Reddy’s second visit to New Delhi in just over a fortnight. In his 22-23 September tour, Reddy had, interestingly, met home minister Amit Shah, who is recuperating post his discharge from the AIIMS, twice. The CM’s closed-door discussions with the HM then happened days before the Shiromani Akali Dal’s exit from the NDA. The meeting with the PM now has added to the conjecture that the YSRCP may well replace the SAD spot in the NDA alliance. The Tuesday meeting, according to the Chief Minister Office sources, was about various pending issues pertaining to the Andhra Pradesh reorganization act 2014 and funding for various tasks like the Polavaram multipurpose project that Reddy routinely takes up in his Delhi tours. CM Reddy was accompanied by YSRCP Parliamentary party leader Vijayasai Reddy. The meeting that took place in a “totally cordial atmosphere” is believed to have dwelled on the political situation in the state and the centre. Unlike his Telangana counterpart Chandrasekhar Rao, who occasionally displays his outrage over Modi’s policies, Reddy, who is facing the CBI cases for his alleged disproportionate assets, has always maintained an amiable relation with the PM. The YSRCP has been steadfast in its support to the various legislations brought in by the Modi government including the most contentious ones like the CAA and the recent farm laws. BJP and YSRCP leaders DH spoke to have denied the reports about YSRCP joining the Modi government. They, however, have not ruled out the possibility in future. “Even from the Rajya Sabha point of view, there is no such necessity to get YSRCP on board as we are managing to get almost all bills sail through. But yes, the larger opinion of the BJP leadership since the 2019 elections is to expand the NDA. If Jagan or someone else shows such interest, the party would be open to consider the proposition,” a senior BJP leader in Delhi, who is involved in AP affairs, told DH. A few news reports claimed that Modi has offered berths for YSRCP in his cabinet. “There is no proposal to join the NDA, from our or their side. The meeting with the PM is not about such plans,” a YSRCP MP who accompanied Reddy in his Delhi tour said. Political analysts opine there are no compelling reasons for the two parties to join hands now. Mounting an attack on Reddy for the alleged attacks on Hindu temples etc. issues, the BJP is trying to grow in Andhra Pradesh where Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP has weakened noticeably. According to the BJP leader, Naidu is “desperate” to rejoin the NDA. Elections in the state are over three years away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ap-cm-jaganmohan-reddy-meets-pm-modi-bjp-ysrcp-refute-rumours-of-parties-joining-hands-898205.html

A counter-statement was filed by the NIA against the bail applications of the accused in the case - Faisal Fareed, the third-accused, and Rabins Hameed, the tenth-accused. INTERPOL blue corner notices would be issued against the two as well as four others involved in the racket. UAE authorities have assured all support to the NIA investigation, said the statement. The NIA's counter-statement said that most of the accused were not from financially weak backgrounds and had businesses in India and abroad. Many had no previous involvement in the case, and the motive of the accused was threatening the economic security of India and damaging friendly relations of UAE with India. The court on Monday directed the NIA to submit the case diary and offences committed by each accused in the case registered by invoking section of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Around 30 persons have been arraigned by the NIA in the case so far. Bail applications of seven accused are now under court's consideration.

The incident occurred on September 19 in Khammam in Telangana but was revealed after the police came to know that the girl with about 70% burn injuries is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the town. The girl, aged around 12 years, was working as domestic help in the house of the accused.  No case was registered till Monday as the accused’s family apparently tried to hush up the gruesome deed, by providing medical care in a private facility. Not even the girl's family was informed. Khammam police commissioner Tafseer Iqubal and district officials visited the girl, who is now said to be in a stable condition. A suo motu case was registered and her statement recorded. According to the girl, the accused, whom she calls Anna (elder brother), came downstairs “on Saturday at 6 am and demanded her to come and sleep with him.” “When I refused and pushed him away, he poured petrol on me and lit the fire. As I was screaming for help, he came near to hush me and tore off my clothes. He had poured petrol all over, the fire has charred me everywhere,” the girl, with severe burns all over her body except the face, said.

Chandrashekhar Rao has warned that his government would construct a barrage at Alampur-Pedda Marur to lift three TMC of irrigation water daily if Andhra Pradesh government moves ahead with “illegal projects like Potireddypadu” on the Krishna river. Rao stated that his stand in the apex council meeting convened by union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday to resolve the water sharing issues between the two states. The virtual conference was also attended by Andhra Pradesh CM Jaganmohan Reddy. “The injustices meted out to Telangana in river water allocation has resulted in separate statehood movement. Telangana is ready to protect its farmers’ interests and would not keep quiet if the AP government attempts to usurp our water rights. The irrigation water share we lost during united AP will be reclaimed,” Rao said according to a statement from the CMO. In a move objected by Telangana, the Reddy government had in May issued an order for allocation of Rs 6829 crore for the Rayalaseema Lift Scheme and supporting canal system to draw three TMC per day from the from Pothireddypadu Head Regulator on the Srisailam reservoir. Rao said that “it was unfortunate and painful that despite Telangana lodging complaints, the AP government is going ahead with the projects.” AP CM Reddy submitted that the Pothireddypadu/Rayalaseema Lift scheme is essential to provide water for the chronically drought-prone areas of Rayalaseema - Kurnool, YSR Kadapa, Anantapuram, Chittoor, and SPSR Nellore and Prakasam districts. Rao said that the state government had filed a petition in the Supreme Court as the Centre did not respond to their demand of constituting a new tribunal for Krishna under the Interstate River Waters Disputes Act of 1956. The Telangana CM however agreed to withdraw the case in the Supreme Court to enable the Centre to move forward on referring the water sharing issues to the tribunal, after taking due legal opinion. The second meeting of the council set up as per the terms of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act – 2014, has also decided to shift the Krishna River Management Board to AP from Hyderabad. The centre has also announced its decision of notifying the jurisdiction of both KRMB and Godavari RMB. Telangana CM has dissented on this but as per the APRA-2014, no consensus is needed, the ministry of Jal-Shakti said. Both Chief Ministers agreed to submit the Detailed Project Reports of all projects taken up in their respective states. The Jal Shakti minister assured that the technical appraisal of all these projects would be carried in the shortest possible time frame.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/krishna-waters-dispute-telangana-cm-threatens-to-construct-barrage-at-alampur-898289.html

Munish Moudgil, director of the state Covid war room, said that as per information only about 40% of contacts of known Covid-19 sufferers state-wide are coming forward for testing. Deputy commissioners, district health officers and zilla panchayat CEOs across six randomly chosen districts in the state said the problem is widespread in their jurisdictions. In Tumakuru district, a senior government health official said that as much as 40% of people who come under the ambit of targeted testing refuse to get tested. “There is an inherent fear that they will be isolated in hospitals,” the official said. Priyanka Mary Francis, IAS, who is a member of the Rural Districts Testing Task Force, said that resistance to testing is most noticeable among the working-class, especially those who are asymptomatic. “Most people think that if they are asymptomatic, they are fine,” she said. In Hassan district, Zilla Panchayat CEO B A Paramesh corroborated the problem of asymptomatics' resistance to testing but clarified that those with symptoms had no such reservations. “Every day, we get nearly a thousand people with symptoms lining up at the district hospital for testing from 10 am to 5 pm. Out of this, about 300 test positive daily. This indicates a test positivity rate of 30%,” he said. In Bengaluru, Rajendra Cholan, Special Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), said that the number of contacts rejecting testing is about 10%. In the last one week alone, the Palike registered 1,16,370 contacts (including 56,048 primary contacts).  However, Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad added that the Palike has adopted a no-nonsense attitude to testing contacts and suspected Covid patients. “This is why our testing numbers have increased to 33,000 per day,” he said. Before September 28, the Palike's six-day testing average was 26,000 per day, according to the data. Cholan clarified that a list of all Covid contacts plus those showing symptoms of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) are sent out daily to mobile testing teams who have the task of tracking down the individuals for testing.  He added that those who continue to refuse would be hit with punitive measures under the provisions of the National Disaster Management Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-faces-covid-19-contacts-challenge-897862.html
06-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19 patients crisscross district borders in search of quality health service||Thousands of Covid-19 patients are crossing inter-district borders in a bid to secure quality health services. The viral disease has triggered patient overload in some districts, besides spiking the mortality rate. An expert analysis has revealed that the Mortality Moving Growth Rate (MGR) is highest in Bengaluru Rural, Kodagu, Shivamogga, Chamarajanagar, Uttara Kannada, and Ballari.  Coincidentally, healthcare infrastructure is weak in some of these districts. Others, however, have adequate infrastructure but in turn, are attracting hundreds of patients from underdeveloped neighboring districts. In Ballari, for example, a high number of positive cases and deaths are being reported because interdistrict patients are occupying the district’s limited medical infrastructure. “Except for the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, there are not many options for hospital care in Koppal, Ballari, and Raichur,” a source said. In Dharwad, which has better facilities, 17 of every 100 patients are from other states, explained District Deputy Commissioner Nitish Patil, who added that people are coming from eight other districts. “This was causing a lot of pressure on our medical infrastructure, but numbers have slackened since the end of September,” Patil said. While medical infrastructure has been improved in these poorer districts, a lack of confidence in local services is prompting some to flock to Hubballi, Patil further added. Another district that is faring poorly is Chamarajanagar. “The district is among 10 of 272 in mega states which has witnessed the highest surge in the 30-day Moving Growth Rate,” explained Sanjeev Mysore, convenor of Jeevan Raksha project, a public-private partnership that analyses Covid-19 trends across the country. According to the analysis, 3% of the deceased patients in the state were brought dead to the hospital and 17% of the deceased died on the same day of admission. This indicates that the containment management in the state needs substantial improvement.  Scene in Bengaluru  Bengaluru Rural has also been reeling from a spike in deaths. The district’s 30-day Mortality Moving Growth Rate is 73.2%. P N Ravindra, DC of Bengaluru Urban, attributed this to a strike by National Health Mission staff with severely curtailing medical services. “This elevated our fatality rate to 28%, but as of last week, this has come down to 14%,” he said. Bengaluru Urban was another popular destination for Covid-19 patients from surrounding districts such as Bengaluru Rural, Tumakuru, Kolar, and Ramanagar. But Tumkur District Surgeon Dr T A Veerabhadraiah said that cases going to Bengaluru had reduced over the last three weeks following an improvement in the local healthcare ecosystem. “Previously 10 to 12 patients were going to Bengaluru Urban for treatment per day. Currently, it is about one to two,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-patients-crisscross-district-borders-in-search-of-quality-health-service-897868.html

He added that he was unaware of the basis on which the Goa government has been filing a contempt petition against the state in Supreme Court. Joshi told reporters here on Tuesday that the tribunal had given its award and the state government has allocated Rs 500 crore for the work. The state has also applied for forest clearance to the centre. "Goa Chief Minister Dr Pramod Sawant announcing the filing of contempt petition in the apex could not be understood. We are right and state will pursue the project," he said. Regarding raids on the residence of KPCC president D K Shivakumar and his family members, Joshi said, Income Tax Department or CBI does not conduct raids overnight. People are watched for long and based on that raids are conducted.  He demanded that Shivakumar instead of making allegations against the BJP should have declared his assets before coming into electoral politics and becoming an MLA. He should know about his present assets. The Congress leader cannot talk like Satya Harishchandra. CBI did not raid Shivakumar’s residence in wake of bypolls to the two assembly segments, he added. Joshi denied commenting on the BJP candidate for the by-election to Belagavi parliamentary constituency. Earlier, Joshi visited the residence of union minister Suresh Angadi who passed away recently and paid homage to the departed leader.

According to reports, over 80,000 fake accounts were created on various social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram across countries and continents. As part of the campaign, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, who is an officer of the rank of Director General of Police, had also been targeted over the last three months. “Several social media account holders are trolling the Mumbai Police commissioner on different platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and are using abusive language against him and the force,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said. She said that two FIRs have been registered against those account holders under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act. “Most of these accounts are fake and we will be taking action against all those fake account holders,” she said. One FIR was filed against a person who used a morphed image of the official Twitter account of Mumbai Police Commissioner recently. “We have started the probe in both matters,” she said. As per the Cyber Police’s preliminary analysis, the slanderous or abusive posts were uploaded from India and even several countries in Europe, Scandinavia, south-east Asia and other global locations targeting the Mumbai Police. Many of the posts used hashtags #justiceforsushant #sushantsinghrajput and #SSR – that were trending on popular social media platforms. Activists like Prashant Bhushan and Maha Vikas Aghadi government constituents have welcomed the development.  Maharashtra Housing Minister and NCP leader Dr Jitendra Awhad said that 80,000 fake accounts were created all around the world to abuse, malign Mumbai Police and that the larger conspiracy was to malign the Maharashtra Government. “80,000 fake accounts were created on various social media platforms on June 14 to discredit Mumbai police and Maharashtra government over the investigation into the death of SSR. Mumbai Police Com has asked the Cyber Cell to investigate and register cases under the IT Act. Great!,’ he tweeted.  “To be honest, action is never taken on fake accounts and trollers because police never had faced the fire in the SSR case they investigated…What next?,” he tweeted. “Welcome the decision to investigate the social media racket in the SSR case as demanded by me. Soon, we will share very crucial information to the government with respect to social media accounts which were solely generated by the BJP IT Team to promote conspiracy theory in SSR case and defame Maharashtra,” state Congress General Secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. Shiv Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Priyanka Chaturvedi said: “After Mumbai Police revealed that they are investigating 80,000 plis social media handles created to defame Maharashtra government and  Mumbai Police. There is a rush of BJP MPs wanting to take up the coveted opening of beings trolls in the IT cell. They realise its the best way to rise.”(sic)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-police-to-hunt-down-social-media-trolls-maligning-cops-over-sushant-singh-rajput-case-897992.html

Two fire brigade personnel were injured on Monday during the operation. They were rushed to hospital and later discharged after treatment. The fire broke out around 4.30 pm on Sunday in the ground-plus-three-storey structure, located near Juma mosque in Masjid Bunder area, the officials said. It was initially tagged as a 'level-3' (major) fire, but later escalated to 'level-4' (massive), they said. Seventeen fire vehicles, as many jumbo water tankers and three turn-table ladders have been pressed into service. Firefighters are on the spot and efforts are still underway to douse the flames, a fire brigade official said. The cause of the blaze was yet to be ascertained, he said. As the building has godowns housing garments, cutlery and chemicals, thick smoke was emanating from it, making it difficult to put out the inferno, another fire official earlier said. He said this is probably the first time after the 2012 blaze in the state secretariat that a fire fighting operation has gone on for so long in the metropolis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-market-fire-yet-to-be-doused-even-after-40-hours-898015.html

We will continue to fight for our right,” Sawant tweeted. On Monday, the Chief Minister had said that the state government had evidence collected by his officials related to the illegal diversion of water from the inter-state river basin via the Kalasa-Bhandura canal, would be part of the contempt petition. "We are filing a contempt petition with evidence to show how they have diverted water. There is no pressure on us from the Centre. There will be no injustice on Goa from the Centre. For me the Mahadayi (Madhei in Goa) is not a political issue, it is an issue linked to my heart," Sawant had said on Monday. A special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government on the same issue is already pending before the apex court. The SLP has challenged the award of the Mahadayi Interstate Water Dispute Tribunal, which allowed Karnataka to divert 13.42 TMC water from the river basin. Sawant has said that the contents of the award were "damaging to Goa". Goa and Karnataka are battling out a two decade-long dispute over the sharing of the Mahadayi river in the Supreme Court, after both parties expressed reservations about the award by the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Bhandura project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-files-contempt-petition-in-supreme-court-against-karnataka-for-illegal-diversion-of-mahadayi-water-898034.html
06-10-2020||West||Gujarat to launch 'Digital Seva Setu' phase-I in villages on October 8||The Gujarat government will on Thursday launch phase-I of the 'Digital Seva Setu' programme, under which 3,500 village panchayats have been connected with 100 MBPS optical fibre network to facilitate online availability of public welfare services. Announcing this at a press conference here on Tuesday, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said the programme, an initiative under the Centre's BharatNet project, is meant to ensure optimum utilisation of technology for public welfare and will bring in a "historic administrative revolution". As part of the programme, public welfare services will be made available at the e-gram office in each panchayat and villagers will not have to go all the way to taluka or district-level offices. "The work connecting 3,500 village panchayats (through optical fibre network) has been completed. "On October 8, the programme will be launched in 2,700 villages as model code is in force in the remaining villages that fall under the eight Assembly constituencies where by-elections are scheduled on November 3," Rupani said. By December this year, 8,000 village panchayats will be provided with this service, he said. The 'Digital Seva Setu' aims to provide fast and faceless services to people by removing corruption or the need of middlemen, Rupani said. "We are starting with 20 services, and will slowly offer 50 services to villages. All the 14,000 gram panchayats in the state will be covered under the programme," he said. "The system makes use of digital service and removes corruption in administration... we will complete the work of connecting the remaining villages by 2021," he said. The programme has been initiated under the Centre's BharatNet Project that aims to connect village panchayats through optical fibre network, with Gujarat being the project leader, having laid around 83 per cent of the optical fibre network, government officials claimed. Under the 'Digital Seva Setu' programme, gram panchayats will be connected to the state data centre at Gandhinagar. The 20 services to be offered initially to villagers under the programme include ration cards, affidavits and certificates for widows, residence, caste, senior citizen, language-based minority, religious minority, nomad-denotified, and income certificates. A 'talati' (revenue officer) has been given the power to provide affidavits at the village level so that beneficiaries do not have to visit the notary offices in towns and cities, Rupani said. Use of e-signature in place of physical signature has also been facilitated so that a beneficiary gets the required documents, made available in a digital locker, at the click of his/her mobile phone, he said. Citizens will have to pay a nominal fee of Rs 20 for each service, a part of which will go to the village panchayat, the chief minister said. The initiative is the digital avatar of the 'Seva Setu' programme that was started by Rupani in 2016 wherein a cluster of eight to ten villages was formed and a team of officers administered the programme-related camp of a particular cluster.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-to-launch-digital-seva-setu-phase-i-in-villages-on-october-8-898040.html

Acting on a complaint, the Rajkot crime branch nabbed Paresh Zalavadia (35), owner of New Ideal Agency, a wholesale pharmacy, said inspector V K Gadhvi. Earlier, another accused Rajnikant Faldu, a medical representative of a reputed pharma company, was arrested for a similar offence. Remdesivir is in high demand and dealers are supposed to keep record of sales of the drug, which can only be sold against doctors' prescriptions, the official said, adding that Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also keeps a track of these transactions. Recently, the complainant, Dr Anand Chauhan of Anand Clinic, learnt that Zalavadia had submitted bills to the Rajkot Food and Drug office claiming to have sold 24 remdesivir injections worth Rs 46,473 to him, which the doctor denied, Gadhvi said. Based on the complaint, the crime branch initiated an inquiry and arrested Zalavadia for forging bills in Dr Chauhan's name and selling the injections to others, he said. "Zalavadia acquired the injections from the other accused Faldu. We are now trying to trace the buyers of these injections," Gadhvi said. The accused have been booked under the charges of forgery, cheating and under provisions of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-pharma-wholesaler-held-for-black-marketing-of-remdesivir-898064.html

The medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences' (AIIMS) last week ruled out murder in Rajput's death, and termed it "a case of hanging and death by suicide". Rajput, 34, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. The Mumbai Police probed the matter initially before the CBI began its investigation into the case in August following a ruling by the Supreme Court. The high-profile case also saw a tussle between the Maharashtra and Bihar police. "Maharashtra was battling Covid-19. At such a time, a conspiracy was hatched to defame Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maharashtra," Deshmukh told reporters here. "...some parties tried to defame Maharashtra, Mumbai Police. They should apologise to Maharashtra or else, the people of Maharashtra will not forgive them," the minister said without naming any party. He also asked Devendra Fadnavis, who is the BJP's in- charge for the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls, whether he will campaign for former Bihar police chief and JD(U) leader Gupteshwar Pandey, who had "defamed" Maharashtra and Mumbai Police in connection with the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/state-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-seeks-apology-from-those-who-defamed-maharashtra-898072.html

He said 50 years ago, a scheme of organic manure was dumped by the Centre because it was developed by indigenous brains but there is no alternative before the world today. "The entire world is returning to the basic elements of Indian thought process to practice developmental ways while being environment friendly after being battered by coronavirus during the last six months," said Bhagwat at an event in Kota. He was addressing a function on the 100th birth anniversary of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh leader Dattopant Thengadi. Praising Thengadi’s foresight and his works, Bhagwat said the agriculture was never a subject of trade in India but the world sees it as agriculture economics. "We have seen this as a means of worshipping Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of glory, not as a means of conducting trade," he said. He said the agriculture's economics aspect is not bad but people fail to see that a section of people seeks to exploit others for the business. He said Thengadi’s birth anniversary celebration is for showing gratitude to the work done by him. He said there is a need to create an agriculture that nourishes the whole world. "We have to adopt ideal agricultural practices based on experience and proven evidence. India has ten thousand years of agricultural experience, so it is not necessary to take anti-environment practices from the West," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/world-looking-up-to-indian-ways-of-life-amid-covid-19-mohan-bhagwat-898104.html

Advocate Satish Maneshinde, who represents Rhea and her brother Showik, said that the family and lawyers of SSR are raising doubts on the probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and report of All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS). The statement of Maneshinde came on the day when the judicial custody of the Chakraborty sister-brother duo was extended by another fortnight till 20 October. Rhea (28) and Showik (24) were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) when WhatsApp chat surfaced vis-à-vis the drugs angle in the case during the investigations by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED). The bail applications of the Rhea and Showik, who have been accused of sourcing and purchasing drugs for Sushant, had been rejected by the Magistrate’s Court and Special NDPS court and are now pending before the Bombay High Court. Maneshinde said that while the FIR registered in a police station in Patna by Sushant’s father Krishna Kishore Singh has been transferred to CBI, the complaint by Rhea against the actor’s sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh in Bandra police station has been forwarded to the CBI. "CBI is independently and impartially investigating both the cases and the agency is supposed to be insulated and free from any interference,” Maneshinde said. “It is disturbing to learn that the family of SSR and its lawyers are interfering and tampering with the investigations by bringing pressure on the AIIMS team of doctors by speaking to them during investigations and releasing purported audio recorded conversations and information to the media in order to bring pressure and tamper with potential witnesses,” he said. “The SSR family lawyer (Vikas Singh) is supposed to have said that he is going to meet the CBI Director to get the family’s pre-determined path of investigations in SSR death. It is very disturbing to read such information in the media as attempts are being made to get a pre-determined result in the case,” he added. Any further attempts to interfere and tampering in the investigations would be brought to the notice of the appropriate courts, Maneshinde said. Meanwhile, in a related development, Priyanka and Meetu moved the Bombay High Court to get the FIR against them quashed. Rhea has accused them of administering medicines based on a bogus prescription. "A bare perusal of the complaint and the FIR shows it does not make out any cognisable offence. The drugs that have sought to be allegedly given by Dr Tarun Kumar are not banned drugs", the petition said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sushant-singh-rajputs-family-lawyers-interfering-with-investigation-rhea-s-counsel-898109.html

The court also awarded five years imprisonment to the fifth culprit under the IT Act for circulating a video clip of the incident. The rigorous life imprisonment until natural death was awarded to Hansraj Gurjar, Ashok Gujar, Chhotelal Gurjar and Indraj Gurjar for gangrape by the special court that deals with cases under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. All of them were charged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the SC/ST Act and IT Act, said public prosecutor Kuldeep Jain. He said Hansraj was convicted under an additional section of the IPC for repeated rape. “The court sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment till the time of natural death,” Jain said. The incident took place on April 26 last year when the four men raped the woman in front of her husband at an isolated place on the Thanagazi-Alwar bypass in Rajasthan. The four had gangraped the woman, extorted money and filmed the video of the incident. The FIR in the case was registered on May 2. The case had triggered widespread protest and was condemned across the country. “Fifth culprit Mukesh Gurjar, who had circulated the video clip, was convicted under sections of IT and was awarded a maximum of five years imprisonment,” Jain said. He said there is one more accused, who is minor, and his trial is going on in a juvenile court. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot welcomed the judgement saying it sets an example of how swift inquiry can lead to justice being delivered in a short span of time. “All investigating officers, police and administrative officials in this case deserve appreciation.

The Covid-19 peak may have passed in mid-September, possibly during 10-20 September 2020, considering various parameters,” said Dr Gilada, Secretary General of Mumbai-based Peoples Health Organisation (India). According to him, to date, India has done over 8.1 crore tests and recorded 66,87,247 Covid-19 infections with a cumulative positivity yield (Covid-19 test positivity rate among tested samples) of 8.3 per cent. So far, India has recorded 103,629 deaths due to Covid-19, of which 70 per cent were patients with co-morbidity. India recorded 97,859 cases on September 16 -- the highest single-day number of Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic. Between September 9 and 19, the country recorded daily cases between 90,000 and 98,000. From September 20 to October 1, India's recorded daily cases were between 80,000 and 90,000, except on September 28 when 69,671 cases were recorded. After October 1, the recorded daily cases have been between 70,000 and 80,000.  “The downward trend is not linked to low testing numbers. In fact, the daily testing numbers have been on the higher side. Of the 8.1 crore total tests done, 3.1 crore were done in September itself, averaging 10,42,750 tests daily,” said Dr Gilada. Looking at the parameter of active cases, the highest number of active cases was on 17 September, at 10,18,454, whereas it has been on a downward trend since then with 940,631 cases on September 30 and 920,740 on October 5, he said.  As regards the loss of lives, India recorded the highest number of daily deaths on September 15 at 1,283 (except for 2,006 on June 16; which was due to an adjustment of old unrecorded deaths). The country recorded 886 deaths on October 5; which was the second-lowest since September 1, lowest being on September 28 at 777. “Passing of the peak is indeed the most important goal; however, subsequent surge can come, as seen in several countries of Europe. India being a vast country, some states may have different peaks. However, the states that matter the most for influencing Indian Covid-19 statistics – viz. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu have passed the peak. But, we cannot lower our guards. Mask remains the most important tool, till we have a vaccine or cure or both,” added Dr Gilada.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/worst-phase-of-covid-19-in-india-may-be-over-says-doctor-898182.html

The victim, a 22-year-old resident of Dahod district, came forward to lodge the complaint with the help of the activists who counselled her and took her to the police station. The FIR states that the victim, belonging to the Bhil tribe, was working as a farm labourer along with her husband in Anjar taluka of Kutch district. The farm owner, identified as Ranchhod Ahir, allegedly raped her on the evening of September 16 when she was alone in the farm where she also lived, the report adds. The FIR says that the victim left the farm with her husband who reportedly had to sell his phone to arrange for bus tickets to return home. Days later, the victim informed Man Singh, President of the Dahod unit of the Majur Adhikar Manch, a union of migrant workers. She was then taken to Ahmedabad where she was counselled and the legal team of the union led by Ashok Samrat and Ramesh Srivastava approached the Sabarmati Police station where, after several representations, the zero FIR was registered on Tuesday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Zone-2, Vijay Patel confirmed that the FIR was registered and was sent to the concerned police station in Kutch district. A release by the Majur Adhikar Manch's secretary Mina Jadav stated that "reports of such abuse of tribal migrant agriculture workers by farm owners are common" as thousands of tribal workers migrate to work as wage sharecroppers in agricultural farms of Saurashtra and the north Gujarat region. They migrate with their families and mostly stay on the farm during the entire crop season. It says that away from home and with hardly any local support, such workers are "highly vulnerable." The release claims that "reports of sexual abuse at workplace are very common. The workers allege that sexual harassment is even used as a means to deprive the workers of their hard-earned wages."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/22-year-old-tribal-farmworker-raped-by-landowner-in-kutch-898234.html
06-10-2020||West||Gujarat: Lawyers' body president held guilty of criminal contempt of court||The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday held advocate Yatin Oza, who is also the president of Gujarat High Court Advocates' Association (GHCAA), guilty of criminal contempt of court in a suo motu case for his remarks on the judiciary during a press conference in June this year. The court will be pronouncing the punishment on Wednesday. A division bench of the high court of justices Sonia Gokani and justice N V Anjaria pronounced the judgement holding Oza guilty. The operative part of the order uploaded late on Tuesday evening stated, "In view of the discussion above, this court in the exercise of powers conferred upon it under Article 215 of the Constitution of India and section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, holds the respondent contemner (Oza) guilty of committing criminal contempt of this court within the meaning of section 2(c) (i) of the Contempt of Courts Act,1971." On June 5, Oza had made several serious allegations on the Facebook live press conference. He had said, "The High Court is an absolute gambling den today, wherein only billionaires can gamble. If poor people gamble for five rupees at home, the police would arrest them. This is the situation of the High Court. High Court can file a contempt petition against me." Oza had said this to make a point that during the lockdown it was difficult to get petitions listed for hearing in case the lawyers or clients were not influential. Days later, the high court took suo motu cognisance of his remarks and issued a notice for criminal contempt. During the pendency of the contempt petition, a full-court stripped Oza off his "senior advocate" status. In the court, Oza tendered an unconditional apology but the court didn't consider it. While rejecting the apology, the division bench had said that a "clear and loud" message needed to be sent out that the judiciary is "open to every healthy criticism respecting the fundamental right of freedom of expression," but at the same time "attempts to tarnish its prestige will not be tolerated." The bench headed by justice Gokani commented that "Any attempt to scandalise the court and browbeat the judges and thereby undermining the authority of the institution in our opinion cannot be taken lightly." In order, the bench refused to believe Oza's argument that his remarks were a result of "emotional outburst" and said that "One cannot be oblivious that this institution for its credibility, trustworthiness and its independence, continues to rule in the hearts of common man to be its last resort against every kind of arbitrariness and violation of fundamental and human rights and to term it as a gambling den, as the Senior Advocate and the President of the Bar with authority, facts and figures and in the meeting of Press with ‘all requisite responsibilities’ could not be said prima facie to be the result of emotional upsurge or a momentary phase."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-lawyers-body-president-held-guilty-of-criminal-contempt-of-court-898249.html
