Opening up has risks. Not opening up has other worries. Some have lost a loved one to Covid-19. Others have faced severe restrictions due to the lockdown or quarantine. There are harrowing stories emerging of some who are unable to cope as they are cooped up in their homes. Young audiences, all a bundle of youthful energy, desperately want a way out of this situation that has snatched them away from friends and locked them in with parents. A recent survey by a Bengaluru-based organsiation reported that “students registered 41% increase in emotions of anxiety/fear/worry, 54% increase in anger/irritability/ frustration…” This is a worrying state of affairs. We would want young audiences to take pause and approach the challenge with ways that are simple and potentially powerful. Call it a strategy, if you will, but it is more than that because it will help us manage not just the immediate but also cast a long shadow on how we shape up and emerge from this situation. Can we come out of the lockdown as citizens who are smarter, wiser, and equipped with at least some tools and experience to manage the change of a high order? That would be such an asset.  The story we need to tell ourselves is that six months, even a year, is not a very long time in our long and happy lives. This may not be easy for young minds to fathom as many of us grow with the idea that a year, particularly an academic year, is too much to lose. This is the Indian context. Globally, many students do take time off to travel, to do projects elsewhere, and away from their universities. It becomes a source of good learning that is a very different form of academic achievement. So think of this as an opportunity where you can use your head, heart and hands to nurture the self. When we are 50, 60, and 70 yrs of age, we can hopefully look back to these days and tell our children and grandchildren some powerful stories about how the world changed one fine day in March 2020, when an unseen, unheard of and unknown species wrought collective havoc on mankind by the changing the way we lived, dramatically, drastically and maybe decisively. So what is that story of the lockdown that you treasure? A good way to begin is to make a new friend, a very different friend, a close person who we live with but don’t know fully and well enough. This is yourself, the innerself, the ocean that is embodied in you. Think about you – do you know yourself, do you really understand yourself, do you really “meet” yourself? Let this be the beginning of a new enquiry. The first problem: Nothing is predictable. But look again, and think again. Is this really new? Uncertainty was always there – right from our birth. That this uncertainty is manifest today in itself makes it less uncertain. Come one day, and there will be a nasty surprise. We are in waters we know are uncertain. This is better than being in waters that we think we know but actually do not. In sum, don’t take the standard prescriptions for granted. Instead, Enquire. This is our head at work. Source of joy Second, amid this uncertainty, what is it that brings me joy, happiness and an element of playfulness. Books and certificates apart, it is good to pick up an activity that is a source of joy, a new discovery, an element of fun – and usually something we have never tried before. Is classical music a source of joy, or painting, or singing, or just dance? Or could it be listening to distant radio broadcasts or reading the classics? Explore. This is our heart at work. It is not easy to always talk with meaning and connection to our loved ones. But we must equally know that one of the biggest regrets of many successful people is that they did not spend time or talk or listen in to what their loved ones had to say. Do you have a parent,  a grandparent, a sibling, who you haven’t sat down to listen to in years? Do it now. Make it an ongoing conversation. Write it as a diary. These treasures will hold out for a long time. Engage. This is our heart at work. Many youngsters know that stress at work and in school means that they eat in not very healthy ways. Their sleep habits are equally unhealthy. Here is an opportunity to govern these two. One of the best diets offered is the one that probably your mother follows – eat as much, as long as you cook it yourself. You know the ingredients, you understand the oil, you know the masalas. Pick up cooking as something that will stay with you forever – whether you are a boy or a girl. Prefer traditional, Indian, food. Roti-daal or idli-dosa is preferred to pasta and pizza. Why? Because, in the former, you usually start from scratch with the most fundamental ingredients. Let your family senior be the guide. Then, with everybody around, and to your heart’s content, Eat. This is your heart and your hands at work. Enquire, Engage, Explore, Eat. This will also drive a routine that can regulate the day and help us sleep well. Sleeping well and deep of course will help give the energy to exercise till you break out into a sweat, with mindfulness in every breath. There will still be some who need help to do this, and if you feel you are anxious, feeling low or easily disturbed and often not in the mood, do not hesitate to reach out to your trusted friend or adviser – in the house or outside.

31-10-2020||First Edit||India-US: All but formal allies now||This week’s India-US ‘2+2’ dialogue between the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries once again showed that India and the US are inexorably and perhaps inevitably, if only very slowly, moving towards an ever-tightening strategic embrace. Inexorably, because the two countries started moving close in the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War and the dawn of a new geopolitical landscape, and have continued to do so through the terms of all US presidents and Indian prime ministers since then, acquiring a broad and deep political consensus in both countries. Indeed, that this round of the 2+2 meetings happened just a week before an expected change in leadership in the US symbolises the strength of that consensus and was perhaps the message that New Delhi and Washington DC sought to send out. Inevitably, because China is making it so. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA), the signing of which was the centrepiece of the 2+2 meeting this week, is the last of the three so-called ‘foundational agreements’ that facilitate interoperability and cooperation between the US and Indian militaries. BECA will enable India to obtain militarily critical data in real-time from the US. The two countries had earlier signed agreements on naval logistics and on the integrity of military communications. India and the US conduct more military exercises together every year than either country does with any other nation. The two countries are now at a stage when entering into a formal alliance is all but a political decision away. From Delhi’s point of view, so long as Beijing observed the many agreements and arrangements put in place to maintain peace between the two countries, India could arrive at a modus vivendi with China and did not need to move into a close military embrace with America. And, as the US noted after this week’s meeting, India remains reluctant to do so even now. For years, Delhi has said that there is space for both India and China to rise at the same time. Since Xi Jinping took power in Beijing, however, China has seemed to disagree with that proposition as its ambitions, and aggressiveness, have soared. If Beijing continues on this path, India will have no choice but to firm up its security arrangements in the region and beyond. There are immense challenges and perils that China, India, the US, and indeed the rest of the world, are faced with – climate change, massive job losses worldwide due to technological advancements, future pandemics and other disasters. Going down a path of the strategic competition will only accelerate all these global perils and make all three countries less capable of facing up to them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/india-us-all-but-formal-allies-now-909340.html
31-10-2020||In Perspective||Pope Francis: Turning the Catholic world on its head||He calls himself after his role model, St Francis of Assissi and strictly follows his edict “where there is despair, let me bring hope…”  He is also a Jesuit who emulates the warrior saint, Ignatius of Loyola in standing up like a true soldier to fight injustice in this world. Among the many social reforms he has introduced during his papacy, one stands out for its courage and compassion. Francis has been a daring advocate of homosexual rights. He has supported the cause of gay persons whom he calls “the children of God.” He has courted opposition from his peers. He has earned the disapproval of conservative members of the church. Now, by articulating the latest reform which extends support to same-sex civil marriages among his “flock,” Pope Francis has finally turned the Roman Catholic church on its head. He has shocked his followers worldwide and courted the displeasure of his clergy. Although they were all fully aware of his empathy towards people with a different sexual orientation, this is the first time that he has openly declared his startling views regarding their marriage. If the church frowns on same-sex marriages, and its conservative members view this latest papal declaration as a deviation from accepted church values, he probably does not care. Like his many other unconventional departures from orthodox practices, this modern-day head of the Vatican seems all set to improving an institution that has become decrepit and unsuitable to changing world order. If the church does not consider homosexuality as sinful, then why deny gay people the right to marry and live like a family, is the pope’s argument which can hardly be questioned. One wonders if his 1.3 billion followers will accept his views on this sensitive subject and its repercussion on church practices. Catholics who follow the precepts laid down by their church and simultaneously owe a strong allegiance to its highest authority are now trapped in a Catch-22 situation. Believing for generations that the Pope is their undisputed spiritual guide and mentor whose word is law; and, also believing that they must not violate the teachings of the Church which is their pillar of moral support, they will now be in a quandary with one working against the other to demolish their age-old ethics. Spiritual mentor They can neither discard those beliefs nor disobey their spiritual mentor. Francis has rocked the very foundation of faith and morality in followers of Roman Catholicism by his revolutionary ideas. He has literally cornered his followers by his latest edict. Do they follow the dogmas practised in their church for centuries? Or, do they obey their spiritual leader to whom they have sworn allegiance? Again, the pope’s statements ever since he assumed office have seemingly contradicted themselves. This has given leverage to his critics to question his views on sensitive subjects like this one. For example, he published a book in 2010 where he asserts that “same-sex marriage is a weakening of an institution which has existed for thousands of years ….” Does this mean he has changed his views on the subject? Or that he has grown more tolerant and shed his prejudices? Although, even at that time, he was known to have called upon his fellow bishops to support civil unions among homosexuals as a feasible compromise which theyhad flatly refused. By 2013 however, when he was ordained as pope, Francis was more categorical. In 2014, the newly ordained pope calmly asserted there is a stream of corruption in the churches including a gay lobby! In 2016, Francis returned to his favourite subject. “When a person who is gay arrives before Jesus, Jesus certainly will not say, ‘Go away because you are homosexual?” he told a stunned audience. Come 2019, he was brutally frank and declared that lesbian tendencies “are not a sin.”  Yet, whether the pope is asserting church dogma or voicing his personal views, there is so much compassion in his statements and actions that sets him apart in the stifling climate of the Vatican. His LGBT parishioners, long used to sneers and disdain from the clergy, have found a friend in Francis who has sworn never to abandon them. The latest move in this direction is the appointment of an African American to the exalted position of cardinal. It is a reiteration of Christ’s teachings which exhorted his followers to show more compassion to the “leper, the beggar, the fallen woman.”  Francis begs the same compassion for the lesbian, the transgender, the marginalised. Anything wrong in that?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/pope-francis-turning-the-catholic-world-on-its-head-909342.html

Accordingly, uniformity in the painting, symbol, messages written on the wall, vehicle colour, and design of units have been completed in the three gram panchayats under a pilot exercise initiated in Udupi district. In Dakshina Kannada district, the branding of solid waste management units had been completed in Irebandadi and Kaukradi gram panchayats. In Udupi district, units at Maravanthe in Kundapura, Kadur at Brahmavar taluk and Varanga at Hebri taluk were uniformly branded. SBM officials from Udupi said the initiative was taken up as part of 'Swacchotsava-Nityotsava' which is observed throughout October, according to the directions of the government. Each unit was named as ‘Swaccha Sankeerna,’ and the vehicle, as ‘Swaccha Vahini’, for collecting garbage. The staff, known as ‘Swaccha Karmikaru’, will have a uniform. The unit will have a uniform symbol and colour. In the unit at Maravanthe, located on one-two acres of land at Bhagathnagara, garbage is collected every day from shops and hotels, and once in a week from houses. On average 250 to 500 kg of garbage is collected daily. Varanga gram panchayat also collects 300 to 400 kg of garbage daily while in Kadur gram panchayat, one quintal of garbage is collected daily. All these gram panchayats have been earning income by selling dry waste for the maintenance of the units. Swaccha Bharath Mission Udupi coordinator Raghunath said of the 155 gram panchayats in Udupi, already waste management units had come up on 113 gram panchayats. A total of 55 gram panchayats are managing waste effectively while the remaining have been collecting only dry waste.

Similarly, Police Band is a vital, rather providing the lifeline music, feature of both Dasara and also Mysuru Palace. Police is basically meant to maintain law and order in the society. However, the special wing of the Mysuru City Police plays melodious music, instrumental, and enthralls connoisseurs of music and also other people, with both Indian classical and Western music. Police Band is inseparable for both Dasara and Mysuru. The present Mysuru Police Band traces its origin to 1868 and has evolved over the past one and a half century, assuming different names, at various points of time. Following Western influence on the Wadiyar kings of Mysuru, the Engliish Band was started in 1868, after Tenth Chamaraja Wadiyar was coronated, following the death of his adopted father, also maternal grandfather Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. Initially, J T D’Fries, a Frenchman, headed the Band, with musicians drawn from the best music schools. The English Band was meant to play ceremonial music to welcome dignitaries and also to play western music during banquets. Gradually, the troupe also started to play Carnatic music. Thus, it had two wings – Indian Orchestra and English Band. It has to be noted that Tenth Chamaraja Wadiyar, a musician himself, was a great patron of music. Musicians like Veena Subbanna, Veena Seshanna, K Vasudevacharya, Veena Padmanabiah, Mysore Karigiri Rao and Bidaram Krishnappa were encouraged and patronised in the court of Tenth Chamaraja Wadiyar. The band came to be known as the Palace Band under the patronage of Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the successor of Tenth Chamaraja Wadiyar. Nalvadi, also a musician and a patron, similar to his father, invited well-known musicians from Europe to train the band members. During his period, a separate Band House was constructed on the road leading to Vasantha Mahal Palace, in Nazarbad, now housing the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET). The road was later named after Dewan Sir Mirza Ismail. The Band House now houses the office of the City Police Commissioner. A band stand was also built at Nishad Bagh, now known as Kuppanna Park, for the band to give performances. After Independence and after India becoming a Republic, in 1951, the Palace Bands (Indian Orchestra and English Band) were integrated into the Police department. The sanctioned strength was 56 and 34 musicians respectively. Thus, it was called Mysuru Police Band and was renamed as Mysuru Government Orchestra later. However, it is famous as Mysuru Police Band. In 1958, its base was shifted from the Band House to the building of the Mounted Police Company, on Lalitha Mahal Palace Road. As per the Police department, the Mysuru Police Band plays music during government functions, such as banquet and tea parties; during Mysuru Palace functions such as Dasara and Janmastami; during Police sports events; during visit of VIPs and VVIPs; during functions as per the orders of the Inspector General of Police; on second Sundays, only Carnatic Band, at Brindavan Gardens of Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, on payment by the State Director of Tourism; during Saturdays and Sundays, both English and Carnatic bands, in several parks of Mysuru city; and in functions on payment, subject to the conditions laid down by the government. Keeping pace with changing times, the band also plays contemporary compositions. Recruitment to the Police Band is based on merit and a majority of the musicians come from renowned music schools, with talent and experience. Some of the members of the band play more than three instruments, when the need arises.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/police-band-upholding-a-legacy-since-1868-909642.html

The villagers have grown worried over the frequent loud sound from beneath the ground, followed by vibrations/mild tremors for five to six seconds. Many mud houses in the said villages have developed cracks due to the vibrations. Initially, this strange phenomenon would occur once in two or three days. Now, it occurs every day. The people are scared to sleep in their houses, fearing a major tremor, say the panic-stricken villagers Mahantesh Biradar, a resident of Malghan told DH, “On Saturday, we heard a loud sound and a big jolt. Kitchen utensils fell down from shelves in several houses. This strange phenomenon has created fear among the villagers.” Villagers are more worried about the fact that the Kudgi NTPC plant and Almatti reservoir are in the close vicinity. Malghan villagers attribute the loud sounds and vibrations to a massive pit being built on 900 acres to store fly ash at Kudgi thermal plant. However, there is no clarity on the sounds from beneath the ground. Even the district administration is finding an answer to this strange phenomenon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/strange-sounds-vibrations-trigger-panic-in-vijayapura-villages-909658.html

The CM also defended Munirathna against allegations of electoral malpractices leveled against him by the Congress. “Whatever allegations are being made against him will be answered by way of making him win by a margin of 40,000-50,000 votes,” the CM said. Yediyurappa urged party workers to go door-to-door. “You have to make people come out and vote. The voter turnout shouldn’t be less than 70%,” he said. Munirathna, a film producer, was disqualified last year under the anti-defection law and joined the BJP. He is up against the Congress’ Kusuma Hanumantharayappa and Krishnamurthy V of the JD(S). Yediyurappa hailed Munirathna for prioritising the development of the Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency. “The government has provided Rs 820 crore grants to Rajarajeshwarinagar. This includes Rs 111 crore for lakes, Rs 488 crore for roads, Rs 90 crore for major stormwater drains, and so on,” Yediyurappa said. He also promised that he along with Munirathna would be responsible for “building a home for every person” in the constituency. Speaking to reporters, Yediyurappa said the atmosphere in Rajarajeshwarinagar was pro-BJP. “We aren’t indulging in caste politics. We don’t have to do that. We want to take the SC, ST, OBC, and everyone along,” he said. Asked about allegations against Munirathna that he was distributing cash to voters, Yediyurappa said they were baseless. “It’s our Congress friends who are doing politics by giving cash. Now that they know they’re losing, they’re hurling such allegations. ”The Congress has accused Munirathna of defecting to the BJP for monetary benefit. “I swear before Goddess Rajarajeshwari that I didn’t accept any money. It’s because (Congress) didn’t focus on development that I and 14 others left. I’m even ready to swear before Lord Manjunatha in Dharmasthala,” said Munirathna.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/help-munirathna-become-minister-bsy-tells-voters-909628.html

He said that "politics played after the attack in the country is an example of to what extent can people go for their political interest." Modi was speaking on the occasion of Rashtriya Ekta Divas (National Unity Day) to mark the 145th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadia in Narmada district that houses the "Statue of Unity." Modi said that he would never forget the incident in which brave soldiers sacrificed their lives."  The Prime Minister referred to a statement made by Pakistan's science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhary in Pakistan National Assembly where he termed the "Pulwama attack an achievement of Imran Khan government."  Without naming any individual or party in particular, Modi said that he would never forget the "kind of statements made on the incident" for "selfishness" by some people for their "political interest." Modi urged "such political parties to work in the interest of the security of the country and for the morale of our security forces." Modi, who inaugurated 17 tourist facilities at the site of the world's tallest statue, also said that "some people have come out in support of terrorism which is a matter of concern for the whole world." He said that there is a need for all the countries, governments, religion to unite against terrorism. Modi said that "unity of India is the power which keeps others on their toes. They want to make this diversity our only weakness." He said to identify such "forces and remain cautious." After this speech, Modi also spoke to probationary civil services officers through video conference. Later, he will be inaugurating the first seaplane service connecting Kevadia to Ahmedabad. Without taking names, the PM said that "India's perspective and attitudes towards borders have changed... those eyeing the land of India are getting a befitting reply." he said that "India is building hundreds of kilometers of roads, dozens of bridges and many tunnels on the borders... India is fully ready to protect its sovereignty and integrity."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pulwama-attack-truth-revealed-after-claims-in-pakistan-parliament-pm-modi-attacks-opposition-909448.html
31-10-2020||National||PIL filed in Supreme Court for regulating social media platforms to prevent hate speech, fake news||A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre to frame a separate law for regulating social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, and hold them responsible for spreading hate speech and fake news. Petitioner-advocate Vineet Jindal also sought a direction to the Union government for establishing a mechanism for automatic removal of hate speech and fake news within a short span of time. The petition filed through advocate Raj Kishore Choudhary pointed out freedom of speech and expression was broadly understood as a notion that every person has the natural right to freely express themselves through any media. However, freedom of expression is a complex right. Article 19(2) of the Constitution provided for a number of grounds for imposing reasonable restrictions on this right. "These are the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence," it added. Maintaining that everyone must take cognisance of fundamental duties enshrined in the Constitution, the petitioner cited a number of communal incidents, including of recent Delhi riots, communal violence in Pune in 2014, Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013, where social media played a role of incitements. Emphasising the need to hold social media platforms directly responsible for spreading hate speeches in the country, the petitioner said, after a local communal incident, we rarely asked what was the role of social media and how had the social media age changed the way in which communal violence was engineered. He pointed out the Australian Parliament has passed a legislation to crack down on violent videos on social media, despite furious reaction from the tech industry, media companies and legal experts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-filed-in-supreme-court-for-regulating-social-media-platforms-to-prevent-hate-speech-fake-news-909449.html
31-10-2020||National||Plea filed in SC against 1991 law on maintaining character of religious places||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of a 1991 law which created "arbitrary and irrational retrospective cutoff date" of August 15,1947, for maintaining the character of places of worship-pilgrimage against encroachment done by "fundamentalist-barbaric invaders and law breakers". In a PIL, BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay contended the Centre has barred the remedies against illegal encroachment on the places of worship and pilgrimages of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs, who cannot file suit or approach a High Court. He sought a declaration from the court that the provisions of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 was void and unconstitutional for being violative of fundamental rights to equality, practice one's religion and maintain religious places, among others, as the law validated ‘places of worship’, illegally made by barbaric invaders. "Hindus have been fighting for restoration of birthplace of Lord Krishna from hundreds of years but while enacting the Act, Centre has excluded birthplace of Lord Ram at Ayodhya but not the birthplace of Lord Krishna in Mathura though both are the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the creator," he said.  Maintaining that restriction to move court against the principle of rule of law, and secularism, he claimed if Ayodhya case had not been decided by the Supreme Court's Constitution bench on November 9, 2019, Hindus would have been denied justice even after 500 years of the demolition of the temple. Upadhyay contended that under the Hindu Law, the deity and its property is never lost and devotees have right to sue a wrongdoer for restoration of deity and its property. So, illegal encroachment by other faith doesn’t yield any right and equity in favor of usurper. He claimed that the Centre has no power to close the doors of courts and bar judicial remedy against illegal encroachment on the places of worship and pilgrimage. In June, Lucknow-based Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh had already filed a plea in the top court questioning the validity of the provisions of the 1991 Act. The move has assumed significance as there have been demands to resume litigation on Kashi-Mathura, related to temples of Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna respectively, in Uttar Pradesh. A suit in Mathura court has already been admitted for consideration. Muslim scholars organisation, Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind had already approached the top court to oppose the plea, saying it "will create fear in the minds of the community with regard to their places of worship, especially in the aftermath of the Ayodhya dispute and will destroy the secular fabric of the nation".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-filed-in-sc-against-1991-law-on-maintaining-character-of-religious-places-909461.html

A 'Hindu India' would not be Hindu at all, but a "Sanghi Hindutva state", which is a different country altogether, says Tharoor in his new book 'The Battle of Belonging' that was released on Saturday. "People like me want to preserve the India we love, and not turn our beloved nation into the kind of religious state we were brought up to detest," he said. Tharoor also asserted that Hindutva movement rhetoric echoes the bigotry that India was constructed to reject. In the book published by Aleph Book Company, Tharoor makes a stinging critique of the Hindutva doctrine and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which he says is a challenge to, arguably, the most fundamental aspect of Indianness. Devoting a chapter to the 'Hindu Pakistan' controversy in the book, the former Union minister writes: "I had inveighed against the ruling party’s attempts to create a Hindutva version of Pakistan, since that was not what our freedom movement fought for, nor was it the idea of India enshrined in our Constitution." "This is not just about the minorities, as the BJP would have us believe. Many proud Hindus like myself cherish the inclusive nature of our faith and have no desire to live, as our Pakistani neighbours are forced to, in an intolerant mono-religious state," he writes. Tharoor's reported comment last year that the BJP will pave the way for creation of a "Hindu Pakistan" had sparked a controversy with the party demanding his apology over the remarks. Hinduism, as Swami Vivekananda asserted, teaches the acceptance of difference as a basic credo, Tharoor said in the book. "Hindutva is not Hinduism; it is a political doctrine, not a religious one," he said. "What is bizarre about the media drama over my remarks is that no one who was giving airtime to multiple BJP voices, frothing at the mouth about my words, actually asked them one simple question: 'Is the BJP giving up its dream of a Hindu rashtra?'" Tharoor said. BJP apologists point out that the government has done nothing to amend the Constitution, and others have suggested that the Supreme Court's ruling that secularism is part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution makes the idea of a 'Hindutva Pakistan' impossible, he said. "But the fact is that both have only been held at bay by the simple fact that the BJP has not had the numbers required to achieve their goal -- two-thirds of both Houses of Parliament and half the states," he said. Their overwhelming victory in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and winning a plurality of seats in the Rajya Sabha in June 2020 has ensured that they finally have all the elements needed to fulfil their "project", he said, adding that the nation has been "warned". Tharoor argues in the book that the battle is between two opposing ideas of India or what might be described as ethno-religious nationalism versus civic nationalism. In a sharp criticism of the CAA, Tharoor said it is the first law to question a basic building block of the nation -- that religion is not the determinant of our nationhood and, therefore, of our citizenship. At a time when India's major national priority ought to have been its flailing economy, whose plummeting growth rate had already aroused widespread alarm even before the coronavirus struck, the Modi government plunged the country into an unwanted political crisis of its own making with the CAA, he said. "With its penchant for shock-and-awe, the government pushed through Parliament legislation that fast-tracks citizenship for people fleeing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh -- provided they are not Muslim. By excluding members of just one community, the new law is antithetical to India's secular and pluralist traditions," writes Tharoor. "The religious bigotry that partitioned the country with the founding of Pakistan has now been mirrored in pluralist India. As I told my fellow parliamentarians, that was a partition in the Indian soil; this is now a partition in the Indian soul," he said. The Hindutva movement is the mirror image of the Muslim communalism of 1947; its rhetoric echoes the bigotry that India was constructed to reject, Tharoor said. Its triumph would mark the end of the Indian idea, the Congress leader added. In the book, Tharoor also delves into the issue of the slogan 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' allegedly becoming an "acid test of Indian nationalism" and reiterated his stance that no Indian should be compelled to mouth a phrase that is nationalistic in the eyes of some, but not in his own. Revisiting the 2016 controversy involving Muslim legislator Waris Pathan, who was suspended from the Maharashtra Assembly soon after for refusing to utter the slogan, Tharoor noted that some Muslims say, "'Tell us to say Jai Hind, Hindustan Zindabad, Jai Bharat, we'll do it -- but do not ask us to say Bharat Mata ki Jai'." "The same Constitution that, in our civic nationalism, gives us the right to freedom of speech, also gives us the freedom of silence. We cannot put words in people's mouths," he asserted. Tharoor also criticized the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated on August 5, 2019, saying Modi shocked the nation with an announcement on Kashmir that could well turn out to be the "political equivalent of demonetization"||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/triumph-of-hindutva-movement-would-mark-end-of-indian-idea-shashi-tharoor-909511.html

Addressing the IAS probationers through video conference from Kevadiya in Gujarat, where he paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 145th birth anniversary earlier in the day. Modi told the probationers that they were entering the service at a crucial juncture when India is about to enter the 75th year of its Independence. "A government does not run on policies alone. People for whom the policies are meant need to be involved. People are not the receiver of the government's policies and programmes. They are the real driving force," he said. "So we should move from government towards governance. You will be faced with two ways, one of comfort, name and fame, another of struggle, difficulties, problems. But I can tell you from my experience that you will face real difficulties when you choose an easy way out," he said. "The turn at which the country stands today, the role of you bureaucrats is of minimum government, maximum governance. You have to ensure how to reduce your interference and also ensure empowerment of common people," he said. "I would also request that whatever decision a civil servant takes should be in the national interest and meant to strengthen the unity and sovereignty of the country and keep India's constitutional spirit high," the PM said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/minimum-government-maximum-governance-pm-modis-mantra-to-ias-probationers-909529.html

In its memorandum, the two prominent organisations said that they have no intention to create any hurdle in the process of investigation and made it "very clear" that journalists will fully cooperate with the investigating agencies. However, Jaishankar Gupta and C K Nayak of Press Association and Anand Sahay and Anant Bagaitkar of Press Club of India said that it was brought to their notice that some of the journalists are frequently summoned to the police stations for interrogation by the investigative agencies in connection with cases of arrests of fellow journalists. "It has been observed that the journalists, most of them accredited to the Government of India, are called to the police stations and made to wait for them for hours seriously hampering their normal professional duties. They were asked routine questions and let off in the night or after long hours, directing them to appear again," they said. They added, "In our view, this creates hurdles in discharging their professional duties, especially in view of the pandemic crisis created by Covid-19." "We wish to make it very clear that journalists will fully co-operate with the investigating agencies. The best possible way is to contact the concerned journalist(s) and interrogate him/them on a mutually agreed and convenient date, time, and venue. The venue can be either near his home or office and it should be completed in a stipulated time so that the journalists can perform their professional duties also," the memorandum said. "We have no intention to create any hurdle in the process of investigation and in fact of the view that truth should prevail in the case, guilty should be punished and let the law take its own course," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/police-calling-scribes-for-interrogation-making-them-wait-for-long-hours-2-prominent-media-organisations-909540.html

There were reports in a section of the media that Ghosh might be removed from the party post before the polls as the central leadership is not happy with the inner squabbling in the state BJP. "The reports are not only baseless but also misleading and politically motivated. I want to categorically say that West Bengal BJP will fight the assembly election with Dilip Ghosh as its state president. There is no question of replacing him," Vijayvargiya told PTI. West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu, known to be close to Ghosh, said, "Dilipda was re-elected for three years this January, after completing his first term. There is no question of his removal". Ghosh himself said he is "loyal soldier" of the party and is not aware of any such report. The speculation gained momentum after the party's state unit witnessed a major organisational change recently. The incumbent state general secretary (organisation) Subrata Chattopadhyay was removed and his deputy Amitava Chakraborty was elevated to the post on Wednesday. The change shocked many in the BJP state unit as Chattopadhyay, who had held the post for several years, was considered to be close to Ghosh. The organisational change had come just a day after the BJP central leaders in charge of the state stepped in to resolve differences between its state Yuva Morcha president Saumitra Khan and Ghosh, who had dissolved all the district committees of the youth wing last week. According to sources, Khan, a Trinamool Congress turncoat, is considered close to the party's national vice- president Mukul Roy, who was himself an erstwhile member of Mamata Banerjee's party . After having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades, BJP has emerged as the main rival to the ruling Trinamool Congress. It won 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general elections. BJP leaders have exuded confidence that it will end Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's 10-year rule in the assembly election wbich is due in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-change-of-bjp-guard-in-west-bengal-kailash-vijayvargiya-909588.html

Addressing the new graduates at the eighth convocation of Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram, he said a sense of despondency overtook the scientists at ISRO due to the failure of the first two augmented satellite launch vehicles (ASLVs). "I still remember the events in ISRO related to the failures of the first two Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicles (ASLVs). "Even though a sense of despondency overtook us initially, we did not allow this setback to override our resolve to succeed," he said. "The critical analysis and the in-depth assessment of the problems we made and the technology and quality issues that we addressed really paved the way for the success of the present generation of Polar Satellites Launch Vehicles (PSLVs) and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicles (GSLVs)," Kasturirangan said. In analysing the failures, the scientists got an insight into the 'inadequacies' and the nature of the initial design. The courage of conviction made the scientists to work with redoubled vigour to succeed, he said. According to the ISRO website, of the four launches, two of the ASLV missions were 'unsuccessful' in 1987 and 1988, respectively. PSLVs has become 'trusted workhorse' for the scientists at ISRO following their history of successful launches and also for placing the satellites into the intended orbit. On GSLVs, ISRO said it recorded six consecutive successful launches since 2014. Advising the new graduands, Kasturirangan urged them to have a strong conviction, the persistence to follow through conviction and the courage to face failures. "I have often felt that life can teach you (students) more from a failure than through success," he said. Kasturirangan, also former Chairman of National Education Policy 2020 Committee, said the policy has been crafted to ensure that it touches the life of each and every citizen consistent with their needs and necessities. "The approach is to realise a new system aligned with aspirational goals of 21st-century education while remaining rooted to India's value systems and ethos," he said. The policy provides an integrated, yet flexible approach to education, he said. The major emphasis was given in the policy to the aspect of holistic multi-disciplinary education as a base component at all levels of education, he said. Stating that IIIT Design and Manufacturing was offering futuristic and multi-disciplinary courses with a blend of design and engineering, he said: "institutes with such a profile will transform our nation into a hub for design and manufacturing." "The institute is playing a critical role in the country's efforts towards Make in India campaign launched by our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi). The pace of making in India will be accelerated by the focus on design in India," he said. Kasturirangan, who is the Chancellor of the Central University of Rajasthan, said even though there was a preponderance of graduate programmes with a focus on single or sub-discipline (courses), there is an emergence of interdisciplinary graduate programmes. As many as 306 students graduates were awarded degrees virtually during the convocation, a press release said. For the current academic year 2020-21, the Institute launched three new M Tech programmes in advance robotics, power electronics system design and computer science and engineering. Y Aditya Verma bagged the institute's gold medal for the best graduate student while Vidhathri received a gold medal for a best dual degree student. Another student B Gowri Muraleedharan was awarded the institute's gold medal for best postgraduate student across M Tech courses, the release said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/critical-analysis-assessment-paved-the-way-for-success-of-pslvs-gslvs-former-isro-chief-909594.html

However, he was proud that courts in the country kept functioning amid the pandemic, he said. The CJI was speaking after inaugurating the Nyay Kaushal e-Resource Centre and a virtual court for the Maharashtra transport department at the Judicial Officers Training Institute here. The Nyay Kaushal Centre is the first e-resource centre in the country providing the facility of e-filing cases in any court in the country, officials said. CJI Bobde said that while the courts continued to function after the outbreak of coronavirus, the access to justice became dependent on technology. It created an obvious distinction between those who could afford the technology and those who could not and this created unintended inequality, he said. "I am told by the chairman of Bar council of India and other members that some advocates suffered so much that they had to switch to selling vegetables and there were reports that some wanted to end their careers and some wanted to end life," he said. Therefore it was important to make technology available everywhere, he said. Some states have introduced mobile vans which provide Wi-Fi connectivity which litigants and lawyers can use, he noted. "We must remove these inequalities and that I think is going to be our next emphasis. This E-Kendra, these two facilities we are inaugurating today, is a step in that direction," the CJI said. Many more centres will be opened and "this has to be done on war footing" to remove the inequality created by lack of access to technology, he said. Pointing out another problem the online functioning has created, the CJI said that junior lawyers say that earlier they could get work when they attended the court and got noticed, which does not happen when courts function online. "They are not being exposed to the litigation as only the senior lawyer can be seen on the screen and due to lack of exposure their professional chances are receding," he said. "There is a famous statement about access to justice -- it should not be like Ritz hotel, it should be open to all," he said. The CJI also spoke about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) would change litigation and the judicial system. The AI makes it possible to search for information in a vast database within seconds, he said. He also expressed concerns about the disposal of motor accident claims, saying about 30 per cent of pending cases in all high courts are of motor accidents claims. With Artificial Intelligence, these cases can be dealt with speedily, he said. He also said that the police should devise new methods of serving a summons in cases under the negotiable instruments act, because delay in issuing summons is a major problem in these matters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/inequality-created-by-lack-of-access-to-technology-must-be-removed-cji-s-a-bobde-909600.html

If the people do not stop “playing with honours of daughters and sisters” by concealing their identities, "the Ram Naam Satya journey will start", said the chief minister in a stern warning. “The Allahabad High Court had yesterday said the conversion should not be resorted to solely for the marriage and it should not be given validity,” said Adityanath, adding his government is also “taking a decision to check love jehad sternly”. The chief minister made the remarks while addressing a rally for the November 3 byelections for the Malhani assembly seat in Jaunpur and that of Deoria. “We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities, if they do not mend their ways, the Ram Naam Satya journey will start,” said Adityanath. "The posters of those involved in love jehad will be put on all road crossings," he said Referring to the Mission Shakti programme of his government, the chief minister said the programme is meant to ensure the safety, security and honour of women, but if anyone still dares to indulge in any misadventure, the Operation Shakti is underway. “The court’s verdict will be followed and the honour and dignity of women will be ensured,” he declared. In Deoria, he said, an attempt was made to illegally grab the ashram of renowned saint Devraha Baba following which he was forced to shift to Vrindavan. This has prompted the BJP government to start building a hospital there in his name, he said, adding the academic work too will start there from the next session and the people of the area will also get expert medical treatment. Claiming that the rule of mafia and goonda elements has come to an end in the state, the chief minister said the Samajwadi Party chief is today worried because he had sympathy for such elements but the government has launched a drive against them. Attacking the Congress, SP and Bahujan Samaj Party, the chief minister said their governments had worked on the basis of caste while the BJP government is working for all sections of the society with complete sincerity, honesty and devotion. The chief minister said seeing the massive support to his party, the Samajwadi Party, out of desperation, is conspiring to instigate riots in the state where no such incident has taken place for the past three and half years nor would it be allowed at any cost. Asserting that the government jobs are no longer up for sale in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said in three and half years during his governance, over 3.50 lakh youths have got government jobs. Those who try to sell jobs are now promptly sent to jail, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ram-naam-satya-journey-will-start-if-people-don-t-stop-playing-with-honours-of-hindu-daughters-sisters-yogi-adityanath-909601.html

The girls had then sought a ban on wearing of half pants by the boys. The girls have the last laugh as the same khap panchayat now directed the boys to not roam in public wearing shorts as it is 'distasteful' and against the ''cultural traditions''. ''The boys must not roam in the markets in shorts...those found doing so will be punished,'' Naresh Tikait, president of the powerful 'Baliyan' khap, said. ''The elders had objected to the wearing of the shorts by the boys...it does not look good if they (boys) roam in the villages and markets in half pants,'' he added. Tikait, who was also the president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), said that the khap panchayat had earlier banned the girls from wearing jeans and carrying mobiles. ''The girls had then requested us to impose a similar ban on the boys, who wore half pants....their demand is proper,'' he said. According to another member of the 'Baliyan' khap panchayat, a youth from Muzaffarnagar district in the state had been caught roaming naked after winning a bet. ''The incident had then sparked tension in the area,'' he remarked. Khap panchayats are known for their bizarre diktats. They had earlier banned love marriages and marriages in the same 'gotra' and vowed to punish those, who married without the consent of the family. Though the diktats of the khap panchayats have no legal sanctity, they are followed in the rural areas, especially, in the regions where the khap panchayats are powerful.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-banning-jeans-for-girls-khap-panchayat-in-uttar-pradesh-bars-boys-from-wearing-shorts-909604.html

Here are the top stories of October 31, 2020: India's Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) fell below 1.5 per cent on Saturday, the Union health ministry said, crediting the Centre-led strategy of 'test, trace, track and treat' for keeping coronavirus-related deaths low and within the manageable number. Deaths per million population in the country stand at a very low level of 88, it said The ministry said 23 states and union territories in the country have a CFR lower than the national average, while 65 per cent of the total deaths so far were recorded in five states. The Hindutva movement is the "mirror image" of the Muslim communalism of 1947 and its triumph would mark the end of the Indian idea, says senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, asserting that Hindutva is a political doctrine, not a religious one. A 'Hindu India' would not be Hindu at all, but a "Sanghi Hindutva state", which is a different country altogether, says Tharoor in his new book 'The Battle of Belonging' that was released on Saturday. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, the IMD said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. Russia said Saturday it would provide "necessary" assistance to Yerevan in its conflict with Azerbaijan if fighting reached Armenian territory after its ally requested help. Earlier Saturday Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan formally asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin "urgent" consultations on security assistance in its conflict with Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The mayor of the Italian city of Florence lashed out against protestors on Saturday after violent skirmishes broke out between police and demonstrators opposed to the government's anti-Covid-19 measures. Police arrested approximately 20 people during an unauthorised protest late Friday after about 200 people gathered in the city centre were stopped from entering the Renaissance city's Piazza Della Signoria, newspapers reported.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-indias-covid-19-death-rate-falls-below-15-delhi-records-coldest-october-in-58-years-says-imd-909611.html

Apart from the increase in passenger volume, other important focus of the NRP-30 including an increase in the freight volume, the project has also aimed to speed up passengers and goods train, scrapping low footfall halts of trains, introduction of private trains, giving a seat on demand to passengers by doing away waiting list problems. The railways also plans to augment its infrastructure development by spending Rs 50 lakh crore by 2030. The national transporter seems determined to make the entire Golden Quadrilateral and Golden Diagonal routes operational at 160 kmph speed. Besides, railways will also build a more dedicated freight corridor for seamless movement of freight. The railways has also been working on increasing the operating ratio by reducing cost and improving its finances. The government also had asked railways to meet a 45% modal share in transportation against the current 26%, said an official. The NRP will also give direction to railways on how to finance the projects and increase capital expenditure in the coming days, said an official in the railways. The NRP-30 has also emphasised increasing goods trains up to 50 km per hour from the current 25 km and passenger trains around 150 to 160 km per hour on major routes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-aims-to-carry-12-billion-passengers-per-annum-by-2030-909614.html

31-10-2020||National||India keen to step up cooperation with France to take on radicalisation||In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Nice, India has expressed its willingness to step up cooperation with France to take on the "infrastructure of radicalism", including its "online manifestation". Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla, during his interaction with media, academia and think-tanks of France, underlined that it would be wrong to pretend that terror attacks like the recent ones in Paris and Nice were "lone-wolf initiatives" and committed by "misguided individuals". Such attacks had happened because an "infrastructure of radicalism" existed and it had its "online manifestations" too, he said. Shringla was on a visit to Paris on Thursday and Friday. He had a meeting with Alice Guitton, Director General for International Relations at the Ministry of Armed Forces of the French Government, on Thursday. He also met his counterpart Francois Delattre, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs of the French Government, on Friday. He delivered a lecture at the Institut Français des Relations Internationales (IFRI) in Paris. Shringla reached Paris on the day a terrorist beheaded a woman and killed two men at a church in Nice in southern France. Earlier, a Pakistani man had on September 25 stabbed two people in front of the former headquarters of satirical magazine 'Charlie Hebdo' in Paris. A teacher was also beheaded by a terrorist on October 16 after he showed his students some Charlie Hebdo cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. The magazine itself had been targeted by terrorists for publishing the cartoons. Shringla referred to the string of terror attacks and noted in his speech at the IFRI that both India and France faced similar non-traditional security threats in the form of radicalism and terrorism and increasingly cyber-security challenges. “In some respects, these are linked — not least because online radicalisation has emerged as a pressing concern,” he said, underlining that both India and France had suffered due to the menace. "The fight today is not against specific communities or individuals but against a radical politico-religious ideology that attempts to negate the progress made by secular democracies, particularly when it involves the equality of all citizens, regardless of religion or ethnicity, and the rights of women," said the foreign secretary. "This radical ideology espouses violence and separatism, very often fanned and supported by foreign influence. Such forces seek to destabilise pluralist societies." He underlined the fact that the perpetrator of the recent terrorist attacks in France was from Pakistan. "For the past three decades, we have experienced what unbridled radicalism can wreak — and what malevolent violent forces it can unleash. The civilised world needs to act together and act with firmness to address this threat to our cherished democratic value systems." Shringla drove home the point during his interactions that the infrastructure of radicalism had the backing of states and organised institutions and the international community could not and should not "postpone a coordinated and definitive response". Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Paris in August 2019, had agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron that the two sides should enhance operational cooperation to fight terrorism and "launch fresh efforts to prevent and fight radicalisation, especially online radicalisation".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-keen-to-step-up-cooperation-with-france-to-take-on-radicalisation-909641.html

Gahlot, however, said no passengers will be allowed to travel in standing position. With the rise in a number of Covid-19 cases, Delhi government had in May fixed the number of maximum passenger in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster scheme buses to 20. Lt Governor Anil Baijal, who is the chairman of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) recently gave approval to Delhi government's proposal to run the public transport buses with full seating capacity. In a tweet, Gahlot said bus travellers will require to wear face masks and appealed to people to observe proper physical distancing in view of the Covid-19 threat. "The passengers can travel on all the seats of buses from tomorrow. No passenger, however, will be allowed to travel in standing position. Wearing mask is compulsory and I appeal to all the travellers to maintain social distance to check the spread of Corona virus," Gahlot tweeted. With the opening of various economic activities and government and private establishments in the city, people were forced to wait in long queues often at crowded bus stands, due to the restricted number of passengers in buses. The number of DTC and Cluster buses seat up to 40 passengers. There are around 3,800 buses run by the DTC and over 2,600 run under Cluster scheme of Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System. The DDMA chairman had also approved the proposal of the Transport department to resume inter-state bus service. The inter-state bus services was stopped after the imposition of lockdown in March, resulting in shutting down of inter-state bus terminals at Anand Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmiri Gate. The Transport department is preparing a standard operating procedure for opening the interstate bus services. It is expected to begin next week, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/passengers-can-use-all-seats-of-buses-from-november-1-delhi-transport-minister-kailash-gahlot-909648.html

It also accused the central forces of using “coercive means” to disperse general passengers trying to board trains of Railway staffs. The proposition was made in a letter by the state's Home Secretary H K Dwivedi to the General Manager of the Eastern Railway Suneet Sharma. “Indeed rather than taking resort to unquiet means, we could sit and discuss how a few pairs of trains could be run locally in the morning and in the afternoon hours to serve the general commuters at large,” stated Dwivedi in the letter. He also stated that all physical distancing norms and public hygiene protocols would be maintained for plying these trains. Pointing out that the Railways is running suburban trains for its own staff, Dwivedi stated that it was “painful” to see other government employees and the general public being denied the service. “In the meantime, you have resumed suburban rail services. It is painful to notice that you are running these trains for your staff only, while many other sections of governmental service providers and members of society at large are denied these services. We are anguished to see that your central force has used coercive means to deal with members of public today in railway stations, which is deplorable,” stated Dwivedi. He also pointed out that the state government had already allowed Metro Rail services as well as national and international flights. The development comes at a time when several agitations were taking place at Rail stations across the state by general commuters demanding that be allowed to travel bin trains for Railway staffs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengal-govt-urges-railways-to-run-local-trains-for-general-commuters-909664.html

The external affairs minister, delivering the Sardar Patel Memorial lecture, also made it clear that any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is "unacceptable" to India. During the lecture aired on All India Radio, Jaishankar also referred to cross-border terrorism and said India has to be uncompromising in combating it. "As far as China is concerned, ties were stable for three decades as the two nations addressed inherited challenges and new circumstances "Peace and tranquillity in the border areas provided the basis for expanded cooperation in other domains. But as the pandemic unfolded, the relationship has come under severe stress," the minister said. "To restore normalcy, agreements between the two countries must be respected scrupulously in their entirety. Where the Line of Actual Control is concerned, any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo is unacceptable," he added. "The relationship cannot be immune to changes in the assumptions that underpinned it," he said. India has been maintaining that the agreements inked between the two countries since 1993 for management of the frontier must be respected and effectively implemented, saying peace and tranquility along the LAC is the basis for the overall development of the ties. "Large civilizational states re-emerging in close proximity will not have naturally easy ties. "Their interests are best served by a sustained engagement based on mutual respect and mutual sensitivity," he said. India and China are locked in an over five-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. Talking about the strategy on national security, Jaishankar said advocating sweeping solutions without laying the groundwork may be dramatic politics, and mentioned about creation of border infrastructure along the northern border. Breaking down silos and ensuring a more integrated governance process is just as important to performance. It has been a major priority in the last six years, especially in national security, he said. The minister said India will continue to give utmost attention to its immediate neighbourhood while engaging the different poles of emerging global order. "As an outlook, the Neighbourhood First policy remains generous and non-reciprocal in creating the basis for shared activities in different domains. "In recent times, India has also become more conscious of the extended neighbourhood, that is so much a part of its history and heritage," he said. About India's ties with the US, Jaishankar said successive governments on both sides have steadily pursued what has become a non-partisan endeavour. "A strong economic and technological complementarities, also reflected in their work culture, has laid a strong foundation. "And the diaspora has been a very effective bridge. But it is in the face of emerging multi-polarity that both nations have developed a serious interest in more intensive engagement," he added. Talking about Russia, he said India’s relations with it have been "remarkably steady, noting that the strategic logic that has sustained the ties since its early days still remains largely relevant. "As a region full of capabilities, resources, and best practices, Europe is a natural partner for a more ambitious India. There is an equally strong case for accelerating the partnership with Japan. Responsible for catalysing many aspects of India’s modernisation, its true potential is still far from realised," he said. Outlining a glimpse of the post-Covid-19 approach to India’s foreign relations, Jaishankar said, “India will approach the world in a more proactive way in the aftermath of the pandemic. Some of that will be driven by a global vision of its interests that it has steadily developed over the years." In a post-COVID-19 world, Jaishankar said Indian diplomacy will be more integrated with its defence and security needs, and more supportive of the country's economic and commercial interests. "The pressures of the pandemic will naturally impart a different urgency to such engagements. Where we can make a difference to the recovery and revival of others, we will do so unhesitatingly," he said. "In terms of harnessing global capabilities, diplomacy abroad will match the boldness of reforms at home. And we will take a much more holistic approach to policy challenges and their delivery prospects," he added. As India rose steadily in a changing world, Jaishankar said, a key element of that journey was its expanding ties with major power centres. "In virtually every case, the content of its ties grew substantially, whether weighed in terms of politics, security, economy, technology or community. Some nations were more openly supportive of India’s rise; others took nuanced positions," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/any-attempt-to-unilaterally-change-status-quo-of-lac-unacceptable-eam-on-border-row-with-china-909702.html

Shah will also review the organisational preparedness of the state unit during the visit. The state BJP leadership said that the visit of party president J P Nadda to Bengal which was scheduled to take place on November 6, has been canceled. State BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu told journalists that the Home Minister was expected to visit the Medinipur organisational district on November 5 and on the following day hold a meeting with state leaders. BJP sources said that Shah would evaluate various aspects of the party’s organisational condition in Bengal and frame BJP’s strategy for the 2021 Assembly elections. They further revealed that Shah would meet party leaders of booth and district level. Shah’s visit comes at a time when in a major organisational change in the state unit the state general secretary (organization) Subrata Chattopadhyay was replaced by Amitava Chakraborty by the Central leadership giving rise to speculations that state BJP president Dilip Ghosh was not happy with the move. Ghosh, however, said that there was no question of being unhappy with the party’s decisions and brought a disciplined worker of BJP who would abide by whatever the Central leadership would decide.

While the party will not enter into any alliance with Congress, the central leadership in a two-day digital meeting that ended on Saturday allowed state units in West Bengal, Assam, and Tamil Nadu to enter into seat adjustments with Congress for Assembly elections next year. The two parties will also hold joint campaign meetings while the party will not have any truck with Congress in Kerala where Fronts led by both the parties are in a direct contest. Yechury said that the CPI(M) would contest the elections as part of the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu while in Assam, it will contest the elections "in cooperation with all secular opposition parties including the Congress" to defeat the incumbent BJP government, which is "sharpening communal polarisation, destabilising social harmony and heaping miseries" on the people. "In West Bengal, the CPI(M) and the Left Front will have an electoral understanding with all secular parties, including the Congress, which seek to defeat the BJP and the Trinamool Congress," Yechury told a press conference after the Central Committee meeting. The decision came as the faction led by Prakash Karat, which has been opposed to any truck with the Congress, finally caved in, keeping in mind that there is a need for a broader coalition to fight the BJP-RSS, a stand taken at the Hyderabad Party Congress two years ago. The Karat faction had the support of the Kerala unit but in a Polit Bureau meeting last week, the state leaders accepted that the political situation has changed. This marks a final victory for CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, who has been advocating a broad-based secular combination to fight the RSS-BJP. The Karat-led faction, so far, was of the view that the "main task" of defeating the BJP "has to be done without having an understanding or electoral alliance" with the Congress. Yechury has been arguing that the party should not close its door and be flexible in states where CPM is not strong, which was accepted by the Party Congress in Hyderabad in 2018. The CPI(M) has already fought the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Tamil Nadu along with a front led by DMK, in which Congress was a member, and had managed to win two seats. Similarly in the ongoing Bihar Assembly elections, CPI(M) and other Left parties are part of a Grand Alliance led by RJD in which Congress is the second major partner. The party had an electoral understanding with Congress in West Bengal in the 2016 Assembly elections but the Central Committee later had said that it was a wrong move. The Bengal unit had been arguing for electoral understanding with Congress for a long time to take on the Trinamool Congress and BJP. In the latest Rajya Sabha elections in Bengal, Congress had supported CPI(M) candidate Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharya.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/cpim-to-have-electoral-understanding-with-congress-in-west-bengal-assam-tamil-nadu-909564.html

Senior Congress leader's remark calling BJP Emarti Devi as "item" has triggered a controversy. In a petition filed through advocate Varun K Chopra, Kamal Nath asked the top court to quash the October 30 order by the EC and frame guidelines for speeches during campaigning by star campaigners keeping in mind fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and concept of democratic elections. The Model Code of Conduct has been enforced in 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh since September with the announcement of the schedule for by-elections to 28 seats in the state Legislative Assembly on November 3. He maintained that Section 77(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 read with Guidelines for Star Campaigners issued by the EC from time to time makes the selection of the revocation of ‘Star campaigners’ the sole prerogative of the political party. However, he claimed, the poll panel passed a "completely unreasoned" order against him without any notice and application of mind. This was also violative of principles of natural justice and fair play, he said. "For a vibrant democracy and for the conduct of free and fair elections, it is necessary that voters, candidates, campaigners, and workers are not unduly restrained from exercising their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1) of the Constitution," he said. Giving out instances of the use of objectionable remarks against him by the BJP leaders, Kamal Nath claimed the EC has taken no equivalent actions against them despite the fact that those were in gross violation of the Model Code of Conduct. With regard to his remark against the woman BJP leader, he said that he had already issued a clarification and expressed regret. The President of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee further maintained that there was no malice or intent to disrespect on his part.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ex-madhya-pradesh-cm-kamal-nath-moves-supreme-court-against-ecs-decision-909573.html

Gadkari, who inaugurated the newly built NHAI headquarter at Dwaraka in Delhi through video conference on October 26, shared an entire event video on his Twitter account. While concluding his speech after inaugurating the building, Gadkari said, "It is customary in such a programme that after completion of any work, it is their practice to greet everyone and offer good wishes. I am ashamed to congratulate all officials for the project due to delay in completing the project," "The government in 2008 decided to build a new headquarters for NHAI and awarded tender in 2011. But Rs 250 crore work was completed in 2020 after 9 years. When we are planning to complete Delhi-Mumbai Expressway costing around Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh crore in 2.5 to 3 years, it is shameful for taking 9 years to complete just a Rs 250 crore project. Two governments and 8 chairmen served during nine year period. Please put photos of Chief General Managers and General Managers of that period in the building so that history will know them", he said.  Gadkari reprimanded the officers saying, "I had taken 2-4 meetings for this. Now, according to the official method, after putting a blame on the contractor, the matter went to NCLT and a report will be prepared stating that it went to NCLT. The most important thing is that people who have distorted views, don't want to work in the NHAI, they just want to halt the work." Ths NHAI has some people as guides and philosophers who are like "BishKanya", although their honesty cannot be doubted, he added. The Chief General Managers and General Managers' system is not good in the NHAI. This building is the best example of their incompetency, he said asking the NHAI officials to prepare a research paper on how it got delayed. "Why best brains from IIT are not recruited to NHAI. They got to private-sector jobs. Some waste people have joined here and not performing. These people also ignore the suggestions of the ministry. The NHAI's indolent, unhelpful and corrupt people are so powerful that even after saying in the ministry they make their decisions wrong. It is time to show such 'incompetent' officers the way out," Gadkari said. "The NHAI should study why the projects getting delayed and find out bottleneck and take a decision to resolve it. Wrong decisions and delays are not good for the country", Gadkari said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/video-of-nitin-gadkari-slamming-nhai-officials-goes-viral-909603.html

Speaking at an event organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists, Raut said all eyes are on ongoing elections in the northern state. "There is a youngster who does not have any support, and investigation agencies like CBI and ED are hounding him. He is challenging the Union government as it is suppressing opposition parties," the Sena leader said, referring to Tejashwi. "Therefore, I will not be surprised if he became the chief minister of Bihar," Raut added. He also hit out at National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti who have sought restoration of Article 370 which gave autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir. Asked about opposition leaders meeting Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari with their demands, Raut said they should meet the concerned ministers instead. Meeting governor directly shows disrespect for the state, he said. On NCP chief Sharad Pawar's role in the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition, Raut said Pawar advises the state government and no one should mind it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/wont-be-surprised-if-tejashwi-yadav-becomes-bihar-cm-sanjay-raut-909613.html

Addressing a bypoll rally in Biaora, Pilot said the people had voted for the Congress in the 2018 MP Assembly polls after 15 years of BJP rule. "However, the three-time chief minister (Chouhan) was dissatisfied and played tricks and made a backdoor entry to power," Pilot said without elaborating. He said the BJP government under Chouhan had done nothing for farmers, and claimed the highest number of agriculture-related suicides took place in MP. He said the Centre's new farm laws would force mandis to close, resulting in the dismantling of the minimum support price mechanism, and lead to corporates and industrialists calling the shots in the sector, including on purchase price of produce. He said the Congress government under Nath had waived off farm loans while the BJP had promised jobs and investments but ended up playing the "temple-mosque, Hindu-Muslim, China- Pakistan-Sri Lanka" cards. Hitting back on the remark about Chouhan's "tricks", MP BJP chief spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya said Pilot was levelling baseless allegations, adding "the Congress government here fell due to infighting".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shivraj-singh-chouhan-played-tricks-to-unseat-congress-in-madhya-pradesh-says-sachin-pilot-909633.html
31-10-2020||National Politics||Do not play politics over national interests: PM Modi||Playing up the nationalism plank to the hilt in the middle of campaigning for assembly polls in Bihar and by-poll for Madhya Pradesh, BJP has gone the whole hog to highlight the statement of Pakistan's Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry admitting his country's role in the Pulwama terror attack during a Parliament debate. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Pakistan minister's remarks had exposed the rival parties here, who were doing politics post-Pulwama and recalled how cheap politics (bhaddi rajniiti) was at peak then, BJP President JP Nadda in a poll rally in Siwan demanded an apology from Rahul Gandhi. In another rally in Bhagalpur, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh maintained that NDA walked the talk on what it promises and the admission by Pakistan minister had brought out the truth. After the first phase of Bihar polls on October 28, BJP increasingly latched on to emotive nationalistic issues to drum up support this time in Bihar. Opposition parties and leaders have also tried to put the government on the mat raising issues of the government's response to the Chinese aggression in Ladakh and its commitment to national security. Addressing an event at Kevadiya in Gujarat after paying tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the Statue of Unity on his 145th birth anniversary, Modi said that the truth of last year's Pulwama terror attack has been accepted in Pakistan Parliament and rued that when the entire nation was mourning the brave soldiers' death in Pulwama attack, some people indulged in "dirty politics" for their political gains. "The country cannot forget that when the entire nation was aggrieved, some people were not participating in that grief. They were seeing their political interests in the Pulwama attack. The country cannot forget what kinds of statements were made, what all were said.  The nation cannot forget when it got such a big wound, dirty politics full of opportunism and arrogance was at a peak. The real face of such people has been exposed after the truth was accepted in the Parliament of our neighbouring country. I want to urge such political parties not to indulge in this kind of politics as it affects the morale of our security forces. By playing into the hands of anti-national forces knowingly or unknowingly for personal gains, you will not be able to serve the interest of either the country or your party," said Modi. Latching on to the Pakistan minister's remarks Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said in an election rally in Bhagalpur that it "revealed the truth" on the issue "silenced" those who had questioned the NDA government's intent after the Pulwama terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40 CRPF personnel after which the government had carried Balakot terror strike against Pakistan. Lashing out at the Opposition parties, Singh said that Congress and other Opposition leaders raised questions whenever the NDA government worked for the country's security with all strength. Recalling that BJP stalwart late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had praised former prime minister Indira Gandhi in Parliament when she had divided Pakistan into two and created Bangladesh, Singh said that on the contrary Congress had only one work left doubting and raising questions over the government's achievements ruling. On Friday, BJP President J P Nadd in his poll rally in Siwan said that Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the country for his stand on Pulwama. "What should I say about the Congress party and Rahul babu. They became Pakistan advocates (Vakil)". Mocking BJP over its "Pakistan" centric campaign, Congress asked why does BJP remember Pakistan when elections come and said, "This KPK (Kashmir, Pakistan, Kabristan) model will not work anymore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/do-not-play-politics-over-national-interests-pm-modi-909635.html
31-10-2020||National Politics||Rajnath Singh slams Rahul Gandhi for 'misleading' claim on China||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday slammed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for the "misleading" claim that China had intruded "1200 kilometres" into India's territory and lavished praise on armed forces for the valour displayed by them in defending the country honour. Addressing four back to back rallies in poll-bound Bihar, Singh also tore into the opposition party for having sought "suboot" (proof) of the Balakot airstrikes and demanded an "apology" in the wake of Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhrys recent statement on the floor of the national assembly. "Some opposition parties are misleading the people. The leader of the Congress is saying that intrusion has been made into 1200 kms of our territory and the land has been captured. When the fact is, our jawans showed commendable shaurya and parakram (valour) in defending the country's maan, samman and swabhiman (honour)", said Singh, who spoke in Baikunthpur and Baniapur assembly segments of Gopalganj and Saran besides Maner and Bakhtiyarpur in rural Patna. The former BJP presidents remarks were in reference to a recent statement by Gandhi, whom he chose not to mention by name. At a press conference in Punjab earlier this week, the former Congress president had accused the Modi government of having "given away 1200 kms of Bharat Mata to China". "Let me assure you not an inch of land be captured (in India) by any power in the world. I wonder what is wrong with Congress. Should not all stand united on the issue of national integrity", said Singh, who copiously shared points touched by him on his Twitter handle. Singh also paid rich tributes to the martyred jawans of Bihar regiment who were killed in the stand-off with Chinese troops at Galwan valley in Ladakh earlier this year. The Defence Minister also recalled the Balakot airstrikes which had followed the dastardly terrorist attack in Pulwama wherein a large number of CRPF personnel were killed last year when a suicide bomber rammed his car into a bus carrying the jawans. "Congress was asking for proof of the Balakot airstrikes. The statement of a Pakistan Prime Minister on the floor of the national assembly has established the role of their Premier in Pulwama. Now the Congress must apologize", Singh said referring to Choudhary's statement. The Pakistan minister, who was participating in a debate on the floor of the House, had hailed the "success in Pulwama" achieved under the leadership of Imran Khan and remarked, "humne Hindustan ko ghar mein ghuskar maara" (we hit India on its own soil). Singh said whenever in power, the NDA has "always fulfilled its promises. We scrapped Article 370. Now construction of Ram temple has also begun". Showering praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Defence Minister said under the current dispensation every paisa spent by the government on welfare schemes was reaching intended beneficiaries. "Mark the difference since the time of Rajiv Gandhi when admittedly only 15 paise out of a rupee used to reach the people," he said. The defence minister also underscored the welfare measures undertaken by the Modi government including the Ujjwala Yojana, the Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana. "Thanks to our work, the NDA enjoys the trust of the people and under Modi's leadership, our international standing has risen and foreign powers are eagerly extending a hand of friendship towards India", he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rajnath-singh-slams-rahul-gandhi-for-misleading-claim-on-china-909643.html

The Congress denied the allegation, saying that Nath never used the word. "Kamal Nath came here and called me a dog. Yes, Kamal Nath, I am a dog and the public is my owner. Yes, I am a dog because the dog protects his owner," Scindia said at a rally at Sadora. A video of the speech went viral on social media. Nath's media coordinator Narendra Saluja told PTI that the former chief minister never used such a word for Scindia or any other leader. "Kamal Nath never used this word for anybody in his speeches," Saluja said. Nath had courted controversy recently when he termed minister and BJP candidate Imarti Devi as "item". On Friday, the Election Commission revoked his "star campaigner" status for repeated violations of the model code. Scindia quit the Congress in March with 22 MLAs loyal to him, which brought down the Nath-led government in the state.

31-10-2020||National Politics||RJD, Congress created obstacles building of Ram temple: BJP's J P Nadda||BJP president J P Nadda on Saturday attacked the RJD and the Congress, two key constituents of the opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar, accusing the two parties of creating obstacles in the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya. Nadda also alleged that the RJD is known for "anarchy" and the Congress is an "anti-national party". The day-to-day hearing in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case in Ayodhya in the Supreme Court, which paved the way for the final ruling in the matter after decades, started after the Narendra Modi government came to power at the Centre for a second time, he said. The BJP leader said that the apex court judgement went in favour of a Ram Mandir and construction of a grand temple is currently underway in Ayodhya. "Everyone in the country wanted to see a grand Ram temple at Sri Ram janmabhoomi in Ayodhya but the Congress did everything to protract the case," he alleged. "Crores of people wanted construction of a grand Ram temple, but when (Lal Krishna) Advani jee began his rath yatra for a temple at Ayodhya, it was Lalu Prasad who stopped it in Bihar," Nadda said. On October 23, 1990, Advani's rath was stopped by the orders of RJD boss and the then Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad at Samastipur. People from Bihar also participated overwhelmingly in that rath yatra, Nadda said. The BJP president also criticised the Congress alleging that its senior leader Kapil Sibal, who was the lawyer for one of the parties involved in the Ayodhya land dispute matter, tried to protract the case in the Supreme Court. Training his guns at the Grand Alliance, Nadda said, "The RJD is a party which is known for anarchy. The CPI(ML) spreads destruction in the society whereas Congress is an anti-national party. This Grand Alliance cannot usher development in Bihar." The opposition grouping comprises the RJD, the Congress and three Left parties - the CPI(ML), the CPI(M) and the CPI. The RJD, which once organised a "Tel pilawan, danda bhajawan (Apply oil, swing sticks) rally", cannot do any good to Bihar in future as it did nothing when it had the opportunity, the BJP leader said. Nadda was referring to a 'lathi rally' that the RJD had taken out in 2003 to fight the communal forces in the country. Lalu Prasad, who applied oil on a stick publicly days before the rally, had said that lathi was chosen as a symbol for the rally as people use it against harmful creatures. Attacking Prasad's younger son and the Grand Alliance's chief ministerial face Tejashwi Yadav, Nadda asked how his party, which allegedly forced people to migrate to other states in search of livelihood during its regime, can provide jobs. Tejashwi has recently announced that if the RJD-led Grand Alliance is voted to power, 10 lakh government jobs will be sanctioned in the very first cabinet meeting. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his JD(U) fought the last assembly elections as part of the Grand Alliance, but he had to leave the coalition, the BJP president said. "Why did the Grand Alliance break? The Grand Alliance broke because Nitish Kumar jee understood that providing good governance to people is not possible with those who are known for misrule," he said. Kumar joined the Grand Alliance of the RJD and the Congress and won the 2015 assembly election. But after around two years, he ended the relationship with the coalition over corruption charges against Tejashwi Yadav and returned to NDA to form a new government. Nadda also attacked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on matters related to China. The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has received money from China and now Rahul Gandhi claims himself to be a nationalist, Nadda claimed. "I have sought an account of the money that Rajiv Gandhi Foundation had taken from China but the mother (Sonia Gandhi) and the son have not responded to it," he said. Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the BJP-led government at the Centre over the Ladakh face-off, claiming that China "took away" India's land there. A Pakistani minister recently admitted its involvement in the Pulwama terror attack but Rahul Gandhi was demanding evidence, Nadda said. He said that Pakistani Prime Minister referred to Rahul Gandhi's statement in the UN on the issue of abrogation of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP government erected Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's statue, which is the tallest in the world and is visited by lakhs of people for paying their homage to him, but Congress leaders do not go to that place, Nadda said. He urged people to vote for the NDA if they want development of Bihar and claimed that earlier elections were fought on the basis of caste and religion but this political culture has changed since Narendra Modi became the PM.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rjd-congress-created-obstacles-building-of-ram-temple-bjps-j-p-nadda-909682.html

31-10-2020||North and Central||Centre may review Delhi’s rising Covid-19 cases on November 2: Report||On Saturday, the highest single-day rise of 6,470 Covid-19 cases took Delhi's tally of infection to 3,88,114, while the number of containment zones the national capital increased to 3,113 from 3,047 on Wednesday. Quoting sources, the report added that the meeting will primarily be chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul. The officials will be interacting with Delhi health officials and suggest concrete steps to the government to address the alarming surge in cases. DH could not independently verify this report. Earlier this week, amid the staggering spike in cases of Covid-19, stressing that it would be too early to say if this was a "third wave", Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that the AAP government has changed its strategy and is now going for "aggressive tracing and testing" of people who came in contact with those found positive for the infection, attributing it as one of the factors behind the surge in cases. The sudden spike in Covid-19 cases comes amid festivities and rising air pollution levels. Experts suggest that milling crowd during the festive season, increase in pollution level and laxity in behaviour by many in observing Covid-19 safety norms have led to a massive surge in daily cases in the national capital in the last few days. The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, the next major festivals are Diwali and Chhath in November.

31-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', likely to improve over next 2 days||The air quality in the Delhi-NCR region recorded a marginal improvement but remained in the “very poor” category on Saturday as stubble burning incidents were "unusually high", while a government forecasting agency said it is likely to get better due to favourable wind speed in the coming days. The national capital recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 367. It was 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, and 353 on Monday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The average 24-hour AQI was 368 in Greater Noida, 363 in Ghaziabad, 358 in Gurgaon, 356 in Noida and 348 in Faridabad, according to the CPCB's Sameer app at 4 pm on Saturday. It was 394 in Greater Noida, 382 in Ghaziabad, 379 in Noida, 367 in Gurgaon, 337 in Faridabad on Friday. The concentration of major air pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 also remained high in the five immediate neighbours of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Thursday, Delhi's air quality index (AQI) touched “severe” levels for a brief period before slipping back into the “very poor” category. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 32 percent on Saturday. It was 19 percent on Friday, 36 percent on Thursday -- the maximum so far this season, 18 percent on Wednesday, 23 percent on Tuesday, 16 percent on Monday and 19 percent on Sunday. According to the central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the fire count increased to an “unusual” high on Friday over Punjab (approx 4,266), Haryana (155), Uttar Pradesh (51) and Madhya Pradesh (381) which is likely to impact air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India. SAFAR said Delhi's AQI did not improve much despite better ventilation, mainly because of highly favourable North-Northwesterly boundary level wind direction and perfect wind speed for the intrusion of pollutants from farm fires in Delhi. “Increased local surface wind speed with faster dispersion conditions are counteracting with increased fire-related emission and associated intrusion. But still, AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as dispersion will eventually play a lead role,” it said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 9,000 meter square per second on Saturday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-likely-to-improve-over-next-2-days-909471.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||Rajasthan government introduces three Bills to negate impact of Centre's farm laws||Congress-ruled Rajasthan on Saturday set the ball rolling for negating the farm sector reforms initiated by the Modi government by introducing three Bills in the state assembly. Rajasthan’s Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal introduced The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the state assembly on the first day of the special session. The state assembly adjourned the proceedings for the day after the introduction of the three Bills and is scheduled to reconvene on Monday to discuss and pass the legislation. Rajasthan is the third state to pass state-specific laws to negate the central laws that were passed in September by both the Houses of Parliament. Acting on directives of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Punjab and Chhattisgarh have already passed state-specific laws, rejecting Modi government’s agri-sector reforms that promote contract farming and give farmers the option to sell their produce beyond the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets. However, the laws passed by the three Congress-ruled states could end up being a symbolic political gesture as they would require the assent of Governors of the respective states and President Ram Nath Kovind. “The farm laws were passed by the Centre without taking state governments into confidence. This has led to widespread protests. Centre is lying to farmers and we are trying to secure their rights and will pass farm bills similar to those in Punjab,” Rajasthan Minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas told reporters in Jaipur. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill also proposes punishment of imprisonment from three to seven years with or without a fine of Rs five lakh if any person, company or corporate house or any other association or body of persons harasses farmers. "INC under the leadership of Smt #SoniaGandhi ji& #RahulGandhi Ji stands absolutely with our annadatas and will continue to oppose the anti-farmer laws passed by NDA Govt. Today Congress Govt in #Punjab has passed Bills against these laws & #Rajasthan will follow soon,” Gehlot tweeted on October 20.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajasthan-government-introduces-three-bills-to-negate-impact-of-centres-farm-laws-909487.html

The exhibition, which is in the second year running now, was launched on Friday evening, according to a statement.  While last year the 10-day exhibition was held in an art gallery in New Delhi, this year it is being organised digitally due to Covid-19 restrictions.  An initiative of a trust called "The Art Sanctuary", artistic talents are being showcased of children in the age group of 16-18 years who have intellectual disabilities like autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia, hyperactive and attention deficit disorder, fragile x syndrome, the statement said.  The second Exhibition of Creative and Performing Arts (eCAPA) by Special Needs is showcasing works of arts of youngsters with special needs from all across the country, it said.  The statement said the exhibition would help increase their skill sets in the art space as well as provide exclusive spaces for these special needs artists.  "The team behind the initiative is determined to keep going this till the mainstream contemporary art world sits up and includes the special young adults in their own world of art and creativity without any bias, prejudice on equal footing," it said.  At least 10 new platforms showcasing art, exclusively for the intellectually challenged, have been created in last one year since eCAPA 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-100-children-with-intellectual-disabilities-display-their-artistic-skills-in-digital-exhibition-909501.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||Nine BJP workers killed in four months in Kashmir||Nine Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and workers from Kashmir have been killed by militants between July and October this year. The security agencies fear that more lives could be lost in the coming months as the region goes into election mode for holding polls to newly-formed District Development Councils and vacant panchayat seats. With two main regional parties – National Conference (NC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) – likely to boycott the upcoming polls like they did in 2018 when panchayat and municipal polls were held, “the BJP workers would become main targets of the militants.” “Hundreds of BJP workers have been already shifted to secured accommodations while dozens of others have been provided security. But despite that militants are able to target the BJP workers as it is impossible to stop these attacks in remote corners of the Valley,” a senior police officer told DH. Immediately after taking over the reins of the Union Territory in August, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha had said the administration needs to be cautious while framing the future security strategy for the panchayat representatives and political workers. The killing of three BJP workers in Qazigund belt of Kulgam district in south Kashmir on Thursday has thrown new challenges to the security agencies. According to the police, the trio was killed by Lashkar-e-Toiba and The Resistance Front (TRF) militants. Incidentally, the three BJP workers killed on Thursday were reportedly lone sons and breadwinners of their families. Before this, six more workers of the BJP were killed while one was injured in less than four months in the Valley. On September 23, Block Development Council (BDC) chairman Khag in Budgam, Bhupinder Singh, affiliated with the BJP was killed by militants. On August 9, BJP District President, Abdul Hamid Najar was killed when he was doing morning walk in Ompora, Budgam. Before that on August 6, BJP Sarpanch Sajad Ahmad Khanday was shot dead by militants near his residence at Vessu, Qazigund. On July 8, three members of a family including BJP State executive Committee member Sheikh Waseem Bari, his father Bashir Ahmad and brother Sheikh Umar, who were also office bearers, were killed by militants at their residence in north Kashmir’s Bandipora. Bari family was guarded by ten policemen when the incident took place. “We have inputs that the militants have directions from Pakistan to target BJP workers. There is a likelihood that in coming weeks more attacks will happen,” the police officer warned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nine-bjp-workers-killed-in-four-months-in-kashmir-909503.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||Hurriyat shutdown against new land laws disrupts normal life in Kashmir||Normal life in the Kashmir valley was affected on Saturday due to a shutdown called by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led Hurriyat Conference to protest the new land laws notified by the Centre for Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. Earlier this week, the Centre cleared the decks for people from across the country to buy land in the union territory by amending several laws. Most shops, petrol pumps and other business establishments were shut in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, the officials said. Public transport was off the roads across the city, but private cars and autorickshaws were plying in some areas. Similar reports were received from other districts of the Valley, they said. Security personnel were deployed in strength in vulnerable areas of the city and elsewhere in the Valley to avoid any untoward incident, according to the officials. The Hurriyat had issued the call for the shutdown on Wednesday, a day after the Centre notified the new land laws. One after the other, laws are being invented and amended by New Delhi and "forcibly thrust upon" the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the Hurriyat said. "Rather than pursue a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir issue involving millions of humans living in the uncertainty of a conflict as per their will and to ensure peace in the region, all attempts are being made to undermine that possibility by the Government of India and instead, a policy of permanent demographic change is aggressively being pushed - to snatch our land, destroy our identity and turn us into a minority in our own land," it said in a statement. "People of J&K completely reject and strongly condemn these appalling imperial measures... To register their strong resentment against these anti-JK people laws, and demanding their immediate withdrawal, people will peacefully observe a shutdown on Saturday," it said. In a gazette notification issued on Tuesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs made several changes to the land laws, including one that allows the use of agricultural land for setting up facilities of public purpose. The most important amendment has been made in the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of land with the Centre omitting the phrase "permanent resident of the state" from Section 17 of the law. This paves the way for people from outside Jammu and Kashmir to buy land in the union territory, over a year after the nullification of provisions under Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hurriyat-shutdown-against-new-land-laws-disrupts-normal-life-in-kashmir-909508.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||New land laws: J&K govt transfers 3,000 acres of land to Industries & Commerce department||Just three days after the Centre issued new land laws for Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Territory (UT) government has transferred 24,000 kanals (3,000 acres) of land to Industries and Commerce department for investment purposes. Almost an equal quantity of land will be notified shortly following clearance from the Forest Department, officials said. Notwithstanding Covid-19 pandemic, at least 65 big business houses from outside J&K are constantly in touch with the UT government to set up their units. The land is located in Jammu, Kathua, Udhampur, Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts of Jammu region and Srinagar, Baramulla, Budgam, Pulwama and Anantnag districts of Kashmir division. While J&K had just 242.25 acres of land under industry, the UT administration is now wooing investors by opening up thousands of acres of land for setting up multiplexes, processing units, food parks, film production centres, schools, Information Technology parks and medical complexes. Commissioner/Secretary Industries & Commerce department Manoj Kumar Dwivedi confirmed that 3,000 acres of the land has been transferred by the government while the remaining portion is expected to be transferred shortly. “For the pending land, no objection certificate (NOC) of the Forest Department is awaited. As soon the NOC is received, this land too will be transferred to the Industries and Commerce department,” he said. Dwivedi added that despite Covid-19 pandemic, a number of big industrial houses were in touch with the department for investment purposes and negotiations with them are on. The much-hyped first ever Global Investors Summit, which was scheduled to be held in J&K in April this year was defred due to Covid-19 pandemic. After abrogation of J&K’s special status, the government had given much hype to the Summit stating that it would be a game changer for bringing outside investment to the industrially backward UT. On Tuesday, the Centre notified the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Third Order, enabling a host of new changes to the erstwhile state. Under the new laws, no domicile or permanent resident certificate is required to purchase non-agricultural land in the UT. The Center also notified the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, paving way for the acquisition of land in J&K by all Indian citizens. Previously, Article 35-A of J&K Constitution, revoked on August 5 last year, placed prohibitions on the sale of land to non-state-subjects. However, experts believe investors will wait to invest in J&K and would like to see the situation in the valley stabilize. The violence in Kashmir continues unabated which may shy away outsiders from investing here, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/new-land-laws-jk-govt-transfers-3000-acres-of-land-to-industries-commerce-department-909512.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||Traditional Jauljibi fair of Uttarakhand cancelled due to Covid-19||The over-a-century-old Jauljibi fair will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The decision to cancel the fair was taken by the administration after a meeting with traders and social workers of the Jauljibi and Dharchula areas of this Uttarakhand district. "Owing to the prevailing pandemic and safety concerns, the traders and social workers are not in favour of holding the fair," Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Dharchula AK Shukla said. Started by the Pal kings of Askot in 1916, the trade fair used to be held at Jauljibi in Pithoragarh district from November 14 to 21 every year. The cancellation of the fair will deprive around 700 traders and craftsmen of the region of a platform to sell their products, president of the Vyapar Sangh of Jauljibi town Dhirendra Singh Dharmashaktu said. It is for the first time in 104 years that the fair is not being held, he added. The Jauljibi fair is known for the participation of traders from India and Nepal. Goods bought from Tibetan traders are also sold at the fair. The fair will be organised with full fervour next year, Shukla said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/traditional-jauljibi-fair-of-uttarakhand-cancelled-due-to-covid-19-909516.html

Constable Avinash Rai, who was absconding after committing the crime on Thursday night, was apprehended this morning from Bhilai town of neighbouring Durg district, Balod superintendent of Police Jitendra Singh Meena told PTI. During his posting in Balod district, the accused used to live in the victims' house in Sivni locality under Balod police station area and was transferred to Durg a month ago, the official said. The accused had lent some money to the woman whose husband lives in Nagpur, and on October 24, he went to her place to collect the amount and continued to stay there, Meena said. On Thursday night, Rai allegedly forced the toddler to call him "papa" and when she did not respond, he inflicted multiple burns on her face, stomach and hands with cigarette butts, he said. The accused also allegedly thrashed and abused the woman before fleeing from the scene, he said. Based on the woman's complaint, a case was registered under sections 294 (obscene acts), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC, the SP said. Further investigation is underway and departmental action has been initiated against the accused constable, the SP added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chhattisgarh-cop-held-for-inflicting-burns-on-toddler-thrashing-woman-909523.html

The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, the IMD said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius -- the lowest in the month of October in 26 years. The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a low of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to the IMD data. The normal minimum temperature for this time of the year is 15-16 degrees Celsius, the IMD said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting center, said the absence of cloud cover is a major reason for such low minimum temperatures this time. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds, which allow formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said. Delhi had recorded its all-time low temperature of 9.4 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1937, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/at-172-degrees-delhi-witnesses-coldest-october-in-58-years-909527.html

The accused has been identified as Vikash, a resident of Dakshinpuri. He was arrested on Friday, they said. A complaint in the matter was lodged by the store owner on Tuesday. The complainant, Atul Bajaj, alleged that he received an order for some items to be delivered to D-126, Lajpat Nagar on Tuesday, a senior police officer said. When his delivery boy reached near the house, he met Vikash, who claimed to be the driver of the house owner. The accused took the items from the delivery boy and Rs 1,700, the balance payment for the order, and left saying that he would be back with Rs 2,000, the officer said. The delivery boy waited but nobody came back. Later, it was found that the residents of D-126, Lajpat Nagar had not placed the order, he added. During investigation, the phone number which was used to make the call to the store was put on surveillance. CCTV footage of nearby areas was also checked. The suspect was traced to Dakshinpuri and arrested on Friday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) R P Meena said. The accused told the police that he is unemployed. Earlier, he used to commit thefts to sustain himself. He had been duping people by posing as a customer for two years, he said. He would place an order as per his requirement. He placed orders of less than Rs 1,000 so that the victim may not file a police complaint, the officer said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/man-held-for-duping-delivery-boy-by-posing-as-customer-in-delhi-909535.html

Nine of them tested positive for the disease through the rapid-antigen test and 15 others through the RT-PCR test on Friday, Medical Officer Jagdish Chandra Joshi said. Nine of them are in institutional quarantine and 15 in self-isolation, he added. The Uttarakhand government had allowed resumption of the trading activities associated with adventure sports in the state from September 26, but tourists did not always follow the social-distancing norms, Rafting Association president Dinesh Bhatt said. An estimated 20,000 tourists have gone rafting in Rishikesh since September 26 and with 24 rafting guides diagnosed with the virus, the remaining 676 have also been asked to go for a Covid-19 test, he added. Medical teams are conducting Covid tests at the camps in the Shivpuri and Brahmapuri areas of Rishikesh, Bhatt said. Attributing the detection of positive cases among tourist guides largely to the disregard shown to Covid guidelines by tourists, Muni-ki-Reti police station in-charge RK Saklani said around 6,000 tourists have so far been fined for not wearing masks and not following the norms of physical distancing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/24-rafting-guides-in-rishikesh-test-positive-for-covid-19-909538.html
31-10-2020||North and Central||India's Covid-19 case fatality rate falls below 1.5%||India's Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) fell below 1.5 per cent on Saturday, the Union health ministry said, crediting the Centre-led strategy of 'test, trace, track and treat' for keeping coronavirus-related deaths low and within manageable numbers. Deaths per million population in the country stand at a very low level of 88, it said. The ministry said 23 states and union territories in the country have a CFR lower than the national average, while 65 per cent of the total deaths so far were recorded in five states. A total 551 deaths were reported the previous day, according to the ministry. There is a steady and consistent decline in the number of daily deaths, the ministry said in a statement. "On a progressive decline, the CFR has dropped to 1.49 per cent as on date. Also, 23 states and UTs have CFR lower than the national average," it said. The Centre-led strategy of 'test, trace, track and treat' has focused on effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a comprehensive Standard of Care approach which includes use of anticoagulants and non-invasive oxygen, the statement said. The effective implementation of the strategy by state and UT governments has resulted in early identification, prompt isolation and timely clinical management of hospitalised cases, it said. "These have ensured that India's Covid mortality is kept low and within manageable numbers," it added. The ministry said 65 per cent of the total deaths were recorded in five States -- Maharashtra (36.04 pc), Karnataka (9.16 pc), Tamil Nadu (9.12 pc), Uttar Pradesh (5.76 pc) and West Bengal (5.58 pc). Ten states and UTs -- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh -- account for 85 per cent of the total deaths, it said. Six states and UTs registered cumulative deaths below 100, whereas eight states and UTs registered deaths below 1,000, it added. Sixteen states and UTs have recorded deaths below 10,000. India added 59,454 new recoveries the previous day, while 48,268 new infections were reported. The total number of recoveries has crossed the 74-lakh mark (7,432,829). "Higher number of single-day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is at present 91.34 per cent," the ministry underscored. "India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases. Presently, the active cases comprise merely 7.16 per cent of the total positive cases of the country, standing at 5,82,649," it said. Active cases in the country remained below 6 lakh for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Seventy-nine per cent of the recovered cases are concentrated in 10 states and UTs, according to the ministry. "Karnataka and Maharashtra have contributed the maximum to the single-day recoveries with more than 8,000 cases, followed by Kerala with more than 7,000 cases," the ministry said. Of the 48,268 new infections registered the previous day, 78 per cent are from 10 states and UTs, it said. Kerala and Maharashtra have added the maximum to the new confirmed cases with more than 6,000 cases each, followed by Delhi with more than 5,000 cases, it added.

The Excise Department has also asked its bond inspectors deployed at these establishments to ensure strict compliance of anti-coronavirus guidelines and submit a report. In a circular issued earlier this week, the department said wholesale liquor vends will have to install touch-free sanitizer dispenser at entry and exit points besides coronavirus awareness banner inside as well as outside the building. According to the circular, these establishments will have to ensure mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by their every worker. At wholesale liquor vends, there should be strict compliance of social distancing norms during loading and unloading of stock besides compulsory mask-wearing, it stated. Earlier this month, the government had also directed clubs, hotels, liquor shops and restaurants to ensure strict compliance of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. According to the SOPs, no standing customer has to be served liquor and all establishments also have to ensure provision for sanitiser dispenser and thermal scanning at the entrance.

His remarks come amid a massive spike in fresh cases with a record 5,891 incidences reported on Friday, the third consecutive day when over 5,000 cases have been registered in a day. Interacting with reporters, the minister said that the lockdown was imposed in the beginning as "it was a new virus then" and its behaviour was totally unpredictable. "There have been a lot of learnings from the lockdown, and a lot was also said that after the 21-day lockdown the virus spread will stop or with temperature going to 40 degrees Celsius, it will stop. Did it stop? So, the learning from that exercise has been that it is impossible to wipe off Covid-19 transmission through a lockdown as the virus has spread through the community," he said when asked if lockdown-like restrictions could be imposed if a spike in cases continues. The other learning from the lockdown has been that the use of the mask is an effective way to reduce the spread of the infection, he said. "So, people should treat wearing a mask as a vaccine till we get the real vaccine, which is expected in a few months," Jain said. The Centre late March had announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From June 8, the central government brought in gradual 'Unlock', under which restrictions have been eased accordingly. The Delhi health minister flagged that a large number of people in the city had become carefree and were not wearing masks in public places, and warned that 'challans' (fines) are being issued and stricter action will be taken against those not wearing masks. In an interview to PTI early September, Jain had ruled out the possibility of another lockdown here, saying an economy "cannot be kept shut for eternity" as the livelihood of a large number of people is dependent on it. He has also asserted that "extreme caution and not panic" should be the response of the city and people should exhibit greater alertness and responsibility in public places to deal with this health crisis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/impossible-to-wipe-off-covid-19-spread-through-lockdown-treat-mask-as-vaccine-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain-909639.html

From Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu, Congress leaders organised protest meetings at district headquarters across the country to oppose the farm sector reforms and mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel and the death anniversary of late prime minister Indira Gandhi as ‘Kisan Adhikar Diwas’. Congress leaders also highlighted the contribution of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in organising farmers for the Bardoli Satyagrah, which was a key highlight of the freedom struggle as well as late prime minister Indira Gandhi’s initiative of ushering in the green revolution in the country. Congress-ruled states of Punjab and Chhattisgarh have already passed state-specific laws to negate the farm sector reforms unveiled by the Modi government. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind next week along with all MLAs from the state to request him to grant his assent to the farm sector laws passed by the state Assembly. The Congress has launched a series of protests against the Modi government’s farm sector reforms since the Parliament passed three bills on the issue in September. The protests would continue till November 14, when the Congress is expected to meet the President and submit signatures of lakhs of farmers opposing the reforms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cong-holds-nationwide-protests-against-farm-sector-reforms-909654.html

He was speaking after inaugurating a day-long workshop on youth engagement and outreach here. The workshop, organised by the J&K administration at SKICC, was attended by top Industry heads from Ashok Leyland, ICICI Foundation, Bombay Stock Exchange, various universities, IIMs/IITs and policy analysts from across the country. “I am happy that big business houses are here today and they are fully supporting us. We will frame a policy document on which we will work. We will share all the details with you once the plan is ready. Our aim is to eradicate unemployment in Jammu and Kashmir in five years,” Sinha told reporters on the sidelines of the workshop. The workshop is aimed to create opportunities and infrastructure for engaging youth, addressing their issues and concerns and empower them in entrepreneurship, self-employability and create a livelihood in a well-curated and holistic manner, an official spokesman said. Addressing the inaugural session of the event, Sinha said the idea behind the workshop is to create an institutional mechanism to empower and groom the youngsters and to make them valuable for J&K as well as the country. He said in the past, many initiatives were taken to engage the youth here, but all of them somehow fell short of meeting the desired requirements. So, there is a need to have an umbrella programme that dovetails all the resources meant for this purpose to achieve the goal of youth empowerment and youth development, he added. “I believe in concrete plans and immediate execution. My idea of the institutional mechanism under Mission Youth is to ensure that we have a concrete framework and a definite time-line to execute it on the fertile ground that we have prepared,” Sinha said. He said in comparison to the national average unemployment rate of 13.8 per cent, J&K has a 25 per cent rate. To fix the lag, we have before us 'Mission 2025' under which we have to bring the opportunities to 80 per cent of the youth of J&K, he added. On the occasion, Sinha announced that a seed fund of Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for creating initial infrastructure and institutional support for meeting the initial needs of this programme. This amount, he said, would be used to create a 'Centre of Excellence' and infrastructure in districts to realise the goals of making youth the leaders of success. The Lt Governor also beckoned the industrial leaders to partner J&K in formulating and implementing the programme successfully on the ground. He sought the support of the national-level investors and industry experts in creating robust infrastructure and employment avenues for the youth of the UT. “We not only need your investments but your expertise as well, which will help us realise the dreams of prosperity,” he added. “It is my aim to truly create a stable policy and regulatory ecosystem to business so that they can build for scale and create a thriving startup ecosystem which is inherently entrepreneurial in approach, creating local jobs and employment,” he said. In the domestic ease of doing business ranking and state reform action plan, J&K is moving up, Sinha said. By minimising regulatory burdens, J&K has scored over states like Kerala and Odisha in September's ranking by the central government, he added. Highlighting UT administration's efforts in promoting entrepreneurship, the Lt Governor said within one month, two aspiring entrepreneurs from every 4,290 panchayats of J&K were selected for handholding and about 10,000 people have been provided loans through the J&K Bank to establish their businesses. We believe in the uniqueness of youth energy and providing equal opportunities for them to build a modern, equitable and sustainable society and the nation, he said. Sinha said almost 65 per cent of the population of J&K is under the age of 35 years and on one hand, we have a demographic dividend like the rest of the country, but on the other, we have faced many challenges, systemic unemployment and joblessness along with the absence of holistic development of the youth. The LG said the administration is focussing its energies on four sectors -- industry & services, technology & innovation, infrastructure, agriculture & allied sector. “You are all welcome to Jammu & Kashmir for an unprecedented revolution with public participation. Valuable contribution and investment made today will give dignity to the youth and it will restore their pride and will make Jammu and Kashmir truly a piece of art in the country's economy,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aim-of-administration-is-to-eradicate-unemployment-in-jammu-and-kashmir-in-five-years-lieutenant-governor-manoj-sinha-909676.html

A case has been lodged against Farhan Zubairi on Friday evening under the Indian Penal Code section sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race...) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) at the Civil Lines police station, it said.   The FIR against Zubairi states that during the protest march on Thursday "objectionable slogans" were raised against a particular community.    These slogans, according to the police report, were designed to inflame religious hatred.  On Thursday evening, protesting students at AMU had announced a boycott of all French products and had accused the French President Macron of "hurting religious sentiments of Muslims" by his statements on the issue of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/amu-student-leader-who-led-anti-macron-protest-booked-for-hurting-religious-sentiments-909678.html
31-10-2020||Opinion||Malaysia and Mahathir: Economy, politics can't break free the past||By Daniel Moss You know a parliamentary democracy is in deep trouble when a king has to tell lawmakers to pass a budget. That Malaysia's monarch, usually a background ceremonial figure, has become so involved in basic government shows the breakdown in the political economy. But it goes wider than that. This is a country losing all sense of leadership. Like waxwork figures, the dominant players in Kuala Lumpur are the same folks at or near the top of their game when I lived there in the 1990s. Few Malaysians could name a member of the royal families; the position of king is rotated among the hereditary sultans of nine states. But the country is now so skewed along political, cultural and economic divides that the current one has come out of the shadows to referee old feuds. The pandemic has aggravated these wounds. Take Mahathir Mohamad, who ran the government from 1981 to 2003, and had a second spell as prime minister as the leader of his former opponents from 2018 until March. At 95, he’s still maneuvering for another shot. Mahathir would be remembered, with justification, as a nation builder if he knew when to gracefully bow out. Instead, he manages to do Malaysia an incredible disservice, pressing buttons guaranteed to rile up segments of society and to spark outrage in the West. He was at it again Thursday, weighing in that Muslims had a right to kill millions of French people in response to “massacres of the past.” France urged Twitter to suspend his account. The post was removed. Lack of leadership unfortunately goes beyond one man. The king,  Abdullah Ahmad Shah, has signaled that his support for current Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s cabinet is tenuous, admonishing lawmakers to approve the budget for 2021. Last Sunday, he denied Muhyiddin's plea to sign off on a state-of-emergency declaration. The prime minister would have obtained funding and other rule-making powers by executive order — not an insane idea, given the deep recession and surge in Covid-19 infections. The more corrosive impact would have been effectively freezing challenges to Muhyiddin by suspending parliament, where he holds a wavering, paper-thin majority. Unlike neighboring Indonesia and the Philippines, politics in Malaysia seems unable to throw up newcomers or mold-breakers. Flawed as they are, presidents Joko Widodo and Rodrigo Duterte testify to the abilities of their respective countries to renew leadership. Should Muhyiddin be toppled in coming weeks, Malaysia would be on its fourth government in three years. That’s a dramatic shift, given that one bloc led from  independence in 1957 until 2018.  Malaysia seems to be stuck in 1998, and the great political and economic upheaval of the Asian financial crisis. Anwar Ibrahim, who was struck down as Mahathir’s heir-apparent back then, always seems to be on the cusp of becoming prime minister, only to stumble — or be jailed. He’s making another gambit. Najib Razak, the former premier convicted of corruption in the 1MDB scandal, remains a force within the leading political party. They’re all of a younger generation than Mahathir, but it’s hardly a victory for youth; Muhyiddin is 73. There’s far more to Malaysia's woes than Mahathir spouting bigotry, or his infighting with rivals and the monarchy (whose power he curbed in the 1980s, earning undying grudges that helped nudge him out in March). As I wrote in March, Malaysian society is riven in ways redolent of Brexit and Donald Trump. Once among Southeast Asia’s most stable and prospering nations, deep cleavages have opened up around urban and rural populations, the politics of race and faith, and degrees of comfort with globalization.   The current intrigue can be traced to flaws in the country's design. In the years after World War II, a depleted UK. was eager to shed colonies as quickly as possible. In Malaysia, power was to be shared between secular nationalist elected leaders and the traditional rulers. Under this compromise, the royals kept reserve powers and a degree of cultural and religious authority. Executive government lay with the prime minister. The North Borneo states of Sarawak and Sabah — demographically and religiously more diverse than the peninsula — joined in 1963, along with Singapore, which left two years later. These jigsaw pieces held together as long as there was rapid economic growth and one dominant political party, the United Malays National Organization, that reflected majority opinion among ethnic Malays. They get stacks of privileges, especially in government and state programs, while citizens of minority Chinese descent have historically controlled much private sector wealth. Those conditions no longer exist; the country has evolved even if politics hasn’t. Najib led UMNO to its first defeat, in large part because of the stench of graft hanging over his tenure. Far from being a leader in Southeast Asia, the country  increasingly seems to be in thrall to China and the Gulf states. Sabah and Sarawak are flexing their muscles, wanting a greater say over their own affairs and more revenue from oil drilling in their waters. Islamic fundamentalists are well-entrenched and have made steady inroads into the hold of secular parties.  That means that players like Mahathir are prone to dog whistles. Malaysia isn’t a failed state, but the process of descent has begun. Covid-19 has stripped away the economic growth that used to paper it over. The flailing structures of state and their inconsistencies are there for all to see. Without a public health emergency and the deepest economic hole in decades, the slumber at the helm would be sad. In the pandemic era, it’s tragic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/malaysia-and-mahathir-economy-politics-cant-break-free-the-past-909414.html
31-10-2020||Opinion||Donald Trump has made the whole world darker||There is no escaping it: America is on the ballot on Tuesday — the stability and quality of our governing institutions, our alliances, how we treat one another, our basic commitment to scientific principles and the minimum decency that we expect from our leaders. The whole ball of wax is on the ballot. The good news is that we’ve survived four years of Donald Trump’s abusive presidency with most of our core values still intact. To be sure, the damage has been profound, but, I’d argue, the cancer has not yet metastasized into the bones and lymph nodes of our nation. The harm is still reversible. The bad news is that if we have to endure four more years of Donald Trump, with him unrestrained by the need to be reelected, our country will not be the America we grew up with, whose values, norms and institutions we had come to take for granted. Four more years of a president without shame, backed by a party without spine, amplified by a TV network without integrity, and the cancer will be in the bones of every institution that has made America 'America'. And then, who will we be? We can explain away, and the world can explain away, taking a one-time flier on a fast-talking, huckster-populist like Trump. It’s happened to many countries in history. But if we reelect him, knowing what a norm-destroying, divisive, corrupt liar he is, then the world will not treat the last four years as an aberration. It will treat them as an affirmation that we’ve changed. The world will not just look at America differently, but at Americans differently. And with good reason. Reelecting Trump would mean that a significant number of Americans don’t cherish the norms that give our Constitution meaning, don’t appreciate the need for an independent, professional Civil Service, don’t respect scientists, don’t hunger for national unity, don’t care if a president tells 20,000 lies — in short, don’t care about what has actually made America great and different from any other great power in history. If that happens, what America has lost these past four years will become permanent. And the effects will be felt all over the world. Foreigners love to make fun of America, of our naivete, or our silly notion that every problem has a solution and that the future can bury the past — that the past doesn’t always have to bury the future. But deep down, they often envy Americans’ optimism. If America goes dark, if the message broadcast by the Statue of Liberty shifts from “give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free” to “get the hell off my lawn”; if America becomes just as cynically transactional in all its foreign dealings as Russia and China; if foreigners stop believing that there is somewhere over the rainbow where truth is still held sacred in news reporting and where justice is the norm in most of the courts, then the whole world will get darker. Those who have looked to us for inspiration will have no widely respected reference point against which to critique their own governments. Authoritarian leaders all over the world — in Turkey, China, Russia, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and elsewhere — already smell this. They have been emboldened by the Trump years. They know they’re freer to assassinate, poison, jail, torture and censor whomever they want, without reproach from America, as long as they flatter Trump or buy our arms. I asked Nader Mousavizadeh, a former senior UN official who now runs the London-based consultancy Macro Advisory Partners, what he thought was at stake in this election. He said: “It’s the sense that ever since FDR, despite all kinds of failures and flaws, America was a country that wanted a better future — not just for itself but for other people.” While that may seem like a banality, he added, “it is actually unique in history. No other great power in history has behaved that way. And it provided America with an intangible asset of immense value: the benefit of the doubt. People across the world were willing to give America a second, third and fourth chance because they believed that, unlike any other great power that had come to impact their lives, our purpose was different.” Of course, America has at times behaved in cruel, nakedly self-interested, reckless and harmful ways toward other nations and peoples. Vietnam was real. Anti-democratic coups in Iran and Chile were real. Abu Ghraib was real. Separating children from their parents at our southern border was real. But they remain exceptions, not our modus operandi, which is precisely why people all over the world, not to mention Americans, are so enraged by them — while shrugging off Russia’s or China’s abuses. It’s because they know, added Mousavizadeh, that historically “America’s intent, if not always its practice, has been to exhort not extort other nations; to export not exploit; to collaborate not dominate; and to strengthen a global system of rules and norms, not overturn it in order to focus exclusively on its own enrichment. “Four more years of Trump’s America, and no one will have cause to give us the benefit of any doubt. The disillusionment will be shattering to our standing and influence — and only when we are received around the world as Russians or Chinese will we know what we have lost, for good.” Was everything Trump did wrong or unnecessary? No. He provided a valuable corrective to US-China trade relations. A useful counterpunch to Iranian excesses in the Middle East. And he sent the needed message, albeit crudely, that if you want to come into this country, you can’t just walk in, you have to at least ring the doorbell. But these initiatives were nowhere near as impactful as Trump pretends they are, precisely because he did them alone — without allies abroad or bipartisan support at home. We could have had a much bigger and sustainable impact on China and Iran if we had acted with our allies; we could have had a grand bargain on immigration if Trump had been willing to move to the center. But he wouldn’t. I fear that this inability of Americans to do big, hard things together anymore — which predated Trump and the pandemic, but was exacerbated by them both — has led to another loss. It’s a loss of confidence in democratic systems generally, and versus China’s autocratic system in particular. Over the last pandemic year, the legendary investor Ray Dalio wrote in The Financial Times last week, China’s “economy grew at almost 5%, without monetizing debt, while all major economies contracted. China produces more than it consumes and runs a balance of payments surplus, unlike the US and many Western nations.” Even Tesla’s best-selling Model 3 car, he wrote, “may soon be made entirely in China.” Makes you wonder if the Trump presidency will be remembered not for making America great but for China’s great leap past America. If you’re not worried about that, you haven’t been paying attention these last four years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/donald-trump-has-made-the-whole-world-darker-909450.html
31-10-2020||Opinion||How to see the Halloween Blue Moon (and Uranus!) with your kids||As a little girl growing up in Portugal, Raquel Nuno made birthday wishes upon shooting stars. She was born near the peak of the Perseids meteor shower, one of the most prolific annual cosmic light shows. Every year her father whisked her and her family away to the beach to celebrate under the celestial fireworks. There, she gazed up at the dazzling display amid a backdrop of stars as countless as the grains of sand at her feet. “I fell in love with the night sky,” said Nuno. “It just made me think about our universe and my place in it.” Now, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, Nuno ponders the cosmos professionally. She studies impact craters on the moon using tools aboard NASA’s robotic spacecraft orbiting the moon. “I found my passion — my calling — because he brought me out to look at the night sky,” she said of her father. She’s not alone. Many kids go through an astronomy phase. Even if yours doesn’t dream of becoming an astronaut, taking them stargazing and planet-watching is a great way to spark their imagination and help them fall in love with the universe around them. Astronomers, after all, are grown up kids. This Halloween weekend is a particularly good time to start looking to the stars — on Saturday, there will be a full moon and a parade of visible planets. If you plan to explore the night sky with your kids, here is some advice from astronomers to mesmerize them with that cosmic movie theater in your backyard. Behold the moon The best way to begin your astronomical adventures is with the moon. It’s easy to spot and doesn’t require fancy equipment to enjoy. On Saturday, there will be a spooky full moon — the second of the month, which is called a Blue moon. “The moon is a really great opportunity for parents to engage their kids in the night sky because it always puts on a show no matter where you live,” said Nuno. Even if you miss it at its biggest and brightest, you can take your kids and look as its phases get progressively smaller: quarter, gibbous and crescent. Try to make a lunar calendar with them by bringing paper and markers and drawing the phases of the moon you see every night for 28 days. With their naked eyes, your kids can spot its craters and dark regions. While you watch, Nuno said, tell them the dark spots are remnants of ancient volcanic plains that once spewed magma across the lunar surface. Have them imagine what it looked like billions of years ago, an oozing, molten mess. Follow the planetary parade The next steps for rookie astronomers are the planets. Throughout November eager stargazers will be able to spot five planets without a telescope. Start with Mars. Since early October the red planet has glowed like an amber honey drop in the night sky, which you may have already noticed. That’s because the planet neared opposition (the point where Earth was directly between it and the Sun) and its closest approach to Earth around mid-October. Look for Mars in the southeast sky, it will be the brightest thing in the eastern half of the heavens (that isn’t the moon, of course). After you marvel at Mars, search for Saturn and Jupiter. They’ll be the two bright dots dancing next to each other to the west. Jupiter will outshine its ringed cousin and be the brightest non-moon object on this half of the sky. On December 21 the duo will be at their closest to each other in the night sky since 1623, according to Earthsky. A fun fact to share with your kids, after you tell them about Saturn’s rings, is that the gas giant is less dense than water, meaning if one could find a big enough tub, it would float (although some say its rocky core would sink). Those three planets will be visible at night, but if your kids are willing to get up early, you can watch Venus before sunrise Sunday morning (and Mercury later in week, although hard to spot). Venus is the brightest planet so it’ll be easy to spot. If you get them out of bed, tell your kids that it is so hot there, metal melts on the surface of Venus, making it hard to explore with space probes. Mercury should be meandering somewhere below Venus. It’ll be harder to point out, but with enough patience you should be able to make it out before the sun’s light swallows it. Zoom in a little To take your planetary viewing experience to the next level, grab a good pair of binoculars, said Meg Thacher, an astronomer at Smith College in Massachusetts and author of the children’s book “Sky Gazing: A Guide to the Moon, Sun, Planets, Stars, Eclipses, and Constellations.” (You can find binoculars at a range of price points on Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews consumer products.) Thacher recommended binoculars because telescopes can be expensive and, if you’ve never used one before, frustrating for everyone. “You can’t just point at a random spot in the sky and expect great things to happen with your telescope,” said Thacher. “It’s mostly black.” But if you do know how to work a telescope, then come Saturday night, set your sights on Uranus as it nears opposition, when its relation to the Sun makes it particularly bright. The full moon will outshine Uranus, but you might still see it with your naked eye. Then tell your kids how scientists have found hydrogen sulfide up there, meaning that yes, Uranus does smell like farts. “There is no end to the Uranus jokes,” said Thacher. Connect the cosmic and cultural dots Before you move beyond the planets to the actual stars of the night sky, consider using an app or some software like Skyguide, Stellarium or Google Sky that can map out planetary and star positions for you. They take out a lot of the guesswork and allow you to hand your phone off to your kids so they can get better acquainted with the constellations. Often constellation patterns can be tricky to piece together. If you’re looking for an easy one to spot, Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, suggested starting with the Big Dipper. Most people in the Northern Hemisphere have seen this; just scan the northern sky for seven bright stars grouped together. Three will be in the shape of a handle and the other four will look like a rectangle. Once you know what to look for, the Big Dipper comes to life. After you spot it, look at the two stars in the cup that are furthest away from the handle, where the water might pour out of it. These are the pointer stars: Merak, on bottom, and Dubhe, on top. If you draw a straight line from Merak to Dubhe and out of the cup, you’ll land on Polaris, which is the North Star. With Polaris in your sights you now have the handle of the Little Dipper. Faherty suggested mapping this out on paper with your kids. Read stories in the sky The best part about finding constellations is all the different stories cemented in their stars. “The fall season is the big showcase in the sky where there’s a famous mythological story that we tell,” said Faherty. Look for Perseus riding in on Pegasus. As the story goes, he saved Princess Andromeda from Cetus the whale, while carrying Medusa’s head, all of which appears in the stars. Stargazing is also a wonderful opportunity to introduce children to cultures they might not be acquainted with. What many call Orion’s Belt, for example, is known to the Lakota Native Americans as “Tayamni Cankhu” or as the spine of a bison. Those same stars are seen by the Chinook Native Americans as a canoe racing another boat — what many people know as Orion’s dagger — in the Big River, or the Milky Way. The Ojibwe Native Americans have a constellation that includes Orion called Biboonkeonini, or the Wintermaker. The Wiradjuri people, an Australian Aboriginal nation, referred to the Milky Way as Gugurmin, a giant celestial Emu, said Kirsten Banks, an astrophysicist at the University of New South Wales in Australia and a member of the Wiradjuri nation. Its position in the sky helped inform people about the best time to go hunting for emu eggs, said Banks. Wait for the show Perhaps the best time to bring your kids to stargaze is during a meteor shower. The Orionids are tapering off, but the next shower to the peak will be the Leonids around Nov. 16 and 17. Not everything that streaks across the night sky is a falling star. Some are satellites, blinking in the dark. Searching for satellites with your kids also allows you to reflect on something called “space debris,” pollution caused when spacecraft break down and clog up space. “We probably track about 26,000 things, ranging in size from a cellphone to the space station,” said Moriba Jah, an aerodynamicist at The University of Texas at Austin. “Of the 26,000, only about 3,000 things work, and everything else is garbage.” Light pollution also obstructs the night sky. About 80% of Americans cannot simply gaze upon the Milky Way from home. If you’re fortunate enough to live somewhere very dark, or you can travel to a dark spot, take the time to talk with your kids about how our night sky needs protection. “If we’re losing all those stars, we’re losing all those stories,” said Banks. The best way to preserve those stories is to pass them on to the next generation. Stargazing is an opportunity to show and share the wonders of astronomy with kids who are already interested in space and those who just need a little push. Make it fun and encourage them to play with their imaginations as they look up. “That will make them want to do it more,” said Nuno, “and it’ll become a special thing that you did with your kids that they’ll always remember.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-to-see-the-halloween-blue-moon-and-uranus-with-your-kids-909566.html
31-10-2020||Opinion||It is a vote for the planet, silly!||President Trump’s recent comments about India’s air being filthy left some gasping for breath. He clubbed India with China and Russia on this metric. It is true that India and China have the worst air quality indicators for our cities and towns. We do need to improve. India needs to determinedly handle crop-burning issues, provide clean public transport options, clean its sewer and municipal solid waste, prevent lake encroachments by builders, and strictly implement environmental norms for industries which freely spew gaseous waste into the air, liquid wastes into our rivers, and solid wastes into illegal landfills! For this, India needs to get beyond sloganeering and sweeping leaves on the streets to creating meaningful budgets for a truly clean India. For this, activists need to get off from doing one-time self-glorifying selfie-time events to participating collaboratively with the government. However, the topic being discussed during the presidential debate, when the comment was made, was climate change. America is the biggest contributor globally to climate change on a per capita basis. America is the second-largest contributor to climate change, behind China, even in absolute terms. In fact, the US emits more than eight times CO2 per capita than India does. On an absolute basis, the US emits twice that of India. Air quality measures are based on the particulate matter below a certain size which is detrimental to human health. However, ozone depletion and climate change do not work based on measures developed solely for human health benefit. Spewing gases away from cities, when you have large land masses, will keep the cities clean but will cause no less damage to the planet. Also, over the past 120 years, the US has emitted 12 times more total CO2 than India in absolute terms, and 5-6 times more than European countries like UK and Germany. This is important because there is an atmospheric residence time associated with greenhouse gases. For CO2, the residence time ranges from five to 200 years, depending on the removal process. Carbon tetrafluoride, or CF4, which is used as a low-temperature refrigerant, has a residence time of 50,000 years! It is shallow and shortsighted for a country like the US to deal with its current excesses and its historic debt to the planet by viewing selective data through a tinted lens. Developing economies will need a different emission budget to even provide minimum living standards to its citizens, compared to developed economies that have already significantly over-drafted on their emission budgets through unbridled consumerism. The Paris Agreement was hence fair in identifying differentiated responsibilities for developed and developing economies. By backing out from the Paris Agreement, the Trump administration abdicated from America’s position as a global leader on the issue of climate change. By backing out from technological research associated with greener energy, the US lost decades of progress towards mitigating climate change. After the 2016 US presidential elections, one of my American collaborators who identified himself as a ‘Mexican-Jew Energy Researcher’ went into a depression for weeks and then left a top university in the US to move to Canada. He felt that each aspect of his identity, beliefs and profession was counter to the direction the US would take under Trump. I had then felt that my colleague was being too extreme in his reaction to the election of Trump as President. I was wrong. Trump is for fracking and against wind turbines, he is for unfettered use of water in commodes and against curbing super pollutant refrigerants. Trump is for protecting jobs that have gone past their expiry dates and he lacks the vision to see jobs as they should be. Trump is for protecting medieval gender roles and is unable to take a strong anti-racist stand. Trump is for building walls around the US, and he has no plan for inclusive healthcare for even those within those walls. Trump just wants to get re-elected, the planet be damned. To the Native American Ute Tribe of Utah is attributed the saying, “We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.” Our planet is a beautifully balanced system. It amazes me how every aspect of our earth and its environment are interconnected. The earth can well regulate harmful issues it faces using various defence mechanisms. New diseases, raging fires, devastating floods and destructive tornadoes are all part of the earth’s defences and are here to stay till the point of safe return for the planet. As glaciers melt, we are exposed to new viruses in the uncovered layers, almost as if they were stored away to be released as a control mechanism. As we encroach on forests, we are more susceptible to diseases jumping species. Disrupting natural water cycles cause more frequent and more destructive floods. Small changes in temperatures transform gentle winds into destructive forces. The human ability to collaborate with planet earth continues to diminish as the planet takes back control from its irresponsible citizens. Another four-year term for Donald Trump as the head of the world’s most polluting country, with his cowboy, wild-wild-west approach to the environment, will be disastrous and will certainly result in more severe natural calamities globally than we have already seen. While the November 3 elections are about individual pompousness versus inclusive humbleness, about international isolationism vs global leadership, about intellectual bankruptcy vs a learning population, and about pandemic response vs opening up the economy, the elections are even more about a planet worth living on versus generations of climate change adaptation! The outcome is a known unknown for the next few days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/it-is-a-vote-for-the-planet-silly-909704.html
31-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Taking on the cook||It happened in Munnar in the 1960s, when many Britishers still managed tea-plantations. Memsahib was at her wit’s end trying to figure out how eggs were being filched from her pantry.  She kept a careful watch on the domestic helpers but to no avail.  Finally, one daylight dawned and she confronted her cook. “When did your turban become a nest?” she snapped sarcastically. “I just found three eggs in it!” This was typical of the battle of wits played out in many tea planters’ households in those days – with a sometimes unscrupulous domestic trying to fleece his employers and the memsahib determined to nip any ‘sleight-of-hand’ in the bud. Lacking entertainment in the remote tea estates, servants were often tempted to switch on their employers’ radio when the latter was away – something strictly forbidden. One cook, however, didn’t quite reckon with the memsahib’s astuteness. On being asked whether he had switched on the radio in her absence, he promptly denied having done so. “Then how come the radio’s quite warm?” she retorted. Quite inevitably, some domestics became Scotch-fanciers – which, of course, explained why liquor levels in the sahib’s bottles sometimes dropped inexplicably. When buttonholed, one cook blithely explained away the mystery, attributing it to the bottle not having been properly corked by the sahib and the consequent evaporation!  One Sunday morning, a young, newly-recruited Scottish planter lazed in bed, listening with pleasurable anticipation to the sizzling sounds of ‘dosais’ being baked in the kitchen.  At breakfast, however, he was dismayed to find only four on the table. “I counted no less than eight sizzling sounds this morning,” he chided the cook. “Where are the remaining ‘dosais”? The cook was bewildered initially, then light dawned and he explained painstakingly that it took two sizzles to make one ‘dosai’ – the first when the batter was poured out and the second when it’s turned over.   The youngster’s sheepish but contrite simper made adequate amends for his faux pas. Communication was often a stumbling block. Another freshly recruited Brit returned home dog-tired and told his cook, “Get me a cuppa.”  Thirty minutes later the tea hadn’t come, so he bawled out the cook who soon appeared, beaming, with a plate of steaming tapioca, explaining apologetically that he had to get it from the bazaar. The young Brit then learnt, to his consternation, that ‘cuppa’ also meant tapioca in Tamil! Yet, for all their shortcomings, domestics were an indispensable necessity in Munnar’s former British households. For the Brit needed his Man Friday-cum- scapegoat, as much as he did his cuppa and ‘chota’ peg!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/taking-on-the-cook-909343.html
31-10-2020||Second Edit||Onion prices cause of tears again||The retail prices of onions have steeply risen all over the country in the last few days from around Rs 20 a kilo to Rs 100 in some places. In most places, it is around Rs 80. An increase in the price of onions at this time of the year is not uncommon but governments have been found unprepared to face the situation. Onions are staples in all kitchens and so when they go beyond the reach it hurts everyone, and the special circumstances of this year make it more difficult. There are many reasons for the spurt in prices. The major onion producing states in the country are Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and there are three crops in a year. If production is affected in any one state and if one crop fails, supply is affected adversely.  Heavy rains in Karnataka in September and in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in October damaged crops and supply was badly hit. Even the good onion crops of this season are difficult to store because of their higher moisture content. When the supplies started falling, the government imposed stock limits on both wholesalers and retailers to prevent hoarding. Traders in major onion markets stayed away from auctions in protest, and this aggravated the situation. Onions do not come under the purview of the amended Essential Commodities Act, but the government imposed the stock limits under a special provision, with the ongoing Bihar election in view. Traders have claimed that they cannot buy onions because they cannot stock them, and farmers are not bringing them to the market. At the same time, import restrictions have been removed but it will take time for imported onions to reach the market.  It is difficult to see the situation easing in the next two or three weeks, and by then the next crop will start coming into the market. Imports may also arrive by then which, together with increased domestic supplies, may push the prices very low so that the farmer will suffer again. Both farmers and consumers have suffered from the volatility of prices, which have ranged from Rs 8 to Rs 100 a year. It is necessary to create buffer stocks of farm goods and vegetables like onions, too, as a cushioning mechanism. This year, there is an onion buffer stock for the first time, but it should be bigger and should continue for the next year, too. Better and larger storage facilities should be created and most importantly, there should be a stable policy environment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/onion-prices-cause-of-tears-again-909338.html

The tourism sector in the southern state had been in doldrums following the outbreak of the virus and the global coronavirus scare. As part of the unlock process, the government had decided to open the tourism centres in the state in two phases. Accordingly, in the first phase, the hill stations, adventure resorts and backwater tourism centres including houseboats were reopened on October 12, strictly adhering to the Covid-protocol. In the second phase, the beach tourism destinations will reopen on November 1, the Kerala Day (Kerala Piravi Day), Tourism Department sources here said. The reopening of the beaches and the launch of 26 new tourism projects are expected to give a boost to the holiday sector, they said. Tourism stakeholders also feel that the reopening of the beaches along with the hill stations would instil a renewed energy in the state holiday industry. "The decision to reopen beaches after hill station is a welcome move by the state government. It will give renewed energy and boost to the beach properties like hotels and resorts there. It is also a solace to a large number of domestic families who like to spend their evenings in beaches and reduce their stress in this critical period," E M Najeeb, senior vice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) told PTI. During this period of the pandemic, only domestic tourists can be expected in the beach resorts though it was used to be preferred by foreign tourists more. Kerala's pristine beaches, whether it is Kovalam, Varkala, or Bekal are one of the most sought after destinations of global tourists, he added. October saw the inauguration of 26 significant tourism projects in the state by the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. In his address, the Chief Minister had said when the state, the country and the world survive Covid-19, Kerala would once again become a tourist paradise. "The launch of the 26 new projects will mark the revival of the tourism sector in Kerala in the post-Covid-19-season. The pandemic came at a time when the tourism sector was thriving, overcoming many crises," Vijayan had said. The tourism sector was estimated to have lost Rs 25,000 crores coupled with huge job losses. The new projects are spread across almost all the districts in Kerala, from the popular hill station tourist centre Ponmudi in Thiruvananthapuram way up to the northernmost districts. Some of the notable projects are Malamelpara tourism project in Kollam district, Kollam BeachandThani Beach projects, the Green Tourism Complex in Pala, the Aruvikuzhi Tourism Development Project in Idukki district, the Malanad-North Malabar River Cruise Tourism Project and the Chingeri Hill Rock Adventure Tourism Project in Wayanad, department sources added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/after-hill-stations-kerala-reopens-beaches-for-tourists-909517.html

The nine-year-old tigress, which had earlier given sleepless nights to residents of Wayanad district by killing several domestic animals, was recently caught by forest officials and brought to Neyyar sanctuary. By Saturday noon some forest officials found that the tigress escaped from the cage by breaking the mesh. Though officials later spotted the tigress, it again disappeared before they could tranquilise it. Later the tigress was suspected to have escaped to the Neyyar dam. The forest authorities sounded an alert among the people of the locality and the search was continuing. The chances of the tigress entering the adjacent forest areas were also not being ruled out. The tigress was causing a threat at Cheeyambam near Pulpally in Wayanad for around two months as it killed many domestic animals. The forest officials captured it on October 25 after tranquilising.

He said the state governments expenditure on pensions is between Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 11,000 crore every year but the amount given by the Centre is only Rs 105 crore. The state government provides pensions to over 38.64 lakh people with each person getting Rs 2,016 for different categories of beneficiaries like senior citizens and widows but again the Centre gives pensions to only seven lakh people with each getting Rs 200, he said. He said the BJP leaders claim the Centre is giving Rs 1,600 per person and that he would quit office if anybody proves him wrong. The records of what he was saying were with CAG, he said. Rao, speaking after inaugurating Rythu Vedika, a venue for farmers to discuss farm issues, at Kodakandla in Jangaon district, alleged that a Congress leader got a drama staged through someone by burning dry grass after harvesting paddy crop. The Congress leader sought to spread false information that a farmer had to burn his crop after having suffered losses by cultivating sanna variety of paddy as per his (Rao's) advice, he alleged. The opposition parties were only focussed on getting votes, he said. About the Rythu Vedikas, Rao said such venues do not exist anywhere in the world. Stating that there has been no place for the farmers to discuss issues, he said the Rythu Vedikas are aimed at organising the farmers towards achieving a better deal. He said 2,601 Rythu Vedikas are under construction in the state and that about 1,500 have been completed. He alleged that the state governments are not allowed to provide subsidies to farmers and cited a reported order of FCI to all state governments that paddy should be purchased only for Rs 1,888 and that it would not be procured from the state if the price exceeded this amount. Hitting out at the new farm laws brought in by the Centre, he alleged that the passage of the bills led to the produce being purchased for less than the MSP and that only the big businessmen benefited from this. During his interaction with rice mill people, he said he was recently told that the produce was not being purchased for MSP following the new farm legislations as corn is being offered at a low price of Rs 1,500 by those from Uttar Pradesh and other states. He said he would talk about the issue within the party and with other parties. "If necessary, we have to tighten the fist and go for the battle, he said. It is said about the farm legislation that the farmer can sell his produce anywhere in the country, but can the farmer from Telangana go to Delhi or vice-versa, he said. Only big businessmen would take benefit under the new legislation as market committees, licence and others have been removed, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-spreading-lies-on-social-security-says-telangana-cm-k-chandrashekar-rao-909680.html

If Biden manages to defeat the current president Donald Trump, Murthy is likely to grab one of the key positions in the US government. Murthy, a former US Surgeon General, is among the battery of experts that Biden consults. According to reports, Murthy, along with economist Raj Chetty, another prominent Indian-American aiding the Biden campaign, is advising the presidential nominee on the ongoing pandemic. In the early days of Covid-19, Biden was briefed almost "every day, or at least four times a week." Murthy, who served under the Barack Obama administration, has roots in Hallegere village of Mandya district in Karnataka. He is the grandson of HT Narayan Shetty, a backward class leader and an aide of ex-Chief Minister D Devaraj Urs.  He received a BA from Harvard University, an MBA from Yale School of Management, and an MD from Yale School of Medicine. According to reports, he has also donated funds to improve health facilities in his village in Karnataka. Murthy recalled his family, his ancestral village, and his agricultural background when he was appointed US Surgeon General, an advisor to the president on public health measures.  "We were not supposed to have become Americans. My parents stopped in three other countries – including a brutal dictatorship – on their journey to get here. They saved up money and scrounged for information about job opportunities, always knowing that America was the destination," Murthy said.

31-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka scores on growth, fails in equality||While Karnataka is third in the country in terms of growth, it badly lags behind other states when it comes to equality and sustainability, a nationwide assessment of states and Union Territories has found. The findings were disclosed on Friday in the annual Public Affairs Index report which assesses the adequacy and quality of governance. It was published by the Karnataka-based think-tank, the Public Affairs Centre (PAC). The data lays bare the often-contradictory growth pattern of the state when compared to other states. The assessments consider three primary “pillars” upon which the sustainability development of states and territories are judged: equality, growth and sustainability. When it comes to “growth” Karnataka scores a rank of 1.22 on the index –- making it second in the country among large states (behind Kerala, which has a growth index rank of 1.42). However, among small states, Goa has the top index rank of 1.93. In contrast, when it comes to “equality”, Karnataka’s index value is an abysmal -0.609, which ranks it 12th among the large states, below states like Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Telangana. In fact, apart from Telangana, Karnataka is the only state in south India to have a negative ranking on the parameter of equality. Aparna Sivaraman, Programme Officer at the think-tank and Team Lead for the index explained that states’ and UT data was standardised using either gross domestic product, population or geographical area to ensure that all states are competitive.  She explained that “growth” is assessed in terms of gross state domestic product, employment levels and infrastructure improvements such as school buildings…etc. “Equality” is measured in terms of access to services, malnutrition, social inequalities, teacher-to-student ratios and other similar factors. Gender imbalances in labour also play a role with a low female worker population ratio having a negative relationship to growth. This indicates that the state economy is growing at the cost of widening gender disparities.  “Interestingly, the data shows that while Karnataka has invested heavily in buildings and other infrastructure, it has invested less in human development and human capital,” Aparna said. She added, however, that there had been some improvement. “Last year, it ranked last among the large states – at 18th position,” she added. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) strongly correlate to “equality” such as SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Sustainability slip On the matter of “sustainability,” Karnataka ranks fifth in the country among large states with an index value of 0.793. In contrast, the top small state, Goa, ranks 2.181.   PAC said that the parameters of sustainability significantly influence overall performance in large and small states and Union Territories. Last year, Karnataka was at top place among large states with an index value of 1.45||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-scores-on-growth-fails-in-equality-909380.html
31-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19 aftercare: A long way to go for Karnataka||At a time when more than 35,000 Covid-19 patients require aftercare in the state, Victoria hospital — the largest government Covid hospital which had announced plans to initiate a 'Post-Covid Care' clinic in mid-August — is yet to start the facility. More than 7.41 lakh Covid patients have been discharged in the state till Thursday; over 1.77 lakh are in the age group of 21 to 30. According to the World Health Organization, about 20% of Covid-19 patients in the 18-35 age group report symptoms for weeks after recovery. Taking care after discharge also brings an economic burden, especially for the poor. The Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), the only government hospital that is offering Covid aftercare, has incurred an expenditure of Rs 3 lakh to treat 72 such patients free of cost. Treating each patient costs up to Rs 5,500, which the poor cannot afford. RGICD's post-Covid clinic became operational on September 1. Of the 72 patients who visited the clinic, 33% suffered breathlessness, 28% had fatigue followed by cough, 24% had lung fibrosis, 15% suffered hypoxia and 11% suffered psychological symptoms like depression and adjustment disorder. The Victoria Hospital has reached out to 2,000 Covid-19 survivors in the past three months out of the 5,780 who were discharged. A total of 6,525 Covid patients were admitted to the hospital in the past seven months. Though a screening room was set aside next to the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) on the Victoria campus, it is still awaiting inauguration. In the absence of the government's Covid aftercare facilities, patients are left to pay for care at private hospitals. The central team which reviewed the management of the pandemic in Karnataka observed that the state health department has not paid attention in finding out the health problems faced by Covid patients after recovery. "An old screening room has been identified as the Covid rehabilitation centre. But since the testing target for the Covid lab is 500 samples, the room is being used for testing purposes. We have to identify another place if we cannot use this room. We are getting physiotherapy equipment that the government has already approved for chest physiotherapy," said a doctor at the Victoria Hospital, requesting anonymity. "We are awaiting the official inauguration before we can put out the working hours and phone numbers on our website so that it is also accessible to patients who have been treated elsewhere and have post-Covid problems. We are doing a consultation on the phone as of now. We will have to charge the patients for CT scan though," the doctor said. Tests at RGCID At RGICD, patients undergo complete blood count tests, blood sugar, renal function test, pulmonary function/diffusion capacity test, ECG, ECHO, X-Ray, CT Thorax, six-minute walk test, physiotherapy, D-Dimer, and other inflammatory markers' test. The hospital has an MoU with a private facility called Ragavs Diagnostic and Research Centre for doing CT scans. For each scan, RGICD pays the facility Rs 2,000. The hospital calls patients up to six weeks after discharge from the hospital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-aftercare-a-long-way-to-go-for-karnataka-909389.html

"It (expansion) has been put on hold for quite some time due to various reasons. I will go to Delhi to discuss it with party leaders. It will take place soon after the bypoll results are announced," he told reporters ahead of a roadshow in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. Asked about his announcement at the roadshow that Munirathna would be made minister, he said "I am 100 per cent going to make him minister after he wins the bypoll.' Congress state chief D K Shivakumar flayed the announcement on Munirathna, saying it was a violation of the model code of conduct. "Let him be made chief minister.... but now saying that he (Munirathna) will be made minister itself is a poll code violation," Shivakumar told reporters. Addressing the roadshow, Yediyurappa asked voters to elect Munirathna by at least a 50,000 vote margin, "paving the way for him to be made minister soon after he wins." He lauded the steps taken by Munirathna to help people of his constituency during the coronavirus induced lockdown and urged them to help him win by at least a 50,000 margin, "paving the way for making him a minister." The Chief Minister said Rs 900 crore worth work has already been sanctioned in the constituency. Yediyurappa, seeking to silence his critics within and outside BJP, reiterated that he would continue as Chief Minister for the rest of the term and run the party and government. On October 21, senior BJP legislator Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had said that Yediyurappa would not remain Chief Minister for long and the high command had decided that his successor would be from the north Karnataka region. While BJP leaders downplayed Yatnal's statement, saying there was no truth in it, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told a private news channel recently that the Chief Minister will not continue after the Bihar election. Basavaraj Horatti of JD(S) too had claimed a week ago that Yatnal has the backing of the BJP high command as he has not been removed from the party yet. The RR Nagar bypoll has become a prestigious battle with all three political parties -- BJP, Congress and JD(S) fighting it out intensely. The election was warranted as Munirathna, a former Congress MLA, resigned from the assembly last year and joined the BJP. The Congress has fielded former IAS officer late D K Ravi's wife and senior leader Hanumantharayappa's daughter H Kusuma, while the JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy. The by elections at RR Nagar in the city and Sira in Tumakuru district will be held on November 3. Counting of votes is on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-says-cabinet-expansion-soon-after-assembly-bypolls-909622.html

31-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||A year after decision, bilingual marks cards a non-starter||It’s one year now after the decision to provide bilingual (Kannada and English) marks cards for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. But most of the universities have not yet implemented it. The decision to print marks cards in both languages was based on the recommendation by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) to implement Kannada in administration and academics at the higher education level. According to the higher education department, the decision has not been implemented in any of the universities.  In June 2019, the Karnataka State Council for Higher Education had taken the decision, following the recommendation submitted by the KDA, but even a year after the resolution passed in the Council meeting, none of the universities is keen on implementing it. “Printing bilingual marks cards is not a problem, but the size of the marks card will become bigger,” is what the university authorities are saying.  “We cannot print two marks cards, but we can make the existing marks cards bilingual. The problem is, the font size will be small if we print in both Kannada and English,” said the registrar evaluation of one of the state-run universities.  Another official from a university-based in Bengaluru said, “Printing marks cards in two languages will double the work as the number of subjects will also become double.” Vice Chancellor of Bangalore University Prof K R Venugopal said, “We will implement it from next academic year.” The government had given exemption from this for Sanskrit University as they are already printing marks cards in Sanskrit. The decision to print bilingual marks cards applies even to private and deemed to be universities. Every year, each university in the state prints three lakh to to four lakh marks cards.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/a-year-after-decision-bilingual-marks-cards-a-non-starter-909652.html
31-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Goa Congress opposes 3 central projects on Karnataka border||In what could be a shot in the arm for civil society groups campaigning against three upcoming central government projects, fearing increased transportation of coal through the protected forest areas along the Goa-Karnataka border, the Congress legislature party on Saturday, unanimously resolved to support the popular protests.   After the CLP meeting, Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said that the three projects which deal with the rail, road, and power sector, were environmentally disastrous for Goa and an attack on the state’s unique identity, and the CLP has resolved to oppose them. “The CLP unanimously resolved to extend full support to the people’s agitations raising concerns about the mass destruction to the environment and identity of Goa. The CLP also decided to actively participate in the protests and agitations with people,” Kamat, a former Chief Minister said.  In the meeting, the five Congress MLAs in the state, led by Kamat, had deliberated about the three projects related to doubling of the railway tracks from Castle Rock railway station to Tinaighat station in Goa, the widening of the National Highway 4A and the drawing of a power line from Karnataka to Goa, which the CLP said would severely damage the environment, especially the forested areas in the Bhagwan Mahavir wildlife sanctuary and the Mollem national park.  “The CLP has also expressed concerns about the threat to the wildlife and forests due to the said projects,” Kamat said.  Around 50,000 trees in and around Mollem have been slotted for felling for three central government projects. The projects have already been cleared by the National Wildlife Board in April this year. Activists claim that the projects are aimed at facilitating increased transportation of coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port Trust to the steel mills in Karnataka’s Ballari district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/goa-congress-opposes-3-central-projects-on-karnataka-border-909655.html
31-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Vokkaliga politics holds the key to November 3 bypolls||Earlier this week, Health and Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar minced no words as he launched an attack on the Congress, pitting the dominant Vokkaliga community against the party ahead of the November 3 bypolls.  “How will Congress address the demands of Vokkaligas of the state when it failed to take care of Vokkaligas within the party,” Sudhakar, identifying himself as a Vokkaliga, asked during a campaign rally at the poll-bound Rajarajeshwarinagar. He was earlier with theCongress.  In another rally last week, JD(S) leader Nikhil Kumaraswamy declared that H D Devegowda and H D Kumaraswamy would forever remain the leaders of the Vokkaliga community and “none could usurp their position.”  Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D K Shivakumar and his brother Bangalore Rural MP D K Suresh, both Vokkaligas, are also said to be banking on the community’s votes to be consolidated.  The Rajarajeshwarinagar and Sira bypolls have one common thread - politics over who holds the bragging rights over the Vokkaliga community, which accounts for 12-15% of the state’s population. The community forms a sizable number of votes in both the segments, which all parties are trying to woo.  While the Vokkaliga community has been the largest vote base for regional party JD(S), both Congress and BJP are looking to sway these votes their way.  Much is at stake for Vokkaliga leaders from all parties - Shivakumar, Revenue Minister R Ashoka and Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan of the BJP and of course, Kumaraswamy - and this has made the bypolls a proxy war between them.   In Rajarajeshwarinagar, the JD(S) has fielded local clansman V Krishnamurthy, while Congress has picked debutant Kusuma Hanumantharayappa. Except for BJP’s candidate Munirathna, an OBC,  the other two are Vokkaligas.  In Sira, JD(S) candidate Ammajamma, Congress’ T B Jayachandra and BJP’s C M Rajesh Gowda are Kunchitiga Vokkaliga. BJP sources say they expect a split in the Vokkaliga votes and the party hopes to gain votes of KaaduGollas.  According to poll managers, Rajarajeshwarinagar has over one lakh Vokkaligas among 4.60 lakh voters. In Sira, there are nearly 60,000 Vokkaligas - a majority of them Kunchitiga - out of 2.15 lakh voters.  It is said that the JD(S) is already wary of Shivakumar’s growing clout in the Vokkaliga community. In parallel, the BJP is looking to make inroads into the Old Mysuru region by infiltrating this community.  That the Vokkaligas are politically dominant was made known as recently as the 2018 Assembly elections. Thanks to consolidation of the community’s votes, the JD(S) won big in the Old Mysuru region, with even the then incumbent chief minister Siddaramaiah losing from the Chamundeshwari segment.  “The bypolls are in constituencies that are part of the Old Mysuru region, which has traditionally been the stronghold of the Vokkaliga community,” political analyst Sandeep Shastri said. “These two constituencies, more specifically, have a significant presence of this dominant caste. Caste is a critical factor.” Shastri said he expected a split in Vokkaliga votes at Sira, whereas the caste factor could boil down to a contest between the Congress and the JD(S) from which the BJP can gain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/vokkaliga-politics-holds-the-key-to-november-3-bypolls-909663.html

Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is being celebrated as 'Rashtriya Ekta Diwas' (National Unity Day) since 2014. Modi, whose two-day Gujarat visit started on Friday, reached the Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Narmada district this morning and offered flowers at the feet of the monument of Sardar Patel. At the same time, rose petals were showered on the statue from helicopters. Modi then headed to the parade ground and administered 'national unity pledge' to the gathering on this occasion. On Friday, Modi had inaugurated as many as 17 new projects, including new tourist attractions near the Statue of Unity. Some of the major attractions include Arogya Van, Ekta Mall, Children Nutrition Park, Sardar Patel Zoological Park or Jungle Safari, and a boat ride.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pm-narendra-modi-pays-tributes-to-sardar-patel-at-statue-of-unity-909439.html

The accident took place at around 6 am near Gundavali bus stop on Western Express Highway, after the driver of the crane, which was heading towards Dadar from Jogeshwari, lost control, an official said. The trolley of the crane got separated and hit Chandivali resident Falguni Patel and two others, and also damaged an autorickshaw and a Metro rail pillar nearby, the official said. Patel, who was waiting with her cousin close to the bus stop, died on the spot, while the injured persons were rushed to a hospital, he said. An FIR under section 279 (rash driving), 304(A) (death by negligence) and other relevant provisions of the IPC and Motor Vehicle Act has been registered against crane driver Vinod Yadav, who fled the scene after the accident, he said. Meanwhile, in a series of tweets, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is carrying out the Metro Rail work in the city, said a puller axel crane of Metro Line 2A (DN Nagar to Dahisar) had a technical failure. The locking pin between the puller and axel was broken and the latter swung uncontrollably resulting in a fatal collision with a woman, it stated. A three-member committee has been constituted for a detailed investigation, which will be headed by project director P R K Murthy and the report is expected within two days, the MMRDA tweeted. While the vehicle was not executing any MMRDA Metro Line work at the place of accident that time, it was returning from the Metro Line 2A construction site and the contractor of the same has been notified and will be penalised for negligence and damage, it was stated. The incident near the NCC package project site has also resulted in the damage of pier 50 of package 91 (Line 7) and appropriate actions will be taken against the vehicle owner for these damages to Metro Line 7.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/woman-killed-two-injured-in-mumbai-as-part-of-a-crane-collapses-909463.html

The fast march is being organised by border guarding force Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and over 100 personnel from various paramilitary forces and state police forces are taking part in the event that will conclude on November 2 in the Thar desert here. The walkathon will move through sand dunes in areas like Sakhirewala, Bhuttewala, Katoch and culminate after crossing the Indira Gandhi canal in the same district, an officer-in-charge of the event said. Rijiju flagged off the march from Nathuwala village along with ITBP director general S S Deswal and actor Vidyut Jammwal. "It is the dream of our Prime Minister that every Indian should be fit and that is why my ministry is undertaking the 'Fit India' movement. This is not only a government exercise but has become people's movement." "In December, we are planning to hold a big 'Fit India' event across the country," the minister said. He said the walkathon will also spread the message of integration as the day is being observed as the 'national unity day' as a mark of respect to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of the country. Patel was born on October 31, 1875, in Gujarat's Nadiad. He is credited with the merger of over 560 princely states into the Union of India. "The walking marathon or walkathon aims to create awareness for a fit and healthy lifestyle among the people. This event is unique as walking in the desert is difficult but the personnel are spreading the message that the determination of ensuring a healthy and fit country and citizens is paramount," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said. Out of the total 200 km route of the walkathon, about 53 km is in the desert area. Also, most of the route track runs along those regions of the international border that are known for India-Pak wars, the spokesperson added. The ITBP has been at the forefront of these fitness excursions and the force and its chief have undertaken numerous such walkathons in the past. DG Deswal has earlier participated in a 100-km walk in the Sangla valley of Himachal Pradesh, Lipulekh Pass and Mussoorie in Uttarakhand and some other hilly areas. The ITBP, with about 90,000 personnel, is tasked to guard the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/200-km-fit-india-walkathon-flagged-off-in-rajasthan-desert-909526.html
