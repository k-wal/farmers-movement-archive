19-10-2020||Comment||Required: An overhaul||Universities are at the top of educational pyramids and are conceived to be harbingers of higher learning, scholarship and research. Unlike local and regional institutions, they are supposed to be reservoirs of multinational, multi-disciplinary, multi-religious, multi-cultural and multi-linguistic mosaic to promote a quest for advanced knowledge and a thirst for creative learning.  The founders of universities, be they private trusts/individuals or public sectors like the central and state governments, do not become their ‘owners’ because of the autonomous nature of these portals of higher education. In fact, autonomy is the hallmark of universities in democratic countries across the globe. Some of the world’s top universities (as evaluated by international and independent ranking agencies of high credibility) such as Harvard and Stanford in the US and Oxford and Cambridge in the UK embrace the twin ethos of ‘self-reliance’ and ‘self-governance’ in letter and spirit. In essence, they are free from any kind of external regulations and bureaucratic controls. They have put in place a time-tested and built-in framework to draw the roadmap of their short and long-term academic pursuits. It is learnt that the BJP government of Karnataka is mulling the idea of ‘uniform’ or ‘model’ curricula for all state universities. In biological parlance, this purports to cloning, that is, producing genetically identical organisms. Previously, the Congress government in the state made unwarranted, albeit unsuccessful, attempts to appoint teaching faculty and construct large buildings (costing more than Rs 1 crore) by itself.  The move was not only absurd but was also in contravention of the norms of the University Grants Commission, the apex body that regulates higher education in the country. It is felt that instead of resorting to controls as ‘aberrations’, the government of the day would do well by being a facilitator of quality and innovation. A few areas where it can play a positive role to enable and empower universities are briefly discussed here. Strengthening infrastructure: Almost all state universities suffer from lack of the state-of-the-art facilities for curricular as well as co-curricular activities. Even the old universities have not been able to get rid of obsolescence for being short of funds. It is suggested that the government should set apart 20-25% of the total allocation as ‘development grants’. These shall be in addition to the sanction of ‘block grants’ which take care of only the salary, allowances and pension of employees besides administrative expenses.  The envisaged development grants could be channelised through project modes, fixing priority to the needs of new universities. Of course, an expert committee should decide the merit of such proposals. With low fee structure and dearth of income from other sources, universities have been lackadaisical in their growth pathways. Current knowledge systems need modern infrastructure (for example, Information & Communication Technology) for efficient translation. Appointment of faculty:  There exists 40-45% vacancies in teaching positions across state universities. All of them have a major chunk of ‘guest lecturers’. Whereas this raw and inexperienced category of teachers can do some ordinary classroom teaching as a ritual, they cannot undertake any research nor can they be effective in online instructions. It is indisputable that the eminence and prominence of any university is largely dependent on its qualified, capable and talented faculty. If our universities are not doing well either in national or international rankings, one of the prime reasons is the lack of competent and committed faculty.  Coveted universities around the world make concerted efforts to bring in the best students and faculty wherever they are from, with several incentives. Vibrant teaching and innovative research can only be executed by a team of excellent faculty. Mediocrity will replace meritocracy if incompetent persons get into the university system. It is therefore the bounden responsibility of the government to ensure that all sanctioned posts of faculty are filled forthwith by the established mode of appointment following the norms of merit-cum-reservation.  Financial crunch, often decried, should not cause irreparable damage to academic endeavors. As an innovative step, freshly appointed assistant professors must be encouraged to initiate basic research through a ‘seed money’ by way of minor research proposals. This move will enable the young faculty to secure major grants from central funding agencies later on.  Restoration of Autonomy: Universities are governed by certain provisions of their Acts and have statutory bodies such as Board of Studies, Faculties, Academic Council and the Syndicate apart from Finance and other committees and offices. Put together, these organs have the responsibilities of formulating and implementing their academic and developmental requisites.  Hence, any attempt to impose curricula and regulations from external sources amounts to abrogation of their autonomy and undesirable interference in their functioning. Instead, the state should strengthen their autonomy for determining the pace and diverse nature of their teaching and research programmes.  In other words, the government should be a wary watchdog of performance rather than being a remote controller of dos and don’ts. It must be emphasised that if there is a common and single striking feature of world-renowned universities, it is their absolute functional autonomy.  Amendment to KSU Act 2000:  It is nearly two decades since the Karnataka State Universities Act (KSU Act) was enacted. Like other streams, higher education in recent times has witnessed phenomenal transformation in terms of concepts, scope, cost, diversity, relevance, delivery etc, because of increased globalisation, private participation and technological intervention. One of the major deficiencies in our university set up is the poor leadership and governance.  The so-called Syndicate is no more a ‘think tank’ and has often been detrimental to rather than instrumental in progress. The Vice Chancellors are sandwiched between the Syndicate and the bureaucratic controls. It is a misfortune that a good number of Syndicate members are nominees of the government and governor and are dubious ‘psuedo-educationists’. Therefore, there is an urgent need to amend the KSU Act 2000 in order to enable universities surmount the emerging challenges with more power and vigour. Let there be facilitation first and controls next. (The writer is former Vice Chancellor, University of Mysore)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/required-an-overhaul-903935.html
19-10-2020||First Edit||GST: Better sense prevails||The Central government has done well to go some distance in accommodating the demand of the states on GST (Goods and Services Tax) compensation. It partly conceded the demand by announcing that it will borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore to lend to the states to compensate them for the shortfall in the GST revenue. There was no resolution of the dispute over compensation in successive GST Council meetings, and in the latest one held last week also, the Centre had reiterated its position that individual states should borrow to make up for their respective shortfall. The states ruled by the BJP accepted one of the two options given by the Centre but others rejected both, and planned to go to the Supreme Court. But with the Centre now deciding to borrow a part of the money needed for compensation, an immediate confrontation seems to have been averted. The amount the Centre has now agreed to borrow is about half the expected shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore. It is equal to the shortfall the Centre had attributed to GST implementation. It considers the remaining Rs 1.25 lakh crore gap as the result of Covid-19, for which it is not responsible. States did not accept such a distinction and wanted the entire shortfall to be made up by the Centre, though the BJP-ruled states later agreed with the Centre’s position. What the Centre has now decided is to make the borrowing from a special window in such way that it will not affect the fiscal deficit targets. The Centre will service the loan which will be repaid from the GST compensation cess. The cess will also be extended beyond the scheduled 2022.  The Centre’s decision will also avert the situation in which some states would have to pay a higher interest than others, if they had individually gone to the market for funds. It has eased the tension between the Centre and the states but the Opposition-ruled states would still not agree with the Centre’s argument that it is not responsible for the revenue loss on account of Covid-19.  These states might raise the poser why the Centre cannot borrow the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore if the loans will not affect the fiscal deficit and will be repaid from future compensation cess collections. Payment of compensation for the entire shortfall by the Central government would also be in accordance with the 2017 commitment made to the states, supported by legislation in parliament. The spirit of co-operative federalism also demands it. The climbdown by the Centre will hopefully pave the way for a larger agreement on the entire compensation issue based on a consensus involving all the states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/gst-better-sense-prevails-903905.html
19-10-2020||In Perspective||Aiding women with disabilities||Amidst everything that transpired in Hathras, right from the brutal rape of the 19-year old Dalit woman, her pre-dawn cremation, the harassment of the victim’s family and the lacklustre probe by the police, another intersectionality warrants a discussion which is that of the women with disabilities (WWDs) and their expedition of justice in the cases of sexual violence. As per a 2018 report by the Human Rights Watch, WWDs are more vulnerable to sexual violence due to their bodily impairment which is compounded by an inaccessible criminal procedure. The invisibilisation of the WWDs is such that the NCRB (National Crime Research Bureau) does not even maintain separate data regarding the crimes against them. A WWD is indefensible in the face-off with sexual violence as she cannot pre-empt any sexual advances. This particularly becomes a problem for women with visual impairment and psycho-social disabilities. Struggling to escape and raising an alarm becomes an arduous task due to various physical limitations. For women with psycho-social disabilities, assessing the existence and nature of sexual offence becomes onerous. Reporting the crime is another daunting task due to the associated stigma.  The fundamental problem with the laws pertaining to disabled persons and women is that the former does not account for the aspect of gender and the latter does not account for the aspect of disability.  A gender blind law on disability: The language of law has become more disabled-friendly after the passage of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016. Section 3 encapsulates the right to equality and prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  Furthermore, Section 13(2) recognises the right of persons with disability (PWD) to enjoy legal capacity on an equal footing with any able-bodied person. However, the law does not recognise women’s vulnerability to violence. Section 7 (1) exhorts the government to take requisite measures to protect “persons with disability from violence and abuse.” The section also places a positive obligation on the government to take cognisance of such offences and provide legal remedies to the victims. This generic provision does not recognise the particularised experiences of WWDs. Furthermore, the RPWD rules of 2017 does not provide for any procedure or working plan to fulfil all the obligations placed on the government in Section 7 (1), thereby reducing the provision to a mere paper tiger.  The legislation does not provide for any action plan to protect WWDs from sexual violence. This is how the laws on disability are gender blind. A disability-blind law on sexual violence against women: There have been some changes in the substantive provisions of Indian Penal Code (IPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). For instance, rape of a WWD counts as aggravated rape within the meaning of Section 376(2) (l) of the IPC. If someone indulges in penetrative sexual assault or sexual assault by “taking advantage of a child’s mental or physical disability”, they can be charged for aggravated penetrative sexual assault under Section 5(k), and aggravated sexual assault under Section 9(k), of the POCSO Act, respectively.  Recording statement There have been some amendments to the procedural law to bolster the substantive law. For instance, Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 provides that whenever a WWD  has allegedly been a victim of sexual violence, the magistrate ought to record her statement at her residence or other place that is convenient for her. The law mandates that the statement should also be videographed.  The POCSO 2012 also provides for the video recording of the statements of the child victim and further allows the usage of the video clip in the court, for purposes of chief examination. This is done to protect the victim from repeated interrogation in the courtrooms which can be extremely traumatising. However, these procedural safeguards rarely contribute towards simplifying the victim’s expedition for justice. Filing complaints independently is challenging for the WWDs because not all states provide for online registration of FIRs and not all government websites are disabled-friendly.  Identification of the accused becomes particularly challenging when the victim has visual impairment or psycho-social disability. More often than not, the courts do not accord a lot of evidentiary value to the testimonies of the WWDs.  The police are generally not able to follow additional procedural requirements either due to lack of knowledge or due to lack of sensitisation. Many a times, the police do not specify the disability of the victim in the FIR, they are not able to assess the unique requirements of the victims and they do not provide for reasonable accommodation while recording statements of the victims in terms of taking assistance of the special educators and choosing a convenient place for the examination of the victim. It is clear that a mere rights-based language of law cannot promise practical remedies, for actions certainly speak louder than words. Unless the law enforcement authorities do away with their inertia of ableism, we will just keep on witnessing the creation of more and more Hathras-like landscapes for temporary able-bodied women and women with disabilities.

19-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||Soak pits built under MGNREGS to stop water stagnation||The construction of individual household soak pits at the village level under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has gained momentum in Udupi district. A total of 1,048 applications were received under MGNREGS for the construction of soak pits. Owing to the rainy season, the work was delayed for some time. Now, it has gained pace and already over 70 works have been completed. Zilla Panchayat Chief Planning Officer Srinivas Rao said the target is to construct at least 50 soak pits in each Gram Panchayat jurisdiction. The government has given importance to these works to prevent stagnation of water and to avoid water-borne diseases. Construction of soak pits helps in effective liquid waste management. It will also help in preventing water-logging and ensure hygiene in the surroundings of the houses. In villages, owing to lack of household drainage channels, water from the bathroom and kitchen are let into the road or the backyard of the houses. After bringing in modification to MGNREGS, the Union government has given permission for constructing soak pits by utilising funds under MGNREGS.  All those who possess job cards under MGNREGS, BPL card holders, SC/ST/nomadic families, physically challenged persons, Indira Awaas Yojana beneficiaries, small and marginal farmers, ST and traditional forest dwellers are eligible to avail benefit under the scheme. The beneficiaries have to submit a copy of the job card and RTC of the house to the Gram Panchayat while applying for the soak pit construction work. Minimum assistance of Rs 14,000 can be availed under the scheme for the construction of soak pits. The soak pits should be constructed on 6X4 feet width near the house. To facilitate the percolation of water, gravel should be filled. A cement ring or laterite stones can be used for the construction. After the construction, work on channelling kitchen water and bath water into soak pits should be taken up. It would be better if the soak pits are constructed away from the source of drinking||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/soak-pits-built-under-mgnregs-to-stop-water-stagnation-903990.html

Delivering the centenary convocation address of the University of Mysore (UoM), on Monday, virtually, he said, the youth should spend some time for themselves to introspect and to explore one’s talents and strengths. “The youth can chart their own path, by observing their environment, to achieve in their own capacities. An individual’s progress is not just one own progress, but of the nation. If each individual becomes Atmanirbhar, the nation becomes Atmanirbhar,”(sic) PM Modi said. Elaborating on the National Education Policy 2020, he called upon the institutions to blend global technology and contemporary issues with local culture to find solutions for social issues. “In line with the multi-dimensional approach of NEP 2020, to make youth more competitive, the institutions should offer multi-disciplinary courses. Such courses help in skilling, re-skilling, and up-skilling of youth. They give flexibility to choose and make youth adaptable to the needs of the society,” he said. Recalling the first convocation, held on a corresponding day, 102 years ago, on October 19, 1919, Modi said, the Chancellor and maharaja of Mysusu Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar had expressed that he would have been happy, if not one, but at least 10 girls had received their degree certificates. “Since then, there has been a lot of improvement in gender equality. Over the years, in the UoM, more girls, than boys, have been graduating. Even in the IITs, enrolment of girls was just 6% in 2016. Now, it has increased to 20%. In overall enrolment in education, the ratio has tilted positively towards girls,” he said. Stating that ‘Shiksha’ and ‘Deeksha’ are the two significant phases in the life of students, Modi said, the youth should take an oath to serve the society and nation. “Over the last six years, the government has taken steps to update education, to meet the needs of the 21st century. Initiatives are taken to make India a global education hub, like it was in ancient times. Besides providing infrastructure, steps are taken to introduce structural reforms. Various laws have been enacted for reforms in governance. Up to 2014, there were 16 IITs. Since then, one IIT has been added with each passing year. Till 2014, there were nine IIITs, which have increased to 16 now. Even the number of IIMs have been increased from 13 to 20,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/new-india-is-a-land-of-opportunities-says-pm-narendra-modi-at-university-of-mysore-904002.html

A few senior professors claimed that the convocation is losing solemnity in recent years, due to unnecessary activities. The UoM convocation has its own tradition and significance, they said. The tradition is that the convocation address is the only speech and no other activities are supposed to be taken up. The convocation is a minute to minute programme and it should complete within 45 minutes, as per tradition. A professor said, the authorities have failed to maintain the sanctity of convocation, by adding unnecessary activities. Even Higher Education Minister, also Pro-chancellor of varsities, is not supposed to speak on the occasion. It is a strict tradition, but, it is broken since the last four or five years. So, inauguration of buildings, speech of Vice Chancellor and others is improper, they said. The only agenda of a convocation should be to confer degrees on graduates and the convocation address. The convocation address is very important and it is a landmark speech. It is a sort of guidance for young graduates. A retired professor said that the authorities should give prominence to convocation rather than other events. Another retired professor said, “As per the tradition of the UoM, only awarding degrees was the event. The welcome speech, vote of thanks was not there earlier. Now, convocation is losing the solemnity. The authorities should not have inaugurated the building on the same stage.” However, the officials of the varsity were not available for a comment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/uom-convocation-losing-solemnity-professors-904299.html

19-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||Hotel industry gains momentum; sees 30% occupancy||As the district administration's bar on visitors to tourist destinations was lifted, causing cheers among the people, hoteliers and businessmen are also hoping that business affected by the pandemic, since the last eight months, will also be revived. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Saturday, overruled the decision of Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, on restricting visitors to tourist destinations, and relaxed the ban in Mysuru and Mandya districts. It may be mentioned that the district administration had declared a ban on tourist destinations in Mysuru, from October 17 to November 1. Those in the hotel industry and tourism related business are happy as the occupancy rate in hotels has improved to 30%. Business and the hotel industry of Mysuru and Mandya districts were dull, after the government restricted tourists entry and batted for virtual Dasara, this year. However, the CM, who held a meeting with Hotel Owners' Association and other stakeholders decided to lift the ban, bringing smile on their faces. Speaking to DH, Hotel Owners' Association president C Narayana Gowda said that though the ban is lifted, the occupancy rate is only 25% to 30%. "Advance bookings is even less, only 5%. We have no queries from tourists from other states, who used to do book well in advance, during Dasara. Moreover, bookings on Ayudha Puja, a day before Vijayadashami, is not expected this year, as the procession, Jamboo Savari, is limited only inside the Mysuru Palace premises," he said. "There are around 405 hotels, with more than 9,000 rooms. Around 30% of the rooms were occupied on Sunday. They were all domestic tourists. Only 5% bookings are done for the last three days of Dasara. However, we are seeing bookings only now, after the lockdown was lifted, permitting hotels to open in June," he said. This year, due to travel restrictions owing to the Covid pandemic, there are no foreign tourists for Dasara. Most of the domestic tourists are IT professionals from Bengaluru, he added. Thousands of people are thronging the main roads of the city, Palace and other places to have a glimpse of the illumination and are taking selfie pictures. Cultural programmes are being held on Mysuru Palace premises till October 24. The Palace is being illuminated for two hours every day from 7 pm to 9 pm. The footfall to Mysuru Palace was also more than 1,700 on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/hotel-industry-gains-momentum-sees-30-occupancy-904304.html

19-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Government withdrawing funds released for developmental works, says Siddaramaiah||Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah alleged that BJP government led by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has not been releasing funds for the works for which work orders have been issued. Funds that had been released have been withdrawn. Funds by Public Works Department, Social Welfare and Rural Development were released on receipt of graft. Speaking to reporters at the airport here on Monday, Siddaramaiah said the issue of withdrawal of funds has been raised by him during the legislature session too. It has become a percentage government. Funds for assembly segments represented by opposition MLAs were not being given and for assembly segments represented by BJP MLAs were released after receiving compensation from third party. Such corrupt government had not been witnessed by him. He sought to know the funds released for those whose houses have been damaged due to floods. There were no funds in accounts of Deputy Commissioner and people were being misguided. Centre has not released a pie until now, he said.   Regarding BJP State President Nalinkumar Kateel’s allegations that people will discard Congress into the ocean, he said, Kateel was after all a politician but was not aware of what he has been speaking. He should be speaking responsibly as state president of a political party. Farmers have committed suicides during tenure of different governments including myself as chief minister. During the year 2014 to 2016, during severe drought, farmers have committed suicides. After Yediyurappa coming to power, suicides by farmers and weavers have not stopped, he said. Siddaramaiah said, during his government funds for the assembly segments represented by opposition MLAs were released, but now even BJP MLAs were not getting funds for development. Schemes for the people that were implemented during the Congress government were now being scuttled. Rice allocation for Anna Bhagya, funds for Indira Canteen, subsidy for Kshir Dhare and other programmes has been cut. The Centre has not come to the aid of the state during floods both during the previous year and this year too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not visit the state to access the situation. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman visited, but no funds were released. State sought Rs 35,000 crore, but Rs 1,600 crore was given last year. During the year 2009, flood situation was not that serious but the then-Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had visited the state and released Rs 1,000 crore, he stated. Government and police failure were responsible for the violence in D G Halli and K G Halli. Timely action if had been taken against accused after complaint was filed, violence could have been prevented, he said. Congress has edge over BJP and JD(S) in the by-election for R R Nagar and Sira assembly segments. In RR Nagar it would be straight contest with BJP and triangular in Sira, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/government-withdrawing-funds-released-for-developmental-works-says-siddaramaiah-904051.html

At present, the public transporter is operating 682 special trains and 20 cloned trains. The 416 festival special trains will operate from October 20 to November 30 connecting large cities that include Kolkata, Patna, Varanasi, Lucknow, and others. The trains will cater to the growing demand during Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali, and Chhath Puja. Ticket prices will have add-on ‘special charges’, taking the cost up by around 10-30 per cent compared to regular train tickets. The zonal railways will decide the schedule on which festival special trains will be operated. The trains will run at a minimum speed of 55 kmph so that they can be classified as Superfast Express services, the Railway Board said in its communication to zonal railways. "The zonal railways should make efforts to operate these trains with more AC-III coaches in good conditions," said the communication. "The railway is in touch with state governments and monitoring the ticket booking pattern. Whichever the route and trains have more bookings in such route another express train,  which is also called clone train, will be operated,"(sic) said an official in the railways. In the first week of November, Indian Railways will review the situation and make a decision on operating more trains. "The railway has not decided when it will normalise the train operation. It is assessing the situation on daily basis. Whenever there is a demand for trains, the railway will operate special trains,"(sic) Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav said earlier. The Railways halted the operations of normal service on March 22 to check the spreading of Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-railways-to-operate-416-festival-special-trains-from-tomorrow-903954.html

The official also said that final-year MBBS and nursing students will need to be deployed in addition to the auxiliary midwife workforce, and healthcare workers. According to the official, pharmacists are also likely to be roped into the vaccination programme as the government seeks to make it a mass movement. Jagannath Shinde, chairman, All Indian Origin Chemists & Distributors, said that India's 8 lakh pharmacists will likely be enthusiastic if they are asked to participate in the vaccination programme and that they are already training people to administer insulin injections. However, regulations do not permit pharmacists to administer vaccines, and changes may be needed to enlist them for the programme. For training and certifying the vaccinators, the government may fall back to the Healthcare Sector Skill Council, a certifying organisation under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, to prepare the vaccinator force for the programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-may-deploy-pharmacists-to-administer-covid-19-vaccine-report-903970.html

While Indian army retaliated against PLA by inflicting more casualties at the eastern Ladakh border. This led to strong anti-China sentiment across the country and several leaders have called for a ban on Chinese products especially consumer electronics. Popular brands such as Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo have been the worst impacted companies. And now, a glitch on Xiaomi's Mi Weather service caused a major stir on the social media platforms. Several Xiaomi phone users called out the mobile company on why weather report on Arunachal Pradesh's cities Leh, Ladakh, Chuchat Yakma, capital Itanagar and others areas are missing from its regional Indian weather application.  This led to speculations that Xiaomi is complying with China's political map rather than the official Indian map. For long, China has been wrongly claiming that the aforementioned northeastern state as a part of its country, while on the ground, India officially governs the Arunachal Pradesh. Taking note of the complaints, Xiaomi replied that there was a glitch in Mi weather and they have fixed it. "There was a technical issue in our weather app that we had identified. The same has been fixed.” Xiaomi India spokesperson said to DH. Now, we are able to view the weather statistics of all the Arunachal Pradesh areas are appearing on Xiaomi apps.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mi-weather-app-does-not-show-data-on-some-areas-in-arunachal-pradesh-xiaomi-fixes-glitch-904020.html

Sources said octogenarian Abdullah was questioned at ED’s Rajbagh office in Srinagar for nearly seven hours. He was questioned in connection with alleged misappropriation of Rs over 43 crore when he was the president of the JKCA. Earlier the agency had questioned Abdullah, who represents Srinagar in the Lok Sabha, in the case in 2019. Talking to reporters after coming out of the ED office Abdullah said, “I am quite clear and will always face them.” “My fate will be decided by the court when they put the case into the court. I couldn’t have lunch today. There was no time,” he added. Abdullah’s son and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the questioning was political vendetta and connected it to the alliance forged by six political parties from the region over the restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence. Another former Chief Minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said the summon depicts nervousness about the mainstream politicians. “ED’s sudden summon to Farooq sahab displays the extent of GOIs nervousness about mainstream parties in J&K fighting as one unit. Also reeks of political vendetta & wont in the least blunt our collective resolve to fight for our rights,” she tweeted. Asked whether he was summoned because of the formation of peoples’ alliance for the Gupkar declaration, senior Abdullah said that “don’t bring the Gupkar declaration into this.” Abdullah was named in the scam in 2012 in which bogus money was allegedly transferred into bogus accounts created by the JKCA officials. The JKCA gets subsidies from the BCCI annually.  The ED case is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI’s) FIR as part of which the CBI booked former office-bearers of JKCA, including general secretary Saleem Khan and Treasurer Ahsan Mirza. According to the CBI investigation, the accounts were opened in the name of the JKCA in J&K Bank and the BCCI funds were diverted to these bogus accounts and subsequently siphoned off. The BCCI had given Rs 113 crore to the JKCA from 2002 to 2011 as grant for the promotion of cricket in the region. Of this, Rs.43.69 crore was allegedly siphoned off and misappropriated by the accused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jkca-scam-ed-questions-farooq-abdullah-political-vendetta-says-omar-904027.html

Last week, the centre gave in to the demands of opposition-ruled states to borrow and fund the GST compensation shortfall. The Finance Ministry said that the centre would borrow from the market to pay the GST compensation shortfall of Rs 1.1 lakh crore to states, and then act as an intermediary to arrange back-to-back loans to state governments. This arrangement, the ministry said, will not reflect in the fiscal deficit of the centre and will appear as capital receipts for state governments. However, Kerala wants the centre to borrow the entire GST compensation shortfall of Rs 1.83 lakh crore, which includes Rs 1.10 lakh crore on account of GST implementation and Rs 73,000 crore due to Covid-19. “Higher borrowing will not affect centre’s FD (fiscal deficit). Fears of crowding out private investment is misplaced in recession,” Isaac tweeted. The centre had in August proposed two options to states: borrow Rs 97,000 crore (on account of GST implementation) from a special window facilitated by the RBI or the complete shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore (including Rs 1.38 lakh crore due to Covid-19) from the market. The options have since been revised to Rs 1.10 lakh crore and Rs 1.8 lakh crore, respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-should-take-initiative-in-settling-gst-borrowing-quantum-issue-kerala-fm-thomas-issac-904033.html

In a statement, Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) said it was cooperating with the law enforcement agencies in their ongoing investigation in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation case. Responding to claims by Republic TV that an email from BARC gives proof of the channel not being involved in any alleged malpractices, the agency said it was "highly disappointed" with the broadcaster's actions. "BARC India is highly disappointed with the actions of the Republic Network by disclosing private and confidential communications and misrepresenting the same. "BARC India reiterates that it has not commented on the ongoing investigation and without prejudice to BARC India's rights, it expresses its dismay at the actions of the Republic Network," it said. Mumbai police, on a BARC complaint, is investigating allegations of manipulation of TRP ratings. Republic TV is one of the four channels being investigated. The BARC statement came after Republic TV disclosed what it said was an email conversation between the agency's CEO Sunil Lulla and Republic Media Network CEO Vikas Khanchandani. As per the TV network's website, Khanchandani wrote an email to BARC on October 16, to "confirm in public domain" that the body has found no infringement by Republic. "In response to Khanchandani's email, BARC responded on October 17, by thanking the network for their 'faith in the internal mechanisms of BARC' and said that 'if there was any disciplinary action initiated against ARG Outlier Media (Republic's owner), then BARC India would have communicated the same to you along with necessary documents for your response"," the website said. "Thus, this e-mail proves that BARC did not allege any malpractice against the Republic Media Network," it added. Reacting to BARC's statement, Republic TV owner Arnab Goswami told PTI, that the email of BARC confirms that the police commissioner lied. (Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh) should immediately quit, Goswami said. BARC did not elaborate on the exact parts of the email which makes it feel that the communication was "misrepresented". Six people have been arrested by the police in the scam, which allegedly involves inducing homes which form the sample set whose TV viewing is monitored to ensure that certain channels get higher ratings. The ratings are a key influencer of advertiser preferences while placing commercials. The police claim this is a "multi-crore" scam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/barc-charges-republic-tv-with-misrepresenting-private-communication-904044.html

The High Court also stated that not more than 30 organisers would be allowed to enter the respective pandals and no visitors can enter the pandals. The Division Bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Arijit Banerjee gave the order after hearing a public interest litigation. “In public interest, all pandals whereat Durga Puja is being celebrated this year are made no-entry zones for members of the public,” stated the order. “In other words, the area covered by the pandals and the additional area around the pandals extending 5m from the smaller pandals and 10m from the bigger pandalswill have to be barricaded as a no-entry zone,” it added. The High Court also stated that 'no-entry' signages have to be put up on barricades near the pandals. It said that the Kolkata Police do not have adequate resources for crowd management if people come out on the streets in large numbers. The High Court instructed the Kolkata Police Commissioner and the West Bengal Director General of Police to file affidavits indicating compliance with the related directions by November 5. The order comes at a time when nearly 37,000 Durga Pujas are being organised across the state despite the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in West Bengal. Doctors had expressed concern that in case large gatherings take place during Durga Puja the number of cases may shoot up even higher. Earlier the High Court had ordered that the amount of Rs. 50,000 given by the state government to each of the 37,000 Durga Pujas in Bengal be used only for purchasing masks, sanitiser and for community policing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-durga-puja-pandals-declared-no-entry-zone-in-west-bengal-904073.html

This new feature ensures that feedback received from drivers can help make the platform safer for the next user, Uber said in a statement. Earlier this year, Uber built a technology designed to verify that drivers on the platform are wearing a mask while on-trip, by clicking a selfie. Since Uber began mask verification selfies for drivers in May 2020, more than 17.44 million verifications have been carried out throughout India, the statement said. "At Uber, we believe accountability is a two-way street. Earlier this year, we designed innovative technology to ensure that drivers were actually wearing masks before accepting trips. Today, we've devised similar technology for riders who've previously been called out for not wearing a mask while on-trip," Uber India SA Head of Supply and Driver Operations Pavan Vaish said. The new policy raises the bar on safety and makes the platform safer for riders and the driver-partner, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uber-riders-who-did-not-wear-a-mask-previously-will-have-to-take-a-selfie-before-a-ride-904077.html

This has been brought about by a high level of comprehensive countrywide testing, it said. The country's cumulative positivity rate stands at 7.94 per cent and is on a continuous decline, the ministry said in a statement. "As evidence has revealed, higher numbers of testing on a sustained basis have aided in bringing down the positivity rate. The decline in the cumulative positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of infection is being effectively contained," it said. "Higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases. These measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate," it added. The total number of tests for the detection of coronavirus infection has crossed 9.5 crore so far, according to the ministry. The average daily positivity rate for the third week of October is 6.13 per cent, the statement said. "This is a result of a successful test, track, trace, treat and technology strategy of the Central government effectively followed by states and UTs," it underlined. The ministry said the country has been reporting a steady decline in active cases. The active cases of coronavirus infection remained below 8 lakh for the third consecutive day on Monday. There are 7,72,055 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country which comprise 10.23 per cent of the total caseload, according to ministry data updated at 8 am. The total number of recoveries has surged to 66,63,608, thereby enhancing the difference with respect to active cases, the ministry said. A total of 66,399 patients recovered and were discharged the previous day, while 55,722 new infections were reported. The national recovery rate has progressed to 88.26 per cent, it said. According to the statement, 79 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs -- Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. Maharashtra is the biggest contributor with more than 11,000 recoveries in a day, followed by Kerala and Karnataka with more than 8,000 recoveries each, the statement said. The ministry said 81 per cent of the 55,722 new cases are from the 10 states and UTs. With more than 9,000 fresh infections, Maharashtra continues to report a very high number of cases, followed by Kerala and Karnataka with more than 7,000 cases each, it said. A total of 579 case fatalities were reported in a span of 24 hours. After 90 days, the daily deaths recorded are below 600, the ministry said. Of these, nearly 83 per cent are concentrated in the 10 states and UTs. More than 25 per cent of the latest fatalities are from Maharashtra (150 deaths). India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 75,50,273 with a single-day spike of 55,722 infections, while the death toll climbed to 1,14,610 with 579 fatalities, the ministry data showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-infection-being-effectively-contained-positivity-rate-below-8-for-4th-day-govt-904091.html

The plea sought that women be provided special casual or paid leave as menstruation is intrinsically related to human dignity and by not providing separate toilet facilities, breaks to maintain hygiene during the particular period and paid leaves in form of special casual leaves, the authorities are depriving the employees of their human dignity. The plea could not be heard as the bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan was not holding the court on Monday. It is now listed for hearing on November 23. The petition by Delhi Labour Union, through advocate Rajiv Agarwal, sought direction to the Centre and Delhi government to grant paid leaves for four days a month to all classes of women employees. including daily wage, contractual and outsourced workers and to pay overtime allowance to menstruating women employees if they opt to work during that period. Besides paid leaves, they also sought for facilities of periodic rests, separate and clean toilets and provision of sanitary napkins to women employees during menstruation period. The petitioner, a registered trade union, said the plea is concerned with the right to life and dignity of the women workers and it for the benefit of all women employees and general public as menstrual health and hygiene is of great public importance but still it is considered as a taboo. “A significant number of these employees menstruate and there is very little consideration or even recognition for the emotional, physical, hormonal and physiological trauma that these employees undergo during their menstrual cycle,” the plea said. It gave examples of several private employers like Zomato and Culture Machine which have introduced paid menstruation leave for their female employees. It also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence day speech where he spoke of sanitary napkins. “For the first time, the topic of menstruation featured in a Prime Minister's address and there has been a main streaming of the diversity of female experiences and their criticality to their equal rights in the workplace. The time, therefore, is ripe to break the taboo and misconception around menstruation and consider the genuine needs of menstruating female employees,” it said. The plea also cited the examples of various countries which have introduced laws on menstrual leaves, including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea (one physiological leave per month under the Labour Standards Act), Indonesia and Zambia (1 day per month known as Mother's Day). “As a compromise to the demand for menstrual leave raised by non-gazetted employees union, the Bihar Government introduced two days special casual leave every month for all government women workers in 1992. This facility is still availed by women workers of Bihar and Jharkhand,” it claimed. It said the government does not provide any facility to the menstruating employees and no special paid leave is granted to them and in many workplaces of the government, facilities of sanitary napkin vending machines, separate and clean toilets, separate breaks during menstruation, which are required for maintaining hygiene, are also not provided. Regarding the daily wage muster roll workers, contractual workers and outsourced workers, the plea said they also face severe difficulties during menstruation and their workplaces lack adequate sanitation and clean toilets which hamper hygiene and they are not given the facility of earned leave and sick leave by the employer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-in-delhi-high-court-to-direct-centre-delhi-govt-to-grant-paid-menstrual-leaves-to-women-employees-904092.html
19-10-2020||National||Congress leader Kamal Nath's 'item' remark against woman minister triggers controversy, draws NCW's ire||Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath's remarks against a woman Minister in Madhya Pradesh has triggered a controversy with the National Commission for Women (NCW) on Monday issuing a notice to him and writing to the Election Commission against his "irresponsible and disparaging" statement. While Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP leaders sat on a two-hour silent fast in protest in various locations in the state, Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani attacked the Gandhi family saying it would not take action against Kamal Nath as people like him “keep the fire burning in Gandhi family’s kitchen”. Nath on Sunday made the controversial remark during a bypoll campaign meeting in Gwalior's Dabra where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, a Dalit who left the Congress along with Jyotiraditya Scindia that led to the fall of Congress government in the state. He had said that the Congress candidate was a "simple person" unlike the opponent who was an "item". Describing the remarks as "offensive and derogatory," the NCW said it has sought an explanation from Nath besides forwarding the matter to the Election Commission for taking necessary action. Strongly condemns the "irresponsible and disparaging statement", it said, "At a time when we want more women to enter politics, such disrespectful remarks against a woman leader, that too from a person holding such a responsible position is very unfortunate." Irani accused the Gandhi family of remaining silent on Nath's statement. "I can't understand why the Gandhi family has chosen to remain silent. This is not the first time that a Congress leader from Madhya Pradesh has spoken horribly about women political activists. There was the case of Digvijaya Singh earlier," she said. "I find absolutely no justification that Kamal Nath-ji can give for using such derogatory word against a female political activist. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Gandhi family chooses to be absolutely silent on this issue...Do you really think that the Gandhi family will take action against Kamal Nath? I don't think so. These are the people who keep the fire burning Gandhi family's kitchen," she added. BSP supremo Mayawati also hit out at Kamal Nath and asked Dalits to vote for the BSP to teach the Congress a lesson over this remark. "Congress senior leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister's indecent comment against a Dalit woman contesting bypolls from Dabra in Gwalior (division) is grossly anti-woman, highly shameful and highly deplorable," Mayawati tweeted. 1.मध्यप्रदेश में ग्वालियर की डाबरा रिजर्व विधानसभा सीट पर उपचुनाव लड़ रही दलित महिला के बारे में कांग्रेस के वरिष्ठ नेता व पूर्व सीएम द्वारा की गई घोर महिला-विरोधी अभद्र टिप्पणी अति-शर्मनाक व अति-निन्दनीय। इसका संज्ञान लेकर कांग्रेस आलाकमान को सार्वजनिक तौर पर माफी माँगनी चाहिए।   In various places in Madhya Pradesh, Chouhan, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia among others sat on a two-hour silent fast in protest against the Congress leader. आज कमलनाथ जी, आज आपने अपने ओछे बयान के द्वारा कांग्रेस की विकृत और घृणित मानसिकता का फिर परिचय दिया। आपने श्रीमती इमारती देवी ही नहीं, ग्वालियर-चंबल क्षेत्र की एक-एक बेटी और बहन का अपमान किया है! On Sunday, Chouhan attacked Nath saying it showed the "crooked and despicable mentality" of the Congress. "You have not just disrespected Smt Imarti Devi, but each and every girl and sister of Gwalior-Chambal region...Kamal Nathji, who gave you the right to play with the respect of women?," Chouhan said in a tweet in Hindi on Sunday. Bypoll for 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats is scheduled for November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-leader-kamal-naths-item-remark-against-woman-minister-triggers-controversy-draws-ncws-ire-904102.html

In a virtual press briefing, he said the affected states have been unable to reach an agreement to stop stubble burning and prevent air pollution. "I believe the pollution due to stubble burning can be controlled in a short span of time. But a lack of political will is visible in doing that," he said. Kejriwal said the crop residue can be biodegraded or converted into biogas, coal and even cardboard. The paddy straw can be converted into compressed biogas or cooking coal which some factories are doing in Karnal in Haryana, he said, adding crop residue can be "converted into an opportunity" within a year, provided there are sharp timelines to move away from stubble burning. Kejriwal requested the Union environment minister to hold monthly meetings with the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and UP to find a solution to the deteriorating air in the National Capital Region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kejriwal-seeks-monthly-meetings-with-cms-of-haryana-up-punjab-to-curb-air-pollution-904145.html

Here are the top stories of the day, October 19, 2020: A Corporal of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was apprehended in the Demchok sector of Eastern Ladakh after he had strayed across the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian Army said. The Chinese soldier has been identified as Wang Ya Long and he has been provided with required medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes, it said. The Army said the PLA soldier will be returned after completion of all the formalities.  Sources said the PLA soldier was interrogated on how he crossed over to the Indian side. Calcutta High Court declared all Durga Puja pandals no-entry zone in West Bengal. Only organisers would be allowed to enter the pandals. Names of people allowed to enter the pandals would be displayed outside it, the court added. A location tag of a live video on Twitter posted by national security analyst Nitin Gokhale showed Jammu and Kashmir as a part of China and Leh's Hall of Fame as a part of Jammu and Kashmir instead of the Union Territory of Ladakh. Gokhale tweeted screenshots and tagged Twitter's support handle saying that he did this on purpose as a test. Gokhale also shared a screenshot in which Leh's Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport was identified as a part of China by the micro-blogging platform. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) questioned Farooq Abdullah - regional National Conference (NC) president and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir - in an alleged multi-million J&K Cricket Association (JKCA) scam. Sources said octogenarian Abdullah was questioned at ED’s Rajbagh office in Srinagar in connection with alleged misappropriation of over Rs 43 crore when he was the president of the JKCA. “The questioning is taking place based on bank documents,” they said.

Addressing a meeting of the newly-constituted Chhattisgarh Working Committee of the BJP through video link from Delhi, he also attacked the Congress for questioning the government over the Ladakh face-off with China. The BJP is targeting Tharoor over his comments, made online, at Lahore Think Fest, where he criticized the Narendra Modi government's handling of the coronavirus situation and spoke about "bigotry and prejudice" against Muslims allegedly witnessed during the pandemic. Hitting back, the Congress said the BJP has always responded to substance and facts with "jumlebaazi" (rhetoric). "While the whole country is engaged in the exercise of nation-building, what has happened to opposition Congress, which is citing examples of Pakistan and China? They ask us questions on what happened in Ladakh," Pradhan said. "Prime Minister visited Ladakh and cautioned China that India is capable of giving a befitting reply," the Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister said. "Those who surrendered Aksai Chin to China are asking questions on behalf of the Chinese side. "On the other hand, they see Pakistan in everything... Congress leadership has been speaking the language of Pakistan," Pradhan further alleged, referring to Tharoor's statement about the "prejudice" faced by Muslims. The BJP leader also said the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh cared about only what the "prince of a dynasty" (apparently referring to Rahul Gandhi) wanted. "Despite being rich in resources, a country like the US has been witnessing a third wave of coronavirus outbreak. "In India, due to collective willpower of the people and due to the far-sightedness of PM Modi, the situation and economy are to a great extent under control," Pradhan said. "Unfortunately those friends who are in power in Chhattisgarh are unable to understand anything other than their political interests. The safety and welfare of people of the state are not on their agenda. "What is the liking of the `Yuvraj' (prince) of that dynasty is its political agenda," the Union minister said. He also claimed that the new farm sector laws will benefit the farmers of Chhattisgarh. "Farmers of Chhattisgarh will have access to international markets. Farm produce of the state will be exported. Farmers will not have to be dependent on the storage system of the government anymore," he said. The Centre has planned to manufacture ethanol from rice on a large scale, he said. "We spend around Rs 8 lakh crore for importing crude oil. Scientists have said that rice can be used in manufacturing ethanol which can be used to run vehicles. We will purchase around 100 crore liters of ethanol in 2021. Old stocks of rice with the Food Corporation India will be used," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pradhan-hits-out-at-shashi-tharoor-congress-over-remarks-at-lahore-event-904159.html

It also said the participants of the exercise collectively support a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. The drill is to be held in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, which also is a marked change from the past editions of the exercises that were limited to only one side of the Indian peninsula. The announcement comes two weeks after foreign ministers from the Quad nations met in Tokyo. It was the second ministerial meeting of the coalition that happened in the backdrop of China stepping up its belligerence – not only along its disputed boundary with India, but elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region too.  Even though the concept of a four-nation alliance to take on China was talked about for a long time, the Quad was officially re-launched in November 2017 to counter hegemonic aspirations of the communist nation in the Indo-Pacific region.  From the very beginning China was dead against such a grouping and its involvement in any military activity in the Indian Ocean region. In the past, Beijing once sent a strong diplomatic message to New Delhi when a similar multilateral naval exercise was held in the Bay of Bengal more than a decade ago.   The Malabar series of naval exercises between India and USA began way back in 1992. Japan became a part of it in 2015 and Australia was trying for a berth in the four-nation war game in the Indian Ocean for many years. In her reaction, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds described her country’s participation in the exercise as a "milestone opportunity" and said it would showcase the "deep trust" between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests. “The participants of Malabar exercise 2020 are engaging to enhance safety and security in the maritime domain. They collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and remain committed to a rules based international order,” the defence ministry said. This annual exercise has been conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/australia-to-be-part-of-malabar-naval-drill-with-india-904160.html

Issuing the 'Human Rights Advisory for Protection of the Rights of the LGBTQI+ Community in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic', it said a large number of them do not have access to government documents and are facing extreme difficulties in accessing relief care packages like Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. The advisory said the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown had "disproportionately" impacted the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex (LGBTQI+) community. It has gravely affected their livelihood, especially for those who earn from sex work and begging. It also noted that people who live with their family also may face domestic violence and may face a lack of access to shelter homes and care. "Because of the lockdown, they have been forced to stay with their families who are not always supportive or affirmative of their sexual and gender identities and/or expressions. Confinement in homes has given rise to marriage threats, physical, emotional and sexual abuse with no escape. They are also robbed of the opportunity to access safe spaces, support groups and public life," it said. Emphasising that most of them are driven away from homes early in life and forced into activities like begging and sex work, the advisory said that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has made an interim arrangement of the provision of Rs 1,500 while states like Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have provided free ration kits to transgender persons. "However, the reach of these schemes is very minimal," it said. The NHRC has asked the Centre and state governments to provide access to the LGBTQI+ community to all relief measures and welfare measures by taking into account gender diversity and vulnerabilities. The government must provide appropriate financial support to the economically vulnerable section of the community who have lost their livelihood due to the pandemic. Steps should also be taken to ensure the implementation of the existing guidelines and protocols, medico-legal care for survivors of domestic and sexual violence along with timely treatment, psycho-social support and medico-legal documentation in such cases. Keeping in mind the rising unemployment during the pandemic, the advisory also said the government should ensure skill development opportunities for the community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lgbtqi-facing-trouble-during-covid-19-government-should-ensure-relief-measures-reach-them-nhrc-904171.html

Seeking urgent hearing in the "ongoing case" on appointments in transparency bodies, the petition by activists Anjali Bhardwaj and others said that the Supreme Court had on December 16, 2019, ordered that four vacant posts should be filled within three months of issuance of the order. However, the government filled the vacancy of Chief Information Commissioner and one Information Commission on March 6 this year, which the activists said that it was in violation of the court orders.  "The order of December 16, 2019, has not been complied with and the number of vacancies at the CIC has now increased to six and even the post of the Chief Information Commissioner has been vacant (once again) since August 27, 2020, frustrating the order of this court as well as citizens fundamental right to information," the petition said. According to the petition, the Supreme Court had in February 2019 issued directions to the Centre and states to fill vacancies across Central and State Information Commissions in a transparent and timely manner. However, in November last year, the petitioners once again approached the court informing that the governments had failed to comply with the directions and that four posts of Information Commissioners in CIC were vacant. The next month, the Department of Personnel and Training issued "fresh advertisements for four Information Commissioners' posts though it had already advertised in January 2019. On December 16 last year, the Supreme Court once again asked the Centre to fill the vacancies within three months. Meanwhile, the incumbent Chief Information Commissioner retired. On March 6 this year, the Centre appointed a new CIC Bimal Jhulka, who was already an Information Commissioner, and a new Information Commissioner. "The number of vacancies in the CIC remained at 4t as one of the commissioners was appointed as Chief" despite the court asking the Centre to fill all four vacancies, the petition said. The petition also found fault with an affidavit the Centre filed with the Supreme Court in April this year claiming that it has adhered to the orders and said that as on April 24, the number of vacancies in the CIC remained at four. In July, the DoPT again issued a fresh advertisement for appointment of up to six Information Commissioners while another advertisement was issued inviting applications for the post of Chief Information Commissioner as Jhulka was retiring on August 26. "With the retirement of the Chief on August 26 and another commissioner demitting office at the end of September, currently 6 posts, including that of the Chief are lying vacant and the pendency of appeals/complaints has risen to over 36,600," the petition said. The petition claimed that the Centre appeared to be resorting to issuing fresh advertisements instead of filling all the advertised vacant posts in a bid to cause undue delay in the appointments thereby frustrating peoples' right to information.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/transparency-activists-urge-sc-for-urgent-hearing-on-vacancies-in-rti-bodies-904178.html
19-10-2020||National||ED summons against Abdullah 'witch-hunt': NC||The National Conference (NC) condemned the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summons to party president and Member of Parliament Farooq Abdullah on Monday, describing the move as witch-hunt and vengeance. In a joint statement, several NC leaders from the Kashmir valley, the Jammu region, and the Union Territory of Ladakh condemned the "undue witch-hunt" and intimidation of Abdullah, saying the "motive" behind the summons is to deter him from representing the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. They said the incumbent ruling dispensation in New Delhi is employing the government machinery and malevolent tactics to subdue Abdullah's effort in forging unity among different mainstream political parties of Jammu and Kashmir. "This government is doing everything it can to silence the combined voice of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, which Dr Sahib (Abdullah) has been able to forge. The tactics are being employed across the board in the country to stifle the voices of dissent by using all spiteful measures, the party will not duck due to such tactics," the statement said. The leaders condemned the treatment meted out to Abdullah, an octogenarian, the seniormost politician of Jammu and Kashmir and the Member of Parliament from Srinagar. "Such tactics will only make us more resolute towards achieving our goal peacefully and constitutionally. The measure also reveals the jitters the present ruling dispensation is going through in the wake of the growing consensus among all mainstream political parties on the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, headed by Dr Farooq Abdullah," they said. NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar, provincial presidents Nasir Aslam Wani (Kashmir) and Devender Singh Rana (Jammu) and other senior leaders of the party, including those from Ladakah, were signatories to the statement. Earlier, an NC spokesperson said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is employing government agencies to target Abdullah, after failing to fight him politically. "The BJP, after failing to politically fight party president Farooq Abdullah, has resorted to employing its agencies for the task," he said in a statement here. The ED questioned Abdullah, a former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, on Monday in connection with a money-laundering probe in a case related to the alleged embezzlement of Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association funds, officials said. They said the NC president's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as in the past. The NC spokesperson said the ED summons to Abdullah is clearly the result of the unity the party president has been able to forge among mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir in the shape of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. "This is the price one faces when opposed to BJP's ideology and divisive politics. Recent history is a witness to how the BJP has been employing coercive and intimidating measures through various departments to target opposition leaders across the country. The recent ED summons to Abdullah is a case in point," the statement said. The NC said the timing of the summons is very clear as the previous summons was issued just before August 5 last year, when the BJP-led Centre abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, and this summons comes within days of the formation of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, of which Abdullah has taken a lead. "Abdullah continues to maintain his innocence and will cooperate with the authorities in what is nothing but a witch-hunt," the statement added. Meanwhile, taking to Twitter, Abdullah's son and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah described the ED summons as political vendetta. "The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less than political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib's residence," he wrote on the microblogging website. People's Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti said the ED summons displays the extent of the Government of India's nervousness about mainstream parties in Jammu and Kashmir fighting as one unit.

The Union Road Transport and Highway Ministry made changes in bidding documents to relax financial and technical criteria for HAM (hybrid annuity model) and BOT (build, operate, transfer) for road projects. The relaxation in criteria has also been made for construction of tunnels and bridges. The main aim to bring changes is to encourage more local contractors' participation in the highway building work as the Ministry of Road Transport is planning to award more projects in coming days to improve infrastrecture development, said an official in the Ministry. With the relaxations, the companies who have executed irrigation, water supply, stadiums, hospitals, hotels, smart cities, warehouses, oil and gas projects besides real estate, can also bid for highway projects. Since several highway projects facing delay due to Covid-19 pandemic, the government has been planning  to bring more companies' participation in the development of infrastrecture and expedite works, the official said. According to the new norms, any contractor without prior experience can apply to build a tunnel measuring up to 200 metres while for bridges, prior experience is not required for building up to 60-metre structures. The move holds significance as there are about 730 developers for EPC (engineering procurement and construction) projects of which only 21 are capable of executing projects worth over Rs 2,000 crore as per the qualification criteria earlier.  Based on the criteria, 72 developers can handle projects in the range of Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore, while 75 contractors are such who can handle projects in the range of Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. Majority of the developers fall under the category of contractors who can handle projects in the range of Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore. The Ministry also proposed to change the existing norm requiring average annual turnover of 20 per cent of estimated project cost (EPC) to 15 per cent of EPC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-tweaks-elegibility-criteria-for-building-highways-to-spur-economic-activities-904247.html

Twitter said that it had become aware of the “technical issue” on Sunday. A spokesperson of the company, which provides the micro-blogging service, said that its teams had “worked swiftly to investigate and resolve the geotag issue”. The glitch came to notice on Sunday when a journalist was doing a live broadcast from the Hall of Fame, a museum built by the Indian Army in Leh to honour the soldiers, who had sacrificed lives to protect the nation. Twitter showed his location as “Jammu and Kashmir, People’s Republic of China”. The netizens soon took note of it and the micro-blogging website was flooded with calls to rectify the location. India and China are currently engaged in a military stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two nations – in eastern Ladakh. China recently reiterated that it did not recognize Ladakh as a Union Territory of India. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had in August 2019 initiated the process to strip Jammu and Kashmir off its special status and reorganized the state into two Union Territories, China had joined its all-weather-ally Pakistan to oppose the move. Twitter on Monday stated that it understood and respected the “sensitivities around the issue”. The glitch on Twitter was noticed just a day after India’s north-eastern state Arunachal Pradesh as well as several other places in the country had gone missing from the default weather app on the smartphones manufactured by Xiaomi Corporation of China. Since Arunachal Pradesh is at the centre of India-China boundary dispute in the eastern sector, the glitch on the smartphone fuelled speculation if it was deliberately done at the behest of the government of the communist country. A spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Government recently re-asserted sovereignty of the communist country over Arunachal Pradesh. A spokesperson of the company, however, said that the weather app on the smartphones had not shown for some time Arunachal Pradesh as well as some other cities and states of India due to some technical glitch, which it had now fixed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/geotag-issue-twitters-clarification-on-leh-being-showed-in-china-904263.html

"Future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation," the prime minister said in his keynote address at the inaugural function of the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020. Modi said these investments must be planned well in advance and cannot be done in a short-sighted manner. The prime minister said that one needs to invest in science and innovation in advance to reap benefits at the right time. The journey to innovations must be shaped by collaboration, public participation, as science will never prosper in silos, he added. He also referred to many interventions made by India, including for improved cleanliness and greater toilet coverage, which contribute to a better healthcare system. Modi said this meeting was to be held physically in India but is now being held virtually due to the changed circumstances. The annual event brings together scientists and innovators from across the world in order to deliberate on solving key global challenges. The 2020 summit, being convened virtually from October 19-21, brings together policymakers and scientific leaders, calling for deepened scientific collaborations in solving global health problems, with great emphasis on Covid-19 with an "India for the World" framing. The three-day event will feature leaders talks, panel discussions, and virtual informal conversations on topics ranging from scientific interventions for fighting the pandemic, managing the pandemic and accelerating the development and implementation of global solutions to combat this pandemic and prevent the next one. Approximately 1600 people from 40 countries are participating in this meeting. It is being co-hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, the Indian Council of Medical Research and NITI Aayog, along with the Grand Challenges Canada, the United States Agency for International Development and Wellcome. Grand Challenges India was set up as a partnership of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012, and Wellcome also joined the partnership. Grand Challenges India works across a range of health and developmental priorities ranging from agriculture, nutrition, sanitation, maternal and child health to infectious diseases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/future-will-be-shaped-by-societies-that-invest-in-science-innovation-pm-narendra-modi-904268.html

But Covid-19 infections are decreasing in India after a peak in mid-September, with 61,390 new cases reported on average each day, according to a Reuters tally. "Our mathematical model estimates that around 30% of the population is currently infected and it could go up to 50% by February," Manindra Agrawal, a professor at the Indian Institute for Technology in Kanpur and a committee member, told Reuters. The committee's estimate for the current spread of the virus is much higher than the federal government's serological surveys, which showed that only around 14 per cent of the population had been infected, as of September. But Agrawal said serological surveys might not be able to get sampling absolutely correct because of the sheer size of the population that they were surveying. Instead, the committee of virologists, scientists and other experts, whose report was made public on Sunday, has relied on a mathematical model. "We have evolved a new model which explicitly takes into account unreported cases, so we can divide infected people into two categories – reported cases and infections that do not get reported," Agrawal said. The committee warned that their projections would not hold up if precautions were not followed, and cases could spike by up to 2.6 million infections in a single month if measures such as social distancing and wearing masks were ignored. Experts have warned that infections could rise in India as the holiday season nears, with celebrations for the Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Diwali due this month and in mid-November, respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/half-of-indians-may-have-had-coronavirus-by-february-government-panel-estimates-904273.html

He has been arrested under the anti-terror law in connection with the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed the Jail Superintendent to take adequate steps for the safety and security of Khalid while ensuring the application of the prison rules, without any distinction or discrimination. The court's directions came on an application filed by the accused seeking adequate security in prison so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody. It said in its order passed on October 17 that Khalid be allowed to carry out his daily routine as per the jail rules. “Since accused is in judicial custody, therefore, the jail rules including rule number 1401, as are applicable to all other inmates, have also to be equally applied to the present applicant (Khalid)… the present application is disposed off with the directions to the concerned Jail Superintendent to take adequate steps for the safety and security of the present accused Umar Khalid while ensuring the application of the jail rules without any distinction or discrimination. ,” the court said. As per rule, an undertrial prisoner should be allowed to leave his cell early morning, work on voluntary basis, have access to newspapers, library books and games. His counsel Trideep Pais had earlier told the court he has been attacked on several occasions in the past and hence there was apprehension of his safety in prison. He had further said that the safety and security steps should not result in denial of Khalid's rights in as much as he was not confined to a particular room citing the apprehension. The accused is in judicial custody till October 22 in the UAPA case. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-riots-court-directs-jail-authorities-to-provide-adequate-security-to-umar-khalid-904275.html

Speaking at the first virtual meeting of the Delhi Cultural Policy Advisory Committee, Sisodia said that Delhi belongs to everyone and it should reflect the diverse culture and heritage of the nation. He said art and culture should play a part in enabling the society to stand against hatred and violence. "Violence and hatred are increasing and an all-round collapse of the moral fabric is evident these days. In such a situation, the government of Delhi is formulating a comprehensive cultural policy to ensure the meaningful contribution of art and culture towards transforming the mindset of the society," he said. The Delhi government wants to create a cultural atmosphere in the city. Just like people go to cinemas and restaurants, now they will have many options to choose from in terms of cultural events as plenty of them will organised in the city, he said. Participating in the meeting, actor and member of the committee Manoj Vajpayee said children from the slums should be introduced to theatre education to help them join the mainstream. Citing the example of the French capital of Paris where street artists performing in public spaces is a common sight, he suggested that the Delhi government provide spaces where artists can showcase their talent so that the city can be projected as a cultural capital. Sisodia said the cultural policy is being formulated by a 15-member advisory committee and it will submit its report within two months. In addition to Bajpayee, the advisory committee consists of personalities and experts from the field of art and culture including actor Javed Jaffrey, JNU's School of Arts and Aesthetics Professor Ira Bhaskar among others. Sisodia said that the Delhi government has taken many steps to advance arts and culture but until now, there was no clear structure of these activities. "This is the reason why we want to create a holistic cultural policy so that it is possible to create a better cultural environment in a systematic way," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhis-new-cultural-policy-will-transform-mindset-of-society-sisodia-904287.html

In October, it is inexcusable not to have state-level estimates derived from real data.  Manindra Agarwal, a professor of mathematics at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and a member of the government panel, said the model had 10% error probability on a national scale. This would increase further if it is used to predict the situation in a state or district.  The panel uses publicly available data to create its “supermodel” rather than relying on the Indian Council of Medical Research’s official data due to the limitations of ICMR data policy.  Within the academic circle, there are growing murmurs of how the panel used a simplistic model to come out with conclusions justifying the actions already taken by the central government. “I find it surprising that respected scientists should put their names on a very flawed piece of work. It just seems a political exercise,” said another IMSc professor.  Agarwal countered the charges. “I can’t help if the conclusions support the government policy, but there was no political inclination,” he said. “We wrote to all the scientists and received 30 proposals from which we picked up two models. Subsequently, the panel decided to work together to improve upon the models and the scientists who originally contributed were duly acknowledged,” he said explaining the process.  A second key conclusion of the government panel is that the lockdown decision announced by the Narendra Modi government in March was perfectly timed. This too has been challenged by the academicians.  “The delay in the migrant population moving back (to their home state) did help to spread the disease, unlike what they claimed,” said a scientist. The conclusions that movement of migrants brought about by the lockdown didn't significantly alter the numbers, were made without any basis in the model, which was not designed to test such a hypothesis at all, said a researcher involved in computer modelling.  Agarwal said the panel modelled the migration trend in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar but left out West Bengal, which did not allow migrant workers in for nearly a month. “What is new in the model that we had not assessed earlier except the name of the model – Supermodel!” wondered a professor at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, Kolkata.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/scientists-raise-questions-on-govt-panel-s-claim-about-covid-19-pandemic-in-india-ending-by-february-2021-904291.html

His remarks, in response to a query at a press conference, come a day after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said that community transmission of the coronavirus is restricted to certain districts in a limited number of states, clarifying that "this is not happening across the country". The national capital recorded 31 Covid-19 fatalities on Monday, taking the death toll to 6,040, while 2,154 fresh cases took the infection tally to over 3.33 lakh. "I have been saying it for months. And, despite such a large number of positive cases, I don't know what is their issue, they (Centre) can admit it clearly. If positive cases coming in lakhs are not termed community spread, when will it be called a community spread? Never saw positive cases in such a large number," Jain told reporters. The Delhi health minister also asserted that the seroprevalence survey in September found that 25 per cent of the sampled people had anti-bodies to Covid-19, meaning around 50 lakh people got affected and cured. "So, they (Centre) will know what is their problem in admitting that there is a community spread," he said. Health ministry officials had said the World Health Organisation has not given any standard definition of community transmission. The WHO permits its member-nations to assess the spread of the disease, based on their own analysis of the situation, and do their reporting, which the global body shows on its website. On the ongoing October seroprevalence survey, Jain said it started on October 15 and will go on for a few more days. The Delhi minister also asserted that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital was "better" than what it was a month or so ago. "The peak of cases seems to have got a bit lowered," he said. On the festival season approaching and the chances of infection spread, Jain said, "I would once again appeal to people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, in markets and elsewhere, to contain the spread of infection". Asked if there was any shortage of blood in its banks, he said, "Plasma is the main thing required for COVIDCovid19 patient, blood bank situation is fine as of now". "Also of the total number of beds at our disposal, only 30 per cent is occupied," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/whats-the-issue-with-centre-in-admitting-theres-community-spread-delhi-health-minister-904293.html

Raut, in the memorandum, claimed crimes against Dalits and women, rape and murder had increased manifold, adding "the pogrom against Dalits, women and minorities was well chalked out as an agenda of the fascist BJP rule in UP". He said crimes against women increased in UP by over 67 percent in four years, while incidents of rape were creating fear among women. He also faulted agencies there for lack of timely and scientific probe into crimes against women and those from Scheduled Caste communities, adding that many a times cases were not being registered. Raut said people from SC communities were being garlanded with footwear, paraded naked, denied use of space for last rites, socially boycotted in UP and many of their lands were being encroached. He said rape cases were reported in places like Balrampur, Bulandshahr and Azamgarh in UP after the Hathras incident, which hit the headlines worldwide. "Hence President's Rule was needed to ensure the rule of law and for the peaceful existence of the society in the larger national interest," the memorandum stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/maharashtra-congress-leader-nitin-raut-demands-president-rule-in-lawless-up-904308.html

Though New Delhi has been treading cautiously on the issue of exodus of the Rohingyas from Myanmar to Bangladesh, it may take part in a virtual conference to urge nation, which the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will hold on Thursday to urge the nations around the world to enhance financial support for the displaced people. It was after China moved to take advantage of the issue to spread its tentacles in Bangladesh and Myanmar that the US-led the initiative to generate resources for the Rohingyas. Beijing’s envoy to Dhaka, Li Jiming, is learnt to have recently conveyed to the Bangladesh Government the proposal to hold a tripartite meeting to end the impasse over the much-awaited repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar. He proposed that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi would host the meeting with his counterparts in Bangladesh and Myanmar governments. While Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen agreed to attend the meeting, Dhaka is understood to have conveyed to Beijing that Myanmar’s State Counsellor and de facto ruler, Aung San Suu Kyi, who also holds the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the government of her country, must attend it, instead of being represented by someone else. Beijing is currently in touch with Dhaka and Naypyitaw to explore the possibility of the meeting and scheduling it, sources said. New Delhi, however, is of the view that China’s interest on the Rohingya issue stems from its desire to expand its geopolitical influence in Bangladesh and Myanmar, both neighbouring countries of India. The conference being held by the US, UK, EU and UNHCR on Thursday is intended to bring the international community together to address the crisis. The UN has appealed for more than $1 billion in aid to meet the humanitarian needs of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh this year, but so far less than half has been contributed. This left a significant funding gap, made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic. The minority Rohingyas have since long been victims of persecution in the Rakhine State, where Buddhists constitute the majority. They have been denied citizenship and most of them have been stateless, despite living for generations in Myanmar. Myanmar's armed forces launched the latest military crackdown against the Rohingyas on August 25, 2017, after a militant outfit killed 12 security personnel in Rakhine. With hundreds of them killed and villages burnt down, over 742,000 more Rohingyas, including women and children, fled Myanmar and took refuge in Bangladesh, taking the number of refugees to nearly one million.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-likely-to-join-us-other-countries-in-mobilising-resources-for-rohingya-refugees-904311.html

Azima's suit alleges that Indian security company CyberRoot Risk Advisory and New Delhi-based BellTroX InfoTech Services carried out the hack-and-leak at the behest of American private intelligence company Vital Management Services, which in turn had been hired by the international law firm Dechert on behalf of the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA), an investment fund based in the United Arab Emirates. Reuters reported in June that BellTroX was at the center of a years-long hacking campaign that targeted more than 10,000 accounts across the globe, citing three former employees, outside researchers and a trail of online evidence. BellTroX founder Sumit Gupta could not be reached. Gupta, who is a fugitive from U.S. justice in connection with a separate hacking case, has previously told Reuters he would sometimes "download some mails" on behalf of private investigators but didn't elaborate and has denied wrongdoing. The Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, which took over RAKIA in 2017, didn’t return messages. Dechert's global head of communications, Saira Zaki, and Vital's president, Nicholas del Rosso, also did not respond to messages seeking comment. Dechert and del Rosso have previously denied wrongdoing in relation to the stolen Azima emails. CyberRoot and its executives did not respond to messages. The lawsuit is the latest skirmish in a battle between Azima – a 79-year-old tycoon with longstanding ties to the Middle East – and RAKIA, which accuses him of fraud in relation to various business deals, including a luxury hotel sale in Georgia and a training academy in Ras Al Khaimah. Azima denies the claims, accusing RAKIA in a U.K. lawsuit of basing its case on emails that he says the authority stole and then leaked. In May a British judge ruled in favor of RAKIA, ordering Azima to pay more than $4.1 million. The judge also rebuffed Azima's claim of hacking, saying that while the allegation was "not impossible," evidence for it was "far from conclusive." Azima has since been granted permission to appeal the judgment. Azima also took his case to Washington D.C., where he alleged that RAKIA had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The U.S. suit was dismissed last year on jurisdictional grounds. Although the U.K. litigation has previously mentioned del Rosso, Azima’s new case – filed Thursday – is the first time he has publicly identified the hackers he says are directly involved, naming CyberRoot and BellTroX as the firms responsible for the digital break-in. Azima alleges in the lawsuit that Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based Vital and del Rosso “paid CyberRoot more than $1 million for the hacking of Azima and the dissemination of his stolen data” and that CyberRoot drew on BellTroX’s assistance in carrying out the work. The suit further states that del Rosso was “hired to do so” by Dechert “on behalf of RAKIA.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lawsuit-accuses-indian-hackers-of-leaking-businessmans-emails-904347.html
19-10-2020||National||Bihar Assembly Election | Centre raises poll expenses limit in view of Covid-19||The Union Ministry of Law and Justice has raised the limit of poll expenses ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar in view of the pandemic. The Union government accepted the recommendation of the Election Commission for a 10% hike in the limits of poll expenses by the candidates for both Assembly and parliamentary constituencies across the country. The Union Ministry of Law and Justice issued the notification on Monday, raising the limit of poll expenses for Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and most of the other states from Rs 70 lakh to Rs 77 lakh and every parliamentary constituency from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 30.8 lakh. The EC will hold polling in 243 Assembly constituencies in Bihar in three phases on October 28, November 3 and 7. The poll panel will also hold byelections to fill up 56 vacancies in the Legislative Assemblies in 10 states on November 3 and 7 next. The 54 constituencies, where byelections will be held on November 3 include two in Karnataka–Sira and Raja Rajeshwari Nagar (RR Nagar)–and 28 in Madhya Pradesh. The bypolls to fill two vacancies in the Legislative Assembly of Manipur will be held on November 7. The EC also decided to hold a byelection in Valmiki Nagar parliamentary constituency in Bihar to fill up a vacancy in the Lok Sabha on November 7. The expense limits for Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Ladakh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu have been raised from Rs 54 lakh to Rs 59.40 lakh for every parliamentary constituency and from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 22 lakh for every Assembly constituency. The Ministry of Law and Justice issued a gazette notification on Monday, amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, to raise the poll expense limits. The EC recommended the hikes as the candidates would have to incur additional cost to adhere to the guidelines issued to maintain social distancing norms and other Covid-19 protection measures during electioneering, including for holding a larger number of rallies with attendance of the limited number of voters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bihar-assembly-election-centre-raises-poll-expenses-limit-in-view-of-covid-19-904350.html

19-10-2020||National||Decline in number of Covid-19 cases due to early lockdown: PM||With the number of active Covid-19 cases in the country falling and predictions that India may be having just 40,000 active coronavirus cases by February next year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asserted that this happened because India was one of the first countries to adopt a lockdown. "Today, we are seeing a decline in the number of cases per day and the growth rate of cases. India has one of the highest recovery rates of 88 percent. This happened because India was one of the first countries to adopt a lockdown. India was one of the first to encourage the usage of masks. India actively began to work on effective contact-tracing. India was one of the earliest to deploy the rapid antigen  tests," Modi said addressing the inaugural function of Grand Challenges Annual Meeting 2020. Modi's lockdown measures that began in March with the hope of combating Covid-19 within 21 days, had to be extended for months and the accompanying economic slowdown gave ammunition to the Opposition parties to question the efficacy of the lockdown strategy of the Modi government, which is also a poll issue in Bihar right now. The Prime Minister's spirited defence of the lockdown came on a day when the Health Ministry latching on to a government appointed panel's report expressed confidence that India may have just 40,000 active coronavirus cases by February next year if people in the country follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The ministry earlier on Saturday said the active case load in the country is  merely 10.7 per cent of the total cases and the active caseload has gone below the 8 lakh figure for the first time after one and a half months. Scientists have, though, raised questions on the claims of the expert panel. Speaking of the programme that brings together scientists and innovators in order to deliberate on solving key global challenges, the Prime Minister also said that his government has made many interventions which are contributing to a better healthcare system. "Take sanitation. Improved cleanliness. More toilet coverage. Who does this help the most?  It helps the poor and under-privileged. It leads to a reduction in diseases," he said. The three-day summit (October 19-21) being co-hosted by by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, the Indian Council of Medical Research and NITI Aayog, along with the Grand Challenges Canada, the United States Agency for International Development and Wellcome, called for deepened scientific collaborations in solving global health problems, with great emphasis on Covid-19 with an "India for the World" framing. While flagging the "strong and vibrant scientific community" and good scientific institutions in the country, Modi said they have been India’s greatest assets, specially during the last few months, while fighting Covid-19. "From containment to capacity building, they have achieved wonders. The journey to these innovations must be shaped by collaboration and public participation," he said as he averred that science will never prosper in silos and that the future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation. "But, this cannot be done in a short-sighted manner. One has to invest in science and innovation well in advance. That is when we can reap benefits at the right time," he said. The three-day event will feature leaders' talks, panel discussions and virtual informal conversations on topics ranging from scientific interventions for fighting the pandemic, managing the pandemic and accelerating the development and implementation of global solutions to combat this pandemic and prevent the next one. Approximately 1600 people from 40 countries are participating in this meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/decline-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-due-to-early-lockdown-pm-904362.html

A day after Shiv Sena appeared a bit soft, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, the chief architect of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, has hit out at the Governor. It may be recalled, last week Pawar had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue. The Centre too had expressed its displeasure with Union Home Minister Amit Shah questioning the language used by the Governor. “I have read the letter. He has made a passing reference. I believe some restraint could have been exercised,” Shah had said in a TV interview, to a question on the controversy. Talking to reporters on Monday, Pawar said anybody with self-respect would not continue in the post. “After the Union Home Minister’s statement expressing disappointment over language in the letter, anybody with self-respect will take a call on whether to continue in the post or not,” Pawar said. His statement comes a day after Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said they are satisfied with the response of the government. “The Governor’s letter followed by the Chief Minister’s reply was an unavoidable controversy and we haven’t started it. But we are satisfied with the Union Home Minister’s stand and thank him for understanding the reason for our anger,’’ said Raut, a close aide of Thackeray.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/anyone-with-self-respect-wont-continue-in-the-post-sharad-pawar-hits-out-at-governor-koshyari-904064.html

"How to completely destroy an economy and infect the maximum number of people really quickly," he said in a tweet, tagging a picture that showed the projected GDP growth rate for 2020 and the number of deaths per million in 11 countries of the region. The picture, which cited data from the International Monetary Fund, showed India at the bottom of the table with GDP growth for 2020 at -10.3 pc and 83 deaths per million population due to Covid-19. However, for Bangladesh, the GDP growth rate was at 3.8 per cent and the Covid-19 deaths per million were at 34. For China, the GDP growth was 1.9 per cent and 3 deaths per million due to Covid-19. Similarly, for Vietnam, the GDP growth rate stood at 1.6 per cent and Covid-19 deaths per million at 0.4, while for Nepal the growth rate was zero per cent and 25 deaths per million. Pakistan had -0.4 per cent GDP growth and 30 deaths due to Covid-19 per million population. Gandhi has been attacking the government for failing to manage the coronavirus pandemic properly and for the falling GDP growth in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rahul-gandhi-again-targets-centre-over-handling-of-covid-19-economy-904183.html

He said that the organisation will strive hard to "establish the rule of law and restore democracy" in the opposition ruled states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Surya succeeded Lok Sabha Mumbai MP Poonam Mahajan after completion of her tenure, who had handed over the position to Surya. Prior to taking charge, Surya paid his respects to B R Ambedkar. On taking up office, Surya thanked the party's top leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president JP Nadda for entrusting him with the responsibility to lead the party's youth wing. He also said he would fulfill the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a strong India. Later speaking to reporters, he said he would work for strengthening the wing by bringing more youth into the organisation. "I will identify more grass-root leaders from economically and socially backward class and encourage their growth in the party and cultivate leadership quality," he said. "The BJYM will strive hard to establish the rule of law and restore democracy in the states of West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Hundreds of young party activists have sacrificed their lives to uphold the constitution in these states," the Bangalore South Lok Sabha MP said. The BJP's Delhi youth wing workers gave him a resounding welcome on Monday when he left his residence here for the party headquarters to assume charge as the 14th President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the party's youth wing said in a statement.   (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tejasvi-surya-assumes-charge-as-president-of-bjps-youth-wing-904211.html

Nadda, who was speaking at a meeting of social groups of north Bengal, accused the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal of indulging in "divide and rule politics" in the state to serve the political interests of her party - the TMC, unlike BJP which "works for the development of all". "As far as CAA is concerned all of you will get the benefits of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. It has been passed in Parliament. We are committed to it. "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, CAA implementation got delayed. But as the situation is slowing improving, the work has started. The rules are now being framed, it will be implemented very soon," Nadda told the social groups, who included Dalits, Gorkhas, Rajbanshis, and other tribes. Various social groups of the region had requested Nadda to ensure early implementation of CAA as there is a vast population of refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan in north Bengal. Riding the wave of the local sentiment for the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Bill (now CAA), the saffron party had made deep inroads in the region, once considered a BJP bastion. It had bagged seven out of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Assembly polls are due in the state in the first half of next year and the fight for power promises to be a tough one as Banerjee will seek to return as chief minister for the third straight time. North Bengal, which comprises eight districts, accounts for 54 of the 294 assembly seats. Indicating that CAA would be a major poll plank of the BJP in the assembly polls, Nadda said BJP is committed to its implementation. The citizenship law has become a flashpoint in West Bengal since before its enactment in Parliament in 2019 with the ruling TMC opposing the contentious legislation tooth and nail and BJP pressing for its implementation. According to state BJP sources, the CAA will benefit more than 1.5 crore people across the country, including over 72 lakh in the West Bengal. Lashing out at the TMC government for its alleged "divide and rule policy" in Bengal, Nadda said only the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi can take everybody along as he believes in the policy of "development for all'. "On one hand you have Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji, who works for the development for all and on the other hand, you have West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has employed the policy of divide and rule to serve TMC's political interests. The TMC believes in dividing people, and we believe in uniting people," he said. Continuing his attack on TMC, which has often been a harsh critic of the saffron party, the BJP president accused it of pursuing "appeasement" policies for its vote bank politics. The Mamata Banerjee government has an "anti-Hindu mindset" which has been exposed and is now trying to misguide various communities, he claimed. "We all have seen how the Hindu community was being suppressed in the state. But now when Tthe TMC has realised that it is badly affecting the party, it is trying to make a fool of various communities. They are only interested in vote bank politics," he said. Nadda assailed the TMC government for not joining several central schemes, including Ayushman Bharat, PM Kisan Samman Nidhhi, meant for the poor and farmers. Stating that 76 lakh farmers of West Bengal are being deprived of the government help under Kisan Samman Nidhhi because Banerjee did not allow its implementation, he said "Mamata Ji stop doing politics with the rights of poor people. The day BJP forms government in Bengal within moments we will implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme and PM Kisan Samman Nidhhi in the state". Nadda thanked the Gorkha groups for their continued support to BJP and said the party is committed to the "permanent political solution" to problems of the Darjeeling hills and the demand for the recognition of 11 Gorkha sects. "Both the issues are there in our manifesto (2019 Lok Sabha polls). We are committed to them," he said. Nadda exuded confidence that the BJP would form the next government in West Bengal as the people of the state are fed up with the "violence and cut-money" culture of TMC. Nadda, who arrived here on a day-long visit took stock of organisational matters ahead of 2021 Assembly elections and held separate meetings with BJP leaders of north Bengal and also social groups.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/caa-to-be-implemented-soon-delayed-due-to-covid-19-jp-nadda-904256.html

Addressing a poll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior's Dabra town where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Nath said the Congress candidate was a "simple person" unlike the opponent who was an "item". Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state assembly and joined the BJP in March, in the process bringing down the Nath government. "Based on the report received from the chief electoral officer of MP, we have asked for a detailed report. It would be with the Commission on Tuesday. Based on it, the Commission would take a view," said a senior EC functionary. The National Commission for Women had also forwarded the matter to the Election Commission for necessary action. "By the time we received reference from NCW, we had already sought a detailed report from CEO, Madhya Pradesh," the EC official said.

It struck back at Nadda for "peddling lies and misinformation" to the people of the state. The TMC refuted Nadda's claims that central funds are not being utilized properly and said the BJP national president should stop making "baseless" statements and get his "facts and figures corrected". Nadda had criticised the TMC at a meeting with social groups at Siliguri during the day. He had accused the Mamata Banerjee government in the state of indulging in "divide and rule politics" in the state to serve the political interests of TMC, unlike BJP which "works for the development of all". In a sharply worded statement, TMC Rajya Sabha leader and its spokesperson Derek O' Brien said, "(Durga) Pujo greetings to J P Naddaji and his family. In the best traditions of our great state, Bengal, this is the time of the year which is not the occasion for politics or bickering. This is the time for joy and sharing. This culture, this decency, is deeply enshrined in the ethos of every person who lives in Bengal. "This irony is not lost when the president of the BJP talks about "divide and rule". "Divide and rule" is a ploy learnt from the colonial past and played out deviously every day by your party," he said. The BJP government at the Centre which has "done everything it can to divide and rule the people of this great nation" over the last six years it has been in power, he said. Brien said there were gaping holes in Nadda's speech in Siliguri but the TMC "will not defile this auspicious occasion". Senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim criticised Nadda for spreading "lies and misinformation" and not being aware of the ground reality in the state. "He (Naddda) is making baseless statements and should get his facts and figures corrected. He should stop peddling lies and misinformation. The central government itself has stopped sending funds due to GST compensation and J P Nadda is lecturing opposition ruled states and making politically motivated statements," Hakim said. Nadda, who was on a day-long visit to Siliguri, took stock of organisational matters ahead of 2021 Assembly elections and held separate meetings with BJP leaders of north Bengal and a social groups.

Reacting sharply, Dubey has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla alleging that Tharoor has misused the platform of the Standing Committee. In a series of tweets, Tharoor said, "Should such reputable companies be financing hate through ads on Repulsive TV?" He went on to name a number of companies from diverse sectors like telecom, health and automobile. "Can they find the moral courage to be like Parle?" Tharoor said. He was apparently referring to a media report which quoted a senior Parle official as saying that the company will not advertise on news channels that "broadcast toxic content". Emphasising that corporates should have the same moral and social duties as individuals, Tharoor said that they too should abjure hate and communalism, and not incite one community against another. Mentioning the names of many other companies, Tharoor said, "They fund the toxicity, the hatred and bigotry, which our news channels spew 24x7." Objecting to Tharoor's tweets as he is the chairman of the panel looking into the issues related to TRP ratings of news channels, BJP MP Dubey accused him of misusing the standing committee platform and violating the Lok Sabha Speaker's advisory with his "Catch the Media Attention" campaign. In his letter to Speaker Om Birla, he said that "it is also an abject display of truant behaviour on the part of Dr. Tharoor to abusively call" a TV channel and also make "unsubstantiated insinuations and rant against various reputable companies." Openly discussing various aspects, which are under examination of the parliamentary panel, "is an affront" to the Speakers' pious advisory of refraining from such acts, Dubey said. "Tharoor has now become incorrigible. I, being a public representative for the third consecutive time, feel pained and, therefore, to request your good self to kindly consider nominating me to some other Committee," he said. Under the chairmanship of Tharoor, the parliamentary panel has recently called officials of the central government on the issue of TRP. In August this year, Dubey had sought removal of Tharoor as the chairman of the parliamentary panel after the Congress MP from Kerala tweeted on taking up the issue of suspension of internet services in Jammu and Kashmir and calling Facebook officials over alleged misuse of the social media platform.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tharoor-dubey-again-at-loggerheads-after-congress-mp-questions-companies-advertising-on-toxic-channels-904324.html

A UP Government spokesperson said that on the second day of Mission Shakti, Adityanath interacted with women village pradhans, BDC members, block pramukhs, corporators, heads of urban local bodies, self-help groups and women teachers, through virtual mode. The chief minister said that helpline numbers such as 1090, 181, 1076 and 112 should be publicised. On an appeal by Smriti Singh, the pradhan of Ratsar Kala Garhwar village in Ballia, he said that there should be a facility of speaking Bhojpuri and Bundelkhandi dialects on helpline numbers such as 1090, 112, 181. "The women will feel comfortable, if there is facility of speaking in their regional dialect," he said. Adityanath also said that there is a need to inculcate the feeling 'gaanv ki beti, sabki beti'. "These are our culture and values. This should reverberate from villages to cites. The Centre and state government are making consistent efforts to ensure women security and honour, but the real success will be achieved by cooperation and awareness of women," he said.

19-10-2020||North and Central||BJP leader, four others held in Uttar Pradesh's Ballia murder case||The Uttar Pradesh Police has arrested a BJP leader and four others in the Ballia murder case, officials said on Sunday. Local BJP leader Dhirendra Pratap Singh allegedly shot dead Jai Prakash Pal Gama (46) on Thursday following a quarrel over the allotment of ration shops at Durjanpur village in Ballia's Reoti area. The Uttar Pradesh government had suspended the SDM, circle officer and other policemen present at the spot. According to officials, Dhirendra Pratap Singh, who is the main accused, was arrested by the UP Special Task Force from Lucknow while Santosh Yadav, Amarjeet Yadav, Ajay Singh and Dharmendra Singh were held from Ballia. So far, police have arrested 10 people in connection with the case, in which an FIR has been lodged against around 30 people, most of which are yet to be identified. Dhirendra Pratap Singh was held from Lucknow near the Polytechnic area, Special Task Force (STF) IG Amitabh Yash told PTI. The STF in a statement said the BJP leader carried a cash reward of Rs 50,000 and was held at 11.40 am while waiting for his friend near the Polytechnic crossing. An Aadhaar card and Rs 1,000 in cash were recovered from him, the STF said. He has been lodged at Kotwali police station in Ballia. During interrogation, Dhirendra Pratap Singh said that on October 15, around 2,000 people fhad gathered in the village and there was a fracas over the allotment of ration shop. Members of the other side (of Krishna Kumar Yadav) opened fire in which his nephew, Golu Singh, and 5-6 women of his family were injured. Golu later succumbed to his injuries, he claimed. Meanwhile, Azamgarh Range DIG Subhash Chandra Dubey assured that the other accused will be arrested soon. The main accused will be interrogated to know which weapon he used to commit the crime and efforts will be made to recover it, the DIG said. He said a year ago, a case was registered against Dhirendra Pratap Singh for misbehaving with a supply inspector. "A charge sheet in this matter was filed in a local court," he said. The DIG said SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams from Azamgarh and Mau districts are engaged in arresting the rest of the accused. Assistance from the Bihar Police is also being taken, he said. "The properties of the accused will be seized under the Gangsters Act," Dubey said. Dubey added that all evidence provided by BJP MLA Surendra Singh will be thoroughly examined. The BJP MLA has been accused of backing the accused by the Congress. Lashing out at the BJP without naming the MLA, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday asked the BJP to explain to whom it was backing. "With whom is the BJP government siding in the Ballia incident," she said in a Hindi tweet, adding that the BJP MLA is openly supporting the accused. The MLA, who was called to Lucknow by the party leadership said that he met UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and party's UP unit's general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. Speaking to PTI over phone, he said that he briefed both the leaders about the "one-sided action" of the administration in the case. He added that both the leaders listened to him. Singh said he was assured that a case from the other side would also be registered soon. Meanwhile, the brother of the deceased demanded stringent punishment for the guilty, security for his family, Rs 50 lakh assistance and a government job. Expressing apprehension, he said, "But Dhirendra is a 'dabang' (strongman). We fear untoward incidents in future as well." Among the others arrested in the case is Narendra Pratap Singh, the brother of the main accused. He was held on Friday, along with one Devendra Pratap Singh. On Saturday, Munna Yadav, Raj Pratap Yadav and Rajan Tiwari were arrested from Ballia. The Uttar Pradesh Police said on Saturday that it would invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and Gangsters Act against the accused. Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order. Under the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, a district magistrate can order attachment of property, whether movable or immovable, if there is a reason to believe that it has been acquired as a commission for an offence triable under this law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-leader-four-others-held-in-uttar-pradeshs-ballia-murder-case-903914.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'poor'; likely to worsen by Wednesday||Pollution levels in Delhi dipped slightly on Monday but the air quality stayed in the 'poor' category, with government agencies saying the AQI was likely to slip to 'very poor' in the next few days due to a change in wind direction and a reduction in speed. The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 244. It was 254 on Sunday, 287 on Saturday, 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320). An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the AQI was likely to slip to 'very poor' category by Wednesday due to a change in wind direction and a reduction in the wind speed. Expecting further deterioration in air quality in the coming days, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Monday asked the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments to be ready to close thermal power plants that do not meet the standards laid down in 2015. In two separate letters, EPCA chief Bhure Lal asked the two states to review preparedness for closing thermal power plants and to inform the authority of this as well as steps that will be taken to ensure compliance with necessary shut-down during the peak winter period. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal requested Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to hold monthly meetings with the the CMs of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to curb air pollution, saying there is a lack of political will at the level of the states to address the problem of stubble burning. In a virtual press briefing, he said the affected states have been unable to find a solution to stop stubble burning and prevent air pollution. "I believe pollution due to stubble burning can be controlled in a short span of time. But a lack of political will is visible in doing that." Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the city government will deploy 2,500 environment marshals across the national capital to generate awareness about its recently launched anti-pollution campaign, 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off', to curb vehicular pollution. He also said a meeting of the environment ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh with the Centre must be held every 15 days to discuss matters pertaining to pollution and stubble burning. Such meetings will help in improving coordination between the states, he said. According to SAFAR, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution stood at 10 per cent on Monday with 1,090 stubble fire around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring regions. It said a change in surface wind direction is expected by early Wednesday which is "likely to bring calm surface wind conditions, leading to low ventilation and deterioration of AQI". Very poor AQI is predicted for Wednesday and Thursday, Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor said. "Though transport-level wind direction is favourable, an increase in the wind speed and local surface winds led to a decrease in stubble contribution in Delhi's PM2.5," SAFAR said. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 17 per cent on Sunday, 19 per cent on Saturday, 18 per cent on Friday, around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed -- was 10,000 meter square per second on Monday, favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height at which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-poor-likely-to-worsen-by-wednesday-903974.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Shivraj Singh Chouhan hits out at Kamal Nath over remark against minister||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has hit out at former CM Kamal Nath over his "item" remark against state minister Imarti Devi, saying it shows the "crooked and despicable mentality of the Congress. The remark is a disrespect not just of the minister, but each and every girl of the Gwalior-Chambal region, Chouhan said in a tweet on Sunday. Addressing a poll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior's Dabra town, where the Congress is up against Imarti Devi, who switched over to the BJP, Nath said his party candidate was a "simple person" unlike his opponent who is an "item". Taking a dim view of the remark, Chouhan in a tweet in Hindi said, "With your cheap statement, Congress' crooked and despicable mentality has come to the fore again. You have not just disrespected Smt Imarti Devi, but each and every girl and sister of Gwalior-Chambal region." Kamal Nathji who gave you the right to play with the respect of women? he asked in the tweet. Chouhan, former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and state BJP president Vihsnu Dutt Sharma have decided sit on a silent fast (protest) for two hours in Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior, respectively, on Monday to protest against Naths statement, a party release said. A BJP delegation on Sunday met Election Commission officials in Bhopal and complained against Nath for "insulting women and Dalits". Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state Assembly and joined the BJP in March, in the process bringing down the Nath government. By-elections for 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.

He also assured police that he would help in the recovery of the weapon used in the crime, they said. Singh allegedly shot dead Jai Prakash Pal Gama (46) on Thursday following a quarrel over the allotment of ration shops at Durjanpur village in Ballia's Reoti area. Senior administration and police officials were present at the meeting when the incident took place. After evading arrest for days, Singh was arrested by the UP Special Task Force on Sunday from Lucknow. A cash reward of Rs 50,000 had been announced for his arrest. "DIG Azamgarh range Subhash Chandra Dubey interrogated Dhirendra Pratap Singh for nearly an hour, and he gave the details of the incident. He assured the police that he would help in the recovery of the weapon (used in the crime), and said that he had fired in self-defence," said SHO of Kotwali police station Vipin Singh. He told police that around 2,000 people had gathered in the village on Thursday and there was a fracas over the allotment of ration shops, the SHO said. The accused claimed that the other side started the quarrel and opened fire, injuring his nephew and five-six women of his family. His nephew later succumbed to his injuries, he added. Singh also blamed the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and the circle officer for the incident, the police said. He alleged that the SDM colluded with the other side. He claimed that initially, the SDM had announced that the allotment of shops will be done on the basis of majority. But later he said only those having identity cards can take part in the voting, according to the police. The Uttar Pradesh government has already suspended the SDM, the circle officer and other policemen present at the spot. Besides Singh, four others -- Santosh Yadav, Amarjeet Yadav, Ajay Singh and Dharmendra Singh -- were arrested in connection with the case from Ballia on Sunday. So far, police have arrested 10 people in the case, in which an FIR has been lodged against around 30 people, most of whom are yet to be identified. The Uttar Pradesh Police had on Saturday said it would invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangsters Act against the accused. Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order. Under the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, a district magistrate can order attachment of property, whether movable or immovable, if there is a reason to believe that it has been acquired as a commission for an offence triable under this law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ballia-shooting-fired-in-self-defence-says-main-accused-904003.html

Chouhan also wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, demanding that Nath be removed from all party posts, while Tomar said the Congress chief and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should apologise to Imarti Devi. Talking to reporters in Gwalior's Dabra town, Imarti Devi, who is contesting the November 3 Assembly bypoll from there, said Nath did not know how to respect a Dalit woman and had lost his mind after losing the chief minister's post. She demanded that Sonia Gandhi remove Kamal Nath from the Congress, and claimed he would not be able to get a single seat for the Congress out of the 28 seats where bypolls are scheduled on November 3. On Sunday, while addressing a poll meeting in Dabra, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Nath said the Congress candidate was a "simple person" unlike his opponent who was an "item". Taking a dim view of the remark, Chouhan on Monday wrote to Sonia Gandhi, demanding that Nath be removed from all party posts. "Your silence would compel me to think that you agreed with Naths statement, he said in the letter. In the morning, Chouhan along with state ministers Narottam Mishra, Bhupendra Singh, Vishwas Sarang and some women members of the BJP observed a 'maun vrat' (silent fast) at Minto Hall in Bhopal to protest against Nath's remark.  BJP's Rajya Sabha member Scindia and Lok Sabha member Shankar Lalwani sat on a silent protest over the issue at Regal Square in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Indore. Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Vishnu Dutt Sharma, senior party leader Prabhat Jha and some other leaders staged a similar protest in Gwalior. Tomar demanded that Sonia Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who always champion the cause of Dalit and women, apologise to Imarti Devi. Chouhan also took to Twitter to hit out at Kamal Nath. "With your cheap statement, Congress' crooked and despicable mentality has come to the fore again. You have not just disrespected Smt Imarti Devi, but each and every girl and sister of Gwalior-Chambal region," he said in a tweet in Hindi on Sunday. "Kamal Nathji, who gave you the right to play with the respect of women?" Chouhan asked in the tweet. The National Commission for Women condemned Nath's remarks and also sought an explanation from him over it. The NCW also forwarded the matter to the Election Commission for necessary action. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati also hit out at Nath and demanded that the Congress high command apologise for his remark. She also asked Dalits to vote for the BSP to teach the Congress a lesson over this remark. Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state Assembly and joined the BJP in March this year, in the process bringing down the Kamal Nath-led government. By-elections for 28 Assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bjp-slams-congress-leader-kamal-nath-for-item-remark-on-minister-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-writes-to-sonia-904018.html

The soldier, identified as Corporal Wang Ya Long, was apprehended in the Demchok sector after he had strayed across the Line of Actual Control -- the disputed boundary between the two neighbours. “The PLA soldier has been provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes to protect him from the vagaries of extreme altitude and harsh climatic conditions,” said an Indian Army spokesperson. “A request has also been received from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier. As per established protocols, he will be returned to Chinese officials at the Chushul–Moldo meeting point after of formalities.” Unofficial reports say Corporal Wang was carrying civilian and military documents with him. The two nations have amassed more than 50,000 troops each on the two sides of the LAC as confrontation and stand-off between the border guarding troops snowballed into a massive crisis that could not be resolved in the last seven months despite seven rounds of meetings between top military commanders as well as the Defence and Foreign Ministers from India and China.

Singh, who had been arrested form the state capital of Lucknow on Sunday, told the cops that he had opened fire in ''self defense'' after being 'attacked' by his rivals. Police said that they would seek remand of the main accused to interrogate him and also recover the murder weapon. Singh, a close aide of BJP MLA from Ballia Surendra Singh, had sprayed his rival Jai Prakash Pal with bullets after an altercation during the meeting convened by the officials to discuss allotment of fair price shops at Durjanpur village in the district. Meanwhile upset over the support to the accused by Surendra Singh, the BJP leadership has issued him a show cause notice and asked him not to interfere with the investigation. According to the sources in the BJP here, party's national president J P Nadda spoke to the UP BJP president Swatantra Deo Singh on Monday and expressed his displeasure over the conduct of the MLA. ''The MLA has been asked to explain his remarks supporting the accused...action will be taken against him if his reply is found to be unsatisfactory,'' a senior state BJP leader here said. The MLA had said that he was supporting the accused as both of them were from the same caste. ''I am even ready to quit politics to safeguard the interests of the thakur community....I shall begin a fast unto death if the police do not register the complaint from the family of the accused,'' he had said. The opposition parties have demanded stern action against the lawmaker.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ballia-firing-court-sends-main-accused-to-14-day-judicial-custody-904056.html

The Commission headed by Justice (Retired) Ranjana Prakash Desai could reserve a good number of seats for the scheduled tribes (STs), for the first time in J&K’s history, and increase one or two seats for the scheduled castes, officials privy to the development told DH. While there was no political reservation for STs in J&K Assembly previously, eight seats had been reserved for SCs. STs have a sizable population in both Jammu and Kashmir regions but had been denied political reservations by the previous governments. This will be for the first time when they will get reservation in the UT Assembly. “Though the Commission hasn’t visited J&K even once since its constitution in March this year, it has obtained data pertaining to total electorates in the union territory for analysis for delimitation of the Assembly constituencies,” they said and added the Commission is on the job and is operating from its New Delhi office. The Commission has been mandated to delimit the constituencies of the UT in accordance with the provisions of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019 and Delimitation Act, 2002, by the Union Ministry for Law and Justice on March 6 this year. The erstwhile state of J&K had 87 seats in the assembly and six in Parliament, which got reduced to 83 and five, respectively, after it was bifurcated to make Ladakh a separate UT. So effectively, the seats will go up from 83 to 90 for J&K.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delimitation-commission-studying-data-to-delimit-constituencies-in-jammu-and-kashmir-904060.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Madrassa-educated student from Kashmir's Kupwara cracks NEET||A madrassa-educated (an Islamic religious school) student from a remote village of north Kashmir’s frontier Kupwara district has brought laurels to his area by qualifying for the prestigious NEET exam this year. Faizan Wani, son of a shopkeeper from Muqam Rajwar Shanoo in Kupwara, qualified the NEET in his third attempt with 541 marks. He had passed class 12th in 2017 from a local government school with 88.4% marks. His father Mohammad Maqbool Wani is proud of the achievements of his hardworking son. “I feel privileged to have a son like Faizan,” he said. Faizan, who is a Hafiz-e-Quran (a person who has memorized Quran), was in class 4th when his father admitted him to Madrasa Siraj Ul Uloom, in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. It is the same madrassa whose alumnus Sajjad Bhat is accused in the February 2019 fidayeen (suicide) attack on a CRPF convoy in neighbouring Pulwama district that left 40 paramilitary personnel dead. Within three years, Faizan memorized the entire Quran and during his stay at the madrassa, his father ensured that Faizan continued his studies at a nearby government school. In his first and second attempts in 2018 and 2019, Faizan couldn’t quality the NEET but he didn’t give up. For his success, he credits his parents and teachers who supported and counseled him at every step. “I don’t think coaching is necessary for qualifying any competitive exam but if you avail this facility, that can be an added advantage,” he said and termed hard work and dedication as primary requirements. However, like thousands of other students in Kashmir, he too faced hardships due to the lack of high-speed internet which has been barred in the Valley since last August. “Non-availability of 4G internet did tell upon my preparation but luckily I made it this year with a good rank,” he said. Earlier this month, the Jammu and Kashmir Police booked three teachers of the same madrassa under the Public Safety Act (PSA) after some of its students and alumni were found involved in militancy. While expressing happiness over Faizan’s achievements, a madrassa teacher said, “We teach our children the value of love above religious sentiments. We train them for peace and love. A false perception has been created that madrassa in Kashmir are places where youth are radicalized.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madrassa-educated-student-from-kashmirs-kupwara-cracks-neet-904089.html

According to the police sources here on Monday, a case was registered in this regard and an investigation was launched into the alleged incident. Though the alleged incident had taken place six days back, it came to light on Sunday after the girl complained of pain in her private parts and had difficulty in passing urine, sources said. The family members of the 'victim' told the cops that the girl was playing outside her home in the Quarsi area in the district when the alleged incident happened. The girl went to the neighbour's house to fetch the ball from there when she was 'caught' by the accused and ''sexually assaulted'' after being taken to the bathroom, sources said. Police officials said in Aligarh that the 'victim' had been taken for medical examination.  Sources said that the family of the accused said that he was around seven-year-old.

The Vidhan Bhavan houses the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. "Naseer, his wife and two minor sons (residents of Barabanki district) tried to immolate themselves near gate number 2 of the Vidhan Bhavan in the afternoon by pouring a liquid on themselves. However, the police personnel present at the spot caught hold of them before they could find a matchstick or lighter to set themselves ablaze," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Somen Barma told PTI. Upon interrogation, the DCP said Naseer told them that he was facing financial hardship after his shop in Barabanki was demolished in an anti-encroachment drive and hence, the family thought of taking the extreme step. "Since the family belongs to another district (Barabanki), I have spoken to the district magistrate and they will be handed over to a police team from Barabanki," Barma added. In a separate incident, a middle-aged man identified as Surendra Chakraborty immolated himself in front of the state assembly and sustained 60 per cent burn injuries. "The policemen deputed there tried to save him and rushed him to hospital. He sustained 60 per cent burn injuries," Lucknow Police Commissioner Sujit Pandey said. "The victim had some dispute with his landlord and the matter is in court. We are trying to find out more details," Pandey said adding that four teams have been formed to work on the case. On October 13, a 35-year-old woman from Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh had set herself on fire near the Uttar Pradesh assembly. She succumbed to her injuries at a Lucknow hospital the following day. A man named Alok Prasad, also from Maharajganj, has been arrested on the charge of abetment of suicide in connection with the incident. Lucknow Police Commissioner Pandey had said the woman, identified as Anjali Tiwari, tried to immolate herself near the UP BJP office.

Some organisers said they will rope in two priests to avoid any last-minute scrambling if the main priest gets infected with Covid-19, while others plan to maintain a record of visitors for easy contact-tracing. Most Durga Puja committees in Delhi have decided not to allow entry of people and limit physical darshan to their members only. The Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Society, which organises one of the biggest Durga puja festivals in Delhi, has decided not to allow entry of the general public to the temple premises this year due to Covid-19. It has tied up with a DTH service provider and a local cable operator so that devotees can have a darshan of Durga idol from their houses. The temple society also has plans to facilitate online darshan on its Facebook page and YouTube channel. "Around 2.5 lakh people attend our Durga Puja. Due to Covid-19, we have decided to organise the festival in a simple manner this year. Only a few members of our management committee will be in attendance. "We have hired a certified cook to prepare prasad and he has to show negative Covid-19 report. As devotees will not be allowed, we will deliver prasad at their doorsteps within a 2-km radius for which an agency has been engaged," Society Joint Secretary Prodip Ganguly said. Ganguly said there will be live telecast of aarti and devotees can offer 'pushpanjali' from their homes with all rituals being live-streamed. The size of Durga idol this year is just 5 ft, against the usual 12 to 14 ft every year, he added. Purbanchal Bangiyo Samiti, an umbrella body of 38 Durga puja committees in East Delhi, said only 10 members of each committee will be allowed to have darshan at a time and they have to register their entry to the pandal so that contact-tracing can be easy. "In view of the pandemic, Durga idol will be worshipped in 13 temples while 12 committees will organise only 'Kalash' puja," Samiti General Secretary Mrinal K Biswas said, adding, "We have also decided to hire two priests due to Covid-19. If the main priest gets infected, the other can perform the puja." He said social-distancing will strictly be adhered to and people without face masks won't be allowed entry to the premises while alcohol-based hand sanitisers would be available both inside and outside temples. Delhi Durga Puja Charitable and Cultural Committee in Kashmiri Gate, which claims to be organising Durga puja in the city for 111 years, will conduct COVID-19 test on the six labourers engaged in building pandals. Committee General Secretary Robin Bose said this time, they would conduct 'kalash' puja and entry of devotees will be very limited. The devotees will be encouraged to download the Aarogya Setu app in their mobile phones, he added. Mata Mandir Sarbojanin Durga Samity will also not allow "outsiders" and only committee members will be permitted to the puja. Chief coordinator Debashis Saha said devotees can have darshan on the committee's Facebook page. Meanwhile, a meeting of Durga puja committees of Chittaranjan Park, Greater Kailash 1 and 2, Alaknanda amd Kalkaji was convened by Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj at CR Park Kali Mandir on Monday and it was that Durga puja celebrations in these areas will be suspended this year due to the pandemic. Chittranjan Park Kali Mandir Society's joint secretary said that those pujas, which used to be held in housing societies and streets every year, will not be held this time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/durga-puja-in-delhi-to-go-online-home-delivery-of-prasad-covid-19-test-for-priests-planned-904170.html

It claimed that the calendar proposed by the JNU registrar has parts which have "retrospective effect" and would adversely impact both students and teachers. "The JNUTA rejects the calendar that has no consideration for the academics and the process by which it is being sought to be pushed through. The registrar of JNU had written to the members of the Academic Council informing them that an agenda to consider the academic calendar 2020-21 for the continuing and new students is enclosed and they should convey their approval by mail by October 20," JNUTA president DK Lobiyal said in a statement. It said that a request for consideration could lead to disagreement with the proposed calendar or alternative opinions on it. "However, the possibilities have been ruled out not only in the language of the letter but also the process through which such 'approval' is being sought. It has been reduced to mere formality where statutory bodies are expected to merely rubber stamp for something which has already decided by the university," the statement added. The teachers' association noted how according to the proposed calendar, classes for continuing students were to "commence" from the second week of September 2020 and the last date for adding and dropping of courses was October 4. "What happens to the duration of the monsoon semester in different centres if this starting date was not actually the one in practice everywhere. Neither did the administration ascertain how many continuing students had not managed to take their examinations and would need to take them when the University reopened," the JNUTA claimed. Talking about the sequencing of the monsoon and winter semesters of 2020-21 in the proposed calendar, the association said that if implemented, it would mean that many teachers would be teaching continuously without any break or vacation up to the end of the academic year 2021-22 and neither would any of the batches of students get any significant break between semesters. "This is because the lack of concurrence of the semesters for the continuing and fresh students has been increased beyond what has become inevitable. So, for continuing students, the two semesters are compressed into the nine-month period from September to May, which comes on the back of a conclusion of the winter semester for most students in September," it said. "On the other hand, for the new students being admitted in 2020-21, classes are to begin only in December and the two semesters have to be concluded by July 2021 – a period of just 8 months," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-jnu-teachers-allege-new-academic-calendar-being-imposed-by-diktat-refuse-to-accept-904198.html

The encounter erupted after a joint team of J&K police and Army’s 55-Rashtriya Rifles launched a cordon-and-search-operation in Melhura following ‘specific’ information about the presence of militants in the area, sources said. As the joint team of forces approached towards the suspected spot, the hiding militants fired upon the forces triggering a gunfight in which one unidentified militant has been killed so far, they said. Pertinently, over 190 militants have been killed so far this year in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/police-officer-militant-killed-in-separate-incidents-in-kashmir-904204.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi HC grants bail to 60-year-old man in Delhi riots ca||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a 60-year-old man accused of participating in an unlawful assembly during communal violence in northeast Delhi in February, considering his satisfactory conduct during the interim bail. The man was out on interim bail as the high court had earlier considered his age as well as the fact that he was a permanent resident of Delhi and posed no flight risk. “Considering the submissions (of ASG) and the report on the conduct of the petitioner (accused) during the interim bail period, this court is inclined to grant regular bail to the petitioner...,” Justice Prathiba Singh said. The high court noted the submissions of Additional Solicitor General S V Raju that according to the report of the IO, the conduct of the accused during the interim bail period has been “satisfactory”. Accused Sharif Khan has given his and his daughter’s mobile number to the IO, continued to report regularly and has not indulged in any unlawful or illegal activity during the period, the ASG submitted. The high court directed the accused to not leave Delhi and give his as well as a close family member’s mobile number to the investigating officer and report him in every two days. It said the surrendered passport of the accused shall remain in the custody of the trial court and he shall not indulge in any illegal or unlawful activity or contact any witnesses or any other persons who are subject matter of the investigation of the case. The high court further asked Khan to appear before the trial court as and when directed and shall fully cooperate with the investigation. According to the police, Khan was accused of being a member of an unlawful assembly during riots in Khureji Khas area of northeast Delhi in February. It had said that while disbursing the mob, a couple of police officials were allegedly injured and an FIR was lodged against Khan as one of the police officials had identified him. Earlier, the high court had granted him interim bail for 45 days and had asked the police to file a status report after monitoring his conduct during the period. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-60-year-old-man-in-delhi-riots-ca-904231.html

The UP chief minister had started the programme from Balrampur district on Saturday with an aim to protect and empower women. Akhilesh Yadav said in a statement that the BJP government launched the programme as rape incidents in the state started bringing disrepute to it. “The Chief Minister has presented another advertisement of misleading propaganda in the name of Mission Shakti,” Akhilesh said. "Every daughter of the state is waiting for the answer to the question that where is the anti-Romeo squad. The Samajwadi government had made the 1090 helpline a shield for the protection of women but the BJP made it ineffective," he claimed. The SP chief alleged that even in its fourth year, the state government has not been able to start anything new and only inaugurating the works done during the SP regime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-govts-mission-shakti-a-false-propaganda-says-samajwadi-party-president-akhilesh-yadav-904245.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||DU salary row: ABVP, DUSU to protest outside Delhi secretariat against AAP govt's directives||ABPV and Delhi University Students' Union members will hold a protest outside the secretariat on Tuesday against the AAP government's directive to 12 DU colleges fully funded by it to pay outstanding salaries to staffers from the Students Society Fund. "While the Students Society Fund (SSF) corpus, which is entirely constituted by the fees charged from the students, is meant for funding the various student societies at colleges, the unspent amount is to be utilised only for student welfare. Moreover, the guidelines imply that the deficit spending is to be financed exclusively by the Government of Delhi,” DUSU president Akshit Dahiya said at a press conference. He said the Delhi University statutes also require the colleges to be run in consonance with UGC regulations. Besides, the accumulated funds to the tune of several crores of rupees would be inadequate to remunerate the teaching and non-teaching staff of these 12 colleges beyond a period of two to three months, Dahiya pointed. "Since the Delhi government will be bound to exploit other sources for future provisions, appropriation of students’ money to discharge existing liabilities is unreasonable and patently immoral,” he added. The city government on Friday directed 12 Delhi University colleges fully funded by it to pay outstanding salaries to staffers from the Students Society Fund, a move criticised by DU's teachers' body and officials of the university. The government has ordered a special audit of six colleges -- Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, Maharishi Valmiki BEd College, Keshav Mahavidyalaya, Aditi Mahavidyalaya, Bhagini Nivedita College and Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies. The AAP government and 12 colleges fully funded by it have been locked in a tussle over the release of grants, with the latter saying that they have been unable to pay salaries to staffers for nearly three months owing to the non-release of funds.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/du-salary-row-abvp-dusu-to-protest-outside-delhi-secretariat-against-aap-govts-directives-904254.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots: Tihar jail authorities allege Khatoon 'aggressive', misbehaved with staff||Tihar Jail authorities have told a Delhi court that student activist Gulfisha Khatoon, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the north east Delhi riots in February, was allegedly “aggressive” and had misbehaved with the prison staff on several occasions. The submissions were made before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of an application filed by Khatoon alleging that she was being subjected to communal slurs and mental harassment by the prison staff. The Tihar Jail Superintendent stated, in the reply filed to the application on October 15, that she has been given correctional punishments to mend her behaviour earlier for allegedly misbehaving with the staff. “The female inmate (Khatoon) is also trying to overpower the jail staff and create nuisance in jail, her behaviour is also aggressive and troublesome. Staff has also been directed to behave politely and not to argue with the inmates. As per record, the petitioner has been given correctional punishments to mend her behaviour,” the reply stated. The Superintendent further informed the court that in view of repeated complaints by Khatoon and to avoid any further unpleasantness, the duty of the staff, against whom allegations were raised, have been changed from the ward. “The staff have been directed to talk to the inmates in a polite way and not to get into any argument with inmates. The duty of that staff also changed from that ward for time being to resolve the matter,” the reply stated. It further said that as on October 15, 48 Muslim women inmates were lodged in Central Jail number 6, where Khatoon was lodged, and none of them made any such type of complaints. “The court is informed that there is no discrimination on the basis of caste and creed. The inmates belonging to different religions, states, caste and foreigners are treated equally and without any discrimination,” it added. The reply further stated that on inquiry, it was revealed that Khatoon as well as the staff had made complaints against each other and hence both the parties were heard and counselled to follow the jail rules and maintain discipline inside the jail. It said that two other inmates, Babita and Sheetal, who were present at the time of the incident, had stated that there was an heated argument between Khatoon and the jail staff but the staff did not use any communal slur. The argument was due to the fact that the outing time for ward number 6 was over but Khatoon was still outside taking water from the water cooler and despite being repeatedly told by the staff to finish fast, she came back to her jail after finishing her talk with another inmate, Babita and Sheetal said in their written statements. They further said that Khatoon had allegedly said that the staff was their servants, which the official had opposed. The jail authorities further informed that Khatoon had filed several applications and her request were considered as per the prison rules. The reply stated that Khatoon has been allowed to wear headphones during e-legal interviews, jail staff was directed to put earplugs so that she can comfortably conduct her legal interviews and confidentiality of her conversation was maintained. “The petitioner had made a complaint to change the brand of milk and provide black tea to her. Her request was considered and the brand of milk was changed. Which shows there is no discrimination among the inmates and in fact jail authorities are attending to the request of the inmates as far as possible within the framework of applicable Prison Rules. “That the petitioner gave an application for work of grass cutting in the park but taking her educational qualification into account, she was provided work in Crèche to teach the children of inmates (lodged with their mothers). That as per the request of the petitioner and her two co-inmates, a study room was created in a cell of the ward where these inmates are lodged,” the reply said. Khatoon, through her counsel advocate Mehmood Pracha, had alleged that she was being discriminated against by the staff in the jail. She had also made the submissions directly to the court during the hearing of the case. "I have a problem in jail. Ever since I was brought here I have been constantly facing discrimination by the jail staff. They called me educated terrorist and are hurling communal slurs at me. I am facing mental harassment here. If I hurt myself, only jail authorities will be responsible for it," she has alleged. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-tihar-jail-authorities-allege-khatoon-aggressive-misbehaved-with-staff-904257.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Abdullah's interrogation part of Centre's 'vindictive' politics: People's Alliance||People's Alliance, a newly formed conglomerate of mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, on Monday condemned the interrogation of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and termed it as part of the "vindictive politics" practised by the Centre to eliminate dissent and disagreement across the country. Such "tactics" will not dampen the conglomerate's resolve for restoration of statehood and the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, it said in a statement. The Alliance was formed on October 15 to carry forward the Gupkar Declaration seeking restoration of the status quo of the erstwhile state as it existed on August 4 last year through Constitutional means. "It is stated that the Central Government unnerved by the unity amongst the people across all the regions and communities to pursue the goals of Gupkar Declaration and support extended to it by political parties and civil society groups at the national level is resorting to a game of witch-hunt and suppression," the Alliance said in its statement. Condemning the Enforcement Directorate's action, the group said it was part of the "vindictive politics practiced by the Central government to kill dissent and disagreement across the country". In the present case, the action has been taken "to silence the genuine demand for reversal of unilateral and unconstitutional decisions of August 5, 2019" under which the state was bifurcated into two union territories -- Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir -- and the special status guaranteed under Articles 370 and 35-A of the Constitution was abrogated. "The Alliance has reminded the Central government that such tactics are not to dampen the will of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh to have the Constitutional status realised," it said. The Alliance also urged the Centre to realise "the dangers in this process of witch-hunting and intimidation" and desist from such "vindictive designs". "Dialogue with all stakeholders remains the only option to address the deepening uncertainty in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh," the statement said. The People's Alliance came into existence on October 15 after the release of PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti from detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA). She was among a host of politicians detained last year after the Centre announced abrogation of the special status. Abdullah and his son Omar were released from detention in March this year. The People's Alliance, mainly comprising the NC, the PDP, CPI-M, Sajjad Lone's People's Conference, Awami National Conference and other smaller parties, had decided to format the conglomerate which will work for ensuring that the Gupkar Declaration seeking restoration of the status quo as on August 4 last year is implemented completely through Constitutional means. The Enforcement Directorate on Monday questioned Abdullah, a Lok Sabha MP, for several hours in connection with a money laundering probe related to a multi-crore scam in the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/abdullahs-interrogation-part-of-centres-vindictive-politics-peoples-alliance-904297.html

These marshals will be deployed at 100 traffic signals across Delhi's 11 districts, he said. Addressing reporters, Rai said the shortlisted traffic signals are those where the red light is two-minute long. "From October 21 to November 15, a ground-level awareness drive on 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign will be launched at 100 traffic signals. We are in the process of appointing 2,500 environment marshals who will spread awareness about the campaign at these signals. It is an awareness drive, not an enforcement drive," he said. Rai said local SDM and traffic police (ACP) will monitor this campaign and if required, transport department's deputy commissioner (enforcement) will also oversee the campaign. "This campaign is targeted at initiating a behavioural change. It is an awareness campaign and not enforcement. It is the campaign of the 2 crore people in Delhi, people who are concerned about the catastrophic consequences pollution can have amidst the ongoing pandemic. This campaign is about taking ownership," he said. The marshals will be working in 2 shifts, and 10 of them will be positioned at each traffic point. The first shift will be from 8 am to 2 pm and the other will be from 2pm to 8pm, Rai said.   "Apart from this, places like ITO, which are slightly bigger in size will see civil defence officers in double the numbers. Ten such places have been identified. Around 2,000 marshals for 100 crossroads and extra 200 for the 10 slightly bigger in size. 300 marshals have been kept as reserve in case of need," Rai said. He said the Delhi government will write to all MPs, MLAs, councillors, RWAs, industrial and other social agencies to take part in this campaign. This campaign will be effective from morning 8 am till evening 8 pm. For this, Transport and Traffic police have identified and submitted a list of a select group of 100 major traffic points from 11 districts, he said. "The marshals will adopt the principle of 'Gandhigiri'. They will give red roses to those not switching off the ignition at red lights. They will be made aware as to why it is important for them to do it and how they can fight pollution through the move," he added. The ''Red Light On, Gaadi Off'' campaign was launched by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on October 15. Experts say on an average a vehicle stops at a red light for 15-20 minutes in a day, consuming 200 ml of fuel, creating pollution. If 10 lakh vehicles switch off ignition at red lights, 1.5 tons of PM10 and 0.4 tons of PM2.5 will be prevented every year, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-to-deploy-2500-environment-marshals-to-spread-awareness-about-anti-pollution-campaign-904313.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Noida: Students return to class after seven months; 39% attendance in govt schools, 11% in private||Students from Class 9 to 12 returned to classes on Monday as schools reopened in Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddh Nagar after a seven-month hiatus due to Covid-19 outbreak, officials said. There are 153 schools in the district -- 53 of the government and government-aided while remaining self-financed -- that reopened in adherence to Cpvid-19 norms like social distancing, face covers and sanitisation of hands, District Education Officer Neeraj Kumar Pandey said. “Government and aided schools had an average attendance of 39 per cent on the first day, while it was 11 per cent in private schools. The teachers' attendance was 100 per cent,” Pandey told PTI. “The atmosphere was positive and students looked happy,” he said, adding that the low turnout, especially in private schools, was due to initial challenges of confidence-building between schools and parents. The education officer expected the attendance to go up to 70 per cent in all schools in a week's time and around 100 per cent after Dussehra holidays. “The government's decision to reopen the schools is a courageous step. There is no alternative to classroom teachings. Online classes are fine, but not absolute substitution for schools and classes,” Pandey said. On issues faced during the first day, he said cameras installed in four or five schools were not working properly and these institutions have been asked to get the problem rectified soon. “All schools are equipped with cameras and can be monitored in real time. The same way we monitor classes during examinations. Today, we visited some schools to assess the situation and for many, we reviewed the situation by real-time monitoring through cameras,” he added. Another issue, he said, was a miscommunication between schools and students because of which all students of Class 9, 10, 11 and 12 reached their school in the morning while the instruction was to have 50 per cent students in the morning shift and the remaining in the afternoon shift. “We wanted Classes 9 and 10 to be present in the morning and 11 and 12 in the afternoon shift. At some places, all students reached the schools in the morning. But this appears to be a miscommunication error which will be worked out over the next couple of days,” Pandey said. However, a major advantage of the low turnout was a near-ideal student-teacher ratio in classrooms, the officer said. “There were 20 to 24 students in a classroom instead of the usual 40 or so. The student-teacher ratio is where government schools would earlier come secondary to private institutes and coaching centres. So in a way, the low turnout provided teachers and students also a more convenient atmosphere for classes,” he said. Pandey said all COVID-19 related guidelines were followed and morning assemblies have been cancelled in schools to keep away from gatherings that can be avoided.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-students-return-to-class-after-seven-months-39-attendance-in-govt-schools-11-in-private-904328.html
19-10-2020||North and Central||Authorities seal office of prominent newspaper in Srinagar||Authorities on Monday sealed the office of a prominent daily in Jammu and Kashmir that was allotted to it in a government building here, with the newspaper owners claiming that the due process of law was not followed. The Estates Department sealed the office of 'Kashmir Times' at Press Enclave here on Monday, officials said. They, however, gave no reasons for the government action. The English daily is headquartered in Jammu and is published from both the regions of the Union Territory. The newspaper owners claimed that no notice of cancellation or eviction was served on them and "nothing in writing" was given to them. “Our office in Srinagar was locked without any due process of law. No notice – whether of cancellation or eviction – was served to us,” Kashmir Times owner Anuradha Bhasin told PTI over the phone. Bhasin said they had heard murmurs about the government planning to evict them from the building at the Press Enclave a month back, but there was no formal communication from the Estates Department. “We had approached the Estates Department and asked them to please serve us the order, but they gave us nothing. Then we approached the court, but no order has been given even there,” she said. She said the locking up of the Srinagar office of the newspaper was something similar to her recent eviction from a flat in Jammu. "The government has the right to evict an allottee, but there is a certain criterion and they have to follow the due process," she said. “However, the due process has not been followed in my particular case,” she added. Bhasin termed the move as "vendetta" against her "for speaking out against the government” and moving the Supreme Court against media restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre abrogated Article 370 in August last year. “The day I went to court last year, that very day, the state government advertisements to Kashmir Times were stopped,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/authorities-seal-office-of-prominent-newspaper-in-srinagar-904332.html

19-10-2020||Opinion||The unbearable goodness of being: A review of 'Humankind' by Rutger Bregman||Rutger Bregman, author of the New York Times bestseller, Humankind: A Hopeful History, attempts to address some important central questions of our times: Why do human societies today appear fundamentally broken, with depressing levels of inequality and a pathologically polarising media ecosystem? And what to do about it?  Bregman proposes a sweeping solution and one that overestimates its own merit – he asks us to put faith in the idea that humans are inherently decent and approach the problems plaguing our political life from this philosophical plane. It’s a daring idea that is, no doubt, open to challenge, especially given his way of proving it. To illustrate, he backs this claim with a motley crew of convenient examples, including the humanitarian response following Hurricane Katrina and the spontaneous Christmas Truce of 1914. These examples, albeit heartwarming, are entirely anecdotal. Anecdotes, if taken seriously, can prove almost any hypothesis. For instance, it is possible to argue that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the "goodness" of human nature because there were no Christmas Truces during the First World War after 1914. But Humankind has no room for counter-anecdotes. Yet, the book has the potential to make us look at crucial questions about the condition of human societies afresh and ask whether philosophers and intellectuals in the Western canon have got something very wrong in seeing human nature as inherently violent.    Bregman approaches the issue by pulling the rug from under Enlightenment, the intellectual lodestar of Western democratic values and institutions. He alleges that Western civilisation stands upon a long intellectual and cultural tradition that denies that deep down almost all humans are decent. From Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan to Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, there is ample philosophical support for the assumption that humans are savage, selfish beings that need to be reined in by the coercive power of the State or the invisible hand of markets. This assumption, according to Bregman, is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When institutions are built assuming the worst of human nature, they facilitate the creation of deeply unequal and unhappy societies in the name of law. The collective dissatisfaction and anger of those residing in these societies are then amplified by the perverse incentive structure of the media ecosystem and exploited by manipulative politicians and businesspersons in their pursuit of power. Thus, institutions created to protect humankind from its worst instincts end up facilitating the rise of the most crooked individuals. All foundational myths must be supported by the soft power of science and art, and the ‘veneer theory’ of civilisation is no exception. Bregman cites Milgram’s Shock Experiment, Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment and the Bystander Effect, as evidence for the deep-rooted dogma within the social sciences of viewing human nature as fundamentally brutish. Despite their non-adherence to standard research ethics, and shocking inadequacies in data collection, the aforementioned experiments continue to be taught as central truths in social psychology courses across the world. Similarly, critically acclaimed and widely-read works of literature, like William Golding’s Lord of the Flies (in which a group of young boys marooned on an island descend into savegry and murder when attempting to govern themselves) serve to further the myth in popular imagination. Humankind also offers a biting critique of modern-day media ecosystems that sensationalise brutal crimes, provide fame to bigoted politicians and offer half-truths as objective reportage. This broken incentive structure is further corrupted by the dopamine-fuelled urgency of social media. Yet, it is this shameful state of the media that proves to be the strongest evidence in favour of Bregman’s argument of the self-fulfilling prophecy.   That said, Bregman, despite what his Wikipedia page claims, is not a historian. He is a polemicist. Humankind: A Hopeful History is not a work of serious historical scholarship. It is a manifesto. It uses historical scholarship insofar as it serves the political goals of the book. The biggest hint of this is in the book’s subtitle, ‘A Hopeful History’, which is a subtle contradiction. After all, history is what has already passed, while hope is a future-directed emotion. The heart of the book lies in this contradiction. Like the ‘veneer theory’ of civilisation, Bregman wants his “humans are decent” model of human nature to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. He understands that his model is limited, which is why the book is as prescriptive as it is descriptive. What he cannot explain, he recommends. Humankind for all its flaws is a rare work that straddles the world of fiction and nonfiction in the best sense of the two terms and for this reason alone, if nothing else, deserves to be widely read. Bregman uses limited literal truths, along with speculation, to espouse an allegorical truth. Nobody really knows if there is such a thing as a single, universal human nature, but that does not matter to Bregman. He argues that by learning to expect the best from people, by avoiding the news and allowing themselves to be hopeful of the future, humans can overcome the cynicism that prevents meaningful change.

19-10-2020||Opinion||Covid-19 | Herd immunity? Or ‘mass murder’?||No matter their politics, people nearly always listen to those who say what they want to hear. They would do this by allowing “those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally.” This, they say, will allow people “to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.” But who is right? The signers of the declaration do have a point. Restrictions designed to limit deaths cause real harm, including, but by no means limited to, stress on the economy, increases in domestic violence and drug abuse, declines in tests that screen for cancer and on and on. Those living alone suffer real pain from isolation, and the young have every reason to feel bitter over the loss of substantive education and what should have been memories of a high school prom or the bonding friendships that form in a college dorm at 2 a.m. or on an athletic team or in some other endeavor. So the idea of returning to something akin to normal — releasing everyone from a kind of jail — is attractive, even seductive. It becomes less seductive when one examines three enormously important omissions in the declaration. Second, it says little about how to protect the vulnerable. One can keep a child from visiting a grandparent in another city easily enough, but what happens when the child and grandparent live in the same household? And how do you protect a 25-year-old diabetic, or cancer survivor, or obese person, or anyone else with a comorbidity who needs to go to work every day? Upon closer examination, the “focused protection” that the declaration urges devolves into a kind of three-card monte; one can’t pin it down. Third, the declaration omits mention of how many people the policy would kill. It’s a lot. Will we have achieved herd immunity then? No. Those are models. Actual data from prison populations and from Latin America suggest transmission does not slow down until 60 percent of the population is infected. (At present, only about 10 percent of the population has been infected, according to the C.D.C.) And what will be the cost? Even if herd immunity can be achieved with only 40 percent of the population infected or vaccinated, the I.H.M.E. estimates that a total of 800,000 Americans would die. The real death toll needed to reach herd immunity could far exceed one million. As horrific a price as that is, it could prove much worse if damage to the heart, lungs or other organs of those who recover from the immediate effects of the virus does not heal and instead leads to early deaths or incapacitation. But we won’t know that for years. Proponents of herd immunity point to Sweden. Swedish officials deny having actively pursued that strategy, but they never shut down their economy or closed most schools, and they still haven’t recommended masks. Its neighbors Denmark and Norway did. Sweden’s death rate per 100,000 people is five times Denmark’s and 11 times Norway’s. Did the deaths buy economic prosperity? No. Sweden’s G.D.P. fell 8.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with Denmark’s 6.8 percent and Norway’s 5.1 percent. Finally, the Great Barrington Declaration aims at a straw man, opposing the kind of large, general lockdown that began in March. No one is proposing that now. Is there an alternative? There was once a simple one, which the vast majority of public health experts urged for months: social distancing, avoiding crowds, wearing masks, washing hands and a robust contact tracing system, with support for those who are asked to self-quarantine and for selected closures when and where necessary. Some states listened to the advice and have done well, just as many schools listened and have reopened without seeing a surge. But the Trump administration and too many governors never got behind these measures, reopened too many states too soon, and still haven’t straightened out testing. Worse, the White House has all but embraced herd immunity and has also poisoned the public with misinformation, making it all but impossible to get national, near-universal compliance with public health advice for the foreseeable future. As a result, the United States is not in a good place, and achieving near containment of the virus — as South Korea (441 deaths), Australia (904 deaths), Japan (1,657 deaths) and several other countries have done — is impossible. We can, however, still aim for results akin to those of Canada, where there were 23 deaths on Friday, and Germany, which suffered 24 deaths on Friday. Getting to that point will require finally following the advice that has been given for months. That will not happen with this White House, especially since it is now all but openly advocating herd immunity, but states, cities and people can act for themselves. Nothing, including monoclonal antibodies, rapid antigen testing, or even a vaccine, will provide a silver bullet. But everything will help. And hundreds of thousands of Americans will keep living who would otherwise have died under a policy of herd immunity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/covid-19-herd-immunity-or-mass-murder-904358.html
19-10-2020||Panorama||Food sovereignty of farmers, citizens given a go-by ||Following their passage in Parliament, President Ram Nath Kovind has signed the three Bills which are being referred to as “Farm Bills”. However, these are not about farming alone. They are `Food System Bills’. They affect the entire food system. These laws will determine how we produce our food, how much do farmers get for what they grow, how much do people pay for food, how many people have livelihoods in the food system, and how we manage our soils, biodiversity and natural resources. They could dismantle India’s centuries-old biodiversity-based, small farmer-centred tradition of Atma Nirbhar of small farmers, and 70 years of a regulatory system to protect small farms, small farmer livelihoods, livelihoods of millions of workers and small traders in mandis, the right to food, and the food sovereignty of the country.  The three bills are: The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 which excludes food from the Essential Commodities Act;  Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 which dismantles regulatory market framework that prevents traders and agribusiness from exploiting farmers; and,    The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 which opens the door for global agribusiness and food processing corporations to lock farmers into new corporate slavery. The Essential Commodities Act is not related to farm prices but to the entire food system. The Act is a regulation to prevent profiteering from essential commodities on which life depends - like seed, food and medicine. It is meant to prevent speculation and artificial scarcity created through hoarding. Food is an essential commodity. When prices rise, people starve. Excluding food from the Act is a recipe for speculation and profiteering.  Putting trade and profits above people’s right to food is also a recipe for hunger as we experienced during British rule which destroyed our food sovereignty through trade and a system of extraction of taxes from the peasants. Over 60 million Indians died due to the resulting famines created by the British empire. In 1955, independent India passed the Essential Commodities Act to prevent traders from profiteering from food while people died.  The government used the Act to regulate the price of Bt Cotton seeds. It is related to Right to Food as a fundamental right. Food is life.  Article 21 guarantees it as does the Food Security Act of 2013 which opens with, “An Act to provide for food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach, by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” The Act embodies the duty of a sovereign government to regulate the prices of essential commodities. Without the regulation of food prices, there is no Right to Food.  The second Bill is the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 which dismantles the regulatory market framework that prevents traders and agribusiness from exploiting farmers, and is the foundation of the biggest public food system in the world to ensure that the Right to Food mandis are governed by the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) comprising of both farmers and traders. As an example, the Karnataka Act – The Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1966 - clearly states: (iv) representation on the market committee to purchasers of agricultural produce, representatives of the purchasers’ co-operative societies, representatives of co-operative marketing and processing societies, municipalities, taluk boards and the Central Warehousing Corporation or State Warehousing Corporation”. Governed by states The APMCs embody three aspects: First, they are governed by the states. Therefore, Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 is unconstitutional since the Centre is encroaching on states’ rights. Secondly, the mandis - governed by APMCs - are a co-operative arrangement between farmers and traders with oversight by the government. The mandis are regulated. No trader can hold more than a limited stock. And prices are regulated to ensure that farmers are not exploited. Thirdly, they are a physical space that provides farmers decentralised access to markets. It is the existence of the mandi that guarantees farmers a fair price. And it is the existence of a decentralised network of mandis governed by states in a federal framework that is the backbone of our food security system. No trader in a mandi can take more than 2.5% commission.  Three traders create a price difference of 6-7% between farm price and consumer price. After the 1991 neo-liberal reforms, this started to diverge. After 1997, the polarisation increased to 40%. Wherever corporations control trade and commerce under deregulated markets, they take 90-95% as the margin. Farmers’ incomes fall, food prices rise. As corporates control increases, the price polarisation between farmers’ price and consumer price increases. Integration of farmers into corporate food systems is farmers’ slavery, not farmers’ freedom and farmers’ sovereignty corporations are neither producers, not consumers. They are middlemen who increase the distance between the farmer and consumer, and make profits by exploiting both.    However, all evidence shows that small farms are more productive than large farms. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, 80% of the food we eat comes from small farmers (‘Who really feeds the world’ by Vandana Shiva). Navdanya’s work with small farmers shows that small biodiverse farms based on agro-ecology and nutrition-sensitive agriculture can provide full and adequate nutrition to two times India’s pollution. Biodiverse systems that increase nutrition per acre also increase farmers’ incomes because they stop the drain for costly corporate seeds and agrichemicals, and they free the farmer from corporate chains that drive down prices of farm produce (‘Wealth per Acre’ by Vandana Shiva). Small food-sovereign farmers and a decentralised, diverse food system is the backbone of our food security and food sovereignty. Food sovereignty of farmers and Indian citizens is the essence for a self-reliant Atma Nirbhar Bharat.

19-10-2020||Panorama||Off the record: October 19, 2020||Reason to celebrate Rajya Sabha TV is attracting increasing attention. The latest news is that 10 lakh new people have subscribed to its YouTube channel in 10 months, crossing the 50 lakh mark last week. On January 2, it crossed the 40 lakh mark and on October 14, it crossed the 50 lakh mark. In 2020, viewers have spent over 16.6 million hours watching RSTV content online. Of the 50 lakh subscribers on YouTube, 45 lakhs came in the last three years and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu tweeted, “Glad to know that RSTV today reached another landmark of 5 million YouTube subscribers. Only a few other channels have this distinction...Wish the channel more laurels.” It had just 4.5 lakh subscribers in 2017 when Naidu took over as the Chairman of Rajya Sabha. The RSTV team had more reasons to celebrate as it is far ahead of many other mainstream news channels in India, including India Today (40.8 lakh), DD News (32.4 lakh), Times Now (19.3 lakh), Republic World (38.2 lakh), CNN News18 (16.8 lakh), News Nation (27.4 lakh), CNBC Awaaz (18.4 lakh), Lok Sabha TV ( 8 lakh ) and CNBC-TV18 (6.5 lakh). Missing plaque  As Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Atal Tunnel near Rohtang Pass, which will provide all-weather connectivity to Ladakh, Congress leaders pulled out all stops to point out that the project had begun under UPA-II. Congress President Sonia Gandhi had laid the foundation stone of the project in 2010. Himachal Pradesh Congress leaders were shocked as they found that a plaque that mentioned Gandhi was missing even though she had laid the foundation of the project and lodged a police complaint about the missing plaque. Congress leaders accused Modi and the BJP of trying to wipe out any mention of Opposition leaders in the strategic asset. After police registered a complaint, it was discovered at the project contractor’s office near Manali. Congress leaders have now demanded its restoration and threatened an agitation if it is not done. Pre-poll favouritisms Towards the end of every government’s tenure, the chance of finding irregularities and favouritisms becomes high. Often officials who are forced to turn a blind eye towards irregularities due to political compulsions would land in the dock thereafter. Considering this precedent, a senior IAS officer in Kerala is said to have cautioned his colleagues. The IAS officer is said to have posted a message in a closed group of IAS officers in Kerala that all officers should be cautious while giving their nod as officials would finally be responsible. Kerala is heading towards the local body elections in a couple of months and the Assembly polls are hardly six months away. Already, the state government has announced some popular measures like employment opportunities to thousands of jobless youths and it has already raised concerns of backdoor appointments. Hence the IAS officer’s alert to his colleagues assumes significance. A rarity In Kashmir, begging has become a growing problem. Beggars, mostly non-locals show up anywhere, from religious places to traffic signals and even inside public transport. The proliferation of beggars in almost every area of daily life used to be a matter of annoyance for many people, who had to deal with the constant haggling and heckling by these beggars. These non-locals have over the years learnt the Kashmiri language. Ask them why they speak in Kashmiri and they say it fetches them more money if they seek alms in the native language. While the younger generation in Kashmir is slowly but steadily drifting away from their mother tongue, the language has found another way of staying alive!

19-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Hide and seek||I was around four-years-old when a trivial incident turned dramatic. As a tiny-tot, I was hooked to darts and spent long hours firing them at a drumstick tree during my spare time. Disfigured by the steady barrage of dart hits, the trunk began to ooze a reddish-coloured gum. This act of mine did not go down well with my father who detested the pockmarks made on one of his favourite trees -- the guava and curry leaf were his other pet trees. His repeated pleas to wind up my game and cool my heels indoors fell on deaf ears. Going bonkers, he hollered, "Hold your horses, you little brat, or else!" and stomped out with a cane to give me a few whacks. Filled with dread at the thought of getting flogged, I soon did the disappearing act --fleeing the spot and cooping up in the kennel at the back. Striding with the cane, my father looked every inch a hunter with a gun, out to bag a trophy. He roamed the compound and soon began a thorough search of the house and every conceivable hiding place, but I remained elusive. Unable to trace me, he grew impatient. The search expanded to the streets, playground and the neighbours' houses. A lookout plea was also made to my maternal grandparents who lived nearby. The grandparents and uncles too joined the search party and fanned out in different directions, but returned empty-handed. From the cracks in the kennel's side, I could discern the events unfolding in rapid succession. From a cheerful family just moments ago, there was visible gloom. Refusing to throw in the towel, the despondent family members assembled in the living room to plot their next move. Someone hinted that kidnappers might have captured me intending to demand a ransom. Yet another chillingly reminded those around that the 'begging mafia' may have spirited me away. A third even suggested filing a police complaint. Just as the minutes ticked away, and everyone became anxious, my father dashed to the doghouse --which had escaped his memory--and peeped in as a last resort. A triumphant cheer went up as he hauled me out and thanked the Almighty. The mood changed as my father, cheerful again, carried me into the house and comforted me. My little brothers, the family elders and especially my mother, felt relieved as well and were glad to see me again.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/hide-and-seek-903908.html
19-10-2020||Second Edit||Kerala Covid-19 cases, a worry||The sharp surge in Covid-19 infections in Kerala in recent weeks is distressing. As on October 17, the state’s caseload of coronavirus infections was 3,34,228, with 9,016 new cases reported that day. For months, Kerala’s handling of the pandemic was globally hailed as a model to be followed. Stringent surveillance and swift adoption and implementation of the World Health Organisation’s ‘test, trace, isolate and support’ protocol helped it keep infections down for several months. Despite the arrival of tens of thousands of expatriate workers from the Gulf countries, state health authorities seemed to have the situation under control. Then in early September, there was a noticeable change. The state, which was reporting an average of 2,000 new cases per day till then, saw a surge in daily infections. The number rose rapidly that month to touch 11,755 cases on October 10. While new infections have started falling, the numbers are still high. So what went wrong? Where did Kerala stumble? Ten days of festivities for Onam began on August 31, when caution regarding the coronavirus was thrown to the winds.  Kerala was roiled in mass protests as well in September. Social distancing was ignored and few wore masks. The sharp increase in infections followed. There is a silver lining, however, in the otherwise dreary Covid-19 situation in the state. Fatalities are low. There have been around 1,139 deaths due to Covid-19 so far. Kerala has a Covid-19 fatality rate of just 0.34%, which is far lower than the national average of 1.5%.  What makes this low fatality rate all the more remarkable is the fact that Kerala has a large elderly population. People over 60 years of age comprise 13% of the population compared to the national average of about 8%. Covid-19 has hit the elderly the hardest worldwide but Kerala, despite its significant proportion of senior citizens, has managed to keep fatalities down. It is likely that the state’s robust public health infrastructure system, which has been built systematically over the decades by successive governments, is playing a role in keeping alive those infected by the deadly coronavirus. Other state governments should draw lessons from Kerala’s experience. Daily infections are declining in many states at present. This could change in the coming weeks as India begins celebrating Dasara, Eid and Diwali. Millions are expected to pour into markets and places of worship and participate in public celebrations. If people violate social distancing norms and do not wear masks, infections will rise rapidly again. Unlike Kerala, the rest of India does not have health infrastructure to keep fatalities down.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/kerala-covid-19-cases-a-worry-903904.html

As per the Covid-19 guidelines, pilgrims need to carry a negative Covid-19 test certificate issued by a verified laboratory 48 hours prior to their visit. Antigen tests are conducted at Nilackal for those without the negative certificates. The Tamil Nadu native tested positive during the antigen test conducted at Nilackal, district health authorities said. The devotee came all alone and has been shifted to the Covid First Line Treatment Centre (CFLTC) set up at Carmel engineering college at Ranni. Ayyappa devotees wearing masks and carrying Covid-19 negative certificates were allowed to enter the famed temple here from October 17 morning, after over six months. The temple, which opened for the monthly pujas on Friday evening, will allow pilgrims to offer worship till October 21. Each day only 250 people will be allowed inside the temple. Only those between 10-60 years are being allowed to offer prayers, they should not gather around in groups and maintain social distancing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-devotee-from-tamil-nadu-tests-covid-19-positive-903871.html
19-10-2020||South||Flood situation grim in parts of Telangana, Karnataka||The flood situation in parts of Telangana and Karnataka remained grim on Sunday as overnight spell of rains in Hyderabad battered the city yet again while the Army was pressed into service in four affected districts in Karnataka. Incessant downpour since Saturday caused flooding in parts of Hyderabad, leaving three people dead in separate rain-related incidents. The Telangana capital had witnessed one of the worst deluges in recent times following unprecedented downpour in over a century early this week, with about 20 cm of rains being recorded in the city and its surrounding areas. The flood situation in Karnataka was equally a matter of concern in four districts with Krishna and Bhima rivers in spate as the Army, the national and state disaster response forces undertook rescue work, evacuating hundreds of marooned people, officials said. In Hyderabad, rains since Saturday evening led to lakes and other water bodies overflowing with the water inundating several low-lying areas, including parts of the city affected last week, here and the outskirts, police and civic officials said. A total of 37,409 families were affected in various localities that were inundated in the city due to the recent floods and ration kits and blankets were being distributed among them, a release from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) said. Disaster Response Force personnel, GHMC staff and police swung into action since Saturday night itself, evacuating those stranded. At least three people, including two children died in rain-related incidents reported from different parts of the city over the past 24 hours here, police and civic officials said. The state capital bore the brunt as a depression dumped the heaviest rains (nearly 20 cm) since 1916 for October on Tuesday and triggered flash floods. The rains abated since Wednesday with the flood water receding in most parts while the government in a preliminary estimate had pegged the losses at over Rs 5,000 crore. However, since Saturday night several parts of the city and neighbouring districts again were battered by torrential rains with Saroornagar in adjoining Rangareddy district recording the maximum of 16.9 cm while Hyderabad Airport registered 7.2 cm. On Sunday, GHMC Commissioner D S Lokesh Kumar said the civic body has launched steps to restore normalcy in areas affected by the latest spell and intensified relief works. In view of forecast of heavy rains, as a precautionary measure citizens staying in low lying areas were being evacuated, GHMC officials said. Special drive on demolition of dilapidated structures continued by GHMC officials and citizens living in such structures were requested to vacate the buildings voluntarily to protect their lives from danger of collapse and cooperate with it in taking further action. The India Meteorological Department has warned that thunderstorms accompanied by lightning were very likely to occur at isolated places over Telangana and heavy rain is very likely at isolated places from Sunday till October 21. In Karnataka, which has been witnessing the monsoon fury for the past few days, many villages in Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Vijayapura and Raichur districts were either completely or partially submerged due to floods caused by heavy rains last week, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said. He would undertake an aerial survey of the affected areas on October 21. According to the Karnataka Disaster Management Authority (KDMA), a total of 20,269 people, including 15,078 in badly-hit Kalaburgi, have been evacuated so far by the personnel of the Army, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) besides local police and district authorities. There was no loss to human lives anywhere in the flood- hit areas whereas two cattle died in Vijayapura, KDMA Commissioner Manoj Rajan said. "Two NDRF, one SDRF and one Army column have been deployed in Kalaburagi while two Indian Air Force helicopters are on standby. Similarly, the NDRF and the Army personnel are deployed in other three districts. Situation is under control," Rajan told PTI. Yediyurappa said the floods have also resulted in damage to the crops. Officials said river Bhima continued to remain in spate in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Yadgir districts while the surging Krishna river affected villages in Raichur. Bhima, the major tributary of Krishna, has been in spate for the past one week due to heavy rains in neighbouring Maharashtra and in parts of Karnataka. The river was flowing 4.45 metres above the danger level and 1.61 metres above its previous Highest Flood Level, the Central Water Commission in an update said. Expressing solidarity with the flood-hit people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the state of cooperation from the Centre. This is the third time Karnataka has been hit by floods in the past three months following heavy monsoon rains.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/flood-situation-grim-in-parts-of-telangana-karnataka-903928.html

The HC will be considering Sivasankar's anticipatory bail pleas on October 23. The Customs and the ED would be filing counter-affidavits. The major contention of Sivasankar was that he was fully cooperating with the investigation agencies and had already appeared for 90 hours of quizzing with frequent long-distance traveling for quizzing affecting his health.

19-10-2020||South||Kerala HC dismisses govt's plea against lease of Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani Enterprises||In a setback to the LDF government in the state, the Kerala High Court here on Monday dismissed pleas challenging the Centre's decision to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to Adani Enterprises, holding that there was no valid ground to interfere with the policy decision. A division bench comprising Justices K Vinod Chandran and C S Dias rejected arguments by the state government and other petitioners against the Centre's move to lease out the airport to Adani Enterprises through public private partnership (PPP) for a period of 50 years. Referring to the unsuccessful bid by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), the nominee of the state, under the Request For Proposal (RFP) (tender document) for the airport project, it said the petitions challenging the lease decision was a classic example of sour grapes. "We conclude that there is absolutely no valid ground to cause interference to the proceedings challenged in the batch of writ petitions. As is discernible from the averments in the writ petitions, the challenge is against privatisation which is the declared policy of the Union Government," it said. With respect to airports, it was Public-Private participation which has been statutorily declared by incorporation of Section 12A to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) Act, it noted. "There is no challenge to the statutory provision. Interference to a policy framed by the elected government is trite, is difficult, and the feeble challenge raised herein against the policy is devoid of merit", the court said. "The bid failed and both (the state and KSIDC) have now turned against the very RFP under which they participated, with an edge over others... the case set up by them, according to us, is a classic example of the proverbial sour grapes," the bench said in its order. It dismissed the batch of petitions filed by the state government, the KSIDC and a host of others challenging the Centre's decision. The Adani Enterprises had won the rights to run six airports -- Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Guwahati -- through the PPP model after a competitive bidding process in February, 2019. The Union Cabinet had on August 19 this year gave its approval to lease out the Thiruvananthapuram airport, triggering opposition from the LDF government and political parties in the state barring the BJP. The state government had moved the high court last year itself against the privatisation of the airport, but the petition was dismissed by the latter. After the government filed an appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the high court verdict and the matter was remanded back to it for a decision on merits. Following the union cabinet approval, the state government had filed an application in the high court on August 21, seeking a stay on all further proceedings in relation to the grant of lease of the airport to Adani Enterprises till disposal of the main petition. During the hearing, the counsel for the Kerala government had argued that the RFP was in violation of and completely contrary to the scheme of the AAI Act. Opposing the Centre's decision the state government had alleged the RFP was tailor made to suite Adani and revenue from the airport would be used for development of other airports which is against the scheme of the AAI Act. Rejecting the state government's allegations, the counsel for the Central government had said the argument that levying passenger fee from Thiruvananthapuaram Airport and utilising it for development of other airports was not factually and legally correct. He had also submitted that Section 22A of the AAI Act speaks about only development fee. It is specifically stated in the Draft Concession Agreement that the Concessionaire is not entitled to levy any development fee from the passengers. On the contrary, as per Section 24, the authority has the power to utilise its funds. The Centre had also said the state government did not qualify in the bidding process that was carried out in a "transparent manner".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-hc-dismisses-govts-plea-against-lease-of-thiruvananthapuram-airport-to-adani-enterprises-904100.html
19-10-2020||South||How gold smuggling accused helped Kerala's prestigious IT project||SmartCity Kochi, a much-hyped IT infrastructure project at Kochi in Kerala with majority investment by UAE's Dubai Holding's affiliate firm, seems to have come out of a stalemate in 2017 following the intervention of gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh. In his statement to the Customs as part of the gold smuggling case probe, Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar said that Swapna, who earlier served as secretary to UAE consul general, made an effective intervention in resolving a stalemate over the SmartCity Kochi project. It may be recalled that in 2017, the SmartCity Kochi project, with 84 per cent shares by Dubai Holding's affiliate entity and 16 per cent by Kerala government, reportedly faced uncertainty owing to organisational restructuring in Dubai Holdings. Tecom Investments, a subsidiary of Dubai Holdings, was initially holding the 84 percent shares. There were reports that following the restructuring of Dubai Holdings, Tecom Investments was being abolished and its shares with SmartCity Kochi was transferred to Dubai Holdings and Dubai Holdings may pull out from the SmartCity Kochi project owing to inordinate delay in commissioning. However, the issues were later sorted out in further talks between the Kerala government and Dubai Holdings and the current Left-front government in Kerala is highlighting the commissioning of the first phase of the project as a major achievement. In his statement given to Customs, a copy of which was accessed by DH, Sivasankar said that he had interacted with Swapna seeking the intervention of the UAE government in resolving the stalemate in the Smart City project. This intervention was sort of effective in bringing Dubai Holdings to the negotiation table.

The rain on October 13 is said to be the highest single-day precipitation since the 43 cm rainfall recorded on September 28, 1908, in the city. Several areas in and around Hyderabad recorded up to 32 cm rainfall last Tuesday. While the city receives about 80 cm rainfall on average every year, officials said it crossed 120 cm already this year. In 1916, 140 cm rainfall was recorded. Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao, who faced the press after almost a week since the deluge, described it as a once in a century event. The extremely heavy rains have breached the embankments of three lakes in the city—Gurramcheruvu, Pallecheruvu and Appa Cheruvu—resulting in massive flooding in adjoining localities, especially in the old city. “Thirty-three people have lost their lives, unfortunately. Since more rains are predicted this week, our immediate focus is to save lives. I appeal to people in the inundated areas to cooperate with the officials and move to the relief centres,” Rao said on Monday. With floodwaters not receding from the 3-4 feet level in several colonies, the Telangana government has sought 32 boats from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to support the 18-boat fleet with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. The damage to Hyderabad’s civic infrastructure like roads, drains etc., is estimated to be Rs 670 crore. The minister claimed that Rs 60 crore was spent already on the flood relief works in the city and that the Rs 5 lakh compensation per each of the deceased was handed to 29 families already. Meanwhile, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has announced Rs 10,000 immediate relief for the families affected by the floods, to be distributed from Tuesday. He also announced Rs 1 lakh for those whose houses are completely destroyed and Rs 50,000 for the partially damaged. Towards helping the affected, especially the poor, the government is releasing Rs 550 crore immediately to the municipal administration department, the chief minister announced. “Hyderabad has experienced heavy rains it has not experienced in the past 100 years. The poor living in the low-lying slums have suffered a lot,” Rao said. Rao also thanked his Tamil Nadu counterpart Edappadi K Palaniswami for announcing Rs 10 crore aid to Telangana, which pegged its losses at Rs 5,000 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/heaviest-downpour-in-over-a-century-claims-70-lives-across-telangana-904139.html

Dr Mohammed Asheel, executive director of Kerala Social Security Mission, who has been playing a key role in Kerala's fight against Covid-19, made the post criticising Harsh Vardhan. Dr Asheel also faced severe backlash on social media against his post. During his weekly interaction on Sunday, Vardhan said that Kerala was paying the price for gross negligence during the Onam festival and this should be a lesson for all states. With Vardhan's remarks being widely reported, Dr Asheel made a social media post accusing the minister of playing politics. He said that a politician can say anything but a minister should speak only after learning things. This did not go down well with many social media users and Dr Asheel faced severe criticism. Many even cited the medical qualifications of Vardhan. In the meantime, Kerala Health Minster K K Shailaja clarified that she spoke to Vardhan who clarified that he was just replying to a question during the interaction and was alerting other states as festivals were approaching. Later, Dr Asheel withdrew his post after Kerala's Health Minister directed him to do so citing the Union Minister's clarification. The Union Minister also told the Kerala Health Minister that he would clarify his statement in the next weekly interaction. "Being one of the health workers in Kerala who have been relentlessly trying to resist Covid-19 infections over the last several months and keeping death rates and many other key parameters at the lowest levels, the minister's remarks on Kerala pained me too," said Dr. Asheel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-doctor-withdraws-critical-post-against-harsh-vardhan-904187.html

The sisters lost all their relatives in the landslide at Kavalappara last year. Gandhi who came across the plight of the sisters had initiated constructing a house for the two. He reached Kerala on Monday on a three-day tour to his constituency Wayanad and handed over the key of the house to the sisters. Rahul who reached the Kozhikode airport attended a Covid-19 review meeting at Malappuram district. Part of the district also comes under his constituency Wayanad. There were no major receptions Owing to Covid-19. Restrictions were imposed on people meeting him. Rahul is camping at Wayanad for two days and will attend a review meeting at Wayanad Collectorate on Tuesday. He will visit a Covid-19 hospital in the district on Wednesday, accompanied by senior Congress leaders. While Wayanad district is effectively resisting Covid-19 cases with only 1191 active cases now, Malappuram is one of the worst-hit districts with 10,398 active cases. Gandhi was criticised to be not giving attention to Wayanad. Though he was scheduled to participate in a virtual inauguration of a school building in the district last week, the district collector denied permission to the event at the last minute citing that permission of the departments concerned was not obtained. Congress had accused of political interventions in cancelling the event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sisters-orphaned-in-kerala-landslide-get-home-from-congress-leader-rahul-gandhi-904258.html
19-10-2020||South||Politics over NEET returns, all eyes on Governor now||The politics over National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) was back at the center-stage in Tamil Nadu. All eyes are now on Governor Banwarilal Purohit as he is sitting on legislation passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly granting a 7.5 per cent reservation to government school students who clear NEET to get into medical admissions. The Bill was passed on September 15 by the Assembly, but the Governor is yet to give his assent despite Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Health Minister C Vijayabhaskar, and Law Minister C Ve Shanmugham clarifying the doubts raised by him. The issue has now taken a political turn with Opposition parties questioning the “inordinate” delay in the Governor giving his seal of approval. DMK, AMMK run by AIADMK rebel T T V Dhinakaran, PMK, and other political parties have appealed to Purohit to take a decision at the earliest as NEET results have already been released. They also sought to know how Palaniswami was “maintaining silence” on the issue. “The Governor not giving his assent to the Bill passed by the Assembly and the Chief Minister maintaining silence is a betrayal of the interests of students. Is the Governor-Chief Minister alliance trying to put it in cold storage like the Bills that sought state-specific exemption from NEET for Tamil Nadu?”, Stalin asked. The Centre had in 2017 rejected two state-specific Bills passed by the Assembly seeking exemption. The move to provide reservation was taken after the number of government school students getting into medical colleges witnessed a massive dip in the past few years after the introduction of NEET. The 7.5 per cent reservation would ensure that at least 300 government school students get into medical colleges every year after clearing NEET. Dhinakaran said that the actions by the Governor and the Chief Minister rose doubts on whether the government was trying to cheat the students yet again. “The government informing the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that it will conduct medical counseling only after the Governor's assent shows its helplessness,” he said. On his part, Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said that it was the “constitutional obligation” of the Governor to give his assent to the Bill. “We are hopeful that the Governor will do his duty as enshrined in the Constitution,” Jayakumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/politics-over-neet-returns-all-eyes-on-governor-now-904260.html

Reddy covered Nandigama, Avanigadda, Penamaluru, Mylavaram and Tadikonda constituencies to examine the extent of damage especially of  crops, due to the heavy rains and the Krishna floods from upstream. In a letter to the centre on Saturday, CM Reddy has pegged the losses suffered by the state at Rs 4500 crore and sought an immediate relief of Rs 1000 crore. At least 14 people were dead due to the rains and floods in AP. He requested the Home Minister Amit Shah to send a central team to estimate the damage. After the aerial survey, the Chief Minister instructed officials to identify the people who lost crops, houses, and cattle due to the floods in all the districts and compensate them immediately. According to the minister for agriculture Kurasala Kannababu, primary estimates show that crops in 1,07,797 hectares were damaged in nine districts. Horticulture crops damaged in 13,563 hectares and pisciculture in 2,974 hectares. 478 boats belonging to fishermen were also damaged.

This is probably the first time in decades that the leader of the principal opposition party has visited the chief minister at his residence. Leaders of ruling and Opposition parties visiting each other’s residence in times of grief and joy may be common in other states, but it is a rare sight in Tamil Nadu, whose politics has been completely driven by personal hostility for over three decades. The state's political veterans like Periyar and Rajaji shared good personal rapport though their ideologies were diametrically opposite to each other. K Kamaraj and C N Annadurai too enjoyed good relations though they fought each other politically. DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi and AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran did maintain "political decency" though they turned politics foes after being friends for decades and used harsh words for the other in their speeches. The political courtesy, which was part of the Tamil culture, took a major hit after J Jayalalithaa began to dominate the political scene along with Karunanidhi in the late 1980s. Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi never saw eye-to-eye and had a hatred for the other, which had a trickle-down effect with cadres. Leaders of DMK and AIADMK treated the other as "enemies" vitiating the political atmosphere and culture. Even while regretting that “political culture” in the state had plunged low, the two leaders had blamed the other. "It is a great gesture and a healthy move. Stalin has weaned away from the animosity-driven politics that Tamil Nadu had been used to for the past few decades. Stalin visiting the chief minister at his residence is alien to hitherto practised political conduct in Tamil Nadu. Hopefully, this heralds a new political culture in Tamil Nadu," senior journalist R Bhagwan Singh told DH. He added: "The new culture, which is visible in other parts of the country, will percolate down the line which will be good for the state in general if it continues. Stalin and AIADMK leaders should ensure that the basic courtesy and decency stay course whatever differences might emerge between them politically particularly during election times." And the first step towards ending the animosity and extending the olive branch in recent years came from none other than Stalin, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of Jayalalithaa in May 2016. He had also attended the swearing-in ceremony of Jayalalithaa in 2001. And when the former chief minister was hospitalised, Stalin drove to Apollo Hospitals and enquired about her health from V K Sasikala, the late Jayalalithaa's long-time aide. He also led the DMK delegation to pay respects for Jayalalithaa when she died. From the AIADMK side, it was Sasikala who put an end to the animosity by deputing senior leaders to visit Kauvery Hospital to enquire about Karunanidhi's health in 2016.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/stalin-visits-tamil-nadu-cm-edappadi-k-palaniswami-pays-respects-to-his-mother-904320.html

The decision was taken at a recent meeting chaired by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, where the advocate general, additional chief secretary (home), state and city police chiefs, RBI regional director, and banks discussed ways to prevent such crimes. Earlier, banks demanded an FIR to freeze the account of the receiver, but if the new system is implemented, the victim can send an SMS or WhatsApp message, phone call or email to the banks about the fraud, who will initiate quick action and stop the money from being withdrawn. Police officers noted that soon after a fraud is committed, the next one hour is considered as the golden hour to stop the damage. This can be done by stopping the fund flow by reporting the fraud to the bank/law enforcing agency. DG&IG Praveen Sood said Karnataka police was formulating a process in which the victims can report the scam either through phone call, SMS or email. A unique number is generated, which would be considered equal to an FIR number. He suggested that banks consider this unique number and temporarily freeze the account of fraudsters and prevent further damage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-mulls-golden-hour-intervention-to-get-the-better-of-cybercriminals-903939.html

About 28,637 people took shelter in 162 relief centres opened across the district.  Deputy Commissioner V V Jyothsna visited several affected places in Afzalpurtaluk. Floodwater entered into the houses located ear the riverbank in Saradagi (B), Firozabad in Kalaburagi taluk, Rasanagi, Handanur and Harawal villages in Jewargi taluk and the residents have been shifted relief centres. Some have taken shelter at their relatives’ houses. The people, who are taking shelter in the relief centres for the past two days, brought their belongings from their houses by using a coracle. A total of 157 villages in six taluks of the district are facing the flood threat and initially, 27,378 people from 73 villages have been shifted to safer places with the help from the teams of NDRF, Fire and Emergency Services Department, home guards personnel, swimmers and divers called in from other places. Two helicopters, kept standby, are yet to be utilised for the rescue operation. As water entered into Kona Hipparaga village in Jewaargi taluk, the NDRF team and Army’s jawans rescued the residents and shifted them to relief centre at Koodi village. The rain, which gave a break for the past two-three days, lashed Kalaburagi city and parts of Jewargi taluk. Meanwhile, the people are leaving their homes in fear because of fluctuation in water release from barrages and reservoirs. Though flood subsided a little in Afzalpur taluk, the situation continued to be grim in Kalaburagi, Jewargi, Chittapur and Shahabad taluks. Some cattle were seen swimming to the riverbank. Bhagyavanti temple at Mahur village has submerged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/rains-resume-flood-continues-to-ravage-kalaburagi-district-904333.html

So, we can try to amplify the candidates’ campaigns digitally. We’re trying to see how much organic reach we can get for our candidates and well within the sphere of influence of Rajarajeshwarinagar and Bengaluru,” Kharge said, adding that the party is also engaged in countering the BJP’s narratives on social media.  The BJP is banking on its cadre of saffron stormtroopers to drum up support for its candidates in Rajarajeshwarinagar and Sira.  “In every booth, we’re reaching out to voters through WhatsApp groups. Let’s say, if one booth has 1,000 voters, we will have at least five WhatsApp groups. In a constituency like Sira, WhatsApp groups are formed for every gram panchayat,” BJP Yuva Morcha state president Dr Sandeep Kumar said, adding that the party also planned to set up call centres.  The BJP is also counting on its Page Pramukh concept. “Each page will have 60-70 votes and we’re contacting them over the phone or a home visit,” Kumar said. “In Rajarajeshwarinagar, there are nine wards. Each ward has a state-level and district-level office-bearer appointed to work with the chiefs of the shakti kendra, mandal and booth,” he explained.  On Facebook, the BJP is looking to make “as many things viral as possible,” Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-bypolls-cong-tries-data-play-bjp-on-booth-level-outreach-904336.html

Delivering the centenary convocation address of the University of Mysore (UoM) online, from New Delhi, he said the youth should spend some time for themselves to introspect and to explore their talents and strengths. “The youth can chart their own path, by observing their environment, to achieve in their own capacities. An individual’s progress is not just one’s own progress, but of the nation. If each individual becomes Atmanirbhar, the nation becomes Atmanirbhar,” the prime minister said. Elaborating on the National Education Policy 2020, he called upon the institutions to blend global technology and contemporary issues with local culture to find solutions for social issues. Recalling the first convocation, held on the corresponding day, 102 years ago, on October 19, 1919, Modi said, the Chancellor and maharaja of Mysuru Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar had expressed that he would have been happy, if not one, but at least 10 girls had received their degree certificates. “Since then, there has been a lot of improvement in gender equality. Over the years, in the UoM, more girls, than boys, have been graduating. Even in the IITs, enrolment of girls was just 8% in 2016. Now, it has increased to 20%. In overall enrolment in education, the ratio has tilted positively towards girls,” he said. Noting that ‘Shiksha’ and ‘Deeksha’ are the two significant phases in the life of students, Modi said the youth should take an oath to serve the society and nation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-india-a-land-of-opportunities-for-youth-pm-modi-said-in-his-uom-convocation-speech-904337.html

Under the proposal, power supply to various parts of the states by three of the five discoms under Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd would have been privatised. The move was floated by the Ministry of Power last year which suggested several franchisee models to be adopted by states while offering the escoms for privatisation. As part of the reforms announced to boost the Covid-19-hit economy, the Centre had sent a proposal to the state government on September 20, with draft standard bidding documents for privatising power supply of Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company, Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Company and Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company. The three were among the 34 discoms identified by the Centre in September after discoms of Union Territories were privatised earlier in May. While October 5 was the last date for submitting responses to the Centre’s proposal, sources said Karnataka sought an additional week to submit its reply. Karnataka maintained that its discoms were in good fiscal shape and did not require privatisation. The government, however, left its options open saying it would reconsider the proposal based on whether the model succeeded in Union Territories. “We have sent a detailed response to the Centre saying that it was not required immediately,” Mahendra Jain, Additional Chief Secretary, Energy Department, told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/discoms-need-not-go-private-now-karnataka-government-tells-centre-903938.html

The petition said such orders violate the right to privacy and other fundamental rights. The counsel appearing for the Union government said that orders issued by the National Executive Council make it clear that downloading of the application was not mandatory to avail of any services. However, the advocate appearing for the petitioner contended that despite such an order, several circulars had been issued making it mandatory.  “We must clarify that in the absence of any legislation, neither the state government nor the central government and its agencies or instrumentalities can deny any benefit to a citizen only on the ground that he has not installed Aarogya Setu application on his cell phone,” the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-can-t-deny-any-benefit-for-not-installing-aarogya-setu-app-says-high-court-904305.html

The students are presently attending online classes.  Degree colleges and universities will function on second and fourth Saturdays, which were earlier holidays. The system will be changed at least for the next two years. According to highly placed sources in the department, the academic calendar framed by a committee of sitting vice chancellors made a recommendation in this regard. “If necessary, the classes will be conducted even on Sundays,” said a senior department official. “To recover the 90 active academic days per semester, it is necessary to conduct classes on six-day week basis,” said the VC of one of the state-run universities who was in the committee. Officials from the department said that they will convene a meeting by next week to finalise the standard operating procedure (SOP). “There should be one common SOP for all universities. Later, universities can frame their own SOP, keeping that as the basis,” the official said. The universities are planning to conduct classes in a phased manner and also based on priority. “It is better to conduct classes department wise. For instance, first three days for arts stream and next three days for science and commerce stream. This will help maintain social distancing on the campus,” said Prof T D Kemparaju, VC of Bengaluru North University. At hostels “We will conduct health check-up for all students in hostels and also those who work in the hostel kitchens,” said the VC of another university. “At the hostels, we will need to accommodate one student per room. Earlier, three students used be accommodated in a room,” another VC told DH.

The ghastly incident involving the minors was reported from the Borkheda village in Raver. The victims – from the Bhilala family - were identified as Sangita (13), Rahul (11), Anil (8) and Suman (6) – and all were hacked to death by an axe. The girl is suspected to have been sexually assaulted. The incident was reported on Friday when their parents – Maytab Bhilala and his wife Rumali, their elder son Sanjay (16) - had gone to Khargone district in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh for the tenth-day ritual of a relative. Their bodies were recovered from a room in a banana farm, Raver police said, adding that three suspects have been arrested. A local farmer spotted the bodies in a pool of blood and informed the police. Over the weekend, Maharashtra’s Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Minister of Water Supply and Sanitation and Jalgaon Rural MLA Gulabrao Patil visited the village and pacified the local Adivasi population, who were demanding immediate action. “The police are investigating the matter and the trial would be held in a fast-track court,” Deshmukh said. “This is an extremely tragic incident and the culprit must be given the strictest punishment,” said Patil. Immediately, he appointed advocate Ujjwal Nikam as the Special Public Prosecutor. Incidentally, Nikam, who had handled several high-profile cases, hails from Jalgaon. “What has happened is shocking,” said Deshmukh. Nashik Range’s Special Inspector General of Police Pratap Dighavkar, Jalgaon Collector Abhijeet Raut and Superintendent of Police Praveen Mundhe too visited the village and have formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the incident. Assistant Superintendent of Police Kumar Chintha would head the probe panel. Veteran BJP leader Eknath Khadse, his daughter and Jalgaon MP Raksha Khadse, MLAs Shirish Chaudhary and Anil Patil visited the village and spoke to them. The victims are from the Pawara community that is part of the larger Bhil community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/killing-of-four-kids-of-family-shocks-raver-903973.html

Pawar, who is on a tour of the Marathwada region to review the flood situation, told reporters in Osmanabad that a state government cannot do anything alone in a crisis of such magnitude. Last week, heavy rains and floods claimed at least 48 lives in Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions, while crops on lakhs of hectares were damaged. As per official information, till Friday, as many as 40,036 people were shifted to safer places in four districts, including over 32,500 in Solapur and over 6,000 in Pune. "The state has no option but to take loan to help the flood-affected people. The state is facing a historic economic crisis. I will meet the chief minister to discuss the issue," Pawar said. Osmanabad,Latur, Solpaur, Nanded and Pandharpur (in Solapur) were among the worst-affected places, the former Union agriculture minister said, adding that crops like soyabean and sugarcane were damaged. Asked why Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was not touring the state, Pawar, whose party is a coalition partner in the Maharashtra government, said, "I requested Thackeray to be at one place to do the planning. The administration needs to take decisions by doing proper planning." He said farmers were facing problems with conditions (imposed by banks) for availing crop loan, and land was also destroyed due to floods. Asked about BJP's criticism that the state government was looking at the Centre for help and not doing anything, Pawar said, "(Former prime minister) Vajpayee did not see party affiliations when he appointed me head of the disaster management authority because of the work done during the Latur earthquake (in 19923)." "During a crisis, state and central governments work together. A state government cannot do anything alone in a crisis of such magnitude," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-will-have-to-take-loan-to-help-flood-hit-people-sharad-pawar-904007.html

Talking to reporters in Osmanabad district,Pawar said Union Home Minister Amit Shah has also said that certain use of words could have been avoided in the letter. "Anyone with self-respect will not continue in the post. Who are we to make any demand," Pawar said. "After the Union home minister's statement expressing disappointment over language in the letter, anybody with self- respect will take a call on whether to continue in the post or not," he added. Koshyari recently wrote to Thackeray on reopening places of worship in the state and asked if the Shiv Sena president had "suddenly turned secular," triggering a war of words between the governor and the chief minister. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday told a news channel that "Koshyari could have chosen his words better". Asked about speculations that senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse may join the NCP, Pawar said Khadse was earlier the leader of opposition and played a huge role in building the BJP in the state. "He would criticise us and we would take note of it," the NCP chief said. "One is bound to feel disturbed if his contributions and hard work are not taken note of. He may think why shouldn't he shift to a party which appreciates his work," he said. Khadse has been sulking since he was made to resign as a minister in the then BJP government in 2016 on allegations of corruption.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pawar-targets-maharashtra-governor-koshyari-over-his-letter-to-cm-904022.html

Meanwhile, Pawar is expected to meet Modi in the next few days. Pawar said that the state is left with no option but to borrow. "The state has no option but to take loans to help the flood-affected people. The state is facing a historic economic crisis. I will meet the chief minister to discuss the issue," Pawar said. Asked about the BJP's criticism that the state government was looking at the Centre for help and not doing anything, Pawar said, "(Former Prime Minister) Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not see party affiliations when he appointed me the head of the disaster management authority because of the work done during the Latur earthquake (in 1923)."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/uddhav-thackeray-devendra-fadnavis-visit-flood-hit-areas-in-maharashtra-904031.html

A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, which assembled during the Dusshera vacation of the apex court to hear the matter, said the decision will have to be taken on the basis of ground situation. The bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, asked the gurudwara management to file a representation in this regard with the SDMA by Tuesday. The gurudwara management board can move the Bombay High Court if it is not satisfied with the decision of the SDMA, it said. The top court was hearing a plea by ‘Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Board’ seeking permission to carry out the customary procession on account of the 300-year old event -- 'Dusshera, Takht Isnan, Deepmala and Gurta Gaddi’ --with certain conditions. The plea has said that “Gurudwara Takhat Shri Hazur Abchalnagar is a pious place of world fame for being the last place of tenth Sikh Guru Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji Maharaj, where he granted holy seat of Guru to the Gurugranth Sahiv ji before going to Sachkhand”. The Maharashtra government has told the apex court that allowing the Nanded gurudwara to hold Dusshera procession as per custom will not be a "practically feasible option” amid Covid-19 and the state has taken a conscious decision of not allowing religious functions to check the spread of virus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/supreme-court-seeks-maharashtra-sdmas-decision-on-nanded-gurudwara-dussehra-procession-904061.html
19-10-2020||West||TRP case: Issue summons to Arnab Goswami before arraignment, says Bombay High Court||The Bombay High Court on Monday said if the Mumbai police crime branch proposes to arraign Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in the television rating points (TRP) case, it should first issue summons to him as was done for eight others in the case. A division bench of justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik said if such a summons is issued then Goswami shall appear before the police and cooperate with the investigation. The court also directed police to submit for its perusal investigation papers pertaining to the case in a sealed cover by November 5 when it would hear the matter. "The FIR is not an encyclopedia. We would like to peruse the investigation papers and see what probe has been done from today till the next date of hearing," the court said. The court was hearing a petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic TV, and Goswami seeking to quash the FIR lodged on October 6. The petition has also sought a direction to transfer the case to CBI to ensure a fair and transparent probe and also on the ground that the case will have pan-India repercussions. The plea said the HC should stay the investigation and restrain police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners pending hearing of their petition. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Harish Salve sought the court to grant Goswami protection from arrest. "The police have been targeting him (Goswami) and there is apprehension that he may be arrested," Salve said. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Maharashtra government and police, said since Goswami has not been named as accused in the case as of now, there cannot be any order granting him protection. Sibal said till now police have issued summons to eight persons in connection with the TRP case and questioned them. "None of these persons has been arrested," he said. The bench noted that since Goswami has not been named as an accused in the case, it cannot pass an order granting him protection or directing the police to not take any coercive action against him. "In case the Investigating Officer proposes to name petitioner No 2 (Goswami) as accused in the case, then, as done with the eight persons, summons shall be issued to him (Goswami). The petitioner No 2 shall then cooperate with the police," the court said. The court also raised questions on whether it was correct on the part of the Mumbai police and its commissioner Param Bir Singh to hold press conferences in such matters. "We don't know if it is the correct method or procedure to give interviews to the media. We are not talking about just this matter but many sensitive cases...we find police giving information to the media even when investigation is in progress. Police are not supposed to reveal incriminating information pertaining to the case," Justice Shinde said. Sibal, while agreeing to this, assured the court that the police shall not speak to the media with regard to the TRP scam case. "But at the same time, even the petitioner channel should assure the court it will not indulge in vilification of the police and conduct a media trial," he said. To this, Justice Shinde said, "Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy and, hence, they too need to behave responsibly." Salve, while seeking for the FIR to be quashed, argued that no offence is made out and the entire conduct of the police reeks of malafide and was only an attempt to silence the voice of the petitioners. "The petitioner has been targeted by the police and the Maharashtra government since his strong reports during the Palghar lynching incident. A slew of FIRs has been registered against him after his reports then. This whole thing is a disguise and excuse to target Goswami and Republic TV," Salve said. Sibal, however, said the Palghar lynching incident and the petitioners' reports on the same have nothing to do with the present case. "The present investigation pertains to money paid to rig TRPs in order to gain commercial profit. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Maybe many other media channels are also involved," Sibal told the court. The TV channel filed the plea in HC on October 16, a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a plea filed by one of its senior officials challenging the summons issued to them by the Mumbai police. "The officers and key managerial persons of the channel and Arnab Goswami have reasonable and tangible grounds to believe they will be apprehended by the Mumbai police in connection with the FIR which is false, frivolous, politically motivated and an attempt to muzzle the media and silence the news reporting by Republic TV," the petition said. The Mumbai Crime Branch registered the FIR under various sections of Indian Penal Code for cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against Republic TV and its senior officials and also against two other local regional channels. The plea also said the court should initiate a CBI inquiry and disciplinary proceedings under the service rules against Param Bir Singh for "gross dereliction of duty and abuse of power".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/trp-case-issue-summons-to-arnab-goswami-before-arraignment-says-bombay-high-court-904109.html

The state Home minister on Monday held a special camp in Nagpur for redressal of complaints of citizens against criminals and land mafias. He said the project has been started on a pilot basis in Nagpur and will be extended to other cities of the state. During the camp, Deshmukh along with Nagpur Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar, and other senior police and revenue officials heard 50 complaints related to anti-social elements and land mafia.

Talking to reporters in Solapur district after touring some flood-affected villages there, Thackeray said he was in constant touch with local authorities since the heavy rains began because of the retreating monsoon last week. Heavy rains and floods last week claimed at least 48 lives in Pune, Aurangabad and Konkan divisions, while crops on lakhs of hectares were damaged. Thackeray said, "The weather bureau has warned there will be more rains in the coming days. I am here to take stock of the situation and panchnama (assessment) is being done." "After the crisis is over, we will extend assistance in whatever way possible. I am not making any announcement now," he said. Earlier in the day, he gave cheques of Rs 4 lakh each to 10 women whose family members died due to the floods, as assistance from the chief minister's relief fund. On the comment of Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis that the state government should stop looking up to the Centre for help, Thackeray asked, "What is wrong in that?" "The Centre is not a foreign government. Its job is to look over the country and the states. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called me on Friday and assured all assistance from the Centre," he said. "There is no need to indulge in politics over flood relief and everyone should come together for the state's welfare," he said. Thackeray said the state government had extended assistance during the cyclone Nisarga (in June this year) and floods in east Vidarbha (in August end and September). He also said he has asked people during his review visit to take care of themselves and instructedthe local administration to ensure there is no loss of life. Thackeray further said he will be touring other flood-affected areas of the state in the next two days. He will go to Osmanabad district on Tuesday to ascertain the damage caused by floods there, as per a release issued by the Chief Minister's Office.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/will-help-flood-hit-people-in-whatever-way-possible-uddhav-904130.html

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said since the NBSA had detailed code of ethics and guidelines that all member channels are expected to adhere to, the same could be given some teeth and made enforceable by the government. "Can we not make a request to the government, that there are guidelines in place so that those guidelines get a stamp and can be enforced?" the bench asked. The question came when senior counsel Arvind Datar and advocate Neela Gokhale, representing the NBSA, told HC that the private body had taken action on several complaints received against news channels. The advocates said that in the past, the NBSA had imposed the maximum fine of Rs one lakh on some news channels for content that breached its guidelines. While all other channels had apologised and paid the fine, the Republic TV had refused to do so, Datar said. "The Republic TV then walked out of the National Broadcasters Association (NBA) and formed its own association, the National Broadcasters Federation," Gokhale said. Datar said taking a cue from previous SC judgements, the NBSA also supported a mechanism of self-regulation for news broadcasters. The NBSA is an independent body set up by the NBA to consider and adjudicate upon complaints about broadcasts. On Datar's arguments on self-regulation and the Republic TV incident, the bench asked what happened if the self-regulatory mechanisms failed and a channel refused to adhere to the guidelines. "When doctors are admitted to a PG course at concessional rates, they have to serve in rural areas. If they cannot fulfil that condition, then the doctors will not be given their certificate. If they refuse the condition, then they are fined heftily," it said. "Why can't you have guidelines like that? This should be the teeth of guidelines," the court said. Datar said in case a channel refused to adhere to the NBSA guidelines or if it refused to pay the fine, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) could step in and take action. He also said that if self-regulation failed then the court, too, had ample power to step in. Datar said the NBSA also felt its guidelines should be made mandatory and their violation should be taken as a ground for granting injunction (against the offending channel). "Otherwise there is no deterrence," he said. However, the NBSA was not in favour of any new statutory body to regulate the media, he said. "We do not want a statutory body over the existing system of self-regulation. The fastest relief is the court's relief. Courts have considered several cases in the past too," Datar said. "I (news broadcasters) do not want the statutory remedy to take away my remedy with the court. I am safer with the court than with a statutory body," he said. The court has been conducting the final hearing on a bunch of public interest litigations seeking that the press, particularly TV news channels, be restrained in their reportage on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The pleas, filed by activists, retired police officers and some private citizens, also opposed the "media trial" conducted in the case by the press. The HC will continue the hearing on Wednesday. It directed Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh to inform the court on the next hearing why the I&B ministry was forwarding the complaints it received to the NBSA? "Have there been instances where channels have been banned by the ministry?" it asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/why-cant-nbsa-guidelines-be-given-more-teeth-bombay-hc-to-centre-904167.html

Kavlekar has filed a complaint with the Cyber Cell of the Goa Police late on Monday, in which he has alleged that his phone was hacked and he was asleep when the message was sent to the Whatsapp group at around 1:20 am on Monday morning. "The message was sent to only this group out of the many WhatsApp groups where I am a member. Also, the time when this message was sent, I was nowhere near the phone and I was fast asleep,” Kavlekar has said in his complaint to the Cyber Cell. Kavlekar said that attempts have been afoot to defame his name and "project a wrong image" of him in the public, while also demanding strong action against those who were up to mischief. "I demand strong action against all such miscreants and unscrupulous individuals who have criminally hacked/tampered with my mobile phone... and uploaded and transmitted obscene material," Kavlekar said in his complaint. Goa Forward, an opposition party, has demanded that Kavlekar be probed for his conduct on the Whatsapp group, which amounts to "outraging the modesty of women". Cyber Cell officials said that an "initial enquiry" was being conducted after which a First Information Report (FIR) would be filed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/porn-clip-from-goa-dy-cms-phone-accidentally-ends-up-on-social-activists-whatsapp-group-904266.html
19-10-2020||West||Metro services resume in Mumbai; ridership low on Day 1||Services on the financial capital's Metro rail began on Monday after remaining shut for nearly seven months due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a tepid response from the passengers. The over 11-km line, which connects Ghatkopar in northeast Mumbai with Versova to the northwest West, is estimated to see a ridership of over 10,000 passengers as of 2030 hours, which pales when compared to the daily ridership of over 4.5 lakh. The Mumbai Metro One is running services for a limited period of time, insisting on social distancing by limiting the number of people carried in a single coach to 260 people during the reopening. The local trains, which act as a feeder to the Metro line and being operated only for the essential service workers, may also have had an impact on the ridership, according to experts. Last week, the government, which is yet to take a call on restarting the local trains for all, gave the nod for services on the access control-enabled Metro line to start from October 15, and the company operating the line decided to start services from Monday after conducting trial runs. While the COVID-19-related protocol is being followed strictly, many commuters had issues with prepaid cards that had expired due to non-usage for over six months, officials said. Such commuters had to get the cards operational by visiting specified counters, they added. Services began at 0830 hours and are expected to shut at 2030 hours, officials said. Usually, the metro line is shut for over five hours only. Over 300 workers had been working on the upkeep of the line and the railway stations through the lockdown period. Over 30 of those had got infected and only four of them are live cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/metro-services-resume-in-mumbai-ridership-low-on-day-1-904322.html

He also congratulated the state for conducting 77,785 Covid-19 tests per million population against the country's average of 68,901. Interacting with Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitinbhai Patel along with district collectors and health officials of the state and the Centre, Vardhan reiterated that winter months and the long festive season could threaten the gains made against Covid-19. "Active cases are currently around 7,72,000 which has been less than 10 lakh for close to a month. As many as 55,722 cases were reported in a day while 66,399 cases were discharged. Doubling time has been diluted to 86.3 days and the country will soon cross the figure of 10 crore cumulative tests," the health minister was quoted as saying in an official release. About the management of Covid-19 in Gujarat, he noted, "From being one of the top affected states earlier, the state has shown remarkable strides to have a recovery rate of 90.57 per cent compared to the recovery rate of India (88.26 pc)." Gujarat's active case burden now stands at 14,414, out of which 99.4 per cent are stable. Rest 0.6 per cent, comprising 86 people, are on ventilator, Vardhan said. About the upcoming festive season and the winter months, the Union health minister said, "We should all be vigilant for the next three months." "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message of wearing a mask/face cover, maintaining a physical distance and frequent handwashing should reach the last citizen. Steps should be taken to monitor their non-compliance. Following Covid-appropriate behaviour is simple." Vardhan took stock of preventive steps taken in Junagadh and Jamnagar districts which have been reporting a surge in case positivity in the last few weeks, the health ministry said in a statement. About the preparedness for the upcoming festive season, the deputy chief minister said, "Standard Operating Procedures have been issued for carrying out various activities safely. People visiting Ahmedabad by bus are tested outside the city limits and are referred to isolation centres if found Covid-19 positive."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-made-remarkable-strides-in-covid-19-management-harsh-vardhan-904326.html
