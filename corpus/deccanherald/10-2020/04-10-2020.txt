Retail price has shot up to Rs 7 apiece, while branded eggs are sold over Rs 10 per unit, they said. "Consumers, who had shunned poultry products due to the scare of coronavirus earlier, are now consuming eggs to meet their nutritional requirement in the fight against the virus. This has led to a rise in demand," traders in the city said. Retail egg prices had soared by nearly 60 per cent in the last six months from about Rs 4 apiece in April and May, and it has gone up by about 20 per cent in September mainly due to supply shortages, they said. "I am selling eggs at Rs 7 apiece now, while I had sold at Rs 4 per unit in April," a grocery store owner said. Prices of branded eggs in large format stores have increased to over Rs 10 per piece, while brown and other speciality ones are sold at higher prices. "About 25 per cent of birds had been culled before time in the initial months of the lockdown due to disruption in feed supply and labour issues. "Given the shortage in supply, price may rise further and is likely to stay firm at least for another three months," Saguna south Bengal head Balaji R told PTI. About 2.7-2.8 crore eggs are consumed daily in West Bengal, while the per-day production stands at 1.8 crore. Arambagh Hatcheries managing director Prasun Kr Roy said poultry industry has lost around Rs 50,000 crore due to the pandemic. "Both eggs and poultry meat prices are ruling high due to early culling of birds on a large scale. It will take time to normalise production and supply," he said. With hotels and restaurants resuming their operations, demand for eggs has been increasing and will rise further during the festive season, an official of the West Bengal Poultry Federation said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/short-supply-high-demand-push-egg-prices-up-in-bengal-896896.html

A variety of maritime drills and operations were conducted as part of the annual 'Bongosagar' exercise, they said. The first edition of the exercise was held in October last year. On Sunday, the two navies will begin a two-day coordinated patrol in Northern Bay of Bengal. In the 'Bongosagar' exercise, the Indian Navy deployed anti-submarine warfare corvette Kiltan and guided-missile corvette Khukri. The Bangladeshi navy was represented by guided-missile frigate Abu Bakr and guided-missile corvette Prottoy, the officials said. "India and Bangladesh have a close, long-standing relationship, covering a wide spectrum of activities and interactions, which has strengthened over the years," an Indian Navy spokesperson said on Friday. The Indian Navy has participated in a number of joint maritime exercises in the last few weeks including a three-day drill with Japanese navy from September 26-28. Last month, Indian Navy also carried out a two-day mega exercise in the Indian Ocean Region with the Australian Navy that featured a range of complex naval manoeuvres, anti-aircraft drills and helicopter operations. In July, the Indian Navy carried out a military exercise with a US Navy carrier strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship. India has significantly expanded its deployment in the Indian Ocean Region with a plethora of warships and submarines following its border row with China in eastern Ladakh, ostensibly to send across a message to Beijing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-and-bangladeshi-navies-hold-military-drill-896928.html

It may be a two-year wait||An effective vaccine may be the only real protection against Covid-19 as things stand, but don’t pin your hopes on getting it soon. As India’s death toll from Covid crosses one lakh, insights from the scientific community and government officials suggest it could take up to two years from now to get the much-awaited shot. This is not only because the formidable task of delivering the vaccine to over 1.3 billion Indians, in a massive, never-done-before exercise, is one that will test the system at every step, but also because there are several imponderables involved in the process. Here’s a sampler: Once the vaccine gets the needed regulatory approvals by the first half of 2021 — this in itself is a very big ‘if’ — statutory agencies and manufacturing firms have to navigate the minefields of cost per dose, establishment of a cold chain, arranging adequate numbers of trained people to push the needle and ramping up production lines without compromising other vaccines needed for immunisation. “From regulatory approval, it would take a minimum of one year before the vaccine is available to the common man,” K Srinath Reddy, President, Public Health Foundation, said. The first of these steps, picking out the right vaccine for commercial roll out, is an extremely critical one. Any adverse medical reaction would not only give a body blow to people’s faith in the Covid-19 vaccine but would also be counter-productive to existing immunisation schemes. The good news is that there is enough information about potential challenges to the delivery of the vaccine that could alert authorities about what could go wrong and help fix the gap. Crossing the cost hurdle Globally there are more than 180 vaccines under various stages of development in the laboratories while nine have entered the third and most crucial parts of clinical trial. This is remarkable given that traditionally vaccine development takes nearly 15 years. With the pandemic killing more than a million worldwide, the process has been accelerated all over the globe resulting in Phase III clinical trials within 11 months of the disease being reported. Three vaccines are in trial in India and regulatory approvals are being sought for a fourth one. But the first two that are likely to come through are the Oxford University-AstraZeneca-Serum Institute vaccine (ChAdOxnCoV-19) and the Sputnik-V developed by Russia. Assuming that they clear the clinical trials with flying colours, the first hurdle before the government will be to fix a price for the buyer.Last month, Serum Institute of India’s chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla asked whether the government has Rs 80,000 crore in its kitty to pay for the vaccination of all Indians. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that for a population of 138 crore, this roughly translates into Rs 290 for one dose and Rs 580 for a two-dose regimen.  Govt faces hurdles of cost, storage and who to vaccinate first Considering that the company had earlier spoken of delivering the vaccine at a cost of Rs 225 per dose, one would assume that other expenses are included in the Rs 290 price band. While this may be an acceptable price for those in the middle and upper-classes, it may not be a price acceptable to the government, which would have to procure the vaccine for public use. “Rs 290 is not a feasible price for the government programme. Even with a price of (lets say) Rs 40 per dose, the (Indian) government would be needing close to one billion dollars,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, Washington DC. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said he too didn’t agree with Poonawalla’s estimates. The government has created a committee on Covid-19 vaccines that has met five times so far to deliberate on issues related to vaccine procurement, distribution and costs. “We have calculated the amount required in the meetings and currently, that amount is available with the government,” Bhushan said. The X-factor, however, is the chance of a foreign vaccine (like the ones being developed by Moderna or Pfizer) beating the others in the race. “It would be hard negotiations then and the terms and conditions of those negotiations would become important to decide the vaccine’s availability to common Indians,” Reddy said. Planning the who & how of vaccination Once the first challenge is overcome, the government would have to deal with an equally complicated and politically-loaded issue of whom to vaccinate, given that the stock is limited. “The first priority would be doctors, nurses and healthcare workers. It may subsequently be given to older people and those with comorbidities. But with studies showing more than 65% of Covid-19 affected people having a comorbidity, the government needs to start an exercise to identify the people who would receive the vaccine,” said Shahid Jameel, a virologist and Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University. The policy needs to be transparent with all state governments coming on-board, Reddy added. The third hurdle is a huge logistic challenge. While there is a cold chain in place for the polio vaccine, the Covid-19 vaccine simply can not ride piggyback on that for two reasons: First, much more storage space is needed and second the vaccine (depending on the clinical trial outcome obviously) may need a temperature beyond what is provided in a simple refrigerator. Added to this complication is a rule that doesn’t permit ANM and ASHA workers to administer an injection (due to lack of proper training), leading to the key question on the availability of an adequate number of doctors and nurses to vaccinate a billion-plus population. “Its a logistical nightmare and needs a mammoth effort,” said Laxminarayan. Battling unknowns of Covid-19 Even after these challenges are navigated successfully, there is no answer to the final question: How long will the protection last? Will this be an annual vaccine like the flu shots or will the protection remain for a longer period? Experts are divided on this. “Scientific evidence so far suggests that Covid-19 vaccines are unlikely to be efficient for more than a year as the antibodies are not long-lasting enough. But since the T-cell remains, it is possible that in future an infected person may pick up the infection again, but that won’t lead to the disease. But nothing can be said definitely in the absence of a long term study,” Jameel of Ashoka University said. “Since nobody has followed the virus for a long time, there is little data on how long the immunity lasts. It can be five months or five years; no one knows at the moment.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/don-t-pin-hopes-on-a-covid-19-vaccine-it-may-be-a-two-year-wait-896942.html

Ram Vilas Paswan (74), who has been in active politics for more than five decades and is one of the country's most noted Dalit leaders, has been hospitalised for the last few weeks. He was operated upon at a private hospital in the national capital. He has long suffered from a heart condition, and family sources expressed confidence that he will soon return to good health. In a tweet, Chirag Paswan said his father underwent a heart surgery due to sudden developments on Saturday evening, which forced him to cancel a party meeting and rush to his father's side. If needed, the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution will undergo another operation in a few weeks, he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, besides other senior leaders, spoke to Chirag Paswan to enquire about the health of his father, LJP sources said.

Officials familiar with the matter told the publication that the idea was proposed to ensure there is no disruption of key economic activities. If approved, this special quota for Indian companies will be available in an otherwise tightly monitored vaccine programme with limited supplies. According to the government's vaccine priorities, vulnerable population such as health workers, patients with co-morbidities and the elderly will likely be vaccinated first. Sources told the publication that not everyone will be able to get a shot of the vaccine in 2021 and added that the vaccine plan funded by the Central government will cost about Rs 50,000 crore. Earlier in late August, reports stated that the central government is looking at procuring about 50 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine initially. The first round of doses was also said to be prioritised for front-line workers, army personnel and some specific categories of individuals. If the government gives a nod to Indian companies, it will run parallel to the already prioritised vaccine supply chain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-firms-may-be-allowed-to-procure-covid-19-vaccines-for-staff-report-897023.html

With Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar in the driver’s seat, Rahul and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh rode a tractor Badhni Kalan village in Moga district of Punjab and assured the agitating farmers that the Congress would stand by them through thick and thin. Several farmers’ organisations have been protesting the three farm sector laws enacted during the recent Parliament session, apprehending that the “reforms” may sound the death knell for the time-tested minimum support price regime and procurement of food grains through the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee markets. “We are with you and will not step back… the day the Congress comes to power, we will scrap these three black laws and throw them in the waste paper basket,” Rahul told a farmers’ rally in Badhni Kalan village. The former Congress president admitted that there could be flaws in the MSP regime and the APMC system. “But that does not mean you destroy the system as farmers will have no protection left. There is a need to reform the system,” he said. In a scathing attack on the BJP government, Rahul said that a handful of industrialists are eyeing the land and income of farmers, and for them, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is clearing the hurdles. “You remember the puppet shows of the old days, someone pulls the strings from behind. This is not the Modi government. It is the government of Adani and Ambani,” Rahul said. Rahul slammed the Modi government for bringing in the three farm sector laws in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. “What was the hurry? If they wanted to bring the laws, there should have been a detailed discussion in Parliament. If farmers are happy with the laws, then why are they protesting,” Rahul asked. A high-point of the three-day agitation was the presence of former Punjab Minister Navjyot Singh Sidhu, who had quit the government following differences with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-a-puppet-of-adani-ambani-will-scrap-farm-laws-if-elected-to-power-rahul-gandhi-897066.html

Frontline workers including government, private hospital doctors, ASHA workers, hospital staff, etc. The committee is set to finish making the list by the end of October.  *The minister also said that once the vaccine is ready, the government is planning to procure 400-500 million vaccines which would be administered to approximately 20-25 crore people by the end of 2021.  *Addressing concerns of India borrowing money from China-led AIIB to fight coronavirus, Vardhan said that India has borrowed from a number of agencies. States are being supported through budgetary allocations. Moreover, the government is not dependent on loans for emergency Covid-19 response.  *Acquiring the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, is still in deliberations according to the minister. He added that the government’s first priority is to procure a vaccine regardless of its origin.  *He also said that the government will be tracking vaccine consignments in real-time to deter black marketing of vaccines.  *The minister also said that the clinical trials held in India follow a set of rules which has been approved by DCGI, the regulatory body. *Vardhan said that it is not possible to comment on the superiority of the three leading vaccine trials. The government will take a call on which one to acquire on the basis of how fast and efficient they are.  *He suggested seeking a doctor’s advice on consumption of immune boosters, however, he added that maintaining a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables should be a key priority.  *Vardhan reiterated the need to wash hands intermittently, wear masks and maintain social distancing.  *Allaying fears of adverse effects in response to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine trials, Vardhan said that responses such as mild fever, redness, rash and localised pain are common in the case of most vaccines. This doesn’t signify that the vaccine is not working.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/key-takeaways-from-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhans-address-on-covid-19-vaccines-897072.html

He said programmes under Poshan Abhiyan such as the functioning of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), take-home rations and giving pregnant women and children iron folic tablets to prevent anaemia need to be fully implemented again. "We need Poshan Abhiyan back at the same level and beyond than where we were in January (pre-Covid-19 times). It does not require any different response. We need the same programmes... we need ICDS functioning, take-home rations functioning, pregnant women and children receiving iron folic tablets to prevent anaemia," Wagt told PTI. He stressed that all routine services need to get back on track and not any new intervention. According to Wagt, in many cases, there is a need to adjust and look for alternative ways of implementation of different programmes related to nutrition because of the pandemic. "In many cases, we need to adjust. For example, since schools are closed, children need to get the food they used to get in schools. So, we need to look for other ways like take-home rations delivered door-to-door. "There is a need to go to every door that needs it and not a smaller number of people. Iron folic tablets, which are distributed to adolescent girls in schools, can be given to those who need it through communities," he said. There are three pathways on how coronavirus affects nutrition in India. The first is increasing poverty with people losing jobs. Poverty leads to food insecurity and different eating behaviours. The second is how services were affected and the third one is how leadership was affected in these times in terms of focus on nutrition, Wagt said. He said in the past, Poshan Pakwada and Poshan Maah had a key component of bringing a large number of people together in communities, mass gatherings to educate people about good nutrition, but as seen in the last four weeks there were no such gatherings due to the coronavirus infection. "So, more mass media, home visits, home counselling are needed," he said. Poshan Abhiyan was launched by the Centre in 2018 to reduce low birth weight, stunting and undernutrition and anaemia among children, adolescent girls and women. Under the mission, Poshan Maah is observed every September. During Poshan Maah, initiatives are taken to bring a behavioural change towards issues related to maternal, infant and young childcare and feeding practices. Poshan Pakwada is a 14-day event held every year to spread awareness on the importance of nutrition. According to the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), 38.4 per cent children under five years of age are stunted (low height-for-age) and 21 per cent wasted (low weight-for-height). About the impact of missing out on midday meals given to children in schools due to coronavirus, Wagt said many children go to school as they know they will get food there and in many cases, it is one of the most nutritious meals a child gets. "During the lockdown, there have been efforts to bring that food to the doorstep of children. But I am not sure how effective that has been," he said. Asserting that families need to be made adequately aware of the importance of nutrition, Wagt said, "For many people, food is for hunger but people don't realise that eating is to nourish the body and mind, to build the immune system." "I have always been saying that all these government programmes of feeding and nutrition are crucial but for me, it also emphasizes that nutrition is too important to leave it to government. "For me, nutrition is even too personal to leave it to government and it needs to be communities families parents that are also feeding children and at the end of the day the plate in the home is provided by the family," he said. On the importance of breastfeeding even in times of coronavirus pandemic, Wagt said breast milk is the first vaccination provided to a child and the risk of not breastfeeding or poor breastfeeding is much higher than the risk of transmitting Covid-19 to the baby. "There are special proteins, special immune factors in the breast milk that builds the immune system of the baby in the first few days and then in the first six months. So breastfeeding is very essential but people have been afraid of spreading the virus to other people and are asking if they should continue breastfeeding," he advised. There is very little evidence that breastfeeding can transmit the virus. Also, the risk of coronavirus among children doesn't seem to be that high as the risk of not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding must continue even in times of Covid-19 with proper precautions, Wagt stressed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/need-to-bring-back-poshan-abhiyan-at-pre-covid-19-levelssays-unicef-897073.html

However, a notice has been sent to the circus to show cause why its recognition should not be cancelled for alleged violation of the provisions of the Act with regard to maintenance and display of captive elephants, the CZA has told the high court. The submissions were made by the authority in its affidavit filed before a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar in response to PILs by the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Federation of Indian Animals Protection Organisation (FIAPO),  PETA India, represented by advocates Aman Hingorani and Swati Sumby, has claimed in its plea that due to the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant lockdown, circuses are finding it difficult to feed the animals which at various stages of starvation. It has sought a direction to the Centre to immediately notify the Performing Animals (Registration) Amendment Rules of 2018 which expressly prohibit training and exhibition of performing animals in circuses and "mobile entertainment facilities".   FIAPO, which is a group of 100 organisations and works towards the protection of animal rights for over a decade, has challenged the constitutional validity of sections 21 to 27 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act so far as they permit exhibition and training of animals in relation to circus acts. It has contended in the plea that circuses with animals performing tricks often use wild animals, including elephants, hippos, and exotic birds. It has said these animals are very often used without requisite paperwork certifying their fitness and added that on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been numerous reports of animals being stranded as part of these circuses all over the country and being abandoned by their owners.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/great-golden-circus-only-recognised-one-under-wildlife-protection-act-central-zoo-authority-tells-delhi-high-court-897086.html

Tech majors IBM, Wipro and Dell had allegedly flagged certain concerns around the evaluation process. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had floated a tender for contracting a managed services infrastructure provider. Following a technical evaluation of the bids, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was given a score of 98 on 100, higher than those awarded to IBM, TCS and Wipro, a source said. According to another source, a Letter of Intent has been issued to HPE for the project. One of the sources said Wipro, IBM and Dell had reached out to the UIDAI a few months back allegedly raising concerns around the evaluation process. When contacted, Wipro said it does not have any comments on the issue. Dell declined to comment, while IBM did not respond to emailed queries. The UIDAI, in its response to a PTI query, strongly refuted the charges, asserting that the evaluation in the said 'MSIP' Request for Proposal has been done ensuring transparency, fairness and equity in accordance to the CVC guidelines and other applicable rules. "The UIDAI was advised by the CVC 'to take appropriate decision' at its end. Also, CVC declined to interfere in RFP's decision-making process as a matter of policy," the UIDAI said. In a letter dated June 25, Wipro had said it was disappointed with the "quality and the objectivity of the evaluation process" and alleged that the HPE bid had many gaps and shortcomings. It alleged that bidders participated in the tender directly as well as their products were part of other bids, which is not in compliance with CVC rules, and therefore this has rendered the process uncompetitive for those who have strictly followed the RFP requirements. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a system integration partner for HPE. TCS also did not comment on the matter. Dell, in its letter, had highlighted alleged non-compliance of the product positioned by HPE and requested for a meeting on the matter. In a letter dated July 21, 2020, IBM had raised questions about the evaluation of the bidding process for awarding managed services infrastructure provider (MSIP) contract. Subsequently, a legal firm representing UIDAI had responded to IBM saying the allegations levelled were "baseless and completely incorrect" and that it is not obligated to honour any of the "unreasonable and arbitrary demands" made by the company. A HPE spokesperson said the company "respects the decision taken by the UIDAI after extensive RFP evaluation process and we will work towards the successful execution of this critical project of national importance". The UIDAI — in its written response — has said it had published the response to all bidders as part of Corrigendum in third week of February 2020, followed by several meetings with bidders and with their OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) partners to address their concerns and queries. Another corrigendum based on these discussions was issued in the last week of February. "From then till the submission of technical bids, UIDAI didn't receive any further query on CVC guideline from any bidder and no further guidelines were issued by UIDAI in this regard to HPE or to other bidders. All the bidders have responded to the RFP in accordance to the guidelines set out in UIDAI's RFP," it said. The UIDAI said a third-party evaluation was neither envisaged nor required for the RFP, and that there is no legal provision or tradition of third party evaluation in any of the RFP. "All bids were assessed and evaluated as per the defined criteria in the RFP. Wherever any clarity was required, the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) had sought clarifications from the bidders in order to evaluate and complete the assessment thoroughly and fairly," the UIDAI added. The UIDAI outlined the comprehensive process that was involved in technical evaluation and said the compliance to product was verified against the technical specification as specified in UIDAI RFP, and the data sheet of the quoted product was also verified to substantiate the compliance of the requirement. "UIDAI evaluated the product as per its relevancy to UIDAI's RFP and the technical specifications clearly specified in the UIDAI's RFP and was found meeting all the requirements, so approved," the UIDAI added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uidai-body-says-selection-for-msip-fair-transparent-897091.html

The form required to opt for the postal ballot would be delivered at the residence of all those above 80 years of age and people with disabilities by the booth level officer under his polling station. It would be up to these two category of voters to opt for postal ballot "If he/she opts for postal ballot, then the BLO will collect the filled-in form 12-D from the house of the elector within five days of the notification and deposit it with the returning officer forthwith," according to the October 3 letter sent by EC to all state chief electoral officers. These instructions have been issued based on the feedback the poll panel received from civil society and media during its visit to poll-bound Bihar last week. The EC said the fresh instructions would be applicable to all elections and by-elections, including the bypolls announced last week to 56 assembly and one Lok Sabha seat. Bihar is going for a three-phase assembly poll beginning October 28. As per the instructions, the returning officer would deploy polling teams, who will deliver and collect the postal ballot on pre-informed dates and thereafter deposit it with the RO. An official explained that this postal ballot facility is different from the one extended to service voters. Here, those willing to use the facility have to fill up a form. Officials then carry the ballot to the residence of such voters and videograph the voting to ensure transparency.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ec-makes-procedure-to-opt-for-postal-ballot-by-elderly-people-with-disabilities-friendlier-897107.html

About 250 officers in the rank of DGP and IGP from all states, Union Territories and central government will take part in the two-day virtual meeting to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, NSA Ajit Doval among others. The key role played by police during a disaster and pandemic, new-age crimes like cyber terrorism, radicalisation of the youth and the Pakistan-sponsored militants in Jammu and Kashmir will be discussed during the conference, to be held in multiple sessions, a Union Home ministry official told PTI. The conference will be held in the last week of November, the official said. As the role of police during the ongoing pandemic came under wholesome praise from all quarters, the meeting is expected to discuss how to enhance their knowledge and capabilities to handle natural disasters and such health crisis, the official said. The state police chiefs will share their experiences in handling the pandemic and how the police have helped the distressed people and the migrant workers during the nationwide lockdown. The prime minister is likely to make special mention about the exemplary work done by the police personnel while fighting the coronavirus, the official said. According to an estimate, about 75,000 police and paramilitary personnel were infected by coronavirus in the country and about 600 of them succumbed to the virus. Among those infected include about 32,500 paramilitary personnel and 24,000 policemen in Maharashtra, the worst hit state in India. Among the deaths include 100 paramilitary personnel and about 250 in Maharashtra Police, almost all of them while playing different roles during the pandemic. This is for the first time in the history that the annual conference of the DGPs and IGPs, organised by the Intelligence Bureau, will be held virtually and all of them will participate from their respective headquarters, another official said. The role of social media in instigating violence, violence perpetrated by Pakistan-based terrorist groups in Jammu and Kashmir, curbing of blackmoney and narcotics and a few other issues are also expected to be discussed in the meeting. The implementation and activation of decisions taken at previous conferences will also be reviewed during the meeting. The DGPs and IGPs conference is an annual affair where senior police officials of the states and the Centre meet and discuss issues of importance. The Modi government has been organising it outside the national capital since it came to power in 2014. The last conferences have been held in Guwahati, Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, Hyderabad, Tekanpur in Madhya Pradesh and Pune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/for-the-first-time-annual-dgps-igps-meeting-to-be-held-virtually-modi-shah-to-attend-897113.html
04-10-2020||National||UK, India joint operation targets online fraud scams||A recent joint operation against computer software service fraud offences between the UK and Indian security forces has led to raids on 10 suspect offices in six cities of India, according to UK authorities. The City of London Police, the UK's national lead force for fraud, revealed this week that it confirmed people in the UK had been defrauded by these companies to its counterparts in India, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). They provided vital witness statements, detailing the victim's dealings with the companies concerned, evidence which is a key requirement to enable the police in India to take action against fraudulent companies. “We welcome this enforcement action on the part of the Central Bureau of Investigation and will support their efforts to bring offenders to justice through the Indian courts,” said Alex Rothwell, Temporary Detective Chief Superintendent at the City of London Police. “At the time of the lockdown in India, we saw a sharp decline in reports of computer software service fraud in the UK, but we know that criminals adapt quickly to continue to try to defraud people. As more people work from home, the need to prevent fraud of this nature has become more urgent,” he said. The companies are alleged to have displayed pop-up messages on victims' computers warning them about serious technical problems with their device including the presence of malware infection. Victims were then advised to call a helpline to gain assistance and were charged a premium fee for the “fix” and “on-going support”. Victims were then made to pay this fee online or over the phone, meaning their financial details were shared with criminals. On September 17, officers from the CBI conducted raids on 10 premises based on this information across six Indian cities. Some home addresses of people associated with the various companies were also visited. According to the City of London Police, the CBI investigation into the case remains ongoing. The latest operation follows previous joint operations, resulting from a partnership between the City of London Police, American tech giant Microsoft and Indian police forces to tackle such online fraud, which the UK authorities said has led to action against 37 call centers and resulted in 88 arrests. “We are pleased to have been able to support this action taken against criminals defrauding UK citizens and those of other countries. Our ongoing close working relationship with Microsoft and the Indian authorities has led to sustained action against this type of fraud, demonstrating that we can and will seek out criminals wherever they are,” added Rothwell. The police force is warning people to not call phone numbers, or visit websites, mentioned on pop-up messages which indicate there is a problem with your computer and also to be wary of callers, especially cold callers, who claim to be from Microsoft, your telephony provider or internet service provider. “Don’t be afraid to hang up and call the organisation back on a number you have researched yourself. For example, one from the back of a bill or one listed on their official website,” they advise.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uk-india-joint-operation-targets-online-fraud-scams-897122.html

He said priority would be given to health workers engaged in Covid-19 management in getting the vaccine. During an interaction with his social media followers on 'Sunday Samvad' platform, he said a high-level expert group is going into all the aspects of vaccines and the health ministry is preparing a format in which states will submit lists of priority population groups. The list of frontline health workers will include both government as well as private-sector doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers and many other occupational categories who are involved in tracing, testing and treatment of patients. This exercise is targeted to be completed by the end of this October and the states are being closely guided to also submit details about cold chain facilities and other related infrastructure which will be required down to the block level, the minister said. "The Centre is also working on plans for building capacities in human resources, training, supervision and others on a massive scale and roughly estimates to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses covering approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021. All this is under various stages of finalisation," Vardhan said. He further informed his audience that the government is also keeping an eye on immunity data concerning Covid-19 disease while finalising these plans. "Our government is working round the clock to ensure that there is a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready. Our utmost priority is how to ensure a vaccine for each and everybody in the country," Vardhan said. The minister stated that a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul is drawing up the entire process. Vaccine procurement is being done centrally and each consignment will be tracked real-time until delivery to ensure it reaches those who need it most, he said. The Union health minister added the panel is working on understanding the timelines of availability of various vaccines in the country, obtaining commitments from vaccine manufacturers to make available maximum number of doses for India inventory and supply chain management and also on prioritisation of high-risk groups. "This is a work in progress which will be completed by the time the vaccines are ready to ensure the swift roll-out of an immunisation programme." Assuring a social media follower that there would be no diversion or black-marketing of the vaccine, Vardhan said, "Vaccines will be distributed as per pre-decided priority and in a programmed manner. To ensure transparency and accountability, details of the entire process will be shared in the coming months." He stressed on the need to prioritise healthcare workers and adults or those who have underlying health conditions. To a question regarding the phase-three clinical trial of Russia's 'Sputnik-V' vaccine in India, Vardhan clarified that the matter was still under consideration, and no decision has been taken yet. To another question, he replied it is not possible to comment on the superiority of one vaccine over the other, but said, "Even if we have multiple vaccines available, they will all be safe and will elicit the requisite immune response against novel coronavirus." He said that all vaccines that have proven to be safe, immunogenic and efficacious in clinical trials outside India need to undergo bridging studies to prove their safety and immunogenicity in the Indian population as well, although these studies can be conducted with much smaller sample size and end quickly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-estimates-to-utilise-40-50-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-on-20-25-crore-people-by-july-2021-vardhan-897124.html

Now farmers will get new opportunities to sell their produce, which will increase their profits, he said.    The new laws will give the agriculture sector the benefit of modern technology and farmers will be empowered. The minimum support price and government procurement will remain in place, he said.    These new laws will give freedom to farmers for storage and sale of their crops and free them from the clutches of middlemen, he said. Farmers will not be compelled to sell their produce to the licensed traders in mandis anymore and also get freedom from the tax of government mandis, Naqvi said.  The dream of 'One Nation, One Market' will now be fulfilled, he said.    The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is committed to the welfare of villages and farmers of the country, and that their rights will be protected at any cost. Under the 'Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi', more than Rs 92,000 crore has been given to farmers so far, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farm-laws-congress-helping-brokers-middlemen-says-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-897125.html

The incident, which triggered nationwide outrage, not only pitted the 'thakurs' against the 'valmikis' (an SC community) but also divided the local BJP leadership along caste lines. Local intelligence reports have apprehended that the matter may trigger caste clashes if urgent action was not taken. A series of 'panchayats' of the 'Thakur' community were held at several villages near the victim's native village in the district, where the speakers accused the officials of working under the pressure of the media and implicating innocents in the incident. ''All the four youths, who have been arrested, are innocent...the victim's family has been changing their statements....the media is doing false reporting for TRP...the administration is under pressure,'' said former BJP legislator Rajveer Singh, a 'Thakur' himself. Nishant Chauhan, a youth leader of the 'Thakur' community, said that they would not tolerate any attempt to implicate 'innocents' in the matter and would take to streets if needed. Dozens of 'thakur' community members held a demonstration just outside the victim's village to protest the arrest of the four accused in the case. The father of one of the accused alleged that a 'powerful' BJP leader, who hailed from 'Valmiki' community, had exerted pressure on the victim's family to name the 'thakurs' in the case. One of the members of the victim's family said that they were 'scared' after the panchayat. According to the sources, tension prevailed in the nearby 'thakur' dominated villages. Security personnel have been deployed to counter any possible flare-up.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-gang-rape-and-murder-case-acquires-caste-hue-897130.html
04-10-2020||National||Foreshocks, swarms caused recent earthquakes in India: Expert||The recent earthquakes in different parts of India, albeit of small magnitudes, have occurred due to foreshocks and swarms, a top official of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) said, warning that frequent tremors were a matter of concern in the subcontinent, where several areas are prone to major seismic activities. Dr Sandip Som, the deputy director general of GSI, also said that foreshocks -- mild tremor preceding earthquakes -- or swarm activities -- series of earthquakes -- indicate release of tectonic stress and strain during the continuous deformation process, and a detailed study of these jolts could help predict if a significant seismic event is in store. "These minor earthquakes are mainly clustered in the north-eastern and north-western Himalayan region, around the Delhi-National Capital Territory (NCT), western Gujarat and Western Maharashtra areas which have been demarcated as seismic zones IV and V," the geologist told PTI on Sunday. In the past, too, low-magnitude earthquakes have been recorded in these regions, he said. According to the GSI scientist, earthquakes in the north-eastern and north-western Himalayas occur along the plate convergence zones -- between India and Eurasia. "In the Delhi-NCT region, the spatial distribution of seismicity shows seismic activity-concentration mainly in three places -- west of Delhi (near Sonipat), along the Mahendragarh-Dehradun subsurface fault and Delhi Subsurface Ridge," he said. "Similarly, in Western Gujarat, the seismic concentration is located near the intersection between Rajkot-Lathi lineament and neo-tectonic Kutch mainland fault. There is an east-west flexure of Indian lithosphere in the Western Ghat Escarpment," Dr Som said. Explaining the reason behind the frequent tremors, the geologist said any earthquake depends on the strain and stress build-up of an area. "Main strain and stress build-up areas have been noted along the convergence zone between Indian and Eurasian plates. Due to continuous plate movement, stresses build up in this area. Moreover, there are around 30 water reservoirs along the WGE. Enhanced water load in the reservoirs increases pore pressure and stress, triggering earthquakes," he said. Incidentally, the GSI has deployed 30 permanent GPS stations across the country to monitor tectonic plate movements and develop a strain map to identify potential hazardous zones. "Work is under progress and likely to be completed its first phase very soon. We will also carry out seismic microzonation (process of sub division of region) and active fault studies to evaluate potential geological vulnerable seismic sites," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/foreshocks-swarms-caused-recent-earthquakes-in-india-expert-897135.html

The Delhi-based NGO, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (SEEDS), in partnership with Honeywell will distribute food kits to the most vulnerable communities including daily wagers, contract workers, and a migrant population who have been displaced because of the lockdown. While phase-1 of the distribution drive provided around "3.7 million meals" across five cities, in phase-2, the initiative aims to provide an additional 10 million meals across nine cities: Delhi, Gurugram, Bengaluru, Pune, Madurai, Haridwar, Dehradun, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Cumulatively, this multi-city outreach will cover 1.78 lakh people, the NGO said in a statement. According to the NGO, the outpouring of support for the displaced and marginalized during the lockdown days have come down significantly since the country began to restart and reopen. However, large swathes of the population – especially among migrant workers – continues to suffer from job losses and depleted savings. "We are committed to reaching out to the bottom 1 per cent most vulnerable communities during any crisis. Though the country is currently under the unlock phase, there are still communities struggling against daily hardships. SEEDS continues to reach out to such communities for the sixth month running and is committed to carry out its support work until they can safely come out of the current crisis," said Manu Gupta, co-founder, SEEDS. Each food kit comprises rice, wheat flour, sugar, pulses, cooking oil, and salt. SEEDS, over the coming weeks, will engage with social volunteers and government officials to undertake the distribution drive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ngo-to-distribute-over-10-million-meals-to-needy-897136.html

Rai said the chief minister will chair the crucial meeting at 11 am on Monday. "Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch a mega anti-air pollution campaign after a meeting with officials from departments of environment, transport, development, PWD, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi Jal Board, traffic police and municipal corporations," he tweeted. At a meeting of NCR states with Union Environment Prakash Javadekar recently, Rai asked the Centre to take time-bound action to ensure that 11 thermal power plants and more than 1,900 brick kilns using outdated technology in the national capital region control their emissions. There are 11 plants around Delhi -- in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab -- which were supposed to retrofit their units with a technology called flue-gas desulphurisation to reduce emissions by December 2019. Rai said there are more than 1,640 such brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, 161 in Haryana, and 164 Rajasthan. "All these contribute to Delhi's air pollution massively," he said. The minister said the Delhi government presented its plan to tackle stubble burning in the city during the meeting with Javadekar. He said a center is being set up in Kharkhari village in Najafgarh where "bio-decomposer" solution will be prepared in around 400 containers starting Tuesday. The new technology involves a liquid formulation prepared using bio-decomposer capsules, fermenting it over 8-10 days and then spraying the mixture on crop residue to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of the stubble. Capsules worth Rs 20 can effectively deal with 4-5 tonnes of raw straw per acre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arvind-kejriwal-to-launch-mega-anti-air-pollution-campaign-on-october-5-897137.html

BJP national spokesperson and MP Raju Bista noted that Banerjee had claimed that the country is under "super autocracy", as he said the comments amounted to her "confession" because no one would know better than people of the state as to what it means to live under a "dictatorial regime". In a statement, Bista said the West Bengal government has refused to share crime data with the Union home ministry for the year 2019-20 due to rising crime graph in the state. West Bengal also topped the list as major source areas for trafficking to red-light areas across India, and the majority of these trafficked children are female, he said, attacking Banerjee.  "The blatant hypocrisy of the Trinamool Congress and Mamata Banerjee is absolutely nauseating. Yesterday, the TMC took out a protest rally in Kolkata but at the same time a CPI(M) rally was attacked by TMC goons and the BJP was denied permission to hold a rally," Bista said. He added, "Everyone in West Bengal is aware of how TMC has worked to erode the very basis of democracy in the state. Her government stopped following the Constitution a long time back." On the one hand her party cadres are attacking and even "murdering" opposition supporters, he alleged, and on the other, the state police are working as a TMC frontal organisation being used to intimidate, threaten and torture political opponents.

Addressing the media here, the Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs, alleged that the Congress, which championed reforms in the agriculture sector and included it in their manifesto has now gone back on its word. "The party is resorting to violence and vandalism out of frustration of losing relevance in Indian politics," he claimed. The Union Minister said while then Congress government under Manmohan Singh at the Centre, and the Chief Ministers of Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh have supported repealing of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, but the national party has turned its back on the farmers by changing its stance now. Muraleedharan said Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi's opposition to the farm reforms showcased his disconnect with farmers. "Rahul Gandhi is disconnected from reality. He should speak to farmers from Wayanad and other areas. He betrayed the farmers by vehemently opposing reforms that free ryots from the loot of middlemen," Muraleedharan said. He said the reforms such as farm bills, and labour codes reiterate central government's commitment to empowering farmers and entrepreneurs. Alleging that the Congress, which ruled the country for over six decades lacked the conviction and political will to change the lives of farmers, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accomplished what the earlier PMs could not and brought revolutionary changes in farming and labour sectors. These moves will create an enabling environment for agriculture and entrepreneurship to thrive, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rahul-gandhi-disconnected-with-reality-of-farmers-says-union-minister-v-muraleedharan-897165.html

The draft of the bill, approved by the Cabinet in December 2019, proposes a penalty of up to Rs 15 crore and up to three-year jail term for company executives for violating privacy norms. "The time for the joint committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill has been extended to the second week of the winter session. The final bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament in the Budget session after incorporating the suggestions of the committee," the source told PTI. The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in February and has been referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee of both the Houses, headed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, for examination and report. The draft approved by the Cabinet in December mandates storage of critical data of individuals by internet companies within the country while sensitive data can be transferred overseas only after explicit consent of the data owner. The bill has been drafted following a Supreme Court judgement in August 2017 that declared 'Right to Privacy' a fundamental right. The need for a strong personal data protection regime was further highlighted by the apex court in its judgement in September 2018 in which it held Aadhaar as a constitutionally valid scheme but struck down some provisions in the Aadhaar Act. As per the provisions of the bill, all internet companies will have to mandatorily store critical data of individuals within the country. However, they can transfer sensitive data overseas after explicit consent of the data owner to process it only for purposes permissible under the proposed legislation. Critical data will be defined by the government from time to time. Data related to health, religious or political orientation, biometrics, genetic, sexual orientation, health, financial etc have been identified as sensitive data. A company's executive in-charge of conduct of the data business would face a jail term of up to three years if found guilty of knowingly matching anonymous data with publicly available information to find out the identity of an individual -- called as 're-identify de-identified data' in technical parlance, under the proposed law. Social media companies will be required to come up with a mechanism to identify users on their platform who are willing to be identified on a voluntary basis. It will be voluntary for individuals if they want to get verified or not. The bill has provisions to grant the right to be forgotten to data owners as well as the right to erase, correct and porting of data.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/personal-data-protection-bill-likely-to-be-tabled-in-parliament-in-budget-session-897168.html

It said both were "smitten by each other and passions of youth ruled over their minds and emotions as the physical relations that followed between them was not isolated or sporadic in nature, but regular over the years". A bench of Justices R F Nariman, Navin Sinha and Indira Banerjee noted the woman, a Christian, was herself aware of the obstacles in their relationship with a man belonging to Scheduled Tribe. An engagement ceremony was also held in the solemn belief that the societal obstacles would be overcome, but unfortunately differences arose over whether the marriage was to be solemnised in a church or a temple and ultimately failed, the court said, as it acquitted Maheshwar Tigga of rape case lodged in April 1999. "We have no hesitation in concluding that the consent of the woman was but a conscious and deliberated choice, as distinct from an involuntary action or denial, because of her deep-seated love for the appellant leading her to willingly permit him liberties with her body, which according to normal human behaviour are permitted only to a person with whom one is deeply in love," the bench said. The court said the appellant did not make any false promise or intentional misrepresentation of marriage leading to the establishment of the physical relationship between the parties. The man, convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail, contended that the FIR was lodged belatedly after four years as an afterthought. He claimed the physical relations between the appellant and the woman were consensual in nature occasioned by their love affair. Discarding the state's contention that she was minor and her consent did not matter, the court pointed out that the woman had dithered about her age in the deposition. It further said the nature and manner of allegations, coupled with the letters exchanged between them made it apparent that their love for each other grew and matured over sufficient time. She had even gone and resided in the house of the appellant. The court also pointed out the delay of four years in lodging of the FIR, just seven days before the man solemnising his marriage with another girl, raised serious doubts about the truth and veracity of the allegations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-acquits-scheduled-tribe-man-in-20-year-old-rape-case-says-relationship-was-consensual-897180.html

After the killing, a video in which the deceased, Shakti Malik, accused RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of seeking Rs 50 lakh as a donation to give him a party ticket to contest the poll from Raniganj seat and threatening to eliminate him if he continues with his good work in the constituency, went viral. The ruling JD(U) claimed that Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has exposed his true colors before the nation. Repeated efforts to reach senior RJD leaders for their reaction were unsuccessful. Police said that three bike-borne men entered the house of Shakti Malik in Purnea in the morning and shot him in the head while he was sleeping, killing him on the spot, and fled. A country-made pistol and an empty cartridge were found from the spot, K Haat police station Station House Officer Sunil Kumar Mandal said. Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma and Sadar Sub- Divisional Police Officer Anand Pandey visited the spot. In the video that went viral, Malik claimed that he, along with the RJD's SC/ST cell state unit president, met Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in Patna where the RJD leader sought Rs 50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest Raniganj assembly constituency. According to the video, when Malik said that he would let him know of his decision later, Tejashwi made a casteist remark against him and threatened to eliminate him. It was not immediately clear when Malik made this statement to a Purnea based television channel. The deceased's wife also alleged that there is a political conspiracy behind her husband's killing and named several leaders who could be involved in it. JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad claimed that Malik was a Mahadalit and his family members' statements corroborate the allegations levelled by him. "We have been raising the issue of dynastic politics, corruption, Tejashwi's inexperience especially in dealing with alliance politics but the latest allegations has completely exposed him," Prasad told reporters. Allegations that RJD leaders distribute party tickets after taking money or land are not new, he alleged. Prasad also alleged that Tejashwi's "concern" for Dalits was exposed when former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had to leave the Grand Alliance after the RJD leaderships shabby treatment meted out to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dalit-leader-who-accused-tejashwi-yadav-of-demanding-money-for-party-ticket-shot-dead-897184.html

Earlier, the party had alleged that its delegation members were stopped briefly at a toll plaza near Agra by police at the behest of the government when they were on their way to meet the family. "This forcible stoppage is a murder of democracy.... Samajwadi(s) will stand with the aggrieved family in their fight for justice," the party tweeted in Hindi. SP president Akhilesh Yadav had on Saturday set up an 11-member fact-finding team headed by the party's state unit chief Naresh Uttam Patel to visit the woman's village on Sunday and meet her family members. After the delegation met the family, the party said in another tweet in Hindi: "A 'nyay yuddh' (struggle for justice) is going on to deliver justice to the deceased daughter of Hathras by the Samajwadis. On the directives of the national president, the SP delegation met the aggrieved family, expressed its solidarity, and assured all possible help. SP supports all the demands of the aggrieved family." Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in a press statement issued in Lucknow on Sunday alleged that its vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and party workers were lathicharged by police when they were on their way to meet the Hathras family. Condemning the police action, RLD's UP unit president Masood Ahmed said, "The BJP is trying to suppress the voice of the opposition." The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family". The visit by the SP delegation came a day after the visit by senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/samajwadi-party-delegation-meets-hathras-victims-family-assures-help-897204.html

The top law officer said, though the "statements are wholly uncalled for, they don't merit action for criminal contempt". A Delhi-based advocate Sumant Sudan sought a nod from the Attorney General to sue the leader for his tweets related to the Yogi Adityanath government's decision to set up special security force. Singh had then asked whether the court would declare such a force as unconstitutional or act under pressure from the government. The lawyer had claimed that the tweets constituted as serious scandalous allegations upon the dignity and sanctity of the Supreme Court and its judgements and had the potential to shake the faith of the country in the justice delivery system. Under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, a consent from the Attorney General or the Solicitor General was required for initiating criminal contempt proceedings against anyone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/attorney-general-k-k-venugopal-declines-nod-for-contempt-against-congress-leader-digvijaya-singh-897212.html

Heavy police force was deployed in the vicinity of the residence of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan, located around 8-9 kilometres from the victim’s village. One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer Singh denied that the gathering comprised members from the upper castes and said they were from “different sections of society”. “We welcome the CBI inquiry ordered by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. We have faith in the investigation,” Singh told PTI while claiming that the victim’s family members were “changing their stand”. “The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then. They do not want a narco test or a CBI probe. Now they want other kinds of inquiries,” he claimed. He said an FIR should be registered by police against the complainants in the case. "Our demand is that a case should be filed against those people who had filed the case in the first instance," he said. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment. On Sunday, Singh also said various legal options were being explored to defend the accused in the case. He asserted that the arrest of some of the accused persons from their homes was proof of their innocence. “Had they been guilty, they would have run away from their homes. Why would they be present in their homes,” he said. He also alleged that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party were trying to influence the victim's family as they wanted to the issue to “linger on”. The meeting assumes significance as it was held a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the victim’s house and met her family members at a village in Hathras district, and the recommendation of a CBI probe by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on Wednesday. Her family alleged that they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hathras-rape-accused-defended-at-meeting-held-at-former-bjp-mlas-residence-897217.html

We can't be selective in condemning violence,” he said in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district during the “Back to Village-3” programme. Earlier, on Friday, the L-G had appealed to the local militants to shun the path of violence and promised to help them with jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. Sinha said there was no dearth of opportunities for progress and peace and appealed to all to contribute towards peace. “I am working on four key points for the development of J&K: Accelerating growth, providing benefits of social security and social welfare schemes to all, eliminating regional disparities and effective execution of works,” Sinha said. The L-G underscored that the means and resources are abundant and with people’s participation, soon there shall be no backward area in entire J&K region.

Casting aspersions over the AIIMS' medical board ruling out murder in the death of Rajput, the senior advocate said how can the expert team give a conclusive opinion in the absence of the actor's body. "Highly perturbed with AIIMS report. Going to request the CBI director to constitute a fresh forensic team. "How could AIIMS team give a conclusive report in the absence of the body, that too on such a shoddy post mortem done by the Cooper hospital (in Mumbai) wherein the time of death is also not mentioned," he tweeted. The AIIMS' medical board has ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and termed it "a case of hanging and death by suicide," the premier institute's forensic chief Dr Sudhir Gupta said on Saturday. In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, the six-member team dismissed the claims of "poisoning and strangling", with Dr Gupta saying the panel did not find any trace of poison and drugs in the viscera. It is a case of hanging and death by suicide. We have submitted our conclusive report to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)," Dr Gupta, who is also the chairman of the forensic medical board, said. There was no injury on the body other than that of hanging. Also, there was no mark of struggle and scuffle. The ligature mark on the neck was consistent with hanging, he said. Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed 'Kai Po Che' seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14. The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor's father K K Singh in Patna against Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family. Earlier this week, the central probe agency had said that it has not reached any conclusion in Rajput's death case and that all aspects were under investigation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-request-cbi-chief-to-constitute-fresh-forensic-team-sushant-singh-rajputs-family-lawyer-897228.html

Gandhi will hold the rallies in Kurukshetra and Karnal districts of the state, party leaders said. The Congress leader, who arrived in Punjab on Sunday for a three-day visit to lead a series of tractor rallies against the Centre's farm laws, will on October 6 lead a tractor rally which will enter Haryana, they said. Congress' Haryana unit held a meeting of party MLAs and senior leaders in Delhi to take stock of the preparations in connection with Gandhi’s visit to the state. Haryana Congress in-charge Vivek Bansal, state Congress president Kumari Selja, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and senior leaders Kiran Choudhary and Ajay Singh Yadav were also present in the meeting. “His (Rahul Gandhi) visit will prove to be a milestone in the battle of farmers. On October 6 and 7, Rahul Gandhi will be on a two-day visit to Haryana. On the first day, his rally will enter Pehowa in Haryana from Punjab border. In Pehowa, he will address the people,” Selja said. “After this, Rahul Gandhi will go to Kurukshetra and halt there for the night. His journey will start from Pipli Mandi next morning from where he will proceed to Nilokheri and after that he will go to Karnal, where the tractor rally will culminate,” she said. Selja said Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders have been raising the issues of farmers, workers and common people. “Just as Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra went to Hathras on Saturday and shared the grief and pain of the Dalit family, in the same way, he will come to the state to share the pain of farmers because the government does not have time to understand and discuss their sufferings,” she said. Hooda said the new farm laws were not in the interest of farmers. “Rahul Gandhi is coming to Haryana to protest against these black laws,” the former chief minister said. Meanwhile, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said, “We have not received any intimation about his (Rahul's) programme so far.” The remarks come after Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij earlier said the Congress leader’s tractor rally will not be given permission to enter the state. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Karnal, the CM hailed the three farm laws as a “game changer”. “Farmers are going to benefit in a big way,” he said. Accusing the Congress of misleading farmers on the laws, Khattar said paddy and other crop procurement at minimum support price (MSP) was being smoothly done across the state. “On the Citizenship Amendment Act and revoking of Article 370 and so many other issues, the Congress tired to mislead the people. But people soon realised that these steps were taken for their larger benefit keeping the country's interests above all. Similarly, farmers have started realising that Congress is trying to use their shoulder to further their own interests,” he said. Speaking in Sirsa, Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said, “Rahul Gandhi does not understand the basics of agriculture and now he wants to hold protests on these three laws.” “If journalists confront him and ask him about the three laws, he will not be able to tell about their benefits or losses. So, Congress is only doing politics over the issue and nothing else. “It was during the Congress-led UPA regime that a five-member committee of chief ministers gave a report on open market access. Now, they are opposing the reforms brought by the Centre,” Chautala said. He added that the central and state governments have taken many “historic decisions” in the interest of farmers and the work to double the farmers' income was being done earnestly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/after-punjab-rahul-gandhi-to-hold-tractor-rallies-in-haryana-on-october-6-7-897232.html

The woman's kin, however, claimed she was depressed after being chided and humiliated by police officials while lodging a complaint against the man. A senior police officer said the allegations levelled by the woman's family will be probed. The man lured the teen to a friend's house and raped her several times. He had promised to marry her but started ignoring her marriage requests by making excuses like temples are not open during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, a police official said. A case was filed on September 15 and the man arrested, he said. "She hanged herself on Friday night and a probe is underway to find out the reason behind her extreme step," the official said. According to a suicide note recovered from the spot, the woman took her life because she was unable to marry the man, the police said. The police official said two more such "suicide notes" have been found in the woman's notebook and they are being verified. Her family, however, said the teen was depressed as she was humiliated by police officials while filing the complaint against the man. Deputy Commissioner of Police Vijaykant Sagar said the allegations of the woman's kin are being verified and action will be taken against personnel of the concerned police station if they are found to be true.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/raped-on-pretext-of-marriage-teen-hangs-self-to-death-in-palghar-kin-blame-cops-897265.html

Besides paddy, cotton procurement has also begun from October 1. As on September 3, state-run Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has procured a cumulative quantity of 147 bales at Rs 40.80 lakh MSP value benefiting 29 farmers, it said.

Paddy worth Rs 1,082.46 crore has been purchased at MSP from 41,084 farmers so far, it said. Paddy procurement commenced from September 26 in Punjab and Haryana, while it started on September 28 in other states. For the current year, the government has fixed the MSP of paddy (common grade) at Rs 1,868 per quintal, while that of A grade variety has been fixed at Rs 1,888 per quintal. Unlike before, the government is releasing daily procurement data to send a message to farmers protesting against new farm laws that it has no intention of scrapping procurement at MSP. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana and several other states are protesting against the new farm laws, which they feel will lead to procurement in the hands of corporates and the end of MSP regime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-buys-573-lakh-tons-of-paddy-at-msp-in-last-8-days-897267.html
04-10-2020||National||Fact-check | Hathras case: Did Rahul Gandhi hold a UP cop by his collar?||A Dalit woman’s alleged gang-rape in Hathras sparked protests in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi after UP police cremated the victim’s body against her family’s consent. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s handling of the case came under heavy criticism with opposition leaders demanding Adityanath’s resignation. On October 1, a huge contingent of police was deployed at Delhi-UP border as Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi set out to visit the deceased’s kin. A scuffle with the cops led to their arrest. The duo was subsequently permitted to meet the victim’s family on October 3. However, videos of their first attempt to travel to Hathras were widespread as Rahul reportedly fell to the ground during the confrontation with policemen. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Pratap Arunbhau shared a photograph suggesting Rahul held a cop by his collar. Media outlet Republic broadcast a show where a blurry video of Rahul’s scuffle with cops was played for viewers while the anchor claimed that the Congress leader ‘fell for the camera’. The channel claimed that the video clearly shows he ‘fell himself’.  The popular English language adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” has little relevance in a case where videos can provide a thorough context. BJP members and supporters of the party shared a screengrab of a video instead of sharing the actual clip. There are two videos of the confrontation that show Rahul falling to the ground. In the first video, he is walking towards Hathras as policemen attempt to stop him. A cop can be seen roughing him up and holding the Congress leader by his collar. “Maaro mujhe maaro (hit me),” Rahul says to the cop.   लाला लाजपत राय ने कहा था मेरे तन पर पड़ा लाठी का एक एक वार अंग्रेजी राज के ताबूत में आखिरी कील साबित होगा।   Another video shot from the side where Rahul falls shows the same cop holding his collar and the Congress leader subsequently falling to the ground.  Visual analysis cannot establish the strength of the policemen’s push — if it was powerful enough for Rahul to fall. However, the videos do show cops roughing him up. But we digress. The photograph promoted by BJP MP Adsad to suggest it was Rahul who heckled a cop is a screenshot of a third video which was tweeted by Congress. This video shows the events leading up to the fall. The Congress leader is surrounded by policemen who attempt to stop him from walking toward Hathras. As they obstruct him, one of the cops comes in front of Rahul and back peddles while facing him. The Congress MP puts his hand on the cop’s chest and shoves him to the left. His hand does not reach up to the policeman’s collar.  The claim that Rahul Gandhi held a policeman by his collar is therefore false. As far as Republic is concerned, the channel declared that the Congress leader “fell himself” based on a mere clip. This fact-check had earlier pointed out that it’s not possible to decipher the strength of a push through the viral videos. But screenshot posted by BJP MP Pratap Arunbhau Adsad does not show Rahul Gandhi holding a cop by his collar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fact-check-hathras-case-did-rahul-gandhi-hold-a-up-cop-by-his-collar-897278.html

Our aim is to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses of vaccine to cover 20-25 crore people by July 2021,” Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday while interacting with common people on social media. While the minister didn’t clarify on the source of the vaccine, sources within the government said it was premature to talk about the vaccine rollout in the absence of any offer on the table. No manufacturing firm has approached the government with a concrete proposal outlining the cost and production plan. While early stage trials are going on for two homegrown vaccines, a large-scale bridging study (equivalent to a phase-3 trial) has been undertaken for a vaccine developed by researchers at the Oxford University with support from AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India. The Russian government promised to supply 100 million doses of its Sputnik-V shots if they come out successfully in a similar Indian trial. Moreover, the state administrations have been asked to take stock of cold chain facilities and other related infrastructure up to the block level. The Centre is working on plans to build up human resources and arrange their training before such a massive scale rollout takes place. “We are also keeping an eye on the immunity,” Vardhan said, suggesting that the sero-surveillance studies being carried out by state governments would have a key role in deciding the recipients. Those who already have antibodies in their blood because of an exposure to the virus are likely to be excluded. The list of front-line health workers, the minister stressed, should include doctors from the government as well as private sector. “There would be a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines once they are ready.

Sources told the publication that for the Bihar Assembly polls, the JD(U) is set to accommodate Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha within its quota while the BJP will give seats to Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)  if they continue to be a part of the alliance. DH could not independently verify the report. Indicating that it may not fight the state Assembly polls as part of the National Democratic Alliance, LJP party officials had revealed separately that the party may contest on 143 seats in the elections while not putting up its candidates against BJP nominees.  Unhappy with the seat-sharing arrangement offered to it, the LJP is hoping to inflict damage on poll prospects of the JD(U), which has maintained that the LJP is a BJP ally and not one of its own.  Seeking to steal a march over the ruling NDA, the opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar, yesterday announced the number of seats assigned to the Congress, the CPI(ML), the CPI(M) and the CPI. RJD's Tejashwi Yadav said that his party was getting the lion's share of  144 seats. The Bihar assembly polls will be held in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7, and the counting of votes will take place on November 10. The nomination process for the first phase, under which 71 of the total 243 seats will go to polls, began from October 1 and will end on October 8.

04-10-2020||National Politics||Prakash Javadekar takes jibe at parties opposing farm laws; calls them 'middlemen'||Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday alleged that parties opposing the newly enacted farm laws were acting as "middlemen for middlemen". Talking to reporters on the second day of his visit to Goa as part of the ruling BJP's initiative to create awareness about the farm laws, Javadekar said the actual situation is that farmers earn less for their produce and customers have to buy it at higher rates. The middlemen hike the prices and the farm laws deal with this problem by eradicating these middlemen, he said. "Sometimes I feel the opposition parties have become middlemen for middlemen," he alleged. Claiming that the agitation against farm laws will die out on its own, the minister said, "Falsehood has limited life while truth lives forever." "The Congress and NCP launched their campaign to protest against the farm bills. I am going to ask them to look at their manifesto. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken about such (agricultural) reforms in his speeches. But, the Congress has now done a u-turn," he said. He alleged that the opposition parties were spreading a "myth" that APMCs (agriculture produce market committees) will be shut down under the new laws, and government will stop purchasing the produce or the minimum support price (MSP) would be stopped. "All these are lies," Javadekar said. The BJP leader also said the conduct of opposition leaders in the Rajya Sabha over the passage of these bills was "condemnable and shameful". Referring to a protest by a group of people on his way to Mapusa town on Saturday, Javadekar said he doubts that those who were protesting were real farmers. He said 60 per cent population of the country is involved in the farming sector, but their contribution to the GDP (gross domestic product) is 15 per cent. There is a need to increase the productivity and also give them markets outside the country so that their standard of living improves, he said. Javadekar said when he was in school, the country's population was 30 crore, which has now increased to 138 crore, but despite that, there's no shortage of food. "We are thankful to farmers who have been feeding our country," he said, adding that it is the responsibility of the government to increase their income. The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 became law after getting the presidential assent recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/prakash-javadekar-takes-jibe-at-parties-opposing-farm-laws-calls-them-middlemen-897028.html

In a tweet in Hindi, Mayawati said, "There have been serious allegations of the Hathras DM threatening the family of the victim. Despite this, the UP Government is maintaining silence, which is sad and extremely worrying." "The government has agreed for a CBI probe but with the DM staying there (Hathras), how can the matter be impartially probed? People are feeling apprehensive," she said. हाथरस गैंगरेप काण्ड के पीड़ित परिवार ने जिले के डीएम पर धमकाने आदि के कई गंभीर आरोप लगाए हैं, फिर भी यूपी सरकार की रहस्मय चुप्पी दुःखद व अति-चिन्ताजनक। हालाँकि सरकार CBI जाँच हेतु राजी हुई है, किन्तु उस डीएम के वहाँ रहते इस मामले की निष्पक्ष जाँच कैसे होे सकती है? लोग आशंकित। On Saturday, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had demanded the suspension of the district magistrate after meeting the Hathras victim's family. The 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday.

Priyanka Gandhi said that according to the family, the district magistrate meted out the worst treatment to them, and asked who was protecting the officer. In a tweet in Hindi, the Congress leader said, "According to the aggrieved family, the worst treatment meted out to them was by the district magistrate. Who is trying to save him? He should be immediately suspended, and his role in the entire matter should be probed. When the family is demanding a judicial probe, then why is noise over CBI probe and SIT probe is going on." यूपी सरकार यदि जरा भी नींद से जागी है तो उसे परिवार की बात सुननी चाहिए।2/2 "If the UP government has even slightly woken up from its slumber, it should listen to the point of view of the family," she said in another tweet. Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi met the family Saturday evening and declared that they would fight for ensuring justice to them. "Yogi Adityanath has to understand his responsibility. He has to understand that wherever injustice happens, we will fight that and stand with the family," Priyanka Gandhi told reporters. "We will fight against injustice, and fight till justice is done." Rahul Gandhi said, "No power on earth" can stop the voice of this family." Later on Twitter, he said the UP government will not be able to have its way as the entire country has now risen for justice to "this daughter of the nation".

Lashing out at the UP police for earlier stopping Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from proceeding to Hathras and the former party president falling down in the melee, Stalin demanded that the "UP government correct its mistakes and ensure justice for the woman." It should also "publicly apologise to Rahul Gandhi and the Centre should issue directions to the UP government on this matter," Stalin added.

The family of the victim, who was allegedly 'gang-raped' and brutally murdered, demanded a judicial probe by a retired SC judge and vowed not to immerse her ashes into the river until the guilty were 'hanged'. The UP government has already recommended a CBI probe into the incident. Police on Sunday made a lathi charge as Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) workers pelted stones at the cops and tried to break the barricades erected on the borders of the village to prevent them from entering. President of Bhim Army, a 'Dalit' outfit, Chandrashekhar alias Ravan, who was accompanied by a large number of his supporters, also embarked upon a foot march to the victim's village after his cavalcade was stopped by the police. Meanwhile, Priyanka and Mayawati said that an impartial probe into the incident was not possible unless the district magistrate was removed. ''Why is the government shielding the DM?,'' Priyanka asked in a post on Twitter. ''The DM has been accused of threatening the victim's family...he must be acted against,'' said Mayawati. The IPS Association in the state has also questioned inaction against the Hathras DM and condemned the suspension of the district police chief.  Meanwhile, posters appeared in several places in Lucknow showing a girl armed with a revolver and demanding sacking of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The girl, who hailed from the SC community, had been brutally raped by four youths in Hathras district and died in the hospital. The family members alleged that she was gang-raped. The police allegedly held her family hostage and cremated the body at midnight on Tuesday. All the four accused have been arrested The police claimed that the postmortem report and forensic examination of the Hathras victim did not confirm ''rape or gang-rape' and that she had died owing to injury on her neck.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/politicians-continue-to-throng-hathras-victims-village-priyanka-mayawati-seek-action-against-dm-897112.html

The preparations for the campaign covering 365 villages up to October 15, were discussed in the first meeting of the newly appointed state office bearers on Saturday, they said. "Tractor pujas and tractor rallies will be an important part of the campaign to expose how Congress and other parties are misguiding the farmers over the recently passed farm Bills of Modi government," said Delhi BJP general secretary and campaign convener Kuljeet Chahal. A tractor was torched near India Gate on Monday by the Indian Youth Congress as a "symbolic" act against the "anti farmer" farm laws. The Delhi Police arrested 10 people including Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) president Birender Singh Dhillon, in connection with the incident. The BJP had accused the Congress of trying to vitiate the atmosphere and defame farmers by torching the tractor. "By holding tractor pujas and rallies we will show that tractors are a source of farmers prosperity and Congressmen have no regard for their well-being," Chahal said. Amid protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana, President Ram Nath Kovind had on September 27 given assent to three contentious farm bills -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020.  The Opposition parties have been criticising the manner in which the Bills were passed in parliament and over minimum support price issue.  Delhi BJP leaders including its MPs and MLAs have started reaching out to farmers in the city through door to door contact and in small meetings in rural areas. Party president Adesh Gupta, MPs Meenakshi Lekhi, Manoj Tiwari, Parvesh Verma, Ramesh Bidhuri and Gautam Gambhir and Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri were lined up for door to door contact programmes in support of farm laws, in different parts of Delhi on Sunday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/delhi-bjp-to-hold-tractor-rallies-to-counter-opposition-attack-on-farm-laws-897116.html

The much talked about LJP parliamentary board meeting chaired by its president Chirag Paswan passed a resolution to this effect which also expressed confidence in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The decision to have friendly fights among NDA allies has given rise to the buzz that the whole plan has the blessings of the BJP top leadership as the ruling party is up for a larger game plan in the state, where it never had its Chief Minister even when it was the leading party in alliance with JDU once. “On the national level, there is a strong alliance of BJP and LJP. At the state level due to ideological differences with NDA ally JDU, LJP has decided to fight elections separately from the alliance. There may be an ideological fight with JDU on many of the seats so that people can make a decision on those seats as to which candidate is a better choice in the interests of Bihar,” a resolution passed at the meeting said. The meeting repeatedly flagged the “strong alliance between the BJP and LJP at the national level and also sought to clarify “there is no bitterness between BJP and LJP.” This was days after the LJP while expressing confidence in Narendra Modi’s leadership had also  slamming Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s key plank  of “Saat Nischay” programme in the same breath and had expressed confidence that the next government of Bihar will implement LJP’s ‘Bihar First, Bihari First Vision Document On Saturday, Chirag had shared on social media a picture of Modi affectionately patting him and said he was proud to have got an opportunity to work with a Prime Minister, whose accomplished leadership is recognised worldwide. On Sunday, the LJP took the BJP-LJP bonhomie thing further saying “after election results all elected MLAs of LJP will stand by development works of Modi and form a BJP-LJP government. “ It also went on to say that that the LJP is of the view that on the line of Centre, in Bihar also, a government should be formed “in the leadership of the BJP.” LJP did not even mention JDU as an ally in the next government The buzz is that LJP is eyeing the chair of Deputy Chief Minister in Bihar and is aching to replace JDU as the largest non-BJP ally within the BJP as Paswan believes that his caste base of Paswan a vote base is bigger than of Kurmis plus Nitish Kumar. The LJP’s categorical decision not to have any truck with JDU even as the BJP on Saturday said all is well in the alliance and assured that it has authorised three senior leaders of the party to intervene and resolve the alliance standoff between BJP and LJP. LJP, which had announced to contest on 143 of total 243 assembly seats, wanted 42 seats for it in the alliance but BJP was not ready to party with more than 15. Earlier BJP and JDU agreed to contest an equal number of seats with the agreement that while JDU will accommodate Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustan Awam Morcha from its quota, BJP will do the same with LJP. Soon after the announcement, LJP shared video clips on social media of its workers breaking into celebrations in different parts of the state. The sudden display of strain in last few months is not in sync with the bonhomie shown by Paswan to Nitish Kumar at the time of 2019 Lok Sabha polls that had created a buzz of both regional leaders cosying up to create a pressure group within the Bihar NDA. The fight between the two allies has given the BJP an opportunity to play a truce-maker but political watchers see a larger pattern behind the whole row. There is a growing demand within the BJP to have its own Chief Minister in the state, which has kept raising from time to time. BJP has for the record sake repeatedly asserted its commitment to keep NDA united in Bihar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/ljp-decides-not-to-fight-bihar-election-under-nitish-kumars-leadership-of-nda-creates-buzz-897126.html

After the BJP criticised Dahariya and the Congress for the comments, the minister said that his remarks were "misconstrued". "(Former Chhattisgarh chief minister) Raman Singh is unaware that the big (rape) incident has occurred in Balrampur of Uttar Pradesh and not in Balrampur of Chhattisgarh," he said. "The incident happened here is different from that of Uttar Pradesh. Such a tragic incident occurred in Hathras but why Raman Singh did not tweet about it? Why did he keep mum? He should answer whether what happened in Hathras was good. And when any small incident happens in Balrampur in Chhattisgarh, he (Singh) is not doing anything else except criticising the state government," the urban administration minister told reporters on Saturday. He was responding to a query on tweets posted by Raman Singh on the recent incident of rape in Balrampur. However, he later clarified that his remarks were misconstrued and he did not call the Balrampur rape a small incident. "My remarks on big and small incidents were wrongly presented. I was actually referring to a sequence of incidents happening after the Hathras gang-rape. In Hathras incident, the Uttar Pradesh government did not provide proper treatment to the victim. The way attempts were made to hush up evidence in Hathras and the way the victim was cremated at night is inhuman and barbaric. Contrary to that, police in Balrampur (Chhattisgarh) immediately arrested the accused and the state government took a swift action," he said. "(Incidents of) rapes and atrocities, wherever they take place, are inhuman and they could not be tolerated. I never called rape incidents as small incidents," he said in a video released on Saturday night. The opposition BJP has slammed the minister saying his comments showed the "distorted mindset" of the state Congress. "See the 'vikrit mansikta' (distorted mindset) of @ INCChhattisgarh! They feel incidents of horror with daughters of Chhattisgarh are small incidents. @RahulGandhi ji should tell whether incidents of rape in Chhattisgarh are small for you (Gandhi) also? When will you remove a minister with such poor thinking? When will justice prevail?" BJP national vice president Raman Singh tweeted in Hindi. The BJP has also demanded an apology from the minister for his comments. Earlier, Singh had accused the Congress government of trying to suppress the alleged rape of a girl in Balrampur. On September 27, a girl was allegedly sexually assaulted and beaten up by a 22-year-old man in Wadrafnagar area of Balrampur. Two persons were arrested in the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/chhattisgarh-minister-terms-rape-of-minor-small-incident-bjp-demands-his-removal-897245.html

Wagh's stand drew support from Congress leaders who claimed she had not forgotten her "sanskar" despite crossing over to the saffron fold last year. Priyanka Gandhi along with other Congress leaders including her brother Rahul Gandhi was on her way to Hathras on Saturday afternoon to meet the family of a woman who died after she was allegedly gang-raped when the incident occurred at the Delhi-UP border. There were scuffles involving Congress workers and the Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida) police. In the melee, a helmet-wearing policeman had held the Congress general secretary by her kurta at the DND toll plaza while a crowd surrounded them. In a tweet in Hindi, Wagh said, "How dare a male police officer lay his hand on the clothes of a woman political leader!" Police should always be mindful of their limits, she said. "Yogi Adityanath ji, who believes in the Indian culture, should take strict action against such police officials," she said. Along with her tweet, Wagh also posted a picture of the official holding Priyanka Gandhi by her clothes. Maharashtra Youth Congress chief Satyajit Tambe lauded Wagh's stand. He said Wagh, who quit the NCP to join the BJP last year, had stuck to her "sanskar" despite changing her party. Earlier in the day, the Gautam Buddh Nagar police apologised to Priyanka Gandhi and said it has ordered an inquiry into the incident. Pictures and videos of the incident also surfaced on social media, drawing criticism for the state government and the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/how-dare-a-male-cop-put-hands-on-priyanka-gandhis-clothes-female-bjp-leader-897259.html

Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi met the family and declared that they will fight for ensuring justice to the Dalit woman who died after being allegedly gang-raped. In a series of tweets, Priyanka Gandhi listed some of the demands and questions of the victim's family. "Questions of Hathras victim's family -- 1. A judicial probe be conducted through the Supreme Court. 2. Hathras DM be suspended and not given a big post. Why our daughter's body was burnt using petrol without our permission. "4. Why we are being repeatedly misled and threatened. 5. We brought 'flowers’ from the funeral pyre, but how do we believe that this dead body is that of our daughter?" Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. It is the right of this family to get answers to these questions and the UP government will have to give answers, the Congress general secretary in-charge UP said. हाथरस के पीड़ित परिवार के प्रश्न:1. सुप्रीम कोर्ट के जरिए पूरे मामले की न्यायिक जाँच हो2. हाथरस DM को सस्पेंड किया जाए और किसी बड़े पद पर नहीं लगाया जाए3. हमारी बेटी के शव को बगैर हमसे पूछे पेट्रोल से क्यों जलाया गया?4. हमें बार-बार गुमराह किया, धमकाया क्यों जा रहा है? 1/2 After meeting the victim's family, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "I met the Hathras victim's family and understood their pain. I assured them that we are standing with them in this difficult time and will provide all help in getting justice for them." "The UP government will not be able to act in an arbitrary way as the whole country is standing for ensuring justice to the daughter of the country," he said in the tweet in Hindi. While heading to Hathras, high drama unfolded in the national capital. There was heavy police deployment on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border with barricades on Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway and scores of policemen deployed. As swarms of Congress workers and others jostled with each other amid loud honking, slogans and Congress flags fluttering in the air, the Gautam Buddh Nagar Police finally allowed five people, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, to go to Hathras. Congress workers -- some who described what happened as "brutal repression" -- claimed police used batons to disperse the crowd. A video also did the rounds on social media in which Priyanka Gandhi was seen coming to the rescue of party workers coming in between them and baton-armed police. Several Congress leaders also slammed the UP government for showing “disrespect” to a woman and they tagged a photograph in which a policeman is purportedly seen “grabbing” Priyanka Gandhi's kurta. A video targeting the Congress also surfaced on social media in which people were purportedly heard laughing in the car as Priyanka Gandhi drove a silver Innova with Rahul Gandhi by her side and some people on the back seat. While several Congress MPs such as Shashi Tharoor, P L Punia, Partap Singh Bajwa, Deepender Hooda, as well as leaders like Jitin Prasada and Sushmita Dev reached the DND flyway, only a few proceeded beyond the border. Earlier in the day, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the Yogi Adityanath government was threatening the family of the Hathras victim and asserted that such behaviour was not acceptable to the country. Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath dispensation, Priyanka Gandhi said the UP government is "morally corrupt". "The victim did not get treatment, her complaint was not registered on time, her body was forcibly cremated, the family is in captivity, they are being suppressed -- now they are being threatened that they will have to undergo a narco test," she said in a tweet in Hindi. "This behaviour is not acceptable to the country. Stop threatening the victim's family," she said. On Thursday, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi along with several party leaders and workers were detained by the police and sent back to Delhi, after they tried to reach Hathras to meet the family of the Dalit woman. In a tweet in Hindi in the morning using the hashtag 'Hathrashorror', Rahul Gandhi said the behaviour of the UP government and police with the woman and her family "is unacceptable to me. No Indian should accept this." He asserted that "no power in the world can stop me from meeting this grieving family in Hathras and share their pain". The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped at a village in Hathras by four men on September 14. After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi's Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday. She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-victims-family-wants-judicial-probe-suspension-of-dm-priyanka-gandhi-896914.html

Superintendent of Police (Kanpur Dehat) Keshav Kumar Choudhary ruled out the possibility of rape, claiming the girl was abducted by her uncles and was subsequently killed in a cold-blooded manner. He said the Dalit girl’s body, spotted Saturday morning by locals 500 metres away from her native Gaholia Rura village, was partially eaten, possibly by wild animals. The villagers immediately passed on the information to the police. Police said they have arrested the girl’s two uncles -- Brij Lal (65) and Jiya Lal (60) -- who allegedly confessed they killed her over a property dispute. The SP said the body has been sent for autopsy to ascertain the exact cause of her death. He said the girl had gone missing about a fortnight back and her family members had lodged a case a week ago.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/missing-up-girls-decomposed-body-found-police-say-killed-over-property-dispute-896922.html

About an hour later, she realised that her daughter was not answering her calls and thought that she had returned home. However, after finding a lone slipper on the side of the road, she knew something was wrong. She had waded into the maize field and found her daughter with a chunni around her neck.  “She was almost unconscious. Her lower clothes were thrown aside and she was bleeding from her private parts…,” the mother told HT after Uttar Pradesh police allowed the media to visit Bul Garhi on October 3. The victim was also bleeding from her chin, tongue and her eyes were bloodshot.  Talking to the publication, the victim’s mother said that she didn’t even know the word, rape (in English) and now she is having to prove that her daughter was raped.  After her son reached the location, they carried the victim to the local police station who asked them to go to the hospital after registering a written complaint.  “My mother was with my sister and I wrote whatever I knew. My mother didn't have the heart to tell me that my sister was raped,” said the victim’s brother.  According to the family, on September 17, the victim regained consciousness and mentioned that four men had raped her. On that day itself, the victim’s brothers registered a written complaint however did not receive a copy of the complaint. This statement is refuted by the police who have said that there was no mention of rape till September 22 when the complaint was officially registered. Brahm Singh, the Circle Officer, who was allegedly posted there after the crime took place said he was not aware of this development.  The victim succumbed to her injuries in Safdarjung Hospital on September 29. Her body was brought back the same night. According to the family, the police had assured them that they would be able to cremate their daughter at 6 am the next day, however, they suddenly cremated her at 2:30 am without informing the family.  The joint magistrate said that there was video evidence that cremation took place in the presence of her grandfather, uncle and half a dozen relatives.  However, the victim’s brother said, “My grandfather passed away in 2006.”  The family also said that they were "insulted and threatened" by the administration and police following the days after the victim's death.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/having-to-prove-my-daughter-was-raped-hathras-victims-mother-recounts-trauma-896991.html

A defence spokesperson said at about 3.20 am, Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and intense shelling with mortars along LoC in the Mankote sector of Poonch. Indian Army retaliated befittingly, he said and added there was no casualty on the Indian side in the shelling. Reports said the intense firing and shelling continued till 5 am, causing panic among the border residents who were forced to take shelter in underground bunkers for their safety. There has been a huge surge in ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir this year with a 75% jump in the first six months of 2020 as compared to the same period last year. Over 3,200 ceasefire violations by Pakistan troops were recorded in 2019. The government of India led by then Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee had entered into a border ceasefire agreement with Pakistan along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, 2003. However, according to officials shelling and firing by Pakistani troops since last year is so heavy that virtually it has made the 2003 truce redundant. An official in the security grid said that Pakistan was violating ceasefire to help infiltration and create a fear psychosis among the border residents. India shares a 3,323-km-long border with Pakistan, of which 221 km of the IB and 740 km of the LoC fall in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/heavy-shelling-in-forward-areas-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-poonch-by-pakistan-896993.html

Five country made pistols along with eight live cartridges were seized from the accused -- Ashok Kumar, a resident of Mathura district in Uttar Pradesh, who was arrested by the Delhi Police on Friday, they said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said to curb smuggling of firearms from Uttar Pradesh into Delhi, a police team was formed to collect intelligence and gather information regarding such rackets. "On Friday, we received information that an illegal arms supplier, Ashok Kumar, would come to MB road here near Tughlakabad Fort to deliver a consignment of illegal firearms... Accordingly, our team laid a trap and he was nabbed," he said. Five country made pistols along with eight live cartridges were recovered from his possession and a case was registered against him at Sangam Vihar police station, he added. On interrogation, Kumar told police that he was earlier into farming but after shifting to his uncle's village, he came in contact of local criminals there. He was supplying arms and ammunition to criminals in Delhi-NCR for the last one year to make a quick buck, the DCP said.

The Delhi government had earlier extended the school closure till October 5, though the Centre had permitted calling students of classes 9 to 12 to schools on a voluntary basis from September 21. "The Directorate of Education (DoE) has been directed to extend the ongoing closure of schools till Oct 31. Formal orders to this effect will be issued by DoE tomorrow," an official at the Deputy Chief Minister's office said. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also holds the education portfolio. Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shut down as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. On March 25, the central government announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading. As per the latest unlock guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions can reopen outside containment zones after October 15. However, the decision on whether to reopen educational institutions has been left with states and union territories.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-schools-in-delhi-to-remain-closed-till-october-31-897059.html
04-10-2020||North and Central||Army dogs keep danger, stress at bay for Jammu and Kashmir soldiers||Dogs can be great stress-busters. And they are proving exactly that for soldiers of 44 Rashtriya Rifles who have found comfort in the company of two-year-old Rosh, a labrador whose ever-bubbling energy provides an instant relief after a hard day of patrolling. Rosh is among six members of the seemingly submissive canine unit that transforms into a mighty challenger to the enemy, aiding their soldier-friends of the 44th unit of Rashtriya Rifles, an anti-militancy force carved out of regular Army units. Rosh, Tapi and Clyde have been deployed with the unit which keeps a vigil on sensitive areas of south Kashmir, covering Lassipura in Pulwama, Imam Saheb and Shopian town. Performing with aplomb, the canines have been helping the troops in locating improvised explosive devices, chasing violent mobs or tracking fleeing terrorists. Col A K Singh, who heads the 44 RR, feels that the canine squad has played an important role in many anti-militancy operations and averted many incidents that could have led to causalities of security forces. Ruffling Rosh, Col Singh said that he is "one of our celebrities" as he had successfully caught a wanted Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist last year, about 1.5 km away from the site of an encounter. Recalling the incident, Col Singh said that the encounter took place in Dragar village in Shopian during the night and the unit could neither ascertain the number of terrorists nor gauge their exact location. "After the first light, a search party identified two terrorists and a blood trail. We immediately deployed Rosh, who has high standards of training and handling, and the search began as he had picked up the scent. "Moving through a rough and dense orchard, Rosh kept effectively following the terrorist even after the blood trail became almost invisible...and suddenly he jumped on a thick pile of twigs where the third terrorist was hiding," Col Singh recalled. After the operation was over, the third terrorist was identified as Abid Manzoor Magray alias Sujju Magray, who was the commander of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen terror group and wanted in many cases, he said. Rosh has also received a commendation card from the Northern Army chief on this year's Army Day. Some of the Army personnel pat the canines while others throw a ball or offer biscuits for a great job done by them during an anti-militancy operation -- detecting explosives or alerting troops about suspicious movements. Soldiers devote a considerable free time of theirs to their canine "colleagues" who keep a watch when the personnel sleep in their accommodation or walk down the roads which could be mined by terrorists. The army officials have been taking care of these soldiers with great enthusiasm. Not to forget the picture of Lt Gen K J S Dhillon, at present the Director General Defence Intelligence Agency, who returned a salute by "Meneka" outside the Amarnath cave shrine after she had sniffed the path to the holy place for possible explosives. A large number of these canines have been awarded gallantry medals for their role in counter-terrorism operations. Mansi, a four-year-old Labrador and a member of the army's tracker dog unit, was the first canine to have been selected for a posthumous war honour. Mansi was honoured with the ‘Mention of Despatches’ certificate. Her name appears in the Gazette of India for making supreme sacrifice for the nation. She, along with her handler, had a successful season in 2015 with three kills to their credit. They were involved in the killing of a terrorist at Kaisuri ridge in the Tangdhar area, followed by the gunning down of two militants on July 21, 2015.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-dogs-keep-danger-stress-at-bay-for-jammu-and-kashmir-soldiers-897062.html
04-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi firefighters rescue more than 2,400 birds in over 6 months||Firefighters in the national capital rescued more than 2,400 birds between mid-March and September, with a maximum number of such cases being reported around Independence Day when people traditionally fly kites and leave many stray strings that create a death trap for them. According to data shared by the Delhi Fire Services (DFS), they received 13,271 distress calls between March 15 and September 30 this year, of which 2,433 were for rescue of birds and 1,681 for animals. Firefighters receive on an average 150-200 calls every month for the rescue of birds or animals. And the number goes up sharply in the month of August. This time, DFS received 882 calls for bird rescue and 345 calls for animal rescue in August alone, its director Atul Garg said. He said the drastic rise in bird and animal rescue calls during August was due to the kite flying season, especially around Independence Day celebrations. Fire services officials said most of the rescue calls they receive are for birds like crows, pigeons, parrots that either get stuck on electric wire or a tree due to kite string. Or, they get calls related to cows, cattle, dogs or cats which get stuck inside narrow lanes, closed spaces, sometimes even inside houses, in a pit, canal or a drain. The officials that for rescue of birds and animals, a vehicle is sent along with a team consisting of four-five firemen. The vehicle usually has a ladder but in cases, where it faces difficulties with high rises, bigger vehicles are sent if required. Once the bird is rescued and in case, it needs treatment, the fire services personnel shift them to a bird hospital. Recalling an incident of September 28, a fire official said they received a call from the police control room seeking assistance to rescue a cow that fell into a drain near a petrol pump in Sector-21, Rohini. With the help of ropes and locally available equipment, the cow was pulled out from the drain safely by the firefighters which they said required a lot of patience. Talking about the challenges involved in such rescue operations, Garg said one of the difficulties they face when it comes to the rescue of a bird or a trapped animal is the spot is usually not easily accessible. There is also no specialised equipment for their rescue. Most of the time, a hydraulic platform meant for highrise buildings are used. Another challenge, he said, is "when it comes to trees while trying to rescue a bird entangled in a kite string on a tree, even if a branch of a tree falls down or even one movement goes wrong while trying to catch the bird, it may also fall down and die. In that case, our entire effort of rescue goes in vain, if what we are trying to save will not be left." Garg said the firemen do not usually use the traditional methods while rescuing a bird or an animal. "Bird rescue calls are most challenging and difficult since there is no special equipment which can be used in the rescue. It's mostly the experience of the firemen, their presence of mind, utmost patience and locally made arrangements that helps. Just like human lives, we give utmost priority to birds and animals rescue calls, which we have been doing for ages now with precautions and care," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-firefighters-rescue-more-than-2400-birds-in-over-6-months-897079.html

04-10-2020||North and Central||Virtual SIM cards new headache for security agencies in Kashmir||Virtual SIM cards pose a new headache for security agencies fighting terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir as their use in the valley has seen an increase among terror groups to connect with their handlers in Pakistan, officials said here. The penetration of this new technology was found in 2019 when a request was sent to the United States to seek details from a service provider of "virtual SIMs" used by suicide bomber of Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group involved in the Pulwama attack that left 40 CRPF personnel dead. However, a detailed investigation done by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and other security agencies indicated that over 40 virtual SIM cards were used in the Pulwama attack alone, and there are probably more of them floating in the cyberspace of the valley, the officials said. It is a fairly new modus operandi wherein terrorists across the border are using "virtual SIM" cards, generated by a service provider from a foreign country. In this technology, the computer generates a telephone number and the user downloads an application of the service provider on their smartphone. The number is linked to social networking sites like WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram or Twitter. The verification code for activating the service is generated by these networking sites and received on the smartphone. The officials said the numbers used were pre-fixed with a country code or Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) number. They said that, besides telecom companies in the US, Canada, the UK, Israel, numbers of Puerto Rico, a Caribbean island being controlled by the US, are doing the rounds in the market. Every mobile phone instrument is sent for a detailed forensic analysis to have a thorough check to look for any telltale signs of use of virtual SIM cards, the officials said. Technology has its pros and cons, and while fighting terrorism, the security agencies have to not only keep up the pace but also move a step ahead of those planning to misuse it, says an official. The risk of forging identities during purchase of virtual SIM cards also runs high. During investigation of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, it was found that an amount of USD 229 was wired to Callphonex, via Western Union Money Transfer receipt number 8364307716-0, for activating the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) used during the strikes. The money was received from 'Madina Trading' located in Brescia in Italy and sender was claimed to be Javed Iqbal, a resident of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). However, after Italian police arrested two Pakistani nationals in 2009, it was alleged that the firm had made nearly 300 transfers in the name of Iqbal, who probably had never set his foot in Italy. The Italian police, while concluding the probe, had said the Brescia-based company made several transfers using the identity of innocent, unsuspecting persons, whose identity cards or passports might have been stolen.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/virtual-sim-cards-new-headache-for-security-agencies-in-kashmir-897127.html

They were identified as Makhan Singh Gill alias Amli and Davinder Singh alias Happy, both residents of Noorpur Jattan village in Hoshiarpur, Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said. Police have seized two sophisticated arms and ammunition, including one MP5 sub-machine gun (with two magazines and 30 live rounds) and one 9mm pistol (with two magazines and 30 live rounds), besides a white colour car, four mobile phones and an internet dongle from their possession, Gupta said in a statement. The DGP said based on inputs about the disruptive designs of certain pro-Khalistan elements, who had plans to disturb peace and communal harmony in the state by launching terror attacks, security forces had launched a major drive in the state to conduct raids and check the movement and whereabouts of members of various terrorist modules busted in the past. “The current breakthrough is the result of these concerted efforts and the drive launched in the recent past,” he added. Gupta said during preliminary investigations, Makhan disclosed that they were in touch with Canada-based Harpreet Singh who had instigated them to raise a terror module in Punjab to carry out killings in the state. “According to Makhan, who has earlier been a close associate of BKI (Babbar Khalsa International) chief Wadhawa Singh, Canada-based Harpreet, a KZF operative, is a frequent visitor to Pakistan and he's a close aide of Pak-based KZF chief Ranjeet Singh alias Neeta,” the DGP said. The arrested accused further disclosed that the arms and ammunition had been arranged for them by Ranjeet Neeta through his associates, he added. “A couple of other foreign-based terrorist handlers from Germany and the USA had also figured in the module, who were involved in transferring funds from abroad to Makhan alias Amli through different money transfer services and other funding channels as well,” Gupta said. The DGP further stated that Makhan was a hardcore pro-Khalistan militant who had been earlier arrested by the Punjab Police for his involvement in smuggling arms consignments into India and various terror-related offences. “Makhan has been trained in Pakistan and he had earlier stayed in the USA during 1980s and 1990s. He has been very closely associated with Pak-based Babbar Khalsa International chief Wadhawa Singh Babbar and stayed with him in Pakistan for over 14 years," he added.  Gupta said a case under various provisions of the IPC, the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act has been registered at Police Station Mahalpur in Hoshiarpur district against the accused. He said Makhan had been engaging in various terror and other criminal activities in the past. As many as seven cases had been earlier registered against him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-police-busts-khalistan-zindabad-force-terror-module-2-arrested-897131.html

Gandhi arrived here for holding tractor rallies across Punjab from October 4 till 6. The rallies, which have been named 'Kheti Bachao Yatra', would cover more than 50 km, spread over three days in various districts and constituencies. Sidhu's participation in the rally came three days after All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat met him at his residence in Amritsar. After the meeting, Rawat had said that the cricketer-turned-politician would attend tractor rallies. Addressing a public gathering here, Sidhu slammed the BJP-led Centre over the farm laws and dubbed them as an "attack on federal structure" and alleged the central government was being run by "capitalists". "They are robbing our rights," he said, adding that the Centre had imposed a "system" which had failed in Europe and the US. He said these new legislations would adversely affect five lakh labourers and 30,000 ''arthiyas'' (commission agents). Sidhu said that the Punjab government should give minimum support price (MSP) on pulses and oilseeds and set up infrastructure for storage of crops. Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, had stayed away from all Congress activities ever since he resigned as cabinet minister last year. However, Sidhu last month had staged a protest against the farm bills in Amritsar but without Congress' flags. He had described the farm bills as an "attack on the federal structure" and had also said these "black laws" would "ruin" the farming community. Sidhu, MLA from Amritsar East seat, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June last year. The chief minister had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio. However, Sidhu had refused to assume the charge and resigned. The tension between the Punjab chief minister and Sidhu had come out in the open in May last year when Singh had blamed Sidhu for the "inept handling" of the Local Government Department, claiming that it had resulted in "poor performance" of the Congress in urban areas in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Singh had taken umbrage at Sidhu's "friendly match" jibe during electioneering in Bathinda on May 17. Sidhu had allegedly cornered the Congress government in the state over the issue of the desecration of religious texts, questioning why no FIR was lodged against the Badals, who ran the previous government in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/navjot-sidhu-attends-rahul-gandhi-led-tractor-rally-in-punjabs-moga-897144.html

An inference without material support cannot lead to a conviction. In all crimes, the ingredient of Mens Rea (mental elements) cannot be assumed to be present, but it has to be visible and conspicuous, a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said that while acquitting Gurcharan Singh, a man from Barnala, Punjab in the case of abetment to his wife's suicide, Shinder Kaur, a mother of two infants, in 1997. The court said the trial court and the High Court erred in concluding that the deceased was driven to commit suicide, by "the circumstances or atmosphere in the matrimonial home". This is nothing more than an inference, without any material support, which cannot form the basis of conviction under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the IPC, the bench said. The top court said the trial court and the High Court speculated on the unnatural death and without any evidence concluded only through conjectures, that the appellant is guilty. "Insofar as the possible reason for a young married lady with two minor children committing suicide, in the absence of evidence, conjectures cannot be drawn that she was pushed to take her life, by the circumstances and atmosphere in the matrimonial home," the court said. "What might have been the level of expectation of the deceased from her husband and in-laws and the degree of her frustration, if any, is not found through any evidence on record. More significantly, wilful negligence by the husband could not be shown by the prosecution," the bench added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/man-cant-be-convicted-of-wifes-suicide-merely-on-speculation-sc-897154.html

04-10-2020||North and Central||Bihar Assembly Elections: Foundation for LJP’s ‘go solo’ policy was laid in Nov 2019||The LJP Parliamentary Party may have decided on Sunday to not have any truck with Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) for the Bihar polls and contest the Assembly election on its own, but the foundation of ‘ekla chalo re’ (go solo) was laid by LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan in November 2019 itself. During the coronation of his son Chirag Paswan, who took over as LJP president from his father in November 2019, when Paswan’s pocket organisation was celebrating its 20th foundation day, the senior Paswan said, “My son has all the qualities to be the chief minister of Bihar. His time will come... I will suggest him to focus on 2025, not the 2020 Assembly polls. And someday, I am sure, Chirag will prove to be one of the best CM the state has ever produced.” Three months after this event, Chirag decided to take out his ‘rath yatra’ touring the entire state with the slogan: “Bihar first, Bihari first”. However, the breakout of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown in March-end forced him to abandon his yatra midway, but he never hesitated to take potshots at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, despite the fact that the LJP was part of the BJP-led NDA and an ally of the JD (U). The two-time LJP MP from Naxal-infested Jamui reserved parliamentary constituency, Chirag slammed Nitish in no uncertain terms and held him solely responsible for the poor law and order in Bihar, besides taking jibe on the migrants’ plight and mishandling of Covid-19 pandemic in the state. "All throughout the LJP criticism, Nitish looked amused as Ram Vilas Paswan never intervened to stop his son from ridiculing the Bihar chief minister in public. By July 2020, it was almost certain that the two NDA allies - the JD (U) and the LJP - were heading for an imminent split," a senior ruling party source told DH. Meanwhile, the BJP leaders, in private, could not hide their glee each time Chirag lashed out at Nitish. On October 4, when the LJP decided to field its candidates against all the JD(U) nominees, and at the same time stay in alliance with the BJP, it corroborated the theory that a larger game-plan was underway for long to weaken Nitish, although he was always projected as the NDA chief-ministerial candidate by the top BJP leadership.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bihar-assembly-elections-foundation-for-ljp-s-go-solo-policy-was-laid-in-nov-2019-897171.html

Carrying placards and banners, the protesters held the demonstration at Press Enclave here and raised slogans against the perpetrators of the heinous crime, a CITU spokesperson said. He said the burial of the alleged gang-rape victim in Hathras without her family's consent was a blatant denial of justice. "This barbaric caste-based rape crime is reflective of the utter lawlessness in UP under the BJP government and the patronage given to casteist and reactionary forces leading to a big increase in crimes against Dalits and women. The recent NCRB report confirms this," the spokesperson said. The protesters demanded immediate resignation of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while also calling for the arrest of police personnel who refused to file an FIR and against those responsible for the cruel act of forcible cremation. They said the culprits responsible for the rape and murder should be hanged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/citu-affiliated-trade-unions-in-srinagar-protest-against-hathras-incident-897190.html

The forthcoming meeting of the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will be the seventh after the stand-off between the two sides started five months ago. This is also going to be the first after the two sides agreed to pause build-up along the LAC. Lt. Gen. Harinder Singh, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 14 Corps of the Indian Army, and Maj Gen Liu Lin of the Chinese PLA will meet at Chushul close to the LAC on October 12, sources in New Delhi said. This is going to be the last meeting Lt. Gen. Singh will have with his counterpart in the Chinese PLA before completing his term as the commander of the 14 Corps of the Indian Army. His successor Lt Gen PG K Menon had joined him in the last meeting with Major General Liu on September 21 and would do so in the seventh meeting also. The last meeting saw both sides agreeing to stop sending more soldiers to the face-off points along the disputed boundary between the two nations in eastern Ladakh. They, however, could not end the stalemate over the withdrawal of large numbers of troops the two sides already deployed since the stand-off started. The diplomats of India and China had a video conference last Wednesday and agreed that while the senior military commanders would meet again soon, the ground commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA would keep in touch to avoid any misunderstanding and to maintain stability along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ladakh-row-india-china-senior-military-commanders-to-meet-again-on-october-12-897208.html

Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava said as per preliminary information, Madkam Ramesh alias Gonche Ramesh (50), a member of the Kerlapal area committee of the outlawed group, was showing symptoms of the infection and died Saturday evening. He was active along the border of Dantewada and Sukma districts, Pallava said. “He was reportedly suffering from fever and breathlessness following which he was shifted by the ultras from Kerlapal to his native Jagargunda in Sukma where he succumbed. His body was handed over to his family for cremation,” the SP told PTI. “According to villagers, he was showing symptoms of Covid-19 though inputs suggest he was not tested for it. Any sudden death with fever and breathlessness is deemed to be a suspected Covid-19 death till tests are done”, Pallava said. Ramesh was heading a local organisation squad of the Maoists as "commander" and had a reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head, he said. Expressing concern over the possible spread of Covid-19 in the interior areas of Bastar division due to Maoist activities, Pallava said Naxals were not following norms in place for the pandemic and were moving about without masks and convening meetings of villagers ignoring social distancing. “Negligence on the part of Naxals could cause the infection to spread across the interiors of Bastar region, which lack proper health infrastructure," the SP said. As on Saturday, Bastar division, comprising seven districts including Dantewada, has 15,081 Covid-19 cases, while 60 have died due to the infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chhattisgarh-naxal-commander-dies-of-suspected-covid-19-cops-897224.html

04-10-2020||Opinion||World has much to gain by having India sit in the UNSC||In a well-articulated speech on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations (UN), Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for a permanent seat for India in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). One of the six important decision-making organs of the UN, the UNSC is the only United Nations body that can boast of having the power to issue resolutions that are binding on members. The UNSC also alone has the power to admit new members to the General Assembly (UNGA). The last time a new member was taken on board as member of the UNGA was when South Sudan was admitted in 2011 as the 193rd member-country. The road to freedom was not an easy one for South Sudan. Prime Minister Modi has rightly raised the question of the UN’s role in Africa, especially in light of the history of South Sudan -- beleaguered by civil war, struggling with tens of thousands of refugees designated as “internally displaced persons”. His words, “Hundreds and thousands of children who would have otherwise enriched this world with their presence have left us prematurely. So many people have lost their entire life savings and have become homeless refugees,” should shake the conscience of the august body. Has the UN made sufficient efforts to tackle these issues? The subject of carrying out reforms in the structure and the working of the UN Security Council on a priority basis has been raised by India on earlier occasions, too. Many other countries, especially those who are also aspirants, such as Germany, Japan and Brazil, have supported New Delhi in its quest for reform in the hope that the UNSC will truly become a much larger and more representative body of the present and future world order. There has been little or no effort on the part of the UN, or rather on the part of the P-5 – the US, Russia, China, France and Britain --to expand its membership and make it a more representative body. Prime Minister Modi’s words, “Reform in the responses, in the processes, and in the very character of the United Nations is the need of the hour” assume importance in this context. The world had to see more than 60 million deaths in the largest conflict in human history before humanity came to its senses and the failed League of Nations gave way to the United Nations. The world managed to move on, in part thanks to the UN, but has become more complex and complicated since then. While the probability of conflicts using conventional military force between equals or near-equal powers has reduced considerably, it is once again in the throes of Great Power competition and rising nationalisms. Strategic objectives are increasingly being sought to be achieved through coercive policies. Even ostensibly economic programmes like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and other non-conventional tools are being employed in their service. The UNSC, along with other institutions under the aegis of the UN, has the utmost responsibility of ensuring peace, resolving conflicts and guaranteeing the security of member-countries from conventional and non-conventional threats. True, thanks in part to the UN, the world has not seen a third World War. But what about the dozen flash points that persist across the world, the transgression of sovereignty of weaker states by stronger ones, terrorism -- State-sponsored or otherwise -- that has snuffed out thousands of innocent lives? Has the UN been able to rein in even one errant State that has evidently been using terrorism as an instrument of policy and waging a proxy war with impunity? The Prime Minister has rightly questioned the UN’s inadequacy in dealing with the menace of terrorism. Even as the world was grappling with numerous other problems of national and human security, the Covid-19 pandemic hit humanity hard, crippling economies and healthcare systems, and restricting free movement of goods and people. With nearly 35 million Covid-19 cases and over a million deaths worldwide so far and no sign of the pandemic slowing down, there is an urgent need for a global coalition to develop methods and technologies to mitigate its spread and the resultant suffering. As the Prime Minister emphasised in his speech, India has never hesitated in sharing its experiences in any field. Even during the pandemic, India was probably the only country that shipped essential medicines to more than 150 countries around the world. This gesture came at a time when even the developed countries gave up on the principle of serving all of humanity and adopted selfish attitudes. China concealed information about the coronavirus because it could not think beyond the damage transparency would do to its regime, and ended up exporting the virus to the whole world; the US reportedly used the Defence Production Act to prevent exports of N-95 masks to Canada and Latin America. The Prime Minister therefore rightly emphasised the spirit of viewing the world as one family. He assured the world that “as the largest vaccine-producing country, India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.” It is time for the world to realise the importance of looking at the world as one family, and at India as one large part of that family. It has much to gain by giving India its due and having it sit in the UN Security Council at a time when it is faced with superpower competition, receding globalism and the pandemic and many other non-conventional threats to the security of humans and humanity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/world-has-much-to-gain-by-having-india-sit-in-the-unsc-896902.html
04-10-2020||Opinion||Digital economy: You click, they know||Have you ever wondered why you are ever so inclined to click on some eye-catching advertisement on the web offering special deals such as ‘bogo’ (buy one, get one) or a free gift card, good at certain stores only, for consenting to participate in a survey? If you would like to know the answer, and the answer is indeed quite involved, perhaps you should read the rest of this article. Let me first introduce you to one remarkably prescient author, Vance Packard, now largely faded from memory. In a series of writings in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Packard foresaw all of what is currently taking place in the social media-intoxicated internet world. Back then, there was no internet and the relatively few computers in existence were exclusively in the hands of government agencies and certain large corporations. Among the many seminal works of Packard, three are of special import -- The Hidden Persuaders (1957), The Waste Makers (1960) and The Naked Society (1964). The Hidden Persuaders details how American society had become addicted to consumerism, mostly attributable to mass merchandising campaigns conducted by advertising companies through broadcast media and the film industry. Consumerism, a viral disease that has now been successfully exported to the rest of the world through smartphones and social media, a disease for which a successful vaccine, I am quite convinced, can never be found. The Waste Makers is an exposition of the role played by planned obsolescence in driving economic growth – the principal reason behind why companies are always coming up with ‘new and improved’ versions of whatever products they have to offer in the marketplace in order to stay profitable and stay relevant. Why settle for the iPhone 10 which you currently own when your friends have moved on to the 13th generation iPhone SE 2020? Even version 15, which may be just a few weeks away, to upstage your pals and stay relevant. Isn’t the software on your digital devices constantly being updated, whether you like it or not? Not to mention the dire warnings that pop up when the update notices are displayed, if only to force you to act. The essay The Naked Society explores the drastic alteration of American character and culture from one that prized self-restraint and loyalty to high standards and presented heroes for emulation to one that has been replaced by a commercially fabricated ‘culture’ of infotainment in which nothing seems to matter but the economy. According to Packard, people buy products to satisfy eight compelling needs, most of which have to do with a sense of self-worth, ego gratification, a desire to be ‘in control’ and be heard, a love of objects and a sense of community. Since each of us is unique, our social media postings and web browsing activities provide extensive clues on who we are. Which is where the business models of Google, Facebook and other social media platforms come into the picture since they are the ones monitoring their users. In the words of one social media executive, “We look to understand who a person is, based on where they’ve been and where they’re going, in order to influence what they’re going to do next.” Advertisers are willing to pay millions of dollars to Google, Facebook and other data brokers for precisely this type of information. Since there is no basic consumer privacy law in most countries (The European Union is an exception), every individual is responsible for navigating the entire surveillance-economy complex on their own. Legislation such as the explicit Right to Information (RTI) Act ensures a certain measure of transparency in government operations; this stands in sharp contrast to the implicit RTI that the IT behemoths currently enjoy because their services are ‘free’. Huge amounts of money can be made consolidating everything that is known about an individual. While our private persona is very different from our ‘always watched’ public persona, over passage of time, our private and public persona merge, just in time to join the millions who have already made the transition. There is no such thing as a free lunch, is there?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/digital-economy-you-click-they-know-896904.html
04-10-2020||Opinion||The apathy of power||Two weeks ago, on the opening day of the monsoon session of Parliament, the Union Minister of Labour Santosh Kumar Gangwar clarified that his ministry had “no data” on the number of migrant workers who had lost their jobs or had died on the way to their home states after the lockdown was announced in late March. Therefore, he added, the question of offering economic assistance to those who had lost their lives didn’t arise. There was little concern about how such vital data could have gone unrecorded, what his ministry would now do to make up for it, how every life lost was a failing of his government. The labour minister’s callousness appears characteristic of most actions of the present Union government. Whether it is the new farm laws or the labour code bills or the Environment Impact Assessment notification, all of which are known to be detrimental in their impact, the government is showing no signs of reconsidering them. If it truly believed in their value, it must feel confident to invite a discussion on each of them in the legislature. While draft bills can only benefit from extended deliberations before they become an Act, the central government is passing them swiftly into law without offering scope for discussion. These legislations have been held to be pro-business in their design. It is no surprise that modern businesses wish to work where regulations are few and workers and the environment can be played with at will. But governments should not let that be since the well-being of the country and its people takes priority. At least, this is what we expect democracies to be and each time a government acts contrarily, there is disquiet and resistance against it, signifying a continuing faith in a democratic polity. So, even on this occasion, the farmers and organised workers, including those from outfits affiliated with the ruling party, like Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, have risen up in protest, adding to the several major protests seen in recent years. Last year, farmer protests stopped India from becoming a signatory to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Planning, which would have hurt rural livelihoods through the cheap import of dairy products, fish, rubber and pepper from Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. The anti-CAA protests followed soon thereafter. Besides, the lynchings of Muslims, the arbitrary arrests of social activists and intellectuals, to name only a few recent issues that erode the citizenship rights of Indians, also kept the polity under strain. At a time when the country needs to see every possible effort in containing the pandemic and reviving the economy, why a government would want to push unwelcome laws is indeed baffling. Does the ruling party expect its actions to find new voter support? Or satisfy its voter support base? It’s hard to tell the thinking. The CBI court’s acquittal of all those accused as conspirators in the destruction of the Babri Masjid and the Uttar Pradesh government’s crude response to the horrific rape and murder incident accentuate the moral crisis in Indian politics. The recent bad turns in India’s polity have probably bewildered everyone who had felt certain that politics unfolded within tolerable limits, with the lack of a determined political opposition at the centre being a source of despair alongside. Bad times though throw up their own set of social duties to keep at in one’s sphere of activity. It obliges everyone to ask of themselves what these might be and stay morally active and make the electoral system respond to an ethically demanding society.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-apathy-of-power-896907.html

Its name is euphemistic, since few Indians like to call a spade a spade (see ‘eve-teasing’ and ‘outraging a woman’s modesty’). This recipe is so popular that you can be sure that on average 90 times every day—that we know of—some Indian man, somewhere, is cooking a woman’s goose. The basic dish is simple: Take a woman against her will, dominate her, and pierce her flesh with whatever is at hand—a penis is a convenient favourite, but it could be anything, really. She will release a mix of fear, pain, misery, humiliation, rage, and grief. Check your humanity thermometer—when it hits zero, she’s done. Cover up the whole thing and let the heat subside, and serve up to your friends, or show it off on social media. It is a household staple in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, but a favourite all over India. Ingredients are commonplace and usable at any stage of development. A sexually mature woman is fine, but almost a third of men use children (some as young as a few weeks old); and a woman in her 90s has served equally well (Delhi, September 2020). About 94% of men know their ingredient personally, so Babu’s your uncle! Often literally. There is a preparation for every occasion. Woman’s goose is cooked as a complement to communal killings, like in Noakhali in 1946, or Gujarat in 2002. It is a favourite of hostile army personnel, as it was in the Kunan Poshpora (Kashmir) in 1991. It can be a midnight snack, or a post-drink nightcap, like in Delhi in 2012. Woman’s goose is cooked as vengeance, like Bhanwari Devi’s in Rajasthan in 1992, after she opposed a child marriage, or the eight-year-old in Kathua. It is cooked to commemorate spurned love, though acid is a popular alternative. It can be cooked because you’re mad at a man or, like smoking, it can just kill time. It is 100% cooked to establish that men can cook it, and women shouldn’t forget it. Penises are a favourite prop, friends’ and families’ welcome. But men have also used a dog chain to choke the victim (Aruna Shaunbag remained in a vegetative state for 42 years) or an iron rod (which eviscerated Nirbhaya). People have presented their work variously: hung two teenage rape victims from the trees in Badaun in 2014; chopped a 19-year-old daughter into two in Gorakhpur, 2019, for resisting her rapist father who (get this) doubted her character; shot Thangjam Manorama in the genitals, post-rape and torture, in Manipur, 2004; stabbed and burnt alive the Unnao victim in 2019. Most men who cook a woman’s goose just get on with their lives. Women who object usually have to appeal to other men, most of whom don’t see what the fuss is about. But these days, women are getting louder, so now the police just burn the body along with due process on the same pyre, ignited with petrol, in a field, in the middle of the night, while the family is threatened and locked up, the press barricaded with their phones tapped, and opposition leaders manhandled and arrested; then they deny rape, via a public relations firm. All to protect the upper caste cooks of a Dalit woman’s goose (Hathras, 2020). Those who call this barbaric, revolting, heinous—you don’t understand the power of tradition, or the traditions of power. Just stick to pasta.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-indian-men-cook-a-woman-s-goose-896908.html
04-10-2020||Opinion||‘Being a hunter-gatherer’ in the age of AI||On February 28, I gave a TEDx talk on “being a hunter-gatherer in the age of intelligent machines.” Little did I know that, very soon, Covid-19 would virtually make us live the life of hunter-gatherers. For the past six months, we have lived in small tribes, dressed down, stopped shaving, worked from home, found local sources of food, found time to cook, connected better with families, travelled mostly where our feet take us, slept early, told stories on zoom, and generally lived a life that would have been recognizable to hunter-gatherers from the early age of human existence. I hope we retain some of these aspects post-Covid-19. However, the TEDx talk was more focused on climate change, technology, and evolutionary human behaviour. For over 200,000 years, our human ancestors evolved as hunter-gatherers. We have been large-scale farmers for 12,000 years, and industrial workers for just 250 years. Human behaviour in the 21st century, at an epigenetic level, is still modeled after our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The historian-author Yuval Harari eloquently debates modern lifestyles versus hunter-gatherer lifestyles through multiple lenses, including that of human happiness. He nuances human happiness, power, and prosperity. Harari also talks extensively about the impact modern lifestyle has on the ecological equilibrium and hence the potential destruction of human prosperity due to reckless consumption. A good way to discuss the impact of future lifestyles might be to discuss human responsibility and human fulfilment alongside human happiness. And a specific way to discuss the topic of future lifestyles might be about bringing in the hunter-gatherer lifestyle into the world of intelligent machines. Talking about the world of intelligent machines, folks such as Elon Musk and even Harari have an alarmist view which I do not share. Artificial intelligence (AI) that powers intelligent machines is a technical tool. I have leveraged AI right from 1990 as a graduate student funded by NASA, all the way to my current role as the founder of an AI company changing the way videos will be consumed. Over the recent years, AI has particularly accelerated in development due to the availability of less-expensive computational power. Certain algorithms, such as the convolution neural network, have enabled better ways to deal with data such as images. However, AI is still a tool to accomplish specific tasks based on training with historic data. Unsupervised learning techniques have also existed for a long time and are certainly evolving. General AI tools such as GPT-3 have, so far, performed nothing more than parlour tricks for those who are eager to be impressed. Of course, AI will automate a lot more in the coming years but will remain a tool in human hands and will certainly influence human lifestyles. As intelligent machines free up our time from dreary tasks, can we go forward to a lifestyle that gives us a sense of long-term fulfilment while also enjoying the short-term happiness provided by technology? Can we have a lifestyle that is sensitive to the ecological balance while continuing to gain increased power of knowledge? The 8-hour workday, and 5-day workweek is already a vestige of the first industrial revolution, which is now reserved for developing economies. A hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the age of intelligent machines would mean work for pay three days a week; continuous learning; being a storyteller, artist; having deep relationships, leverageable weak ties; being connected with the planet; being a custodian, not an owner; slow cooking, slow digesting food; being a low-impact traveller, walking; being in the moment (time and space); leading a full life, a contented life. That sounds fantastic, but will we go down this path or again consume ourselves with an ever-increasing appetite for prosperity and power at the cost of the future of the planet remains to be seen.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/being-a-hunter-gatherer-in-the-age-of-ai-896918.html

Official sources identified the deceased as Lieutenant Rajeev Jha and sailor Sunil Kumar, who was a Petty officer (Electrical Air). "The naval power glider which was on a routine training sortie met with the mishap. It took off from INS Garuda and crashed near Thoppumpady bridge near the naval base at 7 am. Though the officials were rushed to Navy Hospital Sanjivani they have declared brought dead. The glider is being salvaged. A Board of Inquiry has been ordered by the Southern Naval Command into the incident,"(sic) an official said in a statement. While official confirmation on the whereabouts of the dead officers was still awaited, it was learnt that Jha, aged 39, is a native of Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Kumar, aged 29, is a native of Bihar. Rajeev Jha is married and has two kids. According to local sources, there was no one at the spot where the glider crashed. The cause for the mishap is unknown. It was suspected that the glider crashed while returning after training.

Muziris flourished after the fall of Egypt to Rome and was a pivotal trading area between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Trade of pepper, precious stones, ivory, pottery from Muziris to West Asia and Rome was the norm.  Muziris lost its sheen not much later, either due to the decline of the Roman empire or due to the silting of its harbours by a flood.  The ring could have reached modern-day Pattanam, through traders or through merchants. Several thousand seals would have been in existence during the time, each authorised by the emperor and used on his behalf.  Another possibility is that the seal was produced in Pattanam itself.  “Wastage of the banded agate precious stone (on which the Sphinx was carved) was found in the same trench, along with cameo blanks, indicating that there was a lapidary workshop in Pattanam 2,000 years ago,” P J Cherian told the publication.  The 66 trenches excavated in the village so far constitute less than 1 per cent of the 111 acres of the Pattanam archaeological mound.  The mammoth task of working through it lies ahead of Cherian and his team.  “A beautiful world where there was openness of mind. We are yet to find a weapon in Pattanam,” Cherian told the publication when asked about how he envisioned Muziris.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/class-12-student-stumbles-upon-stone-linking-kerala-with-roman-empire-897012.html

Though in the past there were discussions in society about closure of government schools, now these were being improved, resulting in them attracting more students, he said. Vijayan was speaking after dedicating 90 schools as Centres of Excellence and laying the foundation stone virtually for 54 school buildingson Saturday as part of the government's Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign to protect the public education system in the state. He said the government was implementing changes in the field of school education keeping in mind the next generation. "In the past, society discussed the closure of government schools but now that they have become centres of excellence, the number of students coming to study has also increased. Five lakh new students have joined government schools in the last three years", he said. Through the Public Education Protection campaign, the state government aimed at making government schools as centres of overall excellence. Vijayan said the move was supported by local bodies, people's representatives, teachers, parents, alumni and other interested parties and the campaign has changed the old mindset of society about government schools. The state government has taken up the Centres of Excellence project under the Public Education Rejuvenation Campaign of the General Education Department to elevate schools to high educational standards, considering their requirements over a 20-year horizon. The Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE), under the state government, is approaching this objective with a holistic approach. This included improvement in pedagogy shift from teacher-centric to student centric approach, technological interventions high-tech classrooms and academic content creation and upgradation of physical infrastructure extra- curricular infrastructure and school hygiene, sanitation and security. Of the 90 Centres of Excellence inaugurated, buildings for four have been constructed at a cost of Rs five crores with funding from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), 20 were built a cost of Rs three crores, 62 buildings were built using plan funds and four buildings were constructed with assistance from NABARD. Vijayan said new buildings for 34 schools would be constructed at a cost of Rs three crore each with KIIFB funding and 20 at a cost of Rs 40 crores from the plan fund. The schools dedicated on Saturday are spread across the state in 13 districts and those proposed would be located in ten districts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/government-schools-in-kerala-drawing-more-students-thanks-to-rejuvenation-campaign-cm-897087.html

Southern Railway officials said that while the matter does not come under their purview, it has, however, been 'flagged' with IRCTC, the authorised e-ticketing agency. DMK MP from South Chennai, Thamizhachi Thangapandian, took to Twitter to share a screenshot of the SMS purportedly received in Hindi. "The #GovernmentofIndia despite its promises to not impose Hindi, continues to impose the language through insidious means. Stop forcing Hindi on the non-Hindi speaking states," she said. In a series of tweets, she tagged the Railway Ministry and urged it to take urgent steps to ensure non- Hindi speakers are also able to access the IRCTC services. "#StopHindiImposition," she added. Party MP Kanimozhi also criticised the alleged Hindi imposition. "They are not respecting people's feelings and are repeatedly imposing Hindi," she said in an apparent reference to the Centre. "People (in TN) cannot read what is mentioned in the SMS since it is in Hindi," she told reporters at the airport here and warned of "serious repercussions" due to such incidents. PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss, whose party is an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre, alleged that SMSes for e- tickets in Tamil Nadu are "being sent in Hindi for the last two days." "This is a planned imposition of Hindi on non-Hindi speaking people. The Railways should stop this," he said in a tweet. He demanded action against those behind this and urged that all Central government related announcements in Tamil Nadu must be released only in Tamil and English. A Southern Railway official, when contacted, said that e-ticketing is handled by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) and that the matter has been 'flagged' with it. Allged Hindi imposition has been a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu for long. The DMK had successfully heralded an anti-Hindi agitation in the 1960s, before coming to power for the first time in 1967. Even recently, both the ruling AIADMK and DMK have opposed the Centre's New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, with the former having rejected the three language formula proposed in it. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami had announced that his government will only follow the two-language system--Tamil and English.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-mp-pmk-criticise-rail-users-getting-ticket-confirmation-sms-in-hindi-897139.html

The system, commissioned on October 1, would facilitate the crossing of trains at Yedakumari and Kadagaravalli stations in the Sakaleshpur-Subramanya road section of the ghat stretch. The new system would increase the train-handling capacity in the section by 35 per cent, a press release from the Mysuru division of the SWR said. Earlier, no train could enter the 55-km ghat section when another train was passing through. With the new system, trains from both the directions can cross at the two stations thereby enhancing the line capacity of the section. The project with multi-section digital axle counter technology was executed at a cost of Rs 4.4 crore by the Hassan-Mangaluru rail development company. Restrictions on the crossing of trains on the ghat section imposed by the railway safety commissioner due to the non- availability of catch-siding at the two stations was the main hurdle to operate more freight and passenger trains in the route. The signaling project work, which started in June, was executed in a record time of three months. The work was completed by September-end as was expected, the release said. SWR Mysuru divisions senior divisional signal and telecommunication engineer D Sreenivasulu led the project team. Mysuru divisional railway manager Aparna Garg complimented the team and said she was confident that the introduction of the new safety protocol would pave the way for safer and more efficient train operations in the ghat section.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/railways-upgrade-signal-system-in-ghat-section-897150.html

R L V Ramakrishnan, who is a known classical dance performer, was found in an unconscious state near his house at Chalakkudy in Thrissur district in Kerala on Saturday evening. He had been staging a protest against KSNA alleging that he was denied the chance to perform in an online programme of KSNA on the grounds that he is from the Dalit community. Ramakrishnan, who is the brother of known actor Kalabhavan Mani who died a few years back, had staged a protest in front of KSNA at Thrissur last week alleging that a top official of KSNA told him that if he was allowed to perform in the programme it would affect the image of the programme and would invite criticisms. Several Dalit outfits had also backed him. But KSNA chairperson Lalitha, who is also a popular actor known as KPAC Lalitha, denied the allegation maintaining that applications were not even invited for the event. Ramakrishnan was also learnt to have stuck to the allegation against KSNA in his statement to police. But the police have not registered any case so far even as many mainstream political parties and Dalit outfits demanded a detailed probe. Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP state president K Surendran demanded stern action against those responsible for the incident. Chennithala said that the government should initiate a detailed probe into the allegations of discrimination coming up against KSNA. Police sources said that as per the existing norms, there was no scope for registering the case for attempt to suicide. But if there is a specific complaint of discrimination on the basis of caste, a case could be registered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dancers-bid-to-end-life-triggers-casteism-row-in-kerala-897157.html

While announcing the candlelight vigil, DMK President M K Stalin also demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government tender an unconditional apology to former Congress President Rahul Gandhi who was pushed to the ground by policemen during an argument. He also condemned the UP police’s behaviour towards Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border on Saturday. “The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh should take full responsibility for the cover-up in the Hathras incident and for the behaviour of the state police towards Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. Union Home Minister Amit Shah should also make his stand clear on the incident. The UP government should ask for a probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge on the incident,” Stalin said. He also said that the police’s behaviour towards Rahul Gandhi should be referred to the Privileges Committee of the Lok Sabha as he is a member of the House. Stalin also alleged that the safety of minorities, women and people belonging to Scheduled Caste was a question mark in Uttar Pradesh. Stalin announced that Kanimozhi, as head of the DMK’s women’s wing, will lead a candlelight march from Rajiv Gandhi statue in Guindy to Raj Bhavan on Monday. The DMK president will flag off the march. In a separate statement, Kanimozhi asked members of the women’s wing to participate in the candlelight march.

Participation of Smitha Menon, a Kochi based PR professional, at the Indian Ocean Rim Association of Ministers held in UAE in November 2019, has now triggered the row with Loktantrik Yuva Janata Dal president Saleem Madavoor petitioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that it involved protocol violation. While Muraleedharan tried to evade a direct reply to the allegations, Smitha said in a social media post that Muraleedhran had permitted her to attend the event's concluding day after she expressed her professional desire to cover the international event and she went at her own expense. Though the post was aimed at clearing the air, Muraleedhran's rival camps are now making use of it to target him for permitting the PR personnel to attend the event. Muraleedhran tried to wriggle out of the row maintaining that had any other media professional sought permission, they might have been also allowed.

Allegations from BJP camps of adjustment politics with the ruling CPM and resentment within the Congress for deciding to keep off from public stirs seem to have compelled the party to revoke the decision. Congress leader M M Hassan, who was recently made the UDF convenor, announced on Sunday that protests against government by strictly following social distancing norms would be carried out. The first such protest will be on October 12 with five party workers staging a protest against the government at all constituencies across the state. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala announced the decision to keep off from public stirs last week close on the heels of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan accusing the opposition parties of triggering the Covid-19 spread by conducting stirs without following social distancing. Over 150 police personnel involved in dealing with violent protests and many activists also tested Covid positive. But BJP state leadership had maintained that it would continue the stirs by following social distancing norms and also alleged that Congress and CPM were involved in adjustment politics in Kerala especially in view of their alliances at the national level. This triggered unrest with the Congress and senior leaders including Lok Sabha MP K Muraleedharan who openly flayed the decision to keep off from public stirs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/congress-to-resume-protests-in-kerala-amid-covid-19-surge-897211.html

Panneerselvam, who is camping in his native district of Theni since Saturday, is expected to return here on Monday for further talks with his supporters and interlocutors who are trying to resolve issues between him and Palaniswami. In Chennai, Palaniswami held back-to-back consultations with three ministers, including two from the Western Tamil Nadu region from where he hails, fueling speculation on the October 7 meeting.  On Sunday, the deputy chief minister also sent a political message by inspecting the site where a statue is being built for Mookaiya Thevar, a prominent person from the dominant Mukulathor community to which he belongs to. Though in his native district, Panneerselvam, who feels sidelined within the AIADMK, continued to receive visitors, including local leaders, for the past two days. On Saturday, Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar met him ostensibly to invite him to inspect the statue site of Mookaiya Thevar, but OPS is understood to have made his stand clear on the issue. “He is expected to reach Chennai on Monday and we hope there will be more meetings before Wednesday as we have declared that the CM face will be announced on October 7. We are hoping that the two sides will find a common ground and resolve differences,” a senior leader told Deccan Herald. Another leader said that OPS reminded interlocutors that any decision of the party or appointments need to be ratified by him as he is the coordinator of the AIADMK. “He made his stand clear to Udhayakumar and former minister Natham Viswanathan,” he said. As the differences remained unresolved, there was also speculation that the decision might be postponed. Panneerselvam has been expressing his displeasure over the way Palaniswami and several ministers were treating him in the party and government. Sources said the deputy chief minister remains firm on the constitution of a steering committee with 11 members to run the party. However, Palaniswami is opposed to the idea as he feels such a committee would only create more problems within the AIADMK.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/o-panneerselvam-to-reach-chennai-on-october-5-more-meetings-in-the-offing-897240.html

He was 59 and survived by his wife, son and daughter. Srinivas got infected with coronavirus a month ago and was shifted to a corporate hospital for treatment after the initial home isolation period, YSRC sources said. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy expressed shock and grief over Srinivas's death. "Srinivas was a soft spoken and committed party leader. The Dronamraju family always played a key role in North Andhra and the passing away of Srinivas is heartrending," he said in a statement. The Chief Minister conveyed his condolences to the bereaved family. Srinivas served as a Congress MLA twice from Visakhapatnam South. He was the son of veteran Congressman Dronamraju Satyanarayana. Srinivas joined the YSRC ahead of the general elections in 2019, but lost the Visakhapatnam South Assembly seat. He was later made chairman of the newly-constituted Visakhapatnam Metro Region Development Authority.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-ysr-congress-leader-dronamraju-srinivas-succumbs-to-covid-19-897258.html
04-10-2020||State||Service Rules: Govt can't act like East India Company, says Karnataka High Court||The Karnataka High Court has observed that being a model employer, the state government cannot act as the East India Company when dealing with the Service Rules. The court made this observation while setting aside the order cutting short the deputation of an engineer. The state government had posted C B Chikkalagi as assistant executive engineer Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Vijayapur sub-division from his parent Public Works Department (PWD) in June 2017. The RDPR cancelled his deputation and sent him back to his parent department in February 2020. He moved the petition before the high court after the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal (KAT) rejected his application, challenging the order. A division bench of the Kalaburagi bench comprising Justice Krishna S Dixit and Justice P N Desai observed that a borrowing department cannot cut short the tenure of the deputation unilaterally, in the absence of authorisation. The bench said that sending an officer on deputation without prior consultation also involved denigration of the civil servant who needed to be treated with some respect. "It hardly needs to be stated that the government being a model employer cannot act as the East India Company of the bygone days when the conditions of service are broadly regulated by the Service Rules," the bench observed. The court said that Rule 50 of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules provides for a maximum period of five years for deputation. The bench directed the state government to restore the services of the petitioner in RDPR within 15 days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/service-rules-govt-cant-act-like-east-india-company-says-karnataka-high-court-896895.html

However, according to CMO sources, the CM was yet to accept the resignation as a decision would be taken in consultation with the party high command. Yediyurappa is learnt to have told Ravi to attend the national-level BJP office-bearers meeting on October 5 and 6 in Delhi, after which a decision would be announced. “I have resigned as it will be difficult to manage positions simultaneously,” Ravi told reporters on Sunday. Noting that his priority was to fulfill the organisational role offered by the party, he said that a decision on his resignation was left to the high command. Ravi said that he had tendered his resignation on October 2 and would attend the meeting scheduled in Delhi. According to CMO sources, though Ravi’s resignation letter was dated October 2, he met Yediyurappa on Saturday morning to submit his resignation. The CM is awaiting the directions of the BJP high command on the same, sources said. Ravi had indicated that he would step down from the state Cabinet soon after his elevation in the party at the national level. His resignation also opened space in the Cabinet for CM Yediyurappa - who is under pressure to induct new ministers. Ravi’s resignation, when accepted, will increase the number of vacancies in the state Cabinet to 7, allowing the CM to induct more disgruntled leaders in the BJP to the Cabinet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-tourism-minister-c-t-ravi-tenders-resignation-896966.html
04-10-2020||State||Wait continues for more major industries in twin cities Hubballi-Dharwad||The long-pending demand for the establishment of more major industries which generate more employment, and support the growth of smaller industries in the region, especially in Hubballi-Dharwad, had seemed to be getting fulfilled when industrialists signed MoUs to invest Rs 72,000 crore, seven-and-a-half months back. The MoUs signed between various industrialists and the government at the ‘Invest Karnataka-Hubballi’ investors’ meet held in the City on February 14, included proposed investment of around Rs 62,000 crore in Dharwad district alone. However, the lockdown and Covid-19 situation which severely affected the industry sector, hindered investment interests in becoming a reality. With most of the industries in the twin cities being micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), they are waiting for the establishment of more large-scale industries in manufacturing sector here, so that the MSMEs can grow, generating more jobs for locals, and contributing more to the local economy. This dream has remained largely unfulfilled so far. In the much-hyped investors’ meet, MoUs signed for investment in Dharwad district included Rs 50,000 crore plan by Rajesh Exports Limited to set up an electric vehicle and lithium battery manufacturing plant, Rs 3,000 crore investment plan by Natcap Power Private Limited, and Rs 2,060 crore plan by Jettwings Aerospace & Aviation. Approvals The Microfinish Pumps submitted a proposal to Karnataka Udyog Mitra seeking approval to set up a plant on its own land, investing Rs 33.5 crore. This was the first company among those who signed at the investors’ meet, according to sources in the Industries Department. It is also said that Colours Plus, MYK Polymers, and Ionidea have also shown interest in the go ahead with their investment plan. According to Large & Medium Industries & District In-charge Minister Jagadish Shettar, discussion is on with many investors who have signed MoUs, and the response is positive. “Among MoUs signed in Hubballi meet, 25 proposals to set up pharmaceutical units at Kadechur area in Yadgir district, and some proposals for Hubballi-Dharwad,  including Microfinish’s, are approved. Discussion is on with major investors like Rajesh Exports, regarding subsidy, tax concession and other issues,” he noted. “There will be no problem of land for industries, as land required is being developed at Belur-Kotur, Itigatti, and at Mummigatti. Hopes are there about investment by large industries, but it will take time due to Covid situation,” said District Industries Centre (DIC) Deputy Director Shivaputrappa Hosamani. ‘Make local vendors’ Ramesh Patil, who runs the Patil Electrical Works Private Limited, said, “large industries do not maintain inventory now-a-days, and they want daily supply. If they are located in this region itself, it would be easier for SMEs to supply them, and to grow.” Efforts to bring the Hero Motocorp, and Arecelor Mittal to this region were unsuccessful, and investment promises made in previous investors’ meets were not fulfilled. Some existing large industries are not supporting the local vendors. The government should not just attract huge investment, but should also frame guidelines for large industries to handhold local SMEs and procure material from them, Patil added. “Small scale industries which are already severely hit by lockdown and Covid situation can survive only if large industries come here and make local industries their vendors. The government has been urged to set up a plant to manufacture material required for the defence sector, so that SMEs here can be benefited,” said North Karnataka Small-Scale Industries Association (NKSSIA) president N S Biradar. FMCG cluster planned For developing a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) cluster, 500 acre of land is reserved at Mummigatti, and a vision group is also formed under the leadership of Ullas Kamat of Jyoti Labs. However, all said and done, the region is definitely in need of large industries being set up here so as to improve the job opportunities, and for economic prosperity of the people here.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/wait-continues-for-more-major-industries-in-twin-cities-hubballi-dharwad-897018.html

It is one of the oldest rail bridges in the world. The Mysuru division of the South Western Railway (SWR) has decided to preserve the bridge. The bridge, which connects Mysuru and Nanjangud, is damaged and not in use since 2007.  The Mysore division is rich with many such monumental structures.  According to the authorities, trains were running on the bridge for more than 100 years between 1902 and January 2007. With the establishment of a broad-gauge railway link in 2007 by constructing a new bridge, the vintage bridge fell into oblivion. The bridge was built in 1735 by Dalvoy Devaraj and the railway track was laid in 1899. The bridge was built using brick, sand, lime mortar and stone. The engineering marvel, built in Gothic style, is unique in design to accommodate metre gauge railway line parallel to road traffic over a length of 300 metres.  Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), said Indian Railways has vast heritage and is always at the forefront to take necessary measures to preserve it. The DRM, along with engineers, inspected the heritage structure recently and took stock of its condition. She decided to initiate a detailed proposal to protect this structure, duly reflecting its old glory.  The structure will be strengthened, while protecting its heritage look. Measures to illuminate the structure during night and to instal an information board will be taken, she said. The proposal will be submitted to the headquarters for necessary approval of funds. Works will be taken up at the earliest, so that it becomes an attraction to the public during the festive season, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/285-year-old-kabini-rail-cum-road-bridge-near-nanjangud-to-get-facelift-897276.html

In Koppal, Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages closed due to “lingering labour issues”, the government said.  In the remaining 511 large and medium industries, a total of 2.68 lakh people are employed.  Karnataka dropped to the 17th position in the ease of doing business ranking published by the Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) from the 8th position earlier.  “The guidelines used for the rankings are not right and we have challenged the rankings,” Shettar said, adding that several other states had raised objections as well. “The rankings were based on a period when the state witnessed political instability,” the minister said.  The state government has argued that it has consistently figured among the top Indian states in attracting investments.  Since August this year, Karnataka has cleared 147 projects worth Rs 22,110.84 crore with the promise of creating 54,736 jobs. In the State High-Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) meeting held on September 30 under Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, six projects with an estimated investment of Rs 15,544.06 crore and employment potential of 21,028 jobs were cleared.  The State Level Single Window Clearance Committee (SLSWCC) headed by Shettar, during its meetings on August 19 and October 1 approved 141 projects worth Rs 6,566.78 crore with a potential to generate 33,708 jobs.  The government said it cannot reveal more details due to the election model code of conduct.  “Now that we have amended the Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, we are confident that our ease of doing business rank will improve,” Shettar said.  The amended law provides temporary clearances to establish industries and companies will get three years to apply for various clearances. The government is also working on automated trade licence renewal and streamlining industrial inspections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/31-large-industries-closed-in-3-years-many-in-north-karnataka-govt-896930.html

She and her father, who was with the JD(S), were formally inducted into the party by Congress state chief D K Shivakumar. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and former deputy chief minister Dr G Parameshwara were present on the occasion, party sources said. Kusuma's entry into the party comes amid speculations that Congress would field her from Rajarajeshwari Nagar (R R Nagar) in the city, which goes for the bypolls on November 3. The R R Nagar seat fell vacant following the disqualification of N Munirathna, who was then the party legislator, under the anti-defection law. He is now with the BJP and is looking for a ticket from the saffron party for the bypolls. R R Nagar, along with Sira assembly constituency in Tumakuru, will go for the bypolls on November 3. Shivakumar told reporters that the list of probable candidates would be sent to the high command, which would take the final call. He urged party workers to work hard to ensure the victory of the party in the election. Kusuma's father Hanumantharayappa had contested from R R Nagar on a JD(S) ticket earlier and had lost.

Of the 17,453 RTE seats earmarked for the academic year 2020-21, as many as 13,773 seats have remained unfilled, so far. According to Education department sources, 7,353 students had applied for the RTE seats this year, of which only 3,680 of them have taken admission under the quota. There are hardly any takers for the RTE seats in aided and unaided Kannada medium schools. Even many seats under the quota in English medium schools are lying vacant. Also, the lockdown and the large-scale migration in these testing times, have hit RTE admissions. “With a surge in Covid cases, there’s no guarantee of reopening of schools. Also, parents are worried over the safety of their kids. So, they are refraining from taking admission to far off schools under the quota,” an official told DH on the condition of anonymity. Some of the districts have recorded RTE admissions in single digit. Bengaluru North district (education) has seen just five RTE admissions while Hassan and Ramanagara have registered three and seven admissions.

Some people with "vested interests" targeted Mumbai police without knowing anything about the investigation, he told PTI. The AIIMS medical board on Saturday stated that Rajput died by suicide and it was not a murder. Reacting to the news, Singh said the city police's probe was professional, and doctors at the Cooper Hospital in the city who performed autopsy had also done their job thoroughly. "We all stand vindicated by these findings of AIIMS," the police commissioner said. The Supreme Court had upheld transfer of the FIR lodged by Bihar police in the Rajput case and not the Mumbai police's investigation, Singh said. "The court didn't find any fault with our investigation," he said. Singh further said that the city police had submitted investigation report to the apex court in a sealed cover and it was seen by only six persons -- the investigating officer, senior police inspector, deputy commissioner of police, commissioner of police, advocate general of the state and the judge. "Without knowing anything about our investigation and without having seen our report some vested interests criticized our investigation," he said. Rajput (34) was found hanging at his flat in Mumbai on June 14. A section of media had hinted that it could be a murder. The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor's father K K Singh in Patna against Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/we-stand-vindicated-mumbai-top-cop-on-aiims-report-in-sushant-singh-rajput-case-896932.html

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni conducted a rare Sunday morning hearing since the petitioners expressed an urgency. The bench, however, noted that since the petitioners did not meet the eligibility criteria, it could not help them. The petitioners, Mahesh Balke and nine others, all skilled staff of an ammunition factory in the state, had applied for the post of chargeman (technical) issued by the Ordnance Factory Board in May this year. As per the recruitment notice, the last date for submitting applications was June 15 this year, and applicants should have completed their diplomas in mechanical and civil engineering by the last date of applying. The petitioners said they were all students of such diploma courses in various colleges affiliated with the AICTE. Their final exams of the courses were to be held in AprilMay 2020 and their pass certificates were to be issued by June. However, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the final exams were deferred and are yet to be held. They approached the Central Administrative Tribunal seeking that they be allowed to take the exams for recruitment as chargemen, pending their diploma course final exams. The, tribunal, however, refused any relief last month. Hence, they approached the HC, seeking that they be permitted to write the recruitment exams, since their diploma course exams had been deferred for no fault of theirs. The high court, however, noted that the petitioners should have challenged the recruitment notification and its eligibility criteria. Had they challenged the fact that final year students were not permitted to apply pending their pass certificates, the HC could have looked into the issue, the court said. However, an SC judgement existed that said if a candidate did not meet the eligibility criteria on the last date of application, which in the present case was June 15, a prospective employer was not obliged to entertain the applicant, it said. "We are fully sympathetic to your case as you have said in your petition that this job opportunity comes only once in four years. But an SC judgment stares us in our face," Chief Justice Datta said. In conducting the hearing on Sunday, Chief Justice Datta said doors of the court were open 24 hours a day if an urgency arose. Justice Kulkarni added that the last time the HC conducted a hearing on a Sunday was in 2013. A bench of Justices S J Vazifdar and K R Sriram conducted a day-long hearing in an examination-related matter at that time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bombay-high-court-declines-relief-to-10-aspirants-who-missed-job-exam-date-897064.html

Beaching of ships for dismantling at Alang ship-breaking yard, one of the biggest recycling yards in the world, is increasing post lockdown and fiscal 2020-21 is expected to be the best for business at Alang that witnesses 40 per cent of global ships coming here for scrapping, said shipping minister Mandaviya. There are 53,000 merchant ships globally, out of which 1,000 are recycled every year. Four hundred of these 1,000 ships are recycled in India at Alang in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, which is 40 per cent of the global recycling. "Alang is blessed with natural opportunities with tides of 10-12 metres, which the government of India and Gujarat government decided to cash on. It results in direct beaching of ships and also saw direct beaching of INS Viraat," Mandaviya told PTI in an interview. "Globally, 1,000 ships are scrapped annually and of this 40 per cent are recycled here. It has the world's biggest recycling industry. We are initiating several initiatives to raise its global share in ship recycling to 50 per cent," he added. The shipping minister claimed that it was the result of the various initiatives that majority of the migrant workers preferred to stay at Alang during the lockdown. Migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha make up some 80 per cent of about 25,000 workers directly employed in over 100 ship-breaking yards at Alang in Bhavnagar district. "About 25,000 workers permanently live here. Majority of them hail from Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and get an average of about Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 good salary. Very few went to their native places during the lockdown as their stay and food arrangements were done here," the minister said. He said COVID-19 lockdown impact was less at Alang as his ministry has given exemptions for sign off and sign on exemption. "We gave permissions for sign off and sign on for ships coming here, facilitating immigration and as a result industry remained operational," he said. Mandaviya, who was here to pay homage to Indian Navy's warship INS Viraat to its last journey to Alang for dismantling, said post enactment of recycling legislation by Parliament, INS Viraat was one of the biggest ships for recycling. He exuded confidence that days were not far-off when recycling industry here will grow massively with Europe and other countries ready to send their ships for breaking here in view of Hong Kong convention ratification. India is looking to double its contribution from ship recycling to country's GDP to over USD 2 billion post enactment of a law -- Recycling of Ships Bill, 2019 for recycling of ships in December 2019. It also aims to take direct jobs from recycling sector to about 90,000. "Even during the lockdown period, 40 to 50 vessels came to Alang for recycling. Many ships bought during the period are still to reach here. We expect maximum vessels to come to India in 2020-21 for recycling," the minister said. Currently, India recycles 70 lakh gross tonnage of ships per annum, while Bangladesh's contribution is 68 lakh gross tonnage. Pakistan scraps ships worth 37 lakh gross tonnage, while China accounts for 34 lakh gross tonnage of recycling. "These four countries account for 90 per cent of the ships recycled globally. Post enactment of Recycle Act, India eyes 50 per cent of the global share as many countries will be sending ships here after India ratified the global convention," Mandaviya said. The existing Shipbreaking Code (revised), 2013 and the provisions of the Hong Kong Convention, 2009 are dovetailed in recycling legislation to ensure environment friendly recycling process of ships and adequate safety of the yard workers. With the enactment of the legislation, India has set global standards for safe and sound environment-friendly recycling of ships, as well as ensure adequate safety of the yard workers. Hoping for increase in the business, a large number of recycling plots at Alang are obtaining Statement of Compliance (SOC) with the Hong Kong Convention. The minister also said that 10 per cent of country's secondary steel needs, as an outcome of recycling of ships, will be met in an eco-friendly manner. Haresh Parmar, General Secretary, Ship Recycling Industrial Association (SRIA) here, said Alang is poised to raise its global share with significant changes during the last 10 years with world class safety environment. "Now European and other advanced nations are sending their ships for recycling here. Three million tonnes of steel is recycled here annually. Central government gets revenue to the tune of Rs 600 to Rs 700 crore from Alang while the state government gets Rs 250 crore." INS Viraat, the longest serving warship, has been beached at Alang for recycling three years after it was decommissioned by the Indian Navy. This Centaur-class aircraft carrier of Indian Navy that remained in service for almost 30 years and holds the Guinness record for world's longest serving warship is being dismantled here by Shree Ram Group of Industries. "This historic warship has sailed almost 11 lakh kms, enough to travel the globe 27 times over and we pay homage to this pride of the nation while Alang is privileged to witness such a magnificent ship," Mandaviya said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/alang-positioned-to-grab-50-share-in-global-ship-recycling-employs-25000-workers-directly-mandaviya-897108.html

The BJP has now accused the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government of ignoring the drug angle in the case.BJP state spokesperson Ram Kadam has shot off a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in this regard. In the latter, he cited the investigations that are being carried out by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), in which 20 persons including Sushant Singh Rajput’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty have been arrested. The NCB stepped in after incriminating WhatsApp chats vis-à-vis drugs angle surfaced during the investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED). “The NCB has initiated a massive crackdown to expose the Bollywood-drug cartel nexus. More than 20 people have been arrested whereas several prominent personalities have been summoned by the NCB. This drug link with Bollywood seems one of the significant aspects in the murder mystery of late Sushant Singh Rajput," Kadam said. “The question is, why was the drug link conveniently ignored by Mumbai police which was clearly acting as per the instructions from the Maharashtra Government? Was this cover-up done to safeguard the interest of several powerful people?” he asked. According to him, the drug link with Bollywood, which was highlighted by the close aides of Sushant, appears as an important aspect of the actor’s mysterious death.“Maharashtra government should at least take full responsibility for their failure and for allowing the Bollywood-drug chain to blossom,” said Kadam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sushant-singh-rajput-case-even-after-aiims-report-bjp-continues-to-target-mva-897143.html

The police said that the victim, who had been threatened by the accused, narrated her ordeal only after one of her relatives came to know about the incident and informed her mother. Three of the accused -- Darshan Bhatia alias Buddho, his cousin Milan and Devkaran J Gadhvi -- have been arrested while the fourth accused, Mohit K Ambalia, is still at large. The accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code Section 376 D (gang rape) and Sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act  (POCSO). According to the FIR, the incident happened on the afternoon of September 28 when the main accused, Darshan, called the victim on her phone and instructed her to meet him near a medicine shop close to her house. At around 1:30 pm she left her house and met Darshan who then asked her to follow him. The FIR states that Darshan took the victim to the upper floor of a two-storey building where he allegedly raped her in a room and the other accused came one after the other to take turns. "Apart from Mohit, we have arrested all the accused. The main accused (Darshan) knew the victim and had talked to her at least thrice in the last few weeks. The victim didn't inform her mother about the incident initially as she had been threatened by the accused. It was only after one of her relatives came to know about it and informed her mother then they approached the police," police sub-inspector RB Gadhvi, who is probing the case, told DH. The victim's father passed away some time ago while her mother works as a daily wager to make ends meet. The victim has three sisters and a brother. Independent MLA and Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani took to microblogging site Twitter to highlight the incident. गुजरात में भी हाथरस : "Hathras in Gujarat as well. In Gujarat's Jamanagar, a woman has been gang raped. Gujarat is also ahead in women exploitation and rape. Creating infrastructure alone can't be called development. The country also needs social and cultural change," Mevani tweeted. He also tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from Gujarat, in the tweet asking him to speak up.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/17-year-old-girl-gang-raped-by-4-in-gujarats-jamnagar-897254.html
