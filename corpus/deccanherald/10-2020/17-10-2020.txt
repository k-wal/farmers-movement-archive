It must first beat Bangladesh||By Andy Mukherjee India’s Covid-19 economic gloom turned into despair this week, on news that its per capita gross domestic product may be lower for 2020 than in neighbouring Bangladesh. “Any emerging economy doing well is good news,” Kaushik Basu, a former World Bank chief economist, tweeted after the International Monetary Fund updated its World Economic Outlook. “But it's shocking that India, which had a lead of 25% five years ago, is now trailing.” Ever since it began opening up the economy in the 1990s, India’s dream has been to emulate China’s rapid expansion. After three decades of persevering with that campaign, slipping behind Bangladesh hurts its global image. The West wants a meaningful counterweight to China, but that partnership will be predicated on India not getting stuck in a lower-middle-income trap. The relative underperformance may also dent self-confidence. If a country with large-power ambitions is beaten in its own backyard — by a smaller nation it helped liberate in 1971 by going to war with Pakistan — its influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean could wane.  Where have things gone wrong? The coronavirus pandemic is definitely to blame. Bangladesh’s new infections peaked in mid-June, while India’s daily case numbers are starting to taper only now, after hitting a record high for any country. With 165 million people, Bangladesh has recorded fewer than 5,600 Covid-19 deaths. While India has eight times the population, it has 20 times the fatalities. What’s worse, the severe economic lockdown India imposed to stop the spread of the disease is set to wipe out 10.3% of real output, according to the IMF. That’s nearly 2.5 times the loss the global economy is expected to suffer. Fiscal squeamishness, an undercapitalised financial system and a multiyear investment funk would all delay India’s post-Covid demand recovery. Worse, even without the pandemic, India might have eventually lost the race to Bangladesh. The reason is nested in a new paper by economist Shoumitro Chatterjee of Pennsylvania State University and Arvind Subramanian, formerly India’s chief economic adviser, titled “India’s Export-Led Growth: Exemplar and Exception.”  Consider first the exceptionalism of India’s growth. Bangladesh is doing well because it’s following the path of previous Asian tigers. Its slice of low-skilled goods exports is in line with its share of the poor-country working-age population. Vietnam is punching slightly above its weight. But basically, both are taking a leaf out of China’s playbook. The People’s Republic held on to high GDP growth for decades by carving out for itself a far bigger dominance of low-skilled goods manufacturing than warranted by the size of its labour pool. India, however, has gone the other way, choosing not to produce the things that could have absorbed its working-age population of 1 billion into factory jobs. “India’s missing production in the key low-skill textiles and clothing sector amounts to $140 billion, which is about 5% of India’s GDP,” the authors say. If half of India’s computer software exports in 2019 ceased to exist, there would be a furore. But that $60 billion loss would have been the same as the foregone exports annually from low-skill production. It’s real, and yet nobody wants to talk about it. Policymakers don’t want to acknowledge that the shoes and apparel factories that were never born — or were forced to close down — could also have earned dollars and created mass employment. They would have provided a pathway for permanent rural-to-urban migration in a way that jobs that require higher levels of education and training never can. Bangladesh has two out of five women of working age in the labour force, double India’s 21% participation rate.  A bigger danger is that instead of taking corrective action, politicians may double down on past mistakes and seek salvation in autarky: “Poorer than Bangladesh? Never mind. We can erect barriers to imports and make stuff for the domestic economy. Let’s create jobs that way.” Suddenly, the 1960s and ’70s slogan of self-reliance is making a return in economic policy. It’s in dispelling this pessimism that the Chatterjee-Subramanian study comes in handy again: Contrary to popular belief, India has been an exemplar of export-led growth, doing better than all countries except China and Vietnam. The glass is more than half full. Trade has worked for the country. It’s the composition that’s wrong, because of an unusual “comparative advantage–defying specialization,” the researchers show. India exports a lot of high-skilled manufacturing goods and services, such as computer software. But as the world’s factory, China is now ceding room to others at the lower end of the spectrum. That is where India’s opportunity — and the competitive advantage of its cheap and not particularly healthy or well-educated labour — really lies. Given the urgent challenge of creating at least 8 million jobs year after year, it’s also the country’s biggest post-pandemic headache.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/will-india-be-the-next-china-it-must-first-beat-bangladesh-903114.html
17-10-2020||First Edit||Wages of ‘development’, and lessons ignored||Three days of heavy rainfall brought Hyderabad to its knees. Heavy flooding in the city has claimed the lives of over 50 people so far. Extensive damage to property has been reported. With residential and commercial areas alike going under water, Hyderabad was transformed overnight into a city with a river coursing through it. Houses in low-lying areas were inundated and vehicles could be seen floating down streets. The downpour was indeed heavy. According to the Met Department, rainfall in recent days has been the heaviest in over a century. Hyderabad received more rain on Tuesday than the amount it generally receives during the whole month of October. And yet, it is hard to dispel the feeling that the magnitude of the damage the rain left behind is disproportionately large even for such heavy rains. Human ‘development’ activity, which has weakened Hyderabad’s capacity to withstand such heavy rains, worsened the impact. Flooding happened because Hyderabad’s lakes overflowed, and this was the outcome of relentless encroachment of lakes by land sharks. Buildings and apartment complexes have come up on land illegally reclaimed from lakes or built on the River Musi’s embankments. Some of the areas that suffered severe flooding over the past week were part of lakes even just a few years ago. Clogged stormwater drains and sewage systems added to the making of the disaster. How can flood waters be drained out of our roads if pipes and channels are blocked? Hyderabad’s flooding is not an isolated incident. The city has suffered similarly in the past as well. We have seen similar flooding in Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai in recent years. In all these instances, the underlying reason is the same: unplanned urban development, lake and river encroachment and broken or blocked stormwater and sewage drain channels are turning downpours into disasters. Every year, in the run-up to the monsoons, civic bodies boast that they have the situation under control and that stormwater drains have been desilted and cleared of construction debris. Hundreds of crores of rupees are allocated for such work, but little is actually done, as is evident from the flooding that follows a few weeks later. Climate change is expected to bring more frequent extreme weather events. Heavy downpours will happen more often. Civic authorities need to be proactive. Building encroachments on lakes and rajakaluves must be dismantled and sewage systems improved. Dumping of debris in drains should be sternly punished. Simply desilting a pipe here or randomly bulldozing an illegal construction on a drain there cannot be the solution. Sustained and long-term strategies are needed to protect our cities from going under water.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/wages-of-development-and-lessons-ignored-903016.html
17-10-2020||In Perspective||The Tanishq ad: What fears abound the patriarchal mind||The recent Tanishq advertisement showing a Muslim mother-in-law performing a South Indian ceremony for pregnant daughters-in law (called Seemantham/Srimantham performed in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) evoked controversy, with some people accusing Tanishq of promoting ‘love jihad’ through the ad. Tanishq, a Tata Group company, retracted its advertisement, stating that its Ekatvam campaign was meant to celebrate the coming together of people and the beauty of oneness. The response to this advertisement and even the concept of ‘love jihad’ rests on the patriarchal premise of women lacking personhood and agency. That Hindu women have married Muslim men since time immemorial in India, a country that Shashi Tharoor reminds us is the biggest symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world, is beside the point for those crying ‘love jihad’. Instead, what is at stake for them is the project of the Hindu nation, not the rights of women. This is because women are treated not as ‘persons’ capable of choosing their partners but, instead, as possessions to be given away by parents through kanyadaan. Women are thus ‘transferred’ from one family to another, and these exchanges come to be made through the ritual of marriage. That the woman has a right to decide whom she marries is absent in the ‘love jihad’ perspective, which views even love that cuts across faith as an act of terrorism. The fear is of the Hindu woman being forcibly converted to Islam, to change her name and give up her Hindu identity. This is nourished by the view of women as possessing minds that are easily swayed or moulded, thus making it easier for the Muslim male to conquer. But can one really speak of love in terms of conquest? At the core of this notion of conquest is tradition, and the ominous fear that somehow Hindu culture and tradition are under attack. As Tanika Sarkar points out in her journal article Pragmatics of the Hindu Right: Politics of Women’s Organisations in the Economic and Political Weekly over 20 years ago, the project of Hindu revival rests on the Hindu woman, who has the unique responsibility of preserving tradition, unlike the Hindu man, who was perceived as having compromised tradition. Tradition and religion are fixed to the unchanging obedience of the woman to community demands, making her the sole source of authenticity, nation-making and freedom. But this project is not new and has its roots in the colonial period -- as Partha Chatterjee examined in Colonialism, nationalism, and colonised women: the contest in India in the American Ethnologist -- when women were employed to preserve and protect tradition from the onslaughts of the colonial government, its ‘civilising’ mission and ‘westernisation’. This political role means that the Hindu woman has to give up all agency and self-determination. The reproduction of tradition relies on women marrying within not only religious but also caste lines. The woman who therefore chooses to marry a man from another faith thus defies expectations of the reproduction of the Hindu nation. Tanika Sarkar thus rightly asked as far back as 1999 whether the woman is a rights-bearing individual, or a culture-bearing one? In 2020 we continue to see this conflict, in the positions people have taken for and against this advertisement. While the trolls crying ‘love jihad’ deny women’s personhood and agency, those upholding this advertisement proclaim a woman’s right to choose her spouse. While many see the trolls as bullying Tanishq into submission, this outcry reveals the real fears of the Hindu right. After all, in their worldview, one does not want young impressionable women to even imagine an inter-faith marriage, let alone a happy one. One does not want to trouble the status quo in Indian families, by presenting young women with ideas of rights. In a country where inter-caste marriages were a strict no-no, we see increasing acceptance of such marriages, specially in urban India. It is not far-fetched to imagine that inter-faith marriages, too, will come to gain more acceptance over time. This disproportionate response to a short 43-second advertisement celebrating an inter-faith marriage speaks volumes of the fear this arouses. India has seen many films featuring inter-faith love and advertisements that have in the past been criticised, but not to this extent, with threats received by Tanishq stores and their personnel. Paradoxically, the very retraction of the advertisement has resulted in it gaining more attention than it otherwise would have.   (The writer is Associate Professor, Jindal School of Government and Public Policy, O P Jindal Global University, Sonepat)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/the-tanishq-ad-what-fears-abound-the-patriarchal-mind-903018.html

With this, the state's famous religious centre has run into controversy. There has been a cold war between the temple Dharmadarshi Ramappa and chief priest Sheshagiri Bhat over the last a few months. The priest's family resorted to silence for the temple management's refusal to grant permission for Chandika home on the premises of the temple. Dyavappa Gowda, who is running a canteen at Sigandur went to the temple around 12:30 noon. There was a verbal duel between Dyavappa Gowda and the chief priest. Subraya Bhat, brother of the priest, rushed to the spot and assaulted Dyavappa Gowda, the temple staff Mahesh and Vimala. He also smashed window glasses of the temple office. Instead of controlling the incident, police videographed the incident. It has come under severe criticism from public. Dyavappa Gowda, who is physically disabled, is undergoing treatment in taluk general hospital in Sagar town. No case has been registered at police station so far.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/assault-in-sigandur-temples-triggers-controversy-903091.html
17-10-2020||Main Article||But what about Ramarajya?||In the 1929 Young Indian, Mahatma Gandhi wrote that “in Ramarajya… Rama and Rahim are the same, personifying truth and righteousness…” The CBI court’s judgement on September 30 – two days before Gandhiji’s 151st birth anniversary – calls for a revisit of Rama’s discourse on dharma, truth and justice. The verdict acquitting all the accused of conspiring to demolish Babri Masjid focused on the lack of credible evidence. Truth fell a casualty purely on technical grounds. How would divine Rama, who set high standards for ethical and moral conduct, react to a verdict like this in Ramarajya, where Gandhi said that the weakest citizen could get justice?  While the CBI court ruled that there was no evidence that the Babri demolition was pre-planned, the 2009 Justice Liberhan Commission concluded that the Ramjanmabhoomi movement, led by L K Advani’s rath yatra in 1990, played a key role in the entire saga and that the demolition itself was carried out with “great painstaking preparation and planning.” The commission said that the BJP’s top leaders and their public articulations were implicated in it all. It pointed out that the Kalyan Singh government, which gave assurances to the High Court and Supreme Court, evaded its responsibility wilfully.  In November 2019, the Supreme Court said that the Babri Masjid demolition was an “egregious violation of the rule of law” and breach of the assurance given to it. Invoking Article 142 of the Constitution, it said that “a wrong committed must be remedied” and “tolerance and mutual co-existence nourish the secular commitment of our nation and its people.” It is pertinent to recall the Ramayana and the lessons to learn from it today. King Dasharatha prepared to crown his eldest son Rama as his successor. The king’s third wife, Kaikeyi, wanted her son Bharata to succeed him, and got Rama exiled.  Rama rejects his brother Lakshmana’s advice to revolt against his father because then he would be considered a power-monger and the kingdom would be plunged into a power struggle which would destroy harmony.  Unhappy and upset with the adharmic development wrought by his own mother, Bharata rushes to the forest and begs Rama to return as the king following Dasharatha’s death. Rama replies that the word given to his father is not dead. Rama, the ideal persona, did not want anybody to feel that he was waiting for his father’s death.  His advice to Bharata to administer the kingdom on his behalf until the period of exile was over, which appears in Ayodhyakanda, has become very relevant today. In it are the major principles of governance. A king must have at least one scholar who can critique him and stop him when he seems headed in the wrong direction; he should listen to  dissent, instead of listening to thousands of sycophants; and a king should publicly honour in his court eminent men, even if they differ with him on matters.  A servant is one who does service and should be respected, and servants’ salaries should be given on time. Ministers must be appointed after critically examining their expertise and honesty. Pampering the king’s own kith and kin, favouring some employees, intimidating others, stoking conflict among them, will all destroy the kingdom. The king should speak less, but should not be incommunicado and should not make himself unavailable. His people should be free to approach him.  In conflicts in society for property, money, anger, jealousy, etc., resulting due to differences, the strong exploit the weak, but the king should give ear to the voiceless. The poor come to the king’s court as a last resort when there is a conflict with the powerful; the tears of the innocent would destroy the peace of the kingdom. The royal court should not pardon anyone who breaks the law, even if he is powerful and rich. But what is happening in India now? The powerful are becoming more powerful. The voiceless have become dumb.  “Taking any decision single-handedly, not completing welfare projects on time, appointing our own people to posts is Aviveka…” Remember the 2016 demonetisation? Unsatisfiable greed, arrogance of power, laziness, lying, knowingly following the wrong path, oppressing people, stupidity, indecisiveness, illegality, insulting others unnecessarily are the great enemies of a ruler.  A king should consider himself a debtor, not the owner of the riches in the treasury. Listening to gossip, working thoughtlessly, jealousy, betrayal, finding fault with people unnecessarily, squandering money, arrogance, cruelty in punishment are weapons of self-destruction. Though in the Ramayana, there were great leaders like Ravana, Vali, Sugriva, Dasharatha Rama is unique.   Rama admonishes Vibhishana for refusing to perform Ravana’s last rites. Ravana-ism should be killed, but the dead Ravana should be shown respects. A true Rama-ist, Mahatma Gandhi, declared, “Fight with all the moral strength British imperialism, but don’t hate the British as a people.” Do we hear such sane voices now? But the rant raised by the so-called liberal rationalists who ask for proof of the birth of Rama in Ayodhya also deserves to be totally ignored as it is equally divisive. Most people, irrespective of their faiths, from Afghanistan to Cambodia, believe that he was born in Ayodhya.  The Ram Mandir issue has been decided, though it has taken a heavy toll on our nation in the process, and even Muslims have participated in it. Now, the country should move forward and not follow the path of a fallen state like Pakistan, though even in Pakistan, there are many who oppose communalism and fundamentalism.  Now that the temple of Maryada Purushottam is being built, those governing this nation should listen to Rama’s advice to Bharata when India is faced with a multitude of problems – mostly self-made, some made by our enemies and supposed friends. Otherwise, the very purpose of Ram Mandir will get defeated. There is irony in Advani today seeming to be Mahabharata’s Bheeshma, Murli Manohar Joshi Guru Drona, while Uma Bharti has ended up as Ekalavya losing a thumb. Be that as it may, if the Ram Mandir episode does not result in a new era of Gandhiji’s conception of Ramarajya, I can only quote a line from eminent Kannada poet Gopalakrishna Adiga, “Rama cried, “Rama…Rama...” (The writer is a former principal of Seshadripuram College and vice president of KPCC)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/but-what-about-ramarajya-903017.html

Speaking during the inaugural function of Dasara, atop Chamundi Hill, in Mysuru, on Saturday morning, the CM said, Covid crisis and floods are the twin problems ailing the state and thus steps have been taken to tackle both. “The Prime Minister sought information on the flood situation and the relief measures taken. He was told that a few affected villages have been shifted to safer places. Revenue Minister R Ashoka is touring the affected areas, monitoring relief measures. The officials have been directed to distribute relief to the victims, within a week,” Yediyurappa said. “In August and September, the estimated loss due to floods in Karnataka is over Rs 9,000 crore. Compensation will be provided to victims and infrastructure will be strengthened in phases,” he said. Funds for Chamundi Hill He said, Rs 7.5 crore has been sanctioned for the development of Chamundi Hill, following a demand by people’s representatives. “The funds are meant to develop the lakes atop the hill, for the steps and for lighting the paths,” he said||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/centre-extends-support-to-tackle-flood-situation-says-cm-yediyurappa-felicitates-covid-warriors-903146.html
17-10-2020||Mysuru||Covid warriors should be declared as ‘martyrs’: Dr C N Manjunath||Dr C N Manjunath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, urged the government to declare those, who have laid down their lives as Covid warriors, as martyrs. Delivering the inaugural speech of Dasara, atop the Chamundi Hill, in Mysuru, on Saturday morning, he said, those who lay their lives, defending the nation and its people, are described as ‘martyrs’. “Covid warriors, such as doctors, healthcare professionals and others, are also fighting against the invisible virus, to protect the people,” he said. Pointing out that a doctor has been given the honour of inaugurating Dasara for the first time, Dr Manjunath, a renowned cardiologist, said, it is an honour for all doctors and healthcare professionals, at a time when they are working as Covid warriors. “Nearly 500 doctors and 600 nurses have died in India, as Covid warriors, over the past eight months. The life-expectancy of doctors has come down by 10 years in recent times, as they become victims of the wrath of the people and work under immense pressure. Doctors are generally blamed for not working in rural areas. But, there is lack of security in villages, discouraging doctors. The hospitals under the ambit of Zilla Panchayats should be managed in a better way, to provide adequate facilities and security,” he said. “Of late, one lakh tests are conducted daily in Karnataka and around 8,000 people are testing positive for Covid-19, a sign that the rate of spread of the infection is declining. Among the infected, nearly 80% of patients need minimum intervention, for recovery. Eight per cent of the patients need oxygen support while 2% need ventilator support. Thus, the fear of Covid is graver than the infection itself. When we talk about wearing masks, maintaining personal distance and maintaining hygiene to tackle Covid, it is not untouchability. So, besides treatment to cure the infection, we need psychological intervention for a healthy society,” Dr Manjunath said. “The Wadiyar kings of the Yadu dynasty laid stress on health, education, irrigation, agriculture and industry for the welfare of the people and for a healthy society, in the erstwhile Mysuru State. They provided a democratic rule, despite being a subordinate to the British. Thus, they earned the love of the citizens as ‘people’s kings’,” he said||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/covid-warriors-should-be-declared-as-martyrs-dr-c-n-manjunath-903161.html

The unidentified accused hacked the server of the company based in the industrial Sector 62 of Noida using a cyber malware popularly called 'Ransomware Attack', the police said. According to the FIR lodged at Sector 58 police station, the cyber attack took place on the intervening night of October 12 and 13 and the hackers may have stolen "entire or substantial data" of the company which runs several restaurants and outlets. The complaint made by a Haldiram's official said that an IT official of Haldiram's consequently accessed the Firewall programme on the company's servers and found some traffic generating from servers, showing certain IP addresses. "Finally, the officials of the company found out that some programme was being executed on the aforementioned servers and all the data of the company was being diverted from and going out from the servers of the company," it stated. "… Therefore, the said programme was immediately terminated by the officials along with the connectivity to all systems at branch locations of the company. However, it is apprehended that till the said disconnection was undertaken by the officials, may be the entire or substantial data may have already been stolen from the servers of the company," it stated. The company said its official raised a complaint with its data security and cyber security firm, Trend Micro, and alleged that all files and sensitive data of the firm had been encrypted by the hacker, thereby, preventing its officials from interacting with their files, data, applications and systems. It said that the hackers, to give effect to a pre-planned criminal conspiracy, have not only stolen data from the servers and systems of the company but have also contacted company officials through certain servers to illegally extort money to provide back the access to the company's own data and to delete the stolen data from the servers and systems. The data includes but not limited to financial, HR, sales/purchase and other data/information) A Haldiram’s representative claimed the hacker(s) have demanded a ransom of Rs 7,50,000 in order to decrypt the servers of the company including all its files, data, applications, systems, etc and delete the stolen data from their own systems. The Noida Police said they have taken up investigation and its Cyber Cell is working on the case. "The allegations have been found to be true by our Cyber Cell, which is now probing the case. Whatever points and facts emerge during the probe, the matter would be dealt with accordingly," Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh said. The FIR has been lodged against unknown accused under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 384 (extortion) and under relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, the police said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/haldiram-s-crucial-data-stolen-hackers-demand-rs-750-lakh-to-release-info-903069.html

The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm had on October 13 reapplied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking permission to conduct combined phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the vaccine in the country. In its revised protocol, firm stated that the phase 2 trial would include 100 subjects, while the phase 3 would involve 1,400 volunteers, the sources said. The subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 deliberated on the application on Friday. "Following deliberation, the SEC has recommended the grant of permission for the phase 2 clinical trial of the potential vaccine first. After they submit the safety and immunogenicity data of the first phase, they then would be allowed to proceed for the phase 3 of the trials," a source said.   The SEC had on October 5 asked the firm to re-apply stating it will have to conduct both phase 2 and 3 clinical trials and cannot directly hold phase 3 trial for the vaccine in India. The Indian pharma giant has collaborated with The Russian Direct Investment Fund  (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine as well as its distribution. Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF shall supply to drug maker Dr Reddy's 100 million doses of the vaccine, the firm had said last month. According to sources, it would be multi-centre, observer-blind, randomised controlled study.   Meanwhile, the sources said the phase 3 trial of Sputnik V is underway in Russia since September 1 on around 40,000 subjects.

The notices have been issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. While notices have been issued to Amazon and Flipkart, the department has asked the states to ensure compliance of rules by all e-commerce companies. The two companies did not comment on the issue of notices. The department has asked all e-commerce entities for ensuring compliance of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules. Both the companies have been asked to reply within 15 days. "It has been brought into notice that some of the e-commerce entities are not displaying the mandatory declaration on digital platforms required under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011," the notice said. In almost similar worded notices, the department said that Flipkart India Pvt Ltd and Amazon Development Centre India Pvt Ltd are e-commerce entities and therefore, they have to ensure that all mandatory declarations be displayed on the digital and electronic network used for e-commerce transactions. The two companies, as per the notices, have "not provided the mandatory declaration and contravened" the Legal Metrology Act. Referring to advertisements made by the entities on their respective websites, the notices said that "on examination" of the advertisements "it was found that the mandatory declarations are not mentioned" as per the rules. The Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules provides that an e-commerce entity has to ensure that the mandatory declarations (including the country of origin), except the month and year in which the commodity is manufactured or packed, "shall be displayed on the digital and electronic network used for e-commerce transactions". In case of a market place model of e-commerce, responsibility of the correctness of the declarations lies with the manufacturer or seller or dealer or importer. In July, late Ram Vilas Paswan, the former consumer affairs minister, had said that state governments have been directed to strictly enforce the provision that requires companies and e-commerce players to display the 'country of origin' on all products. The provision of the declaration of 'country of origin' has been in place since January 2018 for all manufacturers, importers, packers and e-commerce players. The commerce ministry has now been asked to ensure that e-commerce players too comply with this rule strictly, he had said. Whether a product is sold through an offline or online platform, it is mandatory to display 'country of origin' besides other details like maximum retail price (MRP), day of expiry, net quantity and consumer care details, the former minister had said. In January 2018, the government amended the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 to add a new provision, mandating declaration of  'country of origin' for manufacturers, importers, packers and e-commerce entities. In June, the DPIIT had sought views of e-commerce firms like Amazon and Flipkart on mentioning the 'country of origin' on each product sold through their platforms. This came against the backdrop of calls to boycott Chinese goods following border clashes between India and China in Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-issues-notices-to-flipkart-amazon-for-not-showing-mandatory-info-about-products-903130.html

There are 7,95,087 active cases of Covid-19 infections as on date. The active caseload was below the 8 lakh mark (7,85,996) last on Sept. 1, the ministry said.

The national recovery rate has further risen to 87.78 per cent. Enhanced countrywide medical infrastructure, implementation of the Centre's standard treatment protocol by states and union territories, and total dedication and commitment of doctors, paramedics and frontline workers have led to a persistent increase in the number of total recoveries with commensurate dip in the fatality rate, the ministry underscored. "India is the only country with the highest recoveries and continues to have one of the lowest fatality rates globally. The case fatality rate as on date stands at 1.52 per cent.

Priority will be given to workers in high-risk sectors such as police, health-care, sanitation, elderly people and those with co-morbidities, the report said, citing officials it didn’t identify. The shots, which will include a booster dose, are planned for the initial phase once a vaccine is approved for use, according to the report. For a country of its size, a safe and quick vaccine delivery is a top priority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration. The nation’s broken health-care system, already struggling to deliver adequate care before the outbreak, cannot cope with the strain of a prolonged pandemic. The beneficiaries of the vaccine in the first phase will receive an estimated 600 million doses and implementation plan aims to cover over 23% of the population, according to the report. India added 62,212 new cases, taking the total infections in the country to 7.43 million as of Oct. 17, government data shows.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-identifying-30-crore-people-wholl-get-covid-19-vaccine-on-priority-report-903207.html
17-10-2020||National||Four states where Covid-19 cases are edging higher: Report||To calculate the trend of coronavirus cases, two factors are taken into account - doubling rate and recovery rate. The report shows data calculated from September 1 to October 1.  The doubling rate is the number of days it takes for the total infections in the region to double. The longer it takes, the better it is as it means that the virus is not spreading fast.  Seven states have performed worse than the national doubling average which is 74 days. Despite almost containing the virus, Kerala performed badly with its Covid-19 cases doubling every 24 days, followed by Chhattisgarh at 37 days. Madhya Pradesh performed marginally better at 50 days, Rajasthan and Karnataka at 53 days, West Bengal at 57 days, and Odisha at 69 days. Recovery rate, on the other hand, is the proportion of people testing positive to those tested. In this case, the lower the positivity rate of a state is the better it is faring.  If a region registers a 5% positivity rate or below under a comprehensive testing programme for at least two weeks, only then the outbreak is said to be under control.  Kerala has performed the worst with an increase from 7.5% to 15.9% positivity rate from September 1 to October 15.  Maharashtra, which has consistently been reporting a high positivity rate over the last few months, saw a rise of 21.1% from 13.8% in the same time period. Rajasthan followed Maharashtra with 11.3% from 6.1%. In Madhya Pradesh, the positivity rate reached 7.7% from 5.7%  while West Bengal recorded an increase from 7% to 8.6%.  The country’s positivity rate is at 6.1% over the past week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/four-states-where-covid-19-cases-are-edging-higher-report-903219.html

A decision to this effect was taken in the executive meeting of the board held virtually a few days ago. AIMPLB member Zafaryab Jilani told PTI on Saturday that "important decisions pertaining to common civil code and the Babri mosque demolition case" were taken in the meeting on October 11 and October 13. "The board members are of the view that in the agenda of the ruling BJP, now only common civil code is left, and they will proceed in this direction," he said. Jilani said that the board will establish contact with different sections of the society, which could be affected in case the common civil code is implemented, and try to build a consensus and public opinion against it. "India is a country of different cultures and civilisations, hence implementing this code will not be justified," he said. The AIMPLB member also said the board will challenge the special CBI court judgement in the Babri mosque demolition. "Representatives of the board will appeal against the judgement in the high court," he said. The special court acquitted all 32 accused including BJP veterans L K Advani, M M Joshi and Uma Bharti of involvement in the destruction of Babri Masjid 28 years ago. In a 2,300-page judgment, the CBI court said there was no conclusive evidence against the accused of being part of any conspiracy to bring down the disputed structure in Ayodhya. It said vandals were responsible for demolition. Such kar sevaks, who were unruly and rowdy, can never be called Ram bhakts (disciples of the Lord) because their actions adversely affected the secular fabric of the nation, the judge added. The 16th century mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992 by kar sevaks who believed that it occupied the site where Lord Ram was born, the destruction triggering riots that left hundreds dead in the country and widening rifts between the communities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aimplb-will-work-towards-building-public-opinion-against-uniform-civil-code-903224.html

17-10-2020||National||SC rejects plea by journalist to shift trial on sting operation against Uttarakhand CM, family to Delhi||The Supreme Court on Friday said that a trial should be transferred from a court sparingly and only when fair justice is in peril. The apprehension of not getting a level playing field should be based on credible material and not on conjectures and surmises, it added. The apex court said this while rejecting a plea by a journalist, Umesh Kumar Sharma, to transfer trial in three cases from courts in Uttarakhand to Delhi or elsewhere on the apprehension of "vindictive prosecution" for conducting a sting operation against the current Chief Minister and his family members. "While assurance of a fair trial needs to be respected, the plea for transfer of case should not be entertained on mere apprehension of a hypersensitive person," a single-judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy said.  Sharma of 'Samachar Plus' was, earlier in 2016, reportedly arrested for carrying out a sting operation to bring down Harish Rawat government.  Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sharma, contended that on account of his work as an investigative journalist against the ruling dispensation, the petitioner was being targeted for malicious prosecution within the state.  Going through the factual matrix, the court noted out of three cases, two were related to property matters, one of 1995 and another of 2007, when the present ruling dispensation was nowhere in the picture. Another case of 2018 was related to a forcible land grabbing attempt. "Perhaps only this is relatable to journalistic activity where the allegation of a core member of the investigative journalism team is that the petitioner, in the guise of sting operation (by video recording activities of powerful elements), does not air them and the concerned footages are utilised for extraneous purposes," the court noted. The bench said that a chargesheet has already been filed in the case and the transfer of trials from one state to another would inevitably reflect on the credibility of the state’s judiciary. "But for compelling factors and clear situation of deprivation of fair justice, the transfer power should not be invoked. This case is not perceived to be one of those exceptional categories," the bench said. The complainant, in the 2018 case, had opposed the plea contending the petitioner faced 29 cases and most of which related to property grabbing as he used the cover of journalism to grab property and none of the so-called sting operations has led to the prosecution of anyone in the state. The state government also submitted the plea by Sharma saying the transfer was made on incorrect and bald allegations. He himself filed five PILs in the HC, showing he was conducting his affairs without impediment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-plea-by-journalist-to-shift-trial-on-sting-operation-against-uttarakhand-cm-family-to-delhi-903252.html

He also said that words and ideas may outlast power and authority. The Thiruvananthapuram MP and author of several books was speaking at the Symbiosis International University Literary Festival via video-conferencing. "When I was in school, I learnt that the pen is mightier than the sword. Today, I have seen our country, its politics and its discourse. I am no longer convinced it is," he said. "I am sorry to say, but words and ideas may outlast power and authority. Power and authority in the short term can crush the words," the Congress leader said. "We have seen that a large number of people are under detention for words they have expressed. Currently, people like Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Anand Teltumbde are under detention for their words. "No one is accused of throwing a stone, hitting someone or possessing a gun or anything like that. It's only about the words. So, how will the pen stand up to the sword if the pen is wielded to the authority of the government of the day," he said.

The results of the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) were declared on Friday. They are children of the humble daily labourer, vegetable seller, truck driver, fisherman and idli-vada seller. These successful students are products of the Zindagi programme run by a non-governmental organisation of academician Ajay Bahadur Singh, who himself had to experience pangs of hunger and scarcity of money in childhood which prevented him from becoming a doctor. Under the programme, talented underprivileged students are selected from across Odisha and provided free coaching and food to help them crack NEET and become a doctor. The noble initiative in Odisha is akin to the famed Super 30 experiment of mathematician Anand Kumar. "Neither poverty nor coronavirus pandemic could dampen the spirit of these students to achieve their dream to become a doctor. This year also the Zindagi foundation students created history, 19 out of 19 students of the foundation have qualified in NEET 2020 exam," Singh said on Saturday. Amongst the kids of the Zindagi foundation, there is Khirodini Sahoo, who belongs to Angul district. Her father works as a farm labourer, who lost his job during the pandemic further driving the family to poverty. "I fell ill during the lockdown, and came to Bhubaneswar by ambulance and told everything to Ajay Sir. He kept me at his home and provided everything required," Khirodini, who has secured 2,594 All India rank, in NEET conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA), said. Satyajit Sahoo, whose father vends vegetables on cycle has achieved 619 marks. Another success story is of Subhendu Parida, who use to vend "Idli Vada" alongside his parents. He qualified in NEET exam by achieving 609 marks. Nivedita Panda, her father is a betel shop owner in their village in Dhenkanal district, has achieved 591 marks. Roshan Paik, who used to lend helping hands to his farm labourer father is another qualifier. Manjeet, whose family survives of catching of fish, is another successful candidate. Smruti Ranjan Senapati, ward of a truck driver, has qualified in the NEET exam for admission in government medical college scoring 536 marks and having 59044 AIR rank. Ajay Bahadur Singh initiated Zindagi Foundation in the year 2017 in Bhubaneswar. "I do all this without taking any donation from any individual or an organisation through many have offered. I manage everything from my own resources because I see my childhood in them," Singh told PTI. The man behind the success stories of these children had to leave his medical studies and sell tea and sharbat (squash) to sustain his family undergoing financial hardship. "I had to sale tea and sharbat at shravani mela in the temple town of Baba Baidyanath in Jharkhand to pursue studies," he said. Under the project, the talented students of the poor financial background selected through a state-wide screening test, are provided free food, lodging and teaching to help them become a doctor. Twelve out of a batch of 14 who had cracked NEET in 2018 got admission in government medical colleges of Odisha. They were hosted by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik then to commemorate their achievements. "I could not become a doctor but when I see these kids achieve their dreams, I feel I have achieved mine. I would never accept that any brilliant child is not able to achieve his or her dream just because of financial constraints. I will keep going on, to ensure that none of the kids miss their dreams due to lack of resources," he said. Impressed by the noble initiative, the Super30 founder mathematician himself has made several trips to the Zindagi foundation to inspire the aspiring medicos. Film star Hrithik Roshan who performed the role of Anand Kumar in the biopic "Super 30", has also showered lavish praise to the Odisha project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/odisha-19-poor-medical-aspirants-crack-neet-exam-903264.html

According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 4,585 farm fires this season so far compared to 1,631 such incidents during the corresponding period last year. Haryana has also recorded an increase in farm fires -- from around 1,200 incidents till October 16 last year to 2,016 this year. Karunesh Garg, Member Secretary of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, however, said the number of stubble burning incidents seem large because of early harvesting of paddy this year. "Around 17 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was harvested till October 15 last year. This year, the figure is around 40 lakh metric tonnes. It shows that farmers harvested their crop early this year," he said. The monsoon season continued until September-end last year, delaying harvesting of paddy, Garg said. Earlier this week, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had asked Punjab to control stubble burning after air quality in the national capital hit "very poor" levels. Garg said it was wrong to blame Punjab for Delhi’s bad air. "Stubble burning in Punjab may be a factor but its contribution to Delhi's pollution is less than one per cent," he asserted. An official from the Haryana government said the number of farm fires in the state has "certainly increased" as compared to last year. "It can be attributed to the unavailability of farm labour due to the Covid-19 pandemic." S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana Pollution Control Board, said, "The number of farm fires, so far, is more than last year... Maybe it is due to early harvesting. So, it is too early to predict whether we will end up burning more stubble than last year.” "Most farm fires occur in Sirsa, Fatehabad and Kaithal. The administration has not been able to completely control stubble burning in those areas. Efforts are on." According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose from around 6 per cent on Thursday to 18 per cent on Friday. On Saturday, it is estimated to be around 19 per cent, SAFAR said. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had Friday said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been "extremely unfavourable" for dispersion of pollutants since this September as compared to last year. With less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped the number of stubble burning incidents will be fewer this year compared to 2019. Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it. Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy. With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 situation. Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution. According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 per cent -- to Delhi's air pollution. Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/early-harvest-labour-unavailability-due-to-covid-19-led-to-more-farm-fires-officials-903272.html

In a statement, the Ministry said that the step was pursuant to the decision of the Central Government vide Press Note No. 4/2019 of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) allowing 26% FDI under Government approval route on ‘Uploading/Streaming of Current Affairs and News through Digital Media'. The Ministry would be considering in the near future to extend the benefits, presently available to traditional media -- print and TV -- to such digital media entities also. This includes PIB accreditation for its reporters, cameramen, and videographers enabling them with better first-hand information and access including participation in official press conferences and such other interactions. This will also help media persons from these entities to avail of CGHS benefits and concession rail fare. Once put in place, this would also make digital media eligible for digital advertisements through the Bureau of Outreach and Communication. "Similar to self-regulating bodies in print and electronic media, entities in digital media can form self-regulating bodies for furthering their interests and interaction with the government," the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-considers-extending-pib-accreditation-for-journalists-in-digital-media-903278.html

In a similar manner, the vaccine delivery and administration systems should involve the participation of states and district level functionaries, civil society organisations, volunteers, citizens, and experts from all necessary domains,” the Prime Minister said after chairing a review meeting of the Covid-19 scenario including the preparedness for vaccine delivery. The entire process of Covid-19 vaccination should have a strong IT backbone and the system should be designed in such a manner so as to have a lasting value to the healthcare system, he suggested. With three Covid-19 vaccine trials ongoing and a fourth one about to start, the health ministry has begun a process to ready the downstream infrastructure and arrange for adequate manpower for a never-done-before exercise to vaccinate nearly 100 crore Indians. The first priority would be doctors, healthcare workers, and other frontline staff, identified by the state governments. National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with state governments and all relevant stakeholders have prepared and presented a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration. The Expert Group, in consultation with states, is working actively on prioritisation and distribution of the vaccine. Modi further directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily. NEGVAC also presented a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration to the Prime Minister during the review. However, its details have not been shared. Two pan-India studies on the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus) in India conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research and Department of Bio-Technology suggested that the virus is genetically stable and there is no major mutation (tiny but crucial genetic changes) in the virus.  Asking the officials to ensure quick access to the vaccine keeping in mind India’s geographical spread, Modi said that every step in the logistics, delivery, and vaccine administration should be put in place rigorously.  The logistics arrangement would include advanced planning of cold storage chains, distribution network, monitoring mechanism, advance assessment, and preparation of ancillary equipment required, such as vials and syringes. The Prime Minister reviewed the Covid-19 situation ahead of India crossing the 75 lakh-mark in the caseload even though the active number of Covid-19 cases fell below the 8 lakh mark for the first time in the last one and half months. But West Bengal ahead of the Durga Puja festival is a worry. The eastern state has now come up to the third spot in the number of Covid-19 deaths recorded in the last 24 hours. India’s death toll stands at 1,12,161, out of which 895 were added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/learn-from-poll-official-while-delivering-covid-19-vaccine-pm-modi-tells-health-officials-903306.html

There had been concerns in some quarters that any major mutation detected in the novel coronavirus could hinder the development of an effective vaccine. However, some recent global studies have said the vaccines currently being developed for Covid-19 should not be affected by recent mutations. Mutation typically refers to the property of a virus to undergo changes when it multiplies and the virus may develop some new strains after it replicates. In cases, the new strains tend to be less effective and therefore die out soon, while more powerful strains may lead to faster spread of the virus. After a review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 pandemic situation, and vaccine delivery, distribution and administration preparedness, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement that three vaccines are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which two are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III. The PMO further said, "Two pan-India studies on the Genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19 virus) in India conducted by ICMR and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) suggest that the virus is genetically stable and there is no major mutation in the virus." Last month, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said no significant or drastic mutations have been found in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in India till now. He had also said the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) was conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains collected over a few months and detailed results on mutations of the virus will be available in early October. Replying to a query on mutations of SARS-COV2, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava had said at a press briefing earlier this week that minor changes called "drifts" may happen from time to time, but major genetic mutations of viruses or "shifts" may happen in about a decade or two. In this context, the effectiveness of a vaccine will not be determined by minor "drifts", he had said. A study by a group of researchers last month found that the coronavirus genomes in India have 5.39 per cent mutation similarity with 72 nations. Mutations in an organism's genetic material are natural 'errors' in the cell replication process that may give the virus new 'powers' of survival, infectivity, and virulence. It can affect the ability of vaccines and drugs to bind the virus or to create a specific immune response against it. The study also revealed that the US, the UK and India are the top three nations with a geometric mean of 3.27 per cent, 3.59 per cent, and 5.39 per cent, respectively, of mutation similarity score with other 72 countries. Indrajit Saha, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of National Institute of Technical Teachers' Training and Research, Kolkata, and his team have also developed a web-based Covid-Predictor to predict the sequence of viruses online on the basis of machine learning. The PMO statement said a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with state governments and all relevant stakeholders have prepared a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration. The Expert Group, in consultation with states, is working actively on prioritisation and distribution of vaccines. At the meeting, the prime minister directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had taken a dig at the government over IMF growth projections showing Bangladesh closing in on India in terms of per capita GDP this year and described it as a "solid achievement" of six years of the BJP's "hate-filled cultural nationalism". Government sources had emphasised that India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of purchasing power parity was 11 times more than that of Bangladesh in 2019. "The India-vs-Bangladesh GDP per capita comparison (post IMF WEO) has sparked anxiety & acrimony. But wrong numbers being compared... "NO, on more appropriate metric, India has not been surpassed and, according to IMF, unlikely to be in near future," Subramanian said in a series of tweets. He said all the focus has been on comparisons based on GDP measured at current, market exchange rates and this yields "conclusion" of Bangladesh eclipsing India. But market exchange rates are not appropriate for welfare comparisons across time and countries, Subramanian said, adding that GDP per capita is an estimate for one indicator of the average standard of living/welfare in a country. The former CEA said there is a need to measure real GDP in local currency after taking out effects of inflation and then, convert all local currency estimates of real GDP into comparable dollars. He noted that more appropriate basis is GDP at constant, purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Noting that India has no room for complacency, Subramanian said, "India will return to pre-Covid *LEVEL* of real per capita GDP only in 2022, 3 lost years." 8/ Finally Bangladesh's performance over last 2 decades-on growth, manufacturing exports, & range of social indicators such as fertility, female labour participation, fin'l inclusion-has been remarkable Bangladesh is a miracle-in-the-making offering development lessons for all According to the IMF, India is set to drop below Bangladesh in terms of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the economy is projected to contract by a massive 10.3 per cent this year. IMF's forecast for India -- a huge downward revision from its previous prediction in June -- is also the biggest contraction projected among major emerging markets amid the Covid-19 pandemic. However, India is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8 per cent growth rate in 2021, thus regaining the position of the fastest-growing emerging economy, surpassing China's projected growth rate of 8.2 per cent, the IMF said in its latest 'World Economic Outlook' report. Released ahead of the annual meetings of IMF and the World Bank, the report said global growth would contract by 4.4 per cent this year and bounce back to 5.2 per cent in 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bangladesh-has-not-surpassed-india-on-more-appropriate-economic-metric-former-cea-903322.html

Large-scale trials of the Sputnik V vaccine in India were first announced and then knocked back by Indian regulators, who said that the scale of Phase I and II trials conducted in Russia earlier this year was too small, requesting that they be repeated. Following a new agreement, India will now carry out an adaptive phase II and III human clinical trial involving 1,500 participants, RDIF, which is marketing the vaccine abroad, said on Saturday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday attacked the Narendra Modi government, saying it is busy "filling the pockets of its special friends" and that is why the country's poor are hungry. He was reacting to the Global Hunger Index 2020 report which has ranked India 94 among 107 countries. According to the report, only 13 countries are behind India, which include Rwanda (97), Nigeria (98), Afghanistan (99), Libya (102), Mozambique (103), Chad (107). Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won a landslide victory in New Zealand's general election Saturday, leveraging success battling Covid-19 to gain an unprecedented outright majority and the chance to implement her reform agenda. With two-thirds of the vote counted, Ardern's center-left Labour Party was on 49.2 per cent and forecast to take around 64 seats in the 120-member parliament. No leader has achieved an absolute majority since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, leading to a succession of multi-party governments. MLC Basavaraj Horatti on Saturday urged the Karnataka government to not open classes for students up to Class 7 during this academic year to ensure the safety of students in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and declare 2020-2021 zero academic year. Speaking to mediapersons here, Horatti said classes must be conducted batch-wise for students from Class 8th to 10. Besides, students of pre-university and first-grade colleges are not kids and their immunity power would be high. So, colleges could be opened, he suggested.

They asked the CJI to put in place a proper mechanism so as to deal with "motivated smear campaigns and misuse of social media to compromise the independence of the judiciary and bring the administration of justice into disrepute".  Led by advocate Utsav Bains, the students said such attacks seriously undermined the credibility of the institution in the eyes of the citizens. If ignored, this evil monster would soon become one of the biggest reasons for the wrongful erosion of public faith in the institution of the judiciary, they said. Reddy is himself is facing prosecution in 31 criminal cases, including 11 corruption cases lodged by the CBI. "This speaks volumes about his motives of making allegations against Justice N V Ramana, who had recently directed the High Courts to form special benches to fast-track criminal cases against MPs and MLAs," they said. Students from law institutions from across the country said Reddy desired constitutional anarchy and legal chaos in his state for his own benefit. "An example must be made of him which will act as a deterrent for all politicians to come. So that no politician in power ever thinks of threatening or blackmailing a Supreme Court judge with slander and insinuations so as to pollute the streams of justice," they said.

He was responding to a video shared by Maharashtra Information Center, New Delhi's deputy director Dayanand Kamble which showed a worker resolving a fault in the high-tension transmission line which gets power to the financial capital. “I will think about and pray for the safety of these high-wire daredevils before complaining again,” Mahindra wrote while retweeting the video on Saturday. Shot on a clear day in the ghat section which separates the Western Ghats from the coastal Konkan in the Khandala region, the 55-second video shows a worker slithering down a wire, possibly to reach the exact spot of a fault. The height at which he is working is very perceptible with land mass being far away below and behind him, and the presence of a lone worker at such great heights illustrates the risks taken. Kamble said this is the fourth day of problem resolution operation undertaken by the state-run MSETCL's employees and had added that fault in this line was a major reason for the power outage faced by the financial capital on Monday. Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company's (MSETCL) chairman and managing director Dinesh Waghmare had earlier this week said that a wire cable carrying power from Talegaon near Pune on the Deccan Plateau to the Kalwa sub-station on the outskirts of Mumbai had “physically snapped” in the days leading to the outage. Waghmare had termed the region in which the fault has occurred as mountainous and hostile from an approach perspective, due to which the problem could not be resolved immediately and the line was shut. Simultaneously, three other lines getting power to Kalwa were either shut or tripped, which led to the grid collapse. At present, the state-run MSETCL and private sector Tata Power are in a blame game over what led to the major power outage which took over 14 hours to resolve. MSETCL says the islanding system could not be triggered because Tata's generation started very late, while Tata blames a cascading tripping of circuits for the fault.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-think-before-complaining-about-electricity-services-anand-mahindra-after-watching-workers-video-903338.html

With a huge population in a country like India, she said, one has to go after the virus in order to control its spread before it becomes a community transmission. "When we look at countries that have succeeded (in controlling the spread of virus) we have to go after the virus where it is present. Then it is easier (to prevent the spread of virus) than it becomes a community transmission," she said. Swaminathan was speaking at a conference 'SICCI 360' organised by trade body Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI). She said even in Tamil Nadu there was a phase when things were looking 'bad' and the government was wondering what needs to be done. "The test positivity rate is a very important marker and India has done well. (But) We could do more. The test positivity rate in Tamil Nadu which was 15 per cent has now become less than five per cent", she said. Swaminathan said testing of samples should be continued while clusters which could turn into Covid-19 'hotspots' need to be identified. "In Chennai like the Koyambedu cluster, there are few other clusters as well as religious gatherings.. those are things (that) need to be identified so that we can take more precautions," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/clusters-that-could-turn-into-covid-19-hotspots-need-to-be-identified-sowmya-swaminathan-903347.html

In its supplementary charge sheet filed at a Bengaluru special court, the CBI has also named as accused IMA managing director Mansoor Khan in the case and the then assistant commissioner, Bengaluru North Sub Division, LC Nagaraj among others, the official said. Besides, then deputy superintendent of police (CID) EB Sridhara, inspector and station house officer of the Commercial Street Police Station M Ramesh and sub-inspector of the station P Gowrishankar have also been listed as accused. Sridhara was the inquiry officer and Nimbalkar was the supervisory officer as inspector general in the enquiry done by CID EOW into activities of IMA group entities, the sources said. The CBI has alleged in the supplementary charge sheet that Karnataka government revenue officials along with police officials of Bengaluru had closed the enquiries and verifications conducted by them into the complaints and information received by IMA. "It was further alleged that the accused did not take necessary action under the law, including KPIDFE Act 2004 and instead had given a clean chit and recommended closure of the complaints stating that the said private company had not indulged in any illegal acts. It was also alleged that the illegal activities of the said company had continued unabated and several thousands of investors had lost crore of rupees," CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said. Nagaraj also enquired into the affairs of IMA and gave a clean chit without conducting a proper probe. The clean chit was given on the grounds that no unauthorised deposits were collected and investments of partners, limited liability, partnership are exempted under KPID Act, the agency has found, officials said. The agency probe shows that Hilori, directly supervising the work of Ramesh and Gowrishankar, had failed to register cases in spite of receiving written complaints from the state government officials and social activists, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-files-supplementary-charge-sheet-in-ima-scam-case-903358.html
17-10-2020||National||Local factors main reason for Delhi's air pollution woes, what has AAP govt done: BJP||The BJP on Saturday said local factors are the main reason behind air pollution in Delhi and accused the city government of trying to shift the blame to the Centre with its suggestion that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is the leading factor.  BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma said at a briefing that the air quality index in the national capital had improved on Friday despite the contribution of stubble burning to PM 2.5, increasing from Thursday's six per cent to 18 per cent.  This conforms with the finding of a 2015 IIT Kanpur study which stated that the main factors contributing to the air pollution in Delhi are road dust (38 per cent) vehicular pollution (20 per cent) and domestic sources (12 per cent). "This means 70 per cent of Delhi's air pollution woes are due to local factors. Why does the Delhi government then always look towards Punjab and Haryana to shift the blame of pollution management on the central government," Sharma asked.  While the Delhi government allocated a meagre Rs 52 crore for environment out of its budget of 65,000 crore, the central government earmarked Rs 1,600 crore this year to tackle air pollution in the Delhi-NCR and stubble burning, she said.  "The burning question in the issue of burning of stubble is what has the Punjab government done to deal with the problem? And more importantly what has the chief of the always alleging party (AAP) and the government of Delhi done to control the environment pollution troubling all of Delhi during coronavirus times," Sharma asked. The central government has also constructed eastern and western peripheral expressway, closed Badarpur and Panipat thermal power plants, switched from BS4 to BS6 fuel, backed innovation of Pusa decomposer for crop residue and subsidised electric vehicles to deal with the issue.  The Delhi government has done little except making empty allegations and claims, she said. "When Delhi government allocates a meagre Rs 52 crore in its a 65,000 crore budget for environment, spends nil from the Rs 787 crore from the environment cess it received in 2017, has only three hired road vacuum cleaning machines, but spends upwards of Rs 73 crore on advertisements and self promotion within the months of July and August only, it is clear where CM Arvind Kejriwal's priorities lie," she said.  Claiming that the maximum incidents of stubble burning in 2019 came from Sangrur, she said it is the Lok Sabha constituency of AAP MP Bhagwant Mann and five out of its nine assembly seats have AAP MLAs. "What have they done?" she asked. The AAP government in Delhi has often blamed stubble burning in states like Punjab and Haryana for air pollution in the nation capital during this time of the year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/local-factors-main-reason-for-delhis-air-pollution-woes-what-has-aap-govt-done-bjp-903359.html

The body said it is also cooperating with the probe by Mumbai Police, which has so far arrested six people for allegedly influencing particular channels' ratings by inducing the homes which formed the sample size which was being monitored to determine the ratings. "Our efforts on combating infiltration are focused on the individual(s) responsible for these activities and we firmly believe that television channels are committed to maintaining a clean and transparent ecosystem,” it said in a statement. The city police had claimed that three channels, including Arnab Goswami-headed Republic Media Network, were allegedly influencing the TRP numbers. The Republic has denied the allegations. According to the city police, brands take advertising calls based on TRPs and over Rs 32,000 crore of ad inventory is sold every year, which makes it think that it is a multi-crore scam. The arrested include former employees of an agency engaged by BARC. "BARC is providing the necessary assistance to the ongoing investigation by law enforcement agency and this should be seen in the light of larger stability of the panel and in the interests of self-regulation, rather than in isolated cases of particular channels which leads to a distortion of facts," the BARC statement said. It added that the body is driven by the single goal of generating ratings that its subscribers rely on which are deeply rooted in science, report with the greatest sense of responsibility and truly reflect what the country watches.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/trp-scam-barc-says-its-efforts-focused-on-individuals-believes-channels-committed-to-clean-ecosystem-903362.html

In a tweet, the magazine alleged that police forcibly took the phone from journalist Ahan Penkar, 24, and then deleted all the videos he had recorded while reporting. The journalist was detained for nearly four hours. He has also sustained injuries on his nose, shoulder, back and ankle, the magazine alleged, adding he has filed a complaint with the Delhi Commissioner of Police. Police, however, refuted the allegation, terming it as "false". It said the allegation is being made only to escalate the situation. It claimed the journalist was among the protesters who were detained for violating coronavirus-related restrictions and was subsequently released. The police action is bonafide and is as per law, it said. Police also said that it issued a notice to the journalist for his statement and questioning in connection with the matter. According to police, a matter of suicide by a girl working as a domestic help in the house of a 74-year-old widow was reported on October 4 at Model Town police station. Her body was found hanging with a bedsheet. The door was bolted from inside and was broken by the Fire Services staff in the presence of local police, police said. Inquest proceedings were conducted and the post-mortem was done on October 8 by a board of doctors from Safdarjung Hospital and the findings are that the death had occurred due to asphyxia as a result of antemortem hanging by ligature material and is suicidal in nature, police said. The body was cremated by the family members at the cremation ground in Wazirpur on October 8. No foul play has come to notice so far in the investigation, it said. “On Friday, some protesters staged a demonstration outside Model Town police station to put undue pressure on police and tried to give the incident a different narrative. Despite explaining the facts of the case and repeated warnings to disperse, a few people remained adamant. "They flouted the DDMA guidelines issued in the wake of the epidemic,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said. The demonstrators were detained for violation of the DDMA order. A case has also been registered for the violations under relevant sections of IPC, Epidemic Act and DDMA Act, she said. One Ahan Penkar, who was also seen protesting among the crowd, was also detained and subsequently released, police claimed. He later claimed to be a press person and had alleged misbehaviour by the police, the DCP said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/magazine-alleges-police-detained-assaulted-its-journalist-police-denies-charge-903385.html

The opposition parties have been protesting the three farm sector laws, alleging these are "anti-farmer measures" and will "destroy" the agriculture sector. The government has, however, asserted the new laws will free farmers from the clutches of middleman and allow them to sell their produce anywhere they want at a remunerative price. On Saturday, protests were held at many places, including in Phagwara, Muktsar, Amritsar, Patiala and Bathinda which led to a disruption of vehicular traffic. Farmers assembled at Phagwara-Hoshiarpur road and held a march. They then burnt the effigy of prime minister alleging that their leaders were "disrespected" during a meeting with Agriculture ministry officials in Delhi. Representatives of several farmers' bodies had on Wednesday walked out of a meeting held in Delhi to discuss the farm laws with the Union agriculture secretary after finding no Union minister present at the meeting. Addressing the protesters in Phagwara, BKU (Doaba) General Secretary Satnam Singh Sahni said, "We have been agitating against these farm laws for the last three months. But the Centre has turned a deaf ear to our demands." Refuting reports about fissure among agitating farmer bodies, he asserted that they were all united in their fight against the "anti-farmer" laws. Another farmer leader Manjit Singh Rai said, “If PM Modi shows sincerity in the matter and himself intervenes and invites the agitating farmers, we will go for such parleys." In Ludhiana, a group of agitating farmers demonstrated outside a hotel at Ferozepur road when a meeting of the Punjab BJP led by its state unit chief Ashwani Sharma was in progress. The protesters raised slogans against the Centre and demanded the withdrawal of three farm reform laws. Over the past several days, farmers have been blocking rail tracks, laid siege to toll plazas, fuel pumps, shopping malls and staged sit-ins outside the residences of several BJP leaders in the state. Rail traffic has been disrupted and in turn, coal supply for thermal power plants have been impacted by the farmers' agitation. The farmers have been demanding that the three farm laws passed by Parliament recently be repealed. They have expressed apprehension that the new laws will pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-hold-protests-across-punjab-over-new-farm-reform-laws-burn-effigies-of-pm-903393.html

Jaishankar made these comments against the backdrop of the over five-month-long border standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh where each side has deployed over 50,000 troops. The Sino-India boundary question a very "complicated" and difficult issue, he said at a webinar on his book ‘The India Way', giving a historical perspective to development of the relationship between the two neighbouring countries in the last three decades. The external affairs minister said the relationship between India and China, which was "very difficult", was normalised since late 1980s through a plethora of initiatives like trade, travel, tourism, and societal activities on the premise of peace and tranquillity along the border. "It is not our position that we should solve the boundary question. We understand that it is a very complicated and difficult issue. There have been many negotiations at different levels...That is a very high bar for a relationship," Jaishankar said. "I am talking about a much more basic bar which is that there must be peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the border areas and that has been the case since the late 1980s," he added. "Now, if peace and tranquillity is deeply disturbed, then obviously there will be an impact on the relationship and that is what we are seeing," he said referring to the border situation in eastern Ladakh. Jaishankar said both China and India are rising and assuming "bigger" role in the world, but the "big question" is how the two countries find an "equilibrium". "That is the basic case I addressed in my book," the minister said, adding he completed the manuscript of the book in April, before the border row erupted in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/peace-and-tranquillity-along-lac-deeply-disturbed-impacting-india-china-ties-says-jaishankar-903396.html

As the system is very likely to move away from the Indian coast no adverse weather associated with this system is likely over the west coast of India,” it added. The IMD has, however, cautioned fishermen from venturing into the central and north Arabian Sea. It said light to moderate rainfall at a few places is very likely over coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch during next 24 hours. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over east-central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea on October 17 and over central and northwest Arabian Sea on October 18.

The Crime Branch of Guwahati Police registered a case on Friday for fraud and other related charges, and detained the saffron party activist, they said. "His name is Rajeev Parashar and he was arrested this morning. He used to collect money from candidates, assuring them of giving jobs in various government departments," a senior police officer told PTI. A team of police personnel also recovered some documents and electronic evidence from his possession, he said. "Investigation is on. More details cannot be given at this moment," he said. Another senior police officer said the BJP member was allegedly involved in the controversial recruitment in the state Panchayat and Rural Development Department. The department had conducted an examination in May 2018 to recruit people for 945 posts at different levels. The opposition has been attacking the BJP-led government since then, alleging irregularities and corruption in the recruitment process, but it denied all charges. The Sarbananda Sonowal government is also embroiled in a job scam in the Assam Police. So far, multiple agencies of the state police have arrested 52 people, including retired DIG Prasanta Kumar Dutta, senior police officer Kumar Sanjit Krishna, the brother of Assam Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna, and BJP leader Diban Deka who was later expelled from the party, in connection with the police exam paper leak scam.

The air pollution level in Delhi had hit an eight-month high on Thursday but reduced slightly on Friday with favourable wind speed helping in the dispersion of pollutants, even as the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose to 18 per cent.   The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 263 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320).   An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.   A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour on Friday. It is likely to be 12 kmph on Saturday.   Calm winds and cold temperatures are unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The wind direction is expected to be north-north westerly on Saturday, which is likely to increase the impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air quality.   However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 9,500 metre square per second on Saturday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose from around 6 per cent on Thursday to 18 per cent on Friday. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday. Air quality is expected to improve further to the lower end of the poor category by Sunday, SAFAR said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Friday said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been "extremely unfavourable" for dispersion of pollutants since September as compared to last year. PM10 concentration between September 1 and October 14 this year has been more as compared to the corresponding period last year, CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava. The average ventilation index has been 1,334 metre square per second in September and October this year as compared to 1,850 metre square per second during the corresponding period last year, the official said. With the lesser area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, the CPCB member-secretary hoped the number of stubble burning incidents will be fewer this year as compared to 2019. Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content so farmers burn it. Gargava also said that stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy. With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 situation. Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution. According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contribute the most -- 18 to 39 per cent -- to Delhi's air pollution. Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/delhis-air-quality-poor-stubble-contributes-to-pollution-903171.html

"These three laws are an attack on the soul of every farmer of this country, they are an attack on their sweat and blood. And farmers and labourers of this country understand this,” he said. Referring to his "tractor rallies" against the laws during his recent visit to Punjab and Haryana, Gandhi said, "I came to Punjab and Haryana a few days ago and every farmer and labourer know that these three laws are an attack on them." He said he was happy that the Punjab government has decided to convene a special session of the Assembly on these laws on October 19 where MLAs will "decide about these farm laws". Gandhi was delivering a virtual address at the launch of the second phase of 'Smart Village Campaign' in Punjab. Rs 2,663 crore has been allocated to execute approximately 50,000 different development works under the campaign. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, some of his cabinet colleagues were among those present at the virtual launch. Hitting out at the BJP-led central government over the farm laws, Gandhi said, "If we weaken country's foundation, India will be weakened." "When Congress party fights, we do that to protect and strengthen the foundation. This is the difference between us and the central government. They talk of the building, but they thrust schemes from the top without talking to the panchayat and the people and their laws weaken India's foundation," he said. "If these laws were in favour of farmers and labourers, then why did the government not allow a debate before these were passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha? Why were they afraid of a debate? Entire country would have seen the debate and decided if these laws are for farmers' benefit,” he said. "But in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, voice of India's farmers was suppressed. I am happy that in Punjab assembly, farmers, labourers' voice will be heard in the special session,” said Gandhi. The three farm bills -- the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were passed by Parliament recently. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills. The Congress, many other opposition parties and several farmers organisations have been protesting against these legislations, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income. Gandhi said the Centre had launched an assault on Punjab and its farmers with these ill-conceived laws. "Every building has a foundation. If that weakens the building falls. If Vidhan Sabha is the building, Panchayats and Sarpanches are the foundation. If we have to develop Punjab or India, we have to protect the building and the foundation,” he said, adding that the smart village campaign was aimed at that. Representatives of all the Punjab village panchayats participated in the virtual launch programme. "When Congress runs a programme, be it MNREGA, Right to Food Act or rural infrastructure programme, we run it through medium of panchayats...because we know if we involve panchayats, programmes can run effectively. If we thrust our programmes from the top without involving panchayats and area MLAs, it is bound to fail because it won't involve people,” he said. "I am saddened, people of Punjab too are saddened that the Centre is attacking Punjab's soul,” he said in reference to the new farm laws. Chief Minister Singh said the Centre's new farm laws will be debated in the special session of the Assembly on Monday with the aim to aggressively and effectively combat the damaging impact of the legislations on farmers. Asserting that his government will take all steps to counter the “black laws” and protect the farmers of Punjab, Singh said he will spend every single day of the rest of his life for the revival of Punjab. He also announced his government's decision to give proprietary rights to those settled in “Lal Dora” land for long. 'Lal Dora'' refers to land that is part of the village ''abadi'' (habitation) and is used for non-agriculture purposes only. Expressing happiness on Gandhi being part of the event, the chief minister said Smart Village Campaign would lead to the creation of enormous rural infrastructure to raise the living standard and quality of life by capitalising on technological advances, as part of his government's Rural Transformation Strategy. He assured that adequate allocation would be made for the schemes to be undertaken under the second phase. The first phase of the campaign was launched in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/new-farm-laws-are-an-attack-on-soul-of-every-farmer-rahul-gandhi-903245.html
17-10-2020||National Politics||Opposition parties have become subservient to families, says BJP President J P Nadda||BJP president JP Nadda on Saturday accused the Congress and other opposition parties of becoming subservient to families, and said his own party was the only one for which the organisation came first.  Nadda was addressing the foundation stone laying ceremony of the BJP's new state office here virtually from New Delhi. "Pick up any political party. Parties have become synonymous with families. Be it the Congress or regional parties, they are limited to small families. If one is saving brother and sister, another is saving the mother and son. Someone is saving the son while uncles are fighting nephews," the BJP president said. "Despite being the world's largest party with 18 crore members, the BJP is the only party for whom organisation itself is the family," he said. When a party is run from the home of a leader, the organisation becomes subservient to the individual and that is what has happened with most of the political parties in the country, he said. He said the party office makes a big, informal contribution to the development of a party worker by inculcating the values of sharing and standing for an ideology. Congratulating party leaders for coming up with a plan to build a party office equipped with modern facilities in a prime location, Nadda said it should function as an instrument to take the good works done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the people through optimum utilisation of digital platforms. He asked party workers to make a WhatsApp group at booth-level and share content on it every 15 days. "For example , the prime minister recently launched Pradhan Mantri Swamitva Yojana. This is a historic step towards giving independence to farmers. We should inform people about such things using the digital platforms," Nadda said.  "The PM recently raised the issue of relevance of the United Nations in the present global scenario at UN General Assembly. Such video clips should be uploaded on the party's WhatsApp group to educate party workers " he said.  The unique points of the new education policy which has made the mother tongue of a child the medium of education at the primary level deserve to be highlighted. Nadda also praised party workers for accomplishing the tasks assigned by the party leadership for taking relief to people during the lockdown against odds which will soon be released in the form of an e-book.  He asked party workers to make the party become an instrument of change.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-parties-have-become-subservient-to-families-says-bjp-president-j-p-nadda-903348.html
17-10-2020||North and Central||NEET tie-breaker: Delhi's Akansha Singh attains full marks, loses top rank due to younger age||Delhi's Akansha Singh scored 720 out of 720 marks in medical entrance exam NEET, but lost the top rank to Odisha's Soyeb Aftab due to her younger age which is one of the factors accounted in the National Testing Agency's tie-breaking policy. According to officials, the tie-breaking policy takes into account factors such as age, subject-wise marks and number of incorrect answers. "Soyeb Aftab of Odisha and Akansha Singh of Delhi have both scored perfect 720 score in the NEET examination. However, as Aftab is older, he has been ranked at the top in the national ranking," an official said. "The ranking of the candidate is initially determined based on the scores obtained in Biology and Chemistry. Following these, in cases where the candidates cannot be shortlisted using the scores obtained in the examination, candidates are further shortlisted taking into consideration the number of answers that are incorrect, following which they are then shortlisted depending on their age. The elder one gets the preference," the official explained. The result of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was announced on Friday night with over 7.7 lakh candidates qualifying the exam. The same tie-breaking policy has been used for deciding further ranks. Tummala Snikitha (Telangana), Vineet Sharma (Rajasthan), Amrisha Khaitan (Haryana) and Guthi Chaitanya Sindhu (Andhra Pradesh) have scored 715 out of 720 marks. However, they have been ranked third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. Similarly, those ranked from 8th to 20th have scored 710 marks and those ranked from 25th to 50th have scored 705 out of 720 marks. The exam was conducted on September 13 amid strict precautions in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. From this year, the admissions to MBBS course in 13 All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, will also be made through NEET following the amendment in National Medical Commission Act, 2019, passed by Parliament last year. The test was offered in 11 languages -- English, Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu -- this year. Based on the initial report, more than 77 per cent aspirants took the test in English, around 12 per cent in Hindi and 11 per cent in other languages. The exam was earlier postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the government decided to go ahead with it, despite opposition by a section, to mitigate any further academic loss.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/neet-tie-breaker-delhis-akansha-singh-attains-full-marks-loses-top-rank-due-to-younger-age-903059.html

The body of the class 5 student, who had left home for tuition, was found behind a bush near Chidi village in Ramgarh police station area, police said. "Prima facie, it seems the girl was gang-raped and murdered. But this can be confirmed only after receiving the post-mortem examination report," Superintendent of Police Amber Lakra told PTI. An SIT has been formed to investigate the case, the officer said, adding the culprits will soon be arrested. Soren directed Director General of Police M V Rao to take strict action in the case and inform the CMO about it. He also asked all the district administrations to punish culprits of such cases through fast track courts. The incident has stirred political controversy in bypoll-bound Dumka assembly constituency, vacated by the chief minister himself who retained his other Barhait seat, as the opposition BJP hit out at the administration over the law and situation in the state. By-elections to Dumka and Bermo seats in Jharkhand will be held on November 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/12-year-old-tribal-girl-gang-raped-murdered-in-jharkhand-903068.html

Aftab, the son of homemaker Sultan Razia and Sheik Mohammad Abbas who owns a small business, said it was his mother who motivated him to aspire for becoming a doctor. "I will like to give all the credit to my mother who motivated me to aspire for being a doctor and stood by me all along," he told PTI. Aftab, 18, said his father extended all the financial support but it was his mother who spent her maximum time supporting him on his studies. He said that he moved to the coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan after the class 12 board exam to prepare for the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET). "My mother and younger sister accompanied me to Kota and made all the arrangements for the studies there," he said. The Rourkela boy said most of his time during the day was spent at the coaching class. "I studied for only three hours in the night initially, and eventually increased the time as the examination approached, he said. Aftab, who scored a perfect 720 out of 720 in the exam, said, "I am absolutely happy. There is no doctor in my family. I would like to study in AIIMS-New Delhi." "All the credit goes to my mother and father," he said, reacting to his score. Aftab said that he was confident of getting a place in the top 50 after verifying the answer key of all the questions but never expected to top the exam. Aftab and Delhi's Akansha Singh scored 720 out of 720 marks but the Odisha boy was ranked first and Singh second as per the National Testing Agency's tie-breaking policy, officials said. The tie-breaking policy takes into account factors such as age, subject-wise marks and number of incorrect answers, they said. A total of 7,71,500 candidates have qualified the exam for which over 13.66 lakh candidates had appeared. The highest number of qualifying candidates are from Tripura (88,889), followed by Maharashtra (79,974).

17-10-2020||North and Central||Rakhi for sex offender: SC seeks Attorney General's aid||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Attorney General (A-G) to decide if a court can issue a direction which says that the accused should get a ‘Rakhi’ tied on his hand by the victim as a condition of bail in sexual offences, trivialising the trauma suffered by the victim. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and B R Gavai sought the assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal, as senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, representing a group of woman lawyers, said such orders objectified the victims. The counsel said the court should not have put such conditions for bail, which was against the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code. The plea was filed under the extraordinary situation against a Madhya Pradesh High Court’s order of July 30, but there have been such orders from other states, he said. The court will examine the matter on November 2. Women lawyers approached the court asking it to set aside the Madhya Pradesh HC's direction to an accused of molestation to have a 'Raksha Bandhan' tied by the victim on his wrist as a condition for bail. In their plea, they said it has been seen in cases of sexual offence, women and families do not seek redressal from the criminal justice system primarily to avoid such kind of secondary trauma that they are subjected to in the process of a criminal trial. They asked whether High Court ought not to have employed circumspection and sensitivity while dealing with a case involving a sexual offence and also related to wrongful entry into the property of the victim. The "public-spirited" lawyers led by Aparna Bhat said imposing a condition where the accused would be required to go to the house of the complainant on the festival of 'Rakshabandhan' and request her to tie a rakhi around his wrist with the “promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come” resulted in further victimisation of the survivor in her own house. They challenged the validity of the Madhya Pradesh HC's order of July 30 by which the accused was also told to pay Rs 11,000 to the complainant as customary ritual and seek her blessings and pay Rs 5,000 to her son for purchase of clothes and sweets. "While it is routine for courts to award certain compensation to survivors of sexual offences to be paid by the accused, it is highly objectionable for the HC in the present case to put the complainant in a position where she is forced to accept the sum of Rs 11,000," they said. They further pointed out that the present case was of particular concern since it has taken years to undo the damaging approach followed by courts whereby cases involving sexual offences committed against women were attempted to be compromised by way of marriage or mediation between the accused and the survivor.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rakhi-for-sex-offender-sc-seeks-attorney-generals-aid-903071.html
17-10-2020||North and Central||BJP MLA cites Newton’s third law to justify killing by aide in Uttar Pradesh||A BJP legislator on Friday cited one of the laws of motion propounded by famous physicist Isaac Newton to justify the killing of a rival by his close aide in the presence of senior officials during a meeting in Uttar Pradesh’s Ballia district on Thursday. “Every action is bound to have a reaction,” BJP legislator Surendra Singh said as he justified the killing claiming that his aide had fired in “self-defence” after being attacked by the rivals. MLA’s aide Dhirendra Singh had pumped four bullets into his rival Jai Prakash Pal after an altercation during the meeting convened by the officials to discuss allotment of fair price shops at Durjanpur village in the district. “I am of the view that if one’s father, mother or brother is hit then there will be a reaction to that action,” Singh told reporters. According to the sources, Dhirendra fired several rounds after perpetrating the crime to scare the officials and the cops and managed to escape from the spot. The family members of the victim, however, claimed that Dhirendra enjoyed the ‘patronage’ of the BJP legislator and therefore the police ‘allowed’ him to escape. As the killing sparked tension in the area, the government suspended five officials, including a sub-divisional magistrate, circle officer and three others on charges of laxity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-mla-cites-newton-s-third-law-to-justify-killing-by-aide-in-uttar-pradesh-903072.html
17-10-2020||North and Central||Resident doctors of NDMC hospitals protest at Jantar Mantar, hold candlelight march||Resident doctors of a few North Corporation-run hospitals, who are currently agitating over their pending salaries, held a joint protest at Jantar Mantar here and a candlelight march on Friday to press for their demands. Wearing masks, doctors from Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and Rajen Babu Tuberculosis Hospital, held placards and raised slogans. The Aam Aadmi Party which has been backing these protests, in a statement, claimed that its members had also joined the march. Abhimanyu Sardana, president of RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital, when asked if they had joined, said the protesting doctors were "seeking a solution more than involvement of any political party". "It's still heartwarming to know their (AAP's) extension of support to our voice and their involvement as a public representative so that it can be voiced out to maximum audience and maybe that could give a better solution to our agony," he said. Representatives of their RDAs said no resolution seems to be in sight to the issue so the protest happened at Jantar Mantar. Scores of doctors had gathered there to protest and demand their due salaries. Later in the evening, they held a candlelight march, starting from Jantar Mantar. "We want our due salaries, else we can't work like this. Some solution has to be found," Sardana said. "The RDA on behalf of all residents would be happy if all political parties can sit under one roof and address the issue amicably. If no one is paying heed to our issues and a public representative can escalate the issue, then we would be glad, irrespective of the inclination," he said. The members of the Resident Doctors' Association of the Hindu Rao Hospital have been protesting for the past several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking release of salaries due for the past three months. Since Wednesday, resident doctors of the Kasturba Hospital are on a week-long strike over their pending salaries too. "The RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital stands in solidarity with the RDA of Kasturba Hospital and RDA of Rajen Babu TB Hospital in the ongoing agitation on the grounds of non-payment of salaries for almost four months. We cumulatively would like to state that there hasn't been any resolution to our issues regarding the aforementioned," the RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital had said in a statement on Thursday. "Therefore, we all NDMC residents would like to join hands on a common platform to demonstrate our agitation validating our affliction with the administration due to strict non-compliance" it said. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash in a tweet late Wednesday night had claimed, "Today, salaries released of all doctors, nurses, paramedics and group C and D staff and for the rest it will be released soon." Prakash, when contacted, said salary has been released for "month of July". The crisis over pending salaries of doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run hospitals had deepened on Wednesday as an association of permanent medics of civic-run hospitals also threatened that its members will go on an indefinite strike from October 19 if their demands were not met, including release of pending salaries. The BJP, which controls the NDMC and ruling AAP have sought to blame each other for the situation. "We doctor have become football among various parties," said a protesting doctor, who did not wish to be identified. "Entire medical fraternity and all the hospitals of Delhi should unite and extend support to these striking doctors who are demanding basic rights and need," AIIMS RDA president Adarsh Pratap Singh said, expressing solidarity with protesting doctors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/resident-doctors-of-ndmc-hospitals-protest-at-jantar-mantar-hold-candlelight-march-903084.html

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice A K Goel noted that brick kiln industry contributed about 5 to 7 per cent of PM10 emissions in winter and summer, respectively, to ambient air of Delhi and NCR. "The concerned authorities in the state of Uttar Pradesh may keep a vigil against illegal operation of brick kilns so as to protect the air quality in the NCR," the bench, also comprising Justice S P Wangdi, said. It also dismissed an application seeking permission to operate brick kiln. The NGT had earlier slammed the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary for allowing brick kilns to operate in the state despite its prohibition during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The NGT said it was surprised how the chief secretary could have passed a contrary order in violation of the order of this tribunal which amounts to a criminal offence. The order came after the Ghaziabad district magistrate told the bench that in March, due to the lockdown situation in the district with respect to Covid-19, inspections at kilns could not be carried out. He told the tribunal that during the lockdown period, the chief secretary issued directions to all the district magistrates of Uttar Pradesh to allow the brick kilns to operate in the state. The NGT had earlier directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to conduct a carrying capacity study of brick kilns in NCR and other regions and its impact on ambient air quality. The tribunal was hearing a bunch of pleas filed by journalist Shailesh Singh and others seeking action against brick kilns, which are operating without complying to pollution norms and causing immense air and water pollution. It alleged that 600 brick kilns are illegally operating in Baghpat district without obtaining necessary clearances from statutory authorities concerned. The plea, filed through advocate Preeti Singh, listed seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Hapur and Muzaffarnagar, 13 districts of Haryana, including Gurgaon, and two districts (Alwar and Bharatpur) of Rajasthan, besides Delhi in the petition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ngt-directs-uttar-pradesh-to-be-vigilant-about-illegal-operation-of-brick-kilns-903201.html

The 62-year-old Sandhu who fought terrorism in Punjab was shot dead in the district on Friday, months after the government withdrew his security cover. The motorcycle-borne men pumped four bullets into him when he was at his office adjoining his home at Bhikhiwind. Sandhu's wife Jagdish Kaur Sandhu, told reporters, "The family would not cremate him unless the killers are arrested." She also demanded security cover for her family. "All the family members -- I, my late husband, his brother Ranjit Singh Sandhu and his wife Balraj Kaur Sandhu -- are Shaurya Chakra awardees and this award was given by the Centre for our fight against militancy." "Both the state and Central governments are accountable for the intelligence failure that resulted in the killing of my husband at the hands of terrorists," Sandhu's wife said. She also said if the state government failed to provide security to the family, then it was the responsibility of the Centre to do the needful. Sandhu had fought against terrorism in the state for years, facing scores of terror attacks during the height of Khalistani militancy. His security cover was withdrawn by the state government a year ago on the recommendation of Tarn Taran police, his brother Ranjit had said, adding their entire family had remained on the hit list of terrorists. Sandhu's wife Jagdish Kaur had on Friday said it was the "handiwork of terrorists", maintaining that their family did not have any personal enmity with anyone. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had condoled Sandhu's death and set up a special investigation team headed by Ferozpur Deputy Inspector General of Police to probe the killing. The chief minister said the SIT will probe the killing, taking all possibilities into account. The guilty will not be spared, he had said. The Tarn Taran braveheart had featured in some documentaries. Inspired by Sandhu and his family, many people followed him and defended themselves from terror attacks. He was awarded Shaurya Chakra in 1993.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/family-refuses-to-conduct-last-rites-of-shaurya-chakra-awardee-balwinder-singh-sandhu-until-his-killers-are-arrested-903216.html

Eight people have been named accused in the incident on Thursday. While police is on the lookout for six people, including local BJP leader Dhirendra Pratap Singh, two have been arrested. Police have detained five others in the case. Besides the eight accused, the FIR also mentions 20-25 unnamed accused of which three people who were later identified as Munna Yadav, Raj Pratap Yadav and Rajan Tewari were arrested on Saturday, Additional SP Sanjay Yadav said. DIG (Azamgarh Range) Subhash Chandra Dubey has announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 on information leading to the arrest of each of the accused. "A cash reward of Rs 50,000 has been announced on each of the absconding accused. Action will also be initiated under the National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangster Act against the accused,” he said. Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.

Accused Singh, in a video that has gone viral on social media, blamed the SDM, CO and police of ignoring his request to deploy police personnel during the meeting and claimed that one of his family members died in the incident while eight were injured. Singh also said that he served the Army for 18 years and that day he only tried to save his family as he saw his 80-year-old father and sister-in-law being attacked in presence of administration officials. His brother Narendra Pratap Singh and one Devendra Pratap Singh have been arrested in the case. Police have formed 12 teams to arrest the remaining accused. BJP MLA from Bariya assembly seat, Surendra Singh who has come out in support of the accused on Saturday visited the Reoti Police Station with family members (women and children) of the accused, claiming that they had also suffered injuries in the incident and an FIR should be registered. Later, he went to the district hospital with the family members and was seen wiping his tears. “It is natural to get emotional on seeing the pain of others,” the BJP MLA said. He also questioned the role of the administration in the incident. Meanwhile, the family of the deceased demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh and a government job for his son, pension to his widow besides strict action against the culprits. Police admitted that there appeared to be "laxity" on their part and suspended nine personnel -- three sub-inspectors and six constables -- posted at the Reoti Police Station. Sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Suresh Chandra Pal and circle officer of police Chandrakesh Singh were suspended on the directions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath soon after the incident on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ballia-firing-charges-under-nsa-gangsters-act-will-be-slapped-on-accused-say-police-903247.html

School managements have said that they are prepared to resume classes while ensuring strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol including limiting attendance in the classes to 50 per cent per day for the sake of social distancing. However, they are not ready to take the blame if a student gets infected despite the precautionary measures. "While we will make sure that the SOPs are followed, I must say that the schools should not be held responsible if a student catches the virus," Chairman Doon International School D S Mann said. The reopening of schools has put parents in a spot as they do not want to expose their wards to the risk of catching the infection but are left with no choice as the option of studying online will no longer be available for the children of the two classes. “Children have spent half of the session attending online classes. There is no harm in letting them continue their studies in this manner for the rest of the session," said Asha Rawat, a resident of Nehru colony. "My daughter studies in class XII and used to go to school on a bicycle. It is better that she studies at home rather than venturing out and taking the risk (of catching Covid-19)," she added. "The health of our children is paramount. Why should we take the risk of sending our children to school when neither the state government nor the school authorities are ready to take the responsibility of their safety," another parent in the Dalanwala area, who did not wished to be named, said. Some of the parents opined that the children should be called only for practical classes if that is a must and not for regular classes until a vaccine for coronavirus is found and every child is vaccinated. Despite getting bored at home due to the prolonged closure of schools, the students too said that they did not want to to take a risk by venturing out. "I am not with the government's decision to reopen schools. I know it will not be possible to take all precautions once the classes resume," said Anushka Bisht, a student of class XII. However, Uttarakhand government spokesperson and cabinet minister Madan Kaushik said all precautions including safe transportation in sanitised buses with only 50 per cent occupancy, regular sanitisation of the premises, limiting the attendance in the classes to 50 per cent of their total capacity and hand sanitisation every now and then will be taken by the school authorities to protect the students. Asked if someone gets infected despite the precautions, Kaushik said, "No one will be held responsible for that". The minister, who had tested positive for the virus recently, added, "I had also tested positive for Covid-19. Did I blame anyone?" Meanwhile, in compliance with the state cabinet's decision to reopen schools for Class X and XII, their managements have prepared an elaborate plan on how to go about it. "To limit the attendance of a class to 50 per cent, the odd-even formula will be followed going by the roll numbers of children,” Doon International School Vice Principal Dinesh Barthwal said. “School buses to be run with only 50 per cent occupancy and will be properly sanitised before and after every ride and it will be mandatory for students to wear masks and maintain physical distance from each other,” he said. Children will be allowed to enter the school premises only after thermal screening and there will be a ban on prayer assemblies and sports, Barthwal added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttarakhand-schools-set-to-reopen-from-november-1-parents-remain-worried-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-903256.html

17-10-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh bypolls: Congress manifesto promises help to Covid-19 victims' kin||In the 'Vachan Patra' released by state Congress chief Kamal Nath for the November 3 bypolls to 28 assembly seats in the state, the opposition party also promised to roll out a farm loan waiver scheme, a welfare scheme for cows and uplift of the Gwalior-Chambal region. In order to return to power in the state, which the Congress lost in March this year, the party has to win all the 28 assembly seats, while the ruling BJP only needs nine seats to reach the majority mark of 116 in the 230-member House. In the manifesto, Congress promised help to the families of the Covid-19 victims, saying that pension would be given to a woman in case of the death of her husband, and food and health services would be provided to the poor during the ongoing crisis. It also said that opportunities for employment and self-employment would be created if the sole bread-winner of the family has died to the infection. The manifesto promises to launch 'Godhan Sewa Yojana' in Madhya Pradesh on the lines of 'Godhan Nyay Yojana' of Chhattisgarh rolled out by the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in that state. The neighbouring state's scheme for cows aims to financially help the people in rural areas and also solve the problem of stray cattle, it said. In the poll document, the Congress also announced to rope in 'gau sevaks' (cow volunteers) in the scheme, saying the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government had removed them. The manifesto promises to restart the scheme of giving farm loan waiver of up to Rs two lakh. It is widely believed that the Congress's promise of farm loan waiver was one of the major factors behind its victory in the 2018 state polls. The party also promised to host a summit of businessmen from India and abroad in Gwalior to attract investments in the Gwalior-Chambal region, which accounts for 16 of the 28 bypoll seats. The party also announced several other sops for the Gwalior-Chambal region, which includes organising Chambal Mahotsav (festival) annually and starting paperwork for metro rail network in Gwalior. The bypolls are being held following the death of three MLAs and resignations of 25 others earlier this year. Twenty-two rebel Congress MLAs, mostly from the Jyotiraditya Scindia camp, had resigned in March this year, reducing the Kamal Nath-led dispensation to a minority and paving the way for the BJP to form the government in the state. Scindia and these former MLAs had joined the BJP. The saffron party then sent Scindia to Rajya Sabha, while many of his loyalists got important portfolios in Shivraj Singh Chouhan's cabinet. In July, three more Congress MLAs resigned and joined the BJP, taking their number to 25, while three assembly seats had fallen vacant due to the death of legislators. In March, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government had won the trust of 112 MLAs with the help of a Samajwadi Party legislator, two BSP and as many Independents MLAs. After the December 2018 MP assembly polls, the Samajwadi Party (SP), BSP and four Independents had supported the Congress to form the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-congress-manifesto-promises-help-to-covid-19-victims-kin-903293.html

Earlier, Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) convener Zafaryab Jilani had said here that he was not 'satisfied' with the verdict and that it would be challenged in the high court. Jilani had said that the CBI had failed to put up a strong case despite there being enough evidence against the BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders who had been charged with conspiracy to bring down the disputed structure. The Board also decided to form a committee to apprise the political parties and religious outfits about the pitfalls of uniform civil code, sources said.

The chief minister said that 'Mission Shakti', whose start coincided with the commencement of the Navrati festival dedicated to Goddess Durga, is a tribute to the woman who died after being allegedly raped by two men in Balrampur and asserted that his government has "zero tolerance" towards crime against women and girls. The 22-year-old Dalit woman died after being allegedly raped by two men, who were later arrested, in the district. The incident came close on the heels of the gangrape-murder of another Dalit woman in Hathras that had drawn intense outrage after alleged apathy of the administration. "Those who cast an evil eye on the dignity and self-respect of women will find no place in the state. Perpetrators of such crimes are a blot on the society and the government will deal with them with an iron hand," Adityanath asserted . The campaign will continue for the next six months till Basant Navratri, the chief minister said. "The first phase of ''Mission Shakti'' will focus on spreading awareness towards ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girl-child. "In the second phase, ''Operation Shakti'' will target eve-teasers and put them on the path of punishment or reform. If such elements do not mend their ways, they will have to face social-boycott and their pictures will be displayed publicly," Adityanath said. In state capital Lucknow, Governor Anandiben Patel inaugurated the 'Safe City Project' under which the police and other departments will work towards the safety of women. "Crime against women is increasing, and in this scenario, the responsibility of society increases. If the schemes meant for women are not properly implemented, they will lose their importance. Till such time that women are dependent on others socially or monetarily, they will be exploited. The women have to become empowered," Patel said. She also asked the police to identify people with "criminal and perverted mindset" and take action against them "Girls are harassed while going to schools. It is because of these people that women do not feel safe in the family. Police must identify these people, and act before they could commit crime," the governor said. The chief minister said that this year Ram Lila and Durga Puja pandals will also spread the message of ''Mission Shakti'', which will have the involvement of 24 departments. Various events are lined up during the campaign for which 100 role models among women will be identified in each district to help spread the message of women safety, self-respect and self-reliance. Adityanath described women as a symbol of ''Shakti'' and said gender equality and protection of the girl child should start from home itself. "Women are venerable in our eternal tradition and Navratri signifies this. In these changing times, the new generation should become the carrier of our eternal tradition, which always professes the cause of women as the prime duty of mankind. ''Mission Shakti'' is a reminder of our duty towards women and girls," he said. Terming female foeticide as a curse, the chief minister said, "Protection of the girl child and giving respect to women should start from home". Adityanath also expressed his strong views against child marriage, saying such practices should be publicly condemned. In a statement issued in Lucknow, the UP Raj Bhavan said the Governor flagged off 100 pink scooties and 10 four-wheeler police vehicles. Lucknow is among eight cities in the country selected for the 'Safe City Project'. The central government has approved the project for Lucknow at a total cost of Rs 194 crore with an aim to strengthen security of women in public places. The UP Governor also said that the responsibility of the universities and educational institutes is not confined only to admission, teaching, examination and results. "Discussions should also be held as to whether the daughters are safe or not, and whether they have information about their rights," she said. Throwing light on the ''Safe City Project'', Additional Director General of Police (Women and Child Security) Neera Rawat said, "The cost of the projects is shared between the Centre and the state in 60:40 ratio. "These vehicles have first-aid kit, flashlights and other facilities. The women personnel will combat crimes against women, which will make them feel secure."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cm-adityanath-launches-mission-shakti-vows-zero-tolerance-to-crimes-against-women-903303.html

"Aaropi khastriya hai, isliye uske saath khada hoon" (the accused hails from thakur community and so I stand with him), Singh told reporters in Ballia on Saturday. "I am even ready to quit politics to safeguard the interests of the thakur community....I shall begin a fast unto death if the police do not register the complaint from the family of the accused," he added. Singh, who visited the family of the accused, Dhirendra Singh, who was a close aide of the legislator, also approached the cops to get a complaint registered on behalf of the family of the accused. The accused, who continued to be at large, released a video blaming the local officials, including the SDM, CO and others for the incident and claimed to be innocent. "I had warned the officials that there might be trouble at the meeting but they did not take it seriously," he claimed. Singh had on Friday justified the killing claiming that his aide had fired in 'self defense' after being attacked by the rivals. The MLA's aide Dhirendra Singh had pumped four bullets into his rival Jai Prakash Pal after an altercation during the meeting convened by the officials to discuss allotment of fair price shops at Durjanpur village in the district.

Vice President of Pradesh Congress Committee Raman Bhalla also alleged that the BJP had gained power after "betrayal of the mandate" and its experiments cost too much to the people of Jammu and Kashmir who lost their identity as a state besides all safeguards to their land and jobs. The Centre revoked the special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the erstwhile state of J&K into Union territories on August 5 last year. "The people will not spare BJP for its total failure and arbitrary and undemocratic decisions besides imposing heavy taxes, price hike and economic crises and failures on health and medicare during the Covid-19 pandemic, as a result people died due to shortage of oxygen in hospitals," Bhalla alleged. The Congress leader was part of a party delegation headed by PCC president G A Mir on a tour of Doda and Kishtwar districts, where they visited the house of party colleague and former minister Mohammad Sharief Niaz who died on October 12 and also met party workers and local residents. "The people are fed up with the bluffs and failures of the BJP and will teach the party a lesson in the next assembly elections. The only achievement of BJP is to create division and hatred in society which has disturbed our age old secular and social fabric," he claimed and asked the people to maintain their brotherhood and unity and defeat all provocations to disturb peace. Mir said the Congress focused on giving due political share and faster development of remote and backward areas of Doda and other areas of Chenab region during its government in the erstwhile state and at the Centre. "It was the Congress which gave due share in political power and ensured faster development on priority basis of the backward and under developed Chenab region," he said. Mir said his party would emerge stronger to gain power in the next elections in Jammu and Kashmir and would always give due representation and special focus to the backward and underdeveloped regions of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/people-fed-up-with-bluffs-and-failures-of-bjp-in-jammu-and-kashmir-congress-leader-903351.html
17-10-2020||North and Central||Several initiatives taken against corruption in Haryana: CM Manohar Lal Khattar||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said the BJP-led dispensation in the state has taken several initiatives in the last six years to bring transparency in the government machinery and rein-in corruption. "Radical changes have been made in the system by using information technology," he said. "In the last six years, we have taken several initiatives to bring transparency in the system and rein-in corruption. These initiatives taken by Haryana to bring about reforms have been appreciated at the national level," Khattar told reporters here. He said in the last six years, recruitment on about 85,000 government posts has been done on the basis of merit, adding that in the next five years too, merit-based recruitment will be done on more than one lakh posts. The Chief Minister expressed confidence that the employees, who are recruited on the basis of merit, will meet the expectations of the public and stay away from corrupt practices. Khattar announced a number of reform measures in the transport department with the main aim to curb corruption. District transport officers (DTOs) will be appointed in all the 22 districts in place of regional transport secretaries. After ensuring the elimination of the role of "undesirable contactmen" (middlemen) at the tehsil offices, now the public will also get rid of them at the RTA offices, be it for getting driving licences or getting vehicles passed, the Chief Minister said. He also said after Rohtak, six inspection and certification centres to inspect and check the fitness of vehicles will be opened in six more districts -- Ambala, Karnal, Hisar, Gurugram, Faridabad and Rewari. He further informed that automated driving test tracks will be set up in 11 districts, where driving skills will be tested and the entire test process will be computerised. As a result, people will not have to approach the middlemen for getting their driving licences, the Chief Minister said. He said a provision of Rs 30 crore has been made for this and these centres will be opened within a year. Similarly, to keep a vigil on overloading of commercial vehicles, which Khattar said is a major reason behind corrupt practices, the state government has decided that portable scales will be installed on the roads and even the drivers will not get to know when the weight of their vehicles has been measured. He said 45 portable scales have been bought by the state government and after the success of the experiment, more such portable scales will be installed in the state. Khattar further said body cameras will be worn by the vehicle inspectors going for checking and passing of commercial vehicles, so as to ensure that the recording of the entire checking process is done and its monitoring will be carried out at the transport department's headquarters. The Chief Minister said the problem of overloading is usually found in mining vehicles, therefore the "e-Ravana" software has been prepared by the mining department, which will now be integrated with the "Vahan" software of the transport department. Khattar informed that at present, the number of registered commercial vehicles at the RTA offices is around 1.25 lakh and the number of employees is only 627.  More recruitment will be done within a period of one year for a smooth functioning of these offices, he said. The Chief Minister also indicated that after the RTA, he will select some other departments where there is a high probability of corruption and action on checking such corruption will be taken soon. Replying to a question, he said in 2014-15, the excise revenue of the state was Rs 3,200 crore, which increased to Rs 6,400 in 2020-21 and is estimated to be Rs 7,000 crore by the end of the current fiscal. To another question, Khattar said arrangements have been made by the state government to ensure that the ongoing procurement process of Kharif crops is done in a smooth and systematic manner. "The interests of the farmers of Haryana are paramount for the state government and for this, the procurement of the crops brought by the farmers of the state is being done at the state mandis on a priority," he said. Farmers of other states will have to get their crops registered on the state government's portal, before bringing it to the mandis of Haryana, whether it is through arhtiyas (commission agents) or at their own level, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/several-initiatives-taken-against-corruption-in-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar-903356.html

Bainsla had last year spearheaded the Gujjar agitations in the state over their demand of five per cent quota in jobs and educational institutions. The Gujjar leader had on Saturday called a mahapanchayat at Malarna Dungar in Sawai Madhopur district to hold discussions with the community members on pending demands like recruitment on backlog posts. “Some of our demands are still pending with the state government. We have held several meetings and the government always assures action on fulfilling the demands, but there is no result. If the demands are not met, there will be an agitation from November 1. We want peace and what we deserve," Bainsla said at the mahapanchayat. His son Vijay Bainsla said recruitment on backlog posts was one of the several pending demands. The Centre should also get the reservation to Gujjars under the ninth schedule of the Constitution, he demanded. Meanwhile, IAS officer Neeraj K Pawan met the Gujjar leaders to resolve the matter. He said the state government has fulfilled all the demands of the community. Solutions are being found to fulfil some of the remaining small demands, which are pending due to technical issues, the officer said. Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra said the community leaders should talk to the 25 BJP MPs to get the reservation included in the ninth schedule of the Constitution as it has to be done by the Centre. On the other hand, BJP state president Satish Poonia accused the Congress-led state government of creating confusion in the matter due to which the Gujjars were planning to hit the streets again for their demands. He alleged that the government was running away from its responsibility by attacking the BJP. “The government should take responsibility and maintain the law and order situation of the state by taking appropriate steps,” Poonia added. The Rajasthan assembly had last year passed a bill giving 5 per cent quota in government jobs and educational institutes to the Gujjars and four other communities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gujjars-in-rajasthan-threaten-agitation-if-pending-demands-not-fulfilled-903374.html
17-10-2020||North and Central||Boy from Pulwama tops NEET exam in Jammu and Kashmir||A teenager from militancy-infested south Kashmir's Pulwama district has topped the NEET examination from the Union Territory despite internet connectivity issues in most parts of the valley since over a year. Basit Bilal Khan (18) secured 695 marks out of 720 in the NEET exam, the result of which was declared on Friday. Khan, hailing from Ratnipora village in Pulwama, said while he worked very hard for the competitive examination, frequent internet outages and slow network speed created a lot of hardships. "I am thankful to God for bestowing this success on me. I am thankful of my parents who supported me always and also of my teachers who showed me a track and guided me and worked hard on me," he told reporters near a private study centre here where he studied for the exams. "My family is very excited with the results as they had huge expectations from me. But this is because of the hard work of my teachers and their polishing. I am feeling proud now being the topper from Jammu and Kashmir," the ecstatic teenager said. He said while the faculty at the study centre covered the syllabus wholly in time, the internet connectivity issues created a lot of difficulties for him and other candidates like him. "We faced a lot of hardships because of internet connectivity issues. My teachers had prepared video tutorials for us, but it was very difficult to access them on 2G network." "However, a philosopher has said that 'if it is important for you, you try to find ways and if it is not, you try to find excuses'. Obviously, the situation was challenging. But if you really want to crack this examination, then you find ways to work hard and if you work with dedication, then God will help you. I did my best and achieved success," he said. Mobile internet often remains suspended in Pulwama district because of anti-militancy operations undertaken by security forces, while the speed of the internet has remained restricted to 2G since August last year when the Centre abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution. The network speed has been increased to 4G in Ganderbal district in the Kashmir Valley and Udhampur district in Jammu region only so far. Khan advised the candidates intending to compete in the examination to not waste time. "They should utilise time and study and practice in such a manner that they do not have any regrets later," the 18-year-old said, adding that he used to take a lot of mock tests during the lockdown imposed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. A faculty member at the study centre said the students faced a lot of hardships due to 2G internet connectivity, but a mobile app which worked on low-speed internet helped to cross the hurdle. "I am much happier today than I was when I qualified this examination. These students faced a lot of hardships due to low-speed internet network. It was not possible to access study material on 2G network," the teacher said. "Then we contacted an app developer and he developed an app for us which worked on low-network speed. We reached our students through our app and we regularly communicated with them and sent across all the study material,” he said. The teacher said while he was proud of the achievement of all-India NEET topper Soyeb Aftab who secured 100 per cent marks, the conditions in Jammu and Kashmir were more difficult. "If we compare the atmosphere he studied in with the situation here... that he did not face any internet shutdowns or speed restrictions.. there is a narrow gap in his and Basit's marks, if Basit got such favourable conditions, then he will easily score full marks," he said. Meanwhile, Farooq Khan, advisor to lieutenant governor, felicitated Basit Bilal Khan for his historic feat by securing 99.98 percentile in NEET-2020 exam. Basit Bilal Khan met the advisor at his official residence here. The advisor enquired about his field of interests, strengths, difficulties and his approach to qualify the prestigious exam, an official spokesman said. The advisor congratulated Bilal Basit Khan for qualifying the exam and topping from Jammu and Kashmir despite facing many odds and expressed hope he would inspire many other youths from the region to crack other prestigious exams in order to serve society in the best possible way so that their energy would be utilised for the development of the nation. The advisor said J-K is full of fertile minds but the need is to provide them proper exposure to an environment where they would hone their skills to excel in their respective fields. Jammu and Kashmir National Conference president and Member of Parliament from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah, and party vice-president Omar Abdullah also congratulated Basit Bilal Khan and other successful NEET qualifiers from Jammu and Kashmir, a NC spokesman said. While congratulating the successful students of NEET examination, the NC president said there is no substitute to hard work and that perseverance and hard work are the key to success. Farooq Abdullah said Basit Bilal Khan has proven that the youth of Kashmir were second to none in academic excellence and chasing dreams for a better tomorrow. "If students like Basit can do it despite all challenges due to the prevailing situation, other students can do it as well. I am sure students will take inspiration from him and bump up their efforts to achieve academic excellence," the MP added. While congratulating the successful candidates, Omar Abdullah said it was elevating to see local youth cracking such prestigious exams despite various oddments, lack of resources and dearth of necessary exposure.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/boy-from-pulwama-tops-neet-exam-in-jammu-and-kashmir-903375.html

The Congress' 'vachan patra' promised to carry forward the farm loan waiver scheme implemented under the previous Kamal Nath dispensation if the party wins enough seats in the bypoll to come back to power. "The Congress' farm loan waiver scheme was a lie. The Kamal Nath government spoke of waiver to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore. The previous Congress government gave this amount as NPAs to banks. The Congress issued fake certificates of loan waiver to large number of farmers," MP BJP chief VD Sharma told reporters. Some farmers who paid back their loans were shown as beneficiaries of the waiver scheme by the Congress government, Sharma alleged. He said the Congress' promises in the manifesto for the 2018 Assembly polls, like homes for people, allowance for unemployed youth, fuel price rebate etc, were never fulfilled in the 15 months Nath was CM. Hitting back, MP Congress spokesperson Durgesh Sharma said the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, in the Assembly, had accepted that loans of 26.95 lakh farmers had been waived off during Congress rule. Bypolls to 28 seats are scheduled for November 3. The counting of votes set to take place on November 10. While the BJP needs to win nine of these seats to attain a simple majority of 116 in the 230-member house, the Congress needs to sweep all 28 to get back to power.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mp-bypolls-congress-farm-loan-waiver-scheme-was-a-lie-says-bjp-903378.html

He also said Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation for allowing leaders like Chidambaram and Digvijaya Singh to speak "against the country". Reacting to Chidambaram's statement that the Congress resolutely stands for the restoration of the special status and rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the "arbitrary and unconstitutional" decisions of the Narendra Modi government of August 5, 2019, must be rescinded, Raina said he has a doubt that the former Union minister might have links with Pakistan's ISI and Naxalites. "Congressmen have always stabbed the country in its back. Article 370 had given birth to terrorism, separatism and a pro-Pakistan ideology and was the main cause for the bloodshed in Jammu and Kashmir. "Chidambaram is toeing the line of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan's premier Imran Khan," Raina said in a video statement uploaded on his Twitter handle. He alleged that treason runs deep in the blood and DNA of Congressmen. "When it (Article 370) was uprooted, Jinping and Khan felt the pain and so did Congress leaders Chidambaram and Rahul Gandhi. The statement makes it clear that the Congress is dancing to the tune of China and Pakistan and I have a doubt that Chidambaram might have links with the ISI and Naxalites," the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said. He said the entire country is watching the "Congress drama" and people would never forgive the party. "Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi should apologise to the nation because they have committed a great sin by giving the licence to Chidambaram and Digvijaya Singh to speak against the country," Raina said. On Friday, Chidambaram welcomed the coming together of mainstream regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the National Conference (NC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP), and said the BJP-led central government must stop looking at the mainstream political parties and people of the Union Territory as "anti-national". "The coming together of mainstream regional parties of Jammu and Kashmir to fight a constitutional battle to restore the rights of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh is a development that must be welcomed by all the people of India," the former home minister said. He said the Congress resolutely stands for the restoration of the status and rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the arbitrary and unconstitutional decisions of the Modi government of August 5, 2019, must be rescinded.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-bjp-chief-slams-chidambaram-says-he-might-have-links-with-isi-naxalites-903398.html

Additional Superintendent of Police R S Gautam said that 21-year-old Rishikesh Singh alias Rishu was arrested on the basis of information provided by his associate Dinesh Gautam (19), who was held on Friday in connection with the case. The ASP said that the date of birth provided by the primary school has revealed that the victim was a minor, and, therefore, charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have also been included. Police had earlier said she was 18 years old. The ASP said that Dinesh confessed his role in the crime on persistent interrogation and also provided several vital inputs on the basis of which Rishikesh, who runs a shop in the village, was arrested. He said that the two accused committed the alleged crime in a planned manner. On the day of the incident, which took place under Satrikh police limits of Barabanki district, Rishikesh allegedly informed Dinesh that the girl had gone to the agriculture field alone, indicating a plan behind the crime, the ASP said. The post-mortem examination had confirmed that the girl was raped before she was strangled and charges related to rape were included in the FIR registered at Satrikh police station, he said. On Friday, the ASP had said, "We have detained Dinesh Gautam (19), who is a relative of the victim. He has confessed to the crime. We are interrogating him." The father of the girl had informed police on Wednesday evening that she had gone to the fields but did not return home. Later, her family members found her dead. A police team had visited the village and collected evidence before lodging an FIR, the police officer had said. This rape-and-murder case came days after a 19-year-old Dalit woman died after she was assaulted and allegedly gang-raped in Hathras district, triggering a nationwide outrage. The Hathras woman died at a hospital in Delhi on September 29.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-police-makes-second-arrest-in-barabanki-rape-murder-case-adds-pocso-charges-903403.html

"Sisters and daughters cannot be safe till the BJP government is there in Uttar Pradesh as this government has surrendered before criminal elements," he said in a statement issued by the party here. Daughters, mothers, sisters, villages and cities are different but their fate is the same, Yadav said. The state is fast turning into "barbaric Hatya Pradesh" he said. Questioning the Shakti Mission launched by the state government for the security and empowerment of women and girls on the occasion of Navratri on Saturday, Yadav questioned its relevance. When the situation is so bad, what is the relevance of the special campaign of the chief minister for the safety, security and empowerment of women, he asked. The government that has failed on all fronts needs to quit in the interest of the state and its people, the SP chief said. Referring to cases of crime against women in different districts of Uttar Pradesh, he said people have lost faith in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and its police.

17-10-2020||North and Central||Janata Congress Chhattisgarh chief Amit Jogi's nomination for bypoll rejected on caste issue||The nomination papers of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) chief Amit Jogi for bypoll to the reserved Marwahi Assembly seat was rejected by the returning officer on Saturday, stating that his caste certificate was invalid. The decision was based on the order of a High Level Certification Scrutiny Committee headed by D D Singh, secretary, Chhattisgarh Tribal Welfare Department. The committee on October 15 dismissed Amit Jogi's claim of being a tribal and canceled his caste certificate. The returning officer also rejected the nomination of Amit Jogi's wife Richa Jogi for the same bypoll on the same ground. Marwahi assembly seat, former chief minister late Ajit Jogi's bastion, will thus not have a contestant from the Jogi family this time. The seat, which falls in the newly-formed Gaurela- Pendra-Marwahi (GPM) district, fell vacant following JCC (J) chief and Amit's father Ajit Jogi's death on May 29. "A total of 19 candidates had filed nominations for the Marwahi bypoll scheduled for November 3. Of them, nomination papers of six candidates, including Amit Jogi and Richa Jogi, were rejected after scrutiny," an election official said. The candidates can withdraw their names from the contest till October 19, he added. "Marwahi seat is reserved for ST category and both Amit Jogi and Richa Jogi do not have valid caste certificates as of today, therefore their nominations were rejected," he said. The High Level Certification Scrutiny Committee on October 15 canceled Amit Jogi's caste certificate which claimed that he was member of the Kanwar community. The ST caste certificate issued to Richa Jogi was suspended on Thursday by a district-level verification committee of Mungeli, the official said. A senior government official said that Amit Jogi's tribal caste certificate was canceled on the ground that his father Ajit Jogi's certificate as belonging to a tribal community was canceled in August last year. Amit Jogi alleged that the action was taken at the behest of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel. "The high level caste scrutiny committee suddenly canceled my certificate. Except me, everyone was aware of it. I sought time to read it but was not allowed," Jogi said. "The move to prevent me from contesting elections has proved that the government has finally admitted that it is not just difficult to beat Jogi, it is impossible. It has been done at the behest of the Chief Minister," he alleged. "We will fight a legal battle and win our honour and rights," he added. After becoming the first Chief Minister of the state in 2000, Ajit Jogi contested a by-election from Marwahi in 2001 and won. He emerged victorious in the 2003 and 2008 Assembly elections as well. In 2013, Amit Jogi successfully contested from Marwahi. In 2016, Ajit Jogi quit the Congress and floated Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (J). He won from Marwahi again as JCC (J) candidate in 2018 polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/janata-congress-chhattisgarh-chief-amit-jogis-nomination-for-bypoll-rejected-on-caste-issue-903437.html

The object was spotted in the sky in the Dankaur area in the morning and later landed in a canal near Bhatta Parsaul village, where a crowd had gathered to see what some of them thought was “an alien”, officials said. “It was a balloon filled with air that had gone up in the sky and later came down and got stuck in the bushes along the canal. A part of the balloon was touching the flowing water in the canal which had led the balloon to shake a little. Unbeknown to the spectators, this made for an anxious watch,” Dankaur SHO Anil Kumar Pandey told PTI. He said a major reason behind the anxiety among people was the unusual shape of the balloon. “It was shaped like the Iron Man (fictional superhero character) given its colour and design. This was an unusual sight so some people even thought it was an alien, or something like that, and were apprehensive,” Pandey said. The official said the balloon was fished out around noon and apparently it came down because it was losing its gas. There was nothing harmful in the object but it was yet to be ascertained who floated it in the air, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/anxiety-grips-public-as-iron-man-shaped-balloon-spotted-in-sky-in-up-903443.html

17-10-2020||Opinion||Will the Covid-19 pandemic socially stunt my kid?||Sometime in July, we met up at a local playground with friends whose children are the same age as our 7- and 4-year-olds. Everyone was masked, and it was basically the first time we had socialized with people we weren’t related to since March. For the first 20 minutes of the play date, the children completely ignored each other. They’d make brief eye contact and then go careening off to different parts of the park. As I watched the children appear to flee from social connection, I broke into a light sweat: Had they forgotten how to relate to other kids while under quarantine? When we asked New York Times readers for their most pressing concerns, some version of the above was the most frequently asked question: How will masks, social distancing and lack of interaction with other children affect their kid’s social and emotional development? For example, reader Ariel Wittenberg, mom to a 7-month-old in Arlington, Virginia, wrote, “The thing that keeps me up at night is what it means that my daughter essentially has no idea other babies exist. Is she going to have problems socializing in the future?” The short answer is: The majority of neurotypical kids will be able to socialize just fine, even if we’re still wearing masks in a year. A lot of socialization happens implicitly through interactions with caregivers, said Erika Hernandez a postdoctoral scholar of social development at Penn State. Just having conversations with your kids, asking them about their feelings and setting boundaries (no, you can’t hit Dad) gets you most of the way to the socialization they need. And even if there are some social setbacks in the next year or two, Hernandez said, “development is a lifelong process. There’s not a skill or domain in which children can’t get better or work at.” It’s also worth noting that there’s a “huge cultural variability” in what’s considered “normal” socializing for children, said Lisa A. Serbin, a professor of psychology at Concordia University in Montreal. “There are many cultures where small children rarely see anyone but their cousins and siblings, who they know very well. They turn out just fine once they get to school. They have social skills,” said Serbin. With the caveat that this particular pandemic is unique, and we won’t definitively know how it affects anyone of any age for years to come, I asked four experts in child psychology and social development for their thoughts about the minimum level of interaction kids need, organized by age range. Ages 0-2: “If you have a baby during this pandemic, you’re good for 18 to 24 months,” as long as you have at least one knowledgeable and attentive adult on hand, said Sally Beville Hunter, a clinical assistant professor of child and family studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. That’s because infants are mostly playing by themselves with toys, or having face-to-face interactions with adults, and they only have a limited emotional repertoire that Hunter called the Inside Out feelings — after the Pixar movie that depicts joy, fear, anger, disgust and sadness inside a child’s head. They don’t care about other children’s emotions. “Children who are that age can’t meet each other’s social needs. They only can tell people when they need something,” Hunter said. Before 18 months, children haven’t started the developmental task psychologists call “theory of mind,” which is the understanding that other people have thoughts different from their own thoughts. Enjoy your tiny narcissists! Ages 2-5: What children are getting from socializing with other kids in the preschool years is moral reasoning, said Hunter. “They need to learn what is fair and what is right, and they learn that from being with other children,” she said. They can learn that from siblings; if your kid is an only child, though, it’s tougher for them to learn that from parents. That’s because adults tend to allow their children to choose the games they play, whereas when kids are interacting with peers, they will learn that they don’t always get their way. That doesn’t mean your child is doomed if they’re not going to a school or day care right now. “If it’s safe to do so, getting outside and meeting up for a peer group interaction, even just a little bit every week” should be enough, said David J. Bridgett, a professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University. Bridgett also encouraged parents to find their “inner child” and “do make-believe and pretend-play” with their preschoolers. Pretend-play helps children learn about creativity and problem-solving, he said. Elementary school: “I’m not worried about them at all,” said Hunter. While the very youngest elementary students may need the same support preschoolers do, by the time children are 7 or 8, they’re finding ways to get their social needs met, whether that’s through virtual interactions (FaceTiming while playing Roblox, anyone?), or riding bikes together around the neighbourhood. My kids have taken to playing hide-and-seek in our building’s courtyard with other children from the surrounding apartments. A note on masks: I asked every expert I spoke to whether they were worried that being around masked children and adults would make reading social cues more difficult for this generation of children. No one was concerned about it, and in fact, both Hernandez and Bridgett thought children may develop other skills more as a result of mask wearing — they may become better verbal communicators and learn to look people in the eyes more as they’re speaking. When to worry: Everyone — kids included — has ups and downs during the pandemic. “What you’re looking for is a pattern of downs,” said Hunter. If it’s lasting for a week, and it’s because of distress from our new versions of school, she said she’d suggest a mental-health day off for the child, which she probably would not have recommended pre-Covid. But if your child’s grades are suffering, and their being upset is lasting weeks or months, it’s time to talk to your pediatrician. By the way, about 15 minutes into that first play date in July, the kids stopped ignoring each other and started chasing each other on their scooters. Turns out they just needed a little while to warm up and leave their worries at the chain-link fence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/will-the-covid-19-pandemic-socially-stunt-my-kid-903145.html
17-10-2020||Opinion||Losing out on the right to privacy in the public domain in the name of surveillance||Earlier this year, Hyderabad found itself ranked among the top 20 cities in the world with the most intense surveillance in public spaces. Hyderabad police installed three lakh surveillance cameras, an average of 30 for every 1000 citizens, in the last six years. Now the state has decided to upgrade their number to a million (10 lakh). Also, new apartments are not being sanctioned unless they install surveillance cameras. All these measures have serious consequences to the right to privacy in public places.           Surveillance cameras, when they were first introduced, were intended to monitor real-time vehicular traffic. After their integration into the control and command centre through the internet, these public eyes were supposed to help in solving criminal cases and monitor religious processions.  Hyderabad recorded 17.8 per cent fewer crimes in five years and this is credited to the installation of CCTVs. However, evidence is necessary to validate these claims. While the offences such as public cheating, chain snatching and murders have reduced in number, crimes against women and rapes have increased substantially in 2019. National crime data shows a similar mixed trend in crimes in Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai though no comparable surveillance mechanism exists. Even in Britain, where these measures originated first (unsurprisingly, London too is in the top 20 cities list) no correlation between crime patterns and proliferation of cameras exists. Yet their explosion goes on unchecked.     Impact of technology-led surveillance Surveillance cameras began as a temporary security measure in Olympics cities and later became permanent. Digital technology has revolutionised their capabilities and created new means of coordinating surveillance. It has simplified the processing and storing of images and enabled their wide sharing. Machines can read and morph these images easily. Therefore, describing these devices as CCTVs today is misleading – they are neither ‘closed circuit’ nor are they ‘televisions’  The cameras and the images they capture may be innocuous in their individual contexts but when they coalesce with other measures of data-mining and image alteration, they are much more potent than in their original conception.  As their deployment multiplies in malls, apartments, offices and streets, the purposes they are used for also increases. Though the rationale of preventing ‘street crime’ and ‘safe shopping’ linger to legitimise their use, the cameras have emerged as an important means of gathering and processing the data for both governments and markets.   Anxieties with an increasing crime have been used to legitimise these technologies. While well-publicized violent incidents in Britain served as ‘trigger events’ to introduce them, the media here justifies their existence even when they help to capture petty thieves. Concerns about ‘missing children’ are often invoked to install more cameras, but there is no adequate evidence to show they help in finding them. The public psyche is fed with the isolated success stories of capturing an offender. Studies elsewhere show that the police systematically use their clout with the government to push for the use of these surveillance measures.  What about consent? The signage about the existence of surveillance cameras are supposed to be a means of obtaining citizens’ consent for their use. On the grounds of privacy and legality, one has to ask a number of questions. For instance, can citizens trust these devices with their privacy? Does this signage inform them of their purpose, data storage and third-party access to footage? Are citizens sure that governments are not using techniques for private and political purposes?  There is a mistaken notion that there is no right to privacy in the public domain. The  right to privacy includes the right to autonomy and anonymity. This is what constitutes privacy in public life. The camera makes the privacy in public places insecure. This constitutes illegal search of a person without informing them. This important right is rendered non-existent by these open place devices.     When the police circulate the footage of surveillance cameras through the mass media, it facilitates many to watch the selected few. But we hardly differentiate between these two modes. This also calls into question the ethics of mass media drawing its content selectively from surveillance cameras. On the grounds of privacy, the citizens of Canada have resisted these measures and rejected the standard rationale of fighting crime as baseless. China has been using these devices to monitor and suppress political dissent among Uyghur Muslims and Tibetans. Turkey installed them in advance to record political demonstrations by the Kurds. In Hyderabad, police now record political demonstrations openly. Surveillance is no longer sneaky now but Orwellian.  Scholars across the world feel that these devices are emerging as the latest, dominant means of social ordering in globalised economies. Perhaps we are witnessing the unfolding of a complex techno-political process in the proliferation of surveillance devices.  (Dr Murali Karnam, teaches at the NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.

17-10-2020||Opinion||Maybe Apple isn’t as green as it claims||By Adam Minter Upgrading to an iPhone 12? Apple Inc. is happy to take your old phone off your hands. “If it’s in good shape, we’ll help it go to a new owner,” the company promises on the website promoting its trade-in program. “If not, we’ll send it to our recycling partner, so we can save more precious materials and take less from the earth.” For years, Apple has used such rhetoric to convince consumers that it’s a greener and more sustainable company than its competitors. Increasingly, it’s fair to ask how sincere it is. Earlier this year, Apple filed a lawsuit against GEEP Canada, a recycler it had hired to destroy and recycle old devices. Rather than do the contracted job, Apple says, GEEP employees determined that many of these devices were still perfectly usable, and diverted at least 100,000 for resale. After an investigation, Apple found that many of the lost phones were being used in China — presumably still in “good shape.”  Apple’s anger at GEEP is certainly understandable if those charges are true. But consumers who entrusted Apple to manage their used goods in an environmentally friendly way could be forgiven for holding their own grudge. When the details of the case recently came to light, plenty of people in the tech world objected. In this case and others, it’s clear that Apple has repeatedly failed to live up to its own lofty promises on managing old devices. In doing so, it’s diverted consumers from seeking out more sustainable and lucrative outlets for their unwanted gadgets, and undermined its case for being a good environmental steward. Making a new smartphone isn’t always a pretty process. According to Apple, 79% of the carbon emissions associated with the total lifespan of an iPhone 11 are emitted during the production phase. To its credit, Apple has tried to mitigate these harms. Among other things, it now uses recycled tin and rare-earth elements, which is a big improvement over using virgin materials. And the company’s trade-in program provides a steady stream of used phones that can be refurbished and resold. In its most recent environmental report, Apple says that it refurbished 11.1 million devices for new users in 2019, and notes that each one “represents a smarter and more environmentally efficient use of the resources and materials we rely on to build our products.” Yet that laudable commitment has long been in tension with the company’s drive to sell new devices. Sometimes Apple is upfront about this. In 2019, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook blamed weaker-than-expected new iPhone sales on discounted battery replacements. But more often, the company quietly takes actions that limit the number of old devices that can compete with new models. It refuses to provide even basic repair documentation to users, for instance, or to sell replacement parts to customers and unlicensed repair shops. It has also lobbied aggressively against laws that might require such concessions. I’ve covered the recycling industry for more than a decade, and in that time I’ve encountered numerous executives who’ve expressed dismay at Apple’s requirement that at least some perfectly reusable devices be recycled. None of them advocated breaking contracts and diverting those devices to secondhand markets. But I’m not surprised that employees at GEEP would think to do so. Seeing treasure where others see junk is a well-worn path to recycling profits. So how does Apple decide which devices should be reused and which recycled? When I asked, a company spokesperson would only say that it subjects them to “rigorous testing.” She also warned that devices that are refurbished with non-Apple parts represent a safety concern. But there’s little public evidence to support that claim. In 2018, 176 million used smartphones were shipped globally, yet malfunctioning parts simply don’t factor into the leading causes of smartphone-related injuries. The good news for iPhone 12 upgraders is that they don’t have to rely on Apple to ensure that their devices have long afterlives. In the U.S., hundreds of businesses will buy old iPhones for refurbishment and resale, and they often pay handsomely. Few of these companies make the kinds of sweeping sustainability claims that Apple does. But, unlike Apple, they don’t have to worry that their used products are competing against their new ones.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/maybe-apple-isn-t-as-green-as-it-claims-903413.html
17-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Cauvery, coffee and curiosity||We ran out of our commercially made coffee powder recently and since I was just back from Coorg with a truckload of pure coffee, I decided to open one of the packets. As I undid the sticky tape of the coffee, a whiff took me back to the time when I was a kid, growing up in the then almost new Indiranagar in Bengaluru.  Just after the double road, on the way to Ulsoor, on the right was housed Cauvery Coffee Works. Run by two sisters, it was a store operating out of a garage. The store faced what is today a huge commercial complex that houses Krishna Sweets among many other stores. Like most homes in Bengaluru, their home too had a lot of trees and plants. The garage was connected to the house through a batwing door, and they would appear mysteriously through this portal when customers would arrive. Clad in the typical Coorg saree, with full-sleeved blouses, or a fitted cardigan in winter, the two sisters were elegant and stylish with their bobbed hair, large bindis and jewellery!  My grandma would always send us to Cauvery Coffee Works, with strict instructions that the coffee powder must be freshly ground and to not buy the already powdered product. This was an errand I loved to run as I was fascinated by the sisters, their bat-wing door, the coffee roaster, grinder and the invigorating smell of the coffee! As a curious kid, I had the special privilege to duck under the counter, enter the store, flap the bat-wing door and call out to the sisters, “Akka, I want coffee.” They would smile and ask how granny was doing and automatically start the process to powder the coffee for packing – they knew my grandma well. It took a long time for me to get my hands on my 200 gm purchase, the green coffee would be running on the roaster like a large Russian Roulette with a million chips on it. I would watch fascinated as it slowly turned dark brown and as the smell grew stronger. I would help them store the roasted beans in large containers and watch every move with a keenness that was rooted in curiosity. Once roasted, the powder would be weighed in a butter paper or brown paper packet bearing the logo and the store name, taped with brown tape ready to be taken away. From the coffee grounds to the packing, everything was bio-degradable! A guilt-free way to get-up, get out and smell the coffee!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/cauvery-coffee-and-curiosity-903019.html
17-10-2020||Second Edit||Nobel Peace Prize: Food for thought||This year’s Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP). The UN agency has done impressive work in addressing global hunger and improving food security. In 2019 alone, it provided food assistance to some 97 million people in 88 countries who were in the grip of acute hunger. It has reached out to a far larger number during the Covid-19 pandemic. On the face of it, the WFP’s work does not fall under conventional ideas of peace. It is not engaged in demining conflict zones, for instance, nor has it helped negotiate a peace agreement. However, much of the WFP’s work has been in conflict zones. Its work has helped us understand how conflict is an important driver of food insecurity. Armed conflict results in death but also in destruction of food and irrigation systems. It devastates the environment and agriculture and results in famine and food shortages. Not only has it reduced global hunger but also, it has weakened attempts by conflict actors to use food as a weapon of war. By awarding this year’s Peace Prize to the WFP, the Nobel Committee has underscored the need to understand peace not just as an absence of fighting but in more comprehensive terms to include wellbeing and food security. The Nobel Peace Prize has often stirred controversy. Several of its choices in the past have been deeply flawed; public opinion has held many recipients undeserving. In deciding to honour the WFP, the Nobel Committee seems to have made a ‘safe’ choice. At a time of grave polarisation on a range of issues, it has backed an organisation whose objective of addressing hunger is hard to oppose. While the WFP’s work is impressive, awarding it the Nobel Peace Prize raises some questions. It was set up to tackle hunger and it has been doing its job admirably, albeit with mixed success. By awarding it the Nobel Prize, the committee may be deemed to have rewarded it merely for doing its job. There are countless individuals and organisations who are putting their lives on the line to make the world a safer place. Surely, they deserve the honour more than a well-known, well-funded UN agency. Global recognition to such individuals and organisations could make a huge difference. It would provide them with a morale boost and also throw the global spotlight on issues they are grappling with, which often receive little attention. By choosing the WFP, the Nobel Committee seems to have lost an opportunity to highlight little known but significant initiatives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/nobel-peace-prize-food-for-thought-903013.html

Rajikumar M N, also known as Janardhanan Namboothiri, of Ernakulam district, was selected as head priest of Malikapuram Devi temple at Sabarimala. Meanwhile, pilgrims were allowed to the temple with restrictions from Saturday morning after a gap of around six months. The new priests were selected through a draw of lots from shortlisted applicants at the temple premises on Saturday morning. While Jayaraj Potty is a member of Varikattu Mutt at Kodungaloor in Thrissur, Rajikumar is from Mailakodathu Mana in Angamali. Jayaraj had earlier served at Malikapuram temple. This year the number of applicants for the Sabarimala priests post were comparatively low. It might be due to uncertainties owing to Covid-19. Pilgrims are being allowed to the temple only after conducting Covid-19 test at Pumba base camp. Only 250 pilgrims are allowed daily through the online queue and all tokens for the five days for which the temple would remain open for monthly pooja have been already booked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/new-head-priests-selected-for-temples-at-sabarimala-903168.html

I will prove that government school students are second to none.” These were the words of Jeevith Kumar, son of a cowherd and a MGNREGA worker, when asked whether he was interested in making a second attempt to clear the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) after he scored just 193 last year. And on Friday, when NEET results for 2020 were declared, the 18-year-old made not just his parents and others helped him to achieve the feat feel proud, but also government school students across the country. He topped the NEET exam in the government school category and is hoping to join the prestigious Madras Medical College (MMC). “I scored 664 marks out of 720 in NEET. I spent a full year at a coaching centre in Namakkal studying for 16 hours a day. My success, I am sure, will serve as an inspiration for all government school students that they can also succeed in life despite less infrastructure facilities,” he told DH. While Jeevith Kumar’s father is a cowherd, his mother works as a MGNREGA worker. The couple has a daughter and another son. “What we need is a push for us to achieve. I got the push but there are hundreds of deserving students who need that push. The NCERT syllabus should be translated in Tamil so that government school students can prepare better,” he said. Behind Jeevith Kumar’s success also lies the struggles of R Sabarimala, a government school teacher who quit her service after a 17-year-old medical aspirant died by suicide after failing in NEET, and his teachers. Jeevith Kumar got every help he needed – Sabarimala crowdsourced funds, and a school teacher provided him accommodation to prepare for exams during Covid-19 lockdown, to cite a few. The former government school teacher was instrumental in getting Jeevith Kumar enrolled in a coaching centre to “send a message” that government school students are “second to none” if they get proper guidance. While the teacher mobilised maximum funds through her contacts, the family and the school pitched in to ensure Jeevith Kumar succeeded. “All that Jeevith Kumar asked me was syllabus. 'Give me what I need, and I will give what you need'. These were his words. And he delivered true to the promise he made,” Sabarimala told DH. Jeevith Kumar’s success is dedicated to Anitha, the girl who could have donned the white coat if there was no NEET, the teacher said, adding that it was the teenager who forced her to come out of her comforts and fight for students. “Anitha inspired me to fight for students and today we have achieved our goal. Suicide is not a solution. Jeevith Kumar is a standing example that determination and grit wins,” Sabarimala said. “But one should remember that a student needs so much help to clear NEET. And we believe NEET is discriminatory,” she added. The former school teacher has travelled across the state asking government school students “not to lose hope” and “defeat the nefarious NEET” by clearing it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hard-work-parents-school-and-good-samaritans-how-a-cowherds-son-defied-odds-to-top-neet-in-government-school-category-903283.html

According to a top Metro Rail official, the lady reached the Victoria Memorial station on October 14 night and told the metro rail personnel that she had to get to Miyapur and that there was no other transport available. Moved by the plight of the woman, the officials decided to operate an exclusive service. "We were shutting down services by 9 PM as per rules.. the woman entered the station at around 10 PM and requested us to take her to Miyapur as she had no other option. .. so our people arranged a special train and transported her safely to her destination," NVS Reddy, Managing Director of HMRL told PTI. Torrential rains battered the city and neighbouring parts on October 13 and 14 disrupting normal life including public transportation. The official noted that the train has the capacity to ferry 1,000 people. However, due to Covid-19 protocols, the coaches were running with only 60 per cent capacity. Reddy said as of now the total network of metro rail, which resumed operations on September 7 after remaining suspended for over four months as part of nationwide lockdown, is presently carrying one lakh passengers per day in the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-metro-rail-runs-special-train-to-ferry-pregnant-lady-903298.html

Sources said that Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar was likely to be in the dock in the case as the Customs strongly suspected his involvement in the dollar transaction. Sivasankar is facing probe for his nexus with the gold smuggling accused, especially the UAE consulate's former employee Swapna Suresh, as well as the alleged irregularities in importing around 17,000 kilogram of dates by the UAE consulate for the stated purpose of distribution among children's institutions in Kerala.  Meanwhile, Sivasankar, who was admitted to a private hospital on Friday as he complained of discomfort after Customs summoned him for quizzing, was on Saturday shifted to a government medical college hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. A medical bulletin from the private hospital said that he did not have any serious coronary ailments but was found to have disc ailments. Tension prevailed at the private hospital premises after a person, said to be an employee at the hospital, manhandled some journalists while Sivsankar was being shifted from the hospital. Incidentally, Sivsankar's wife, who is a doctor, used to work at the same hospital. Even as Customs sources said that a fresh case for dollar smuggling was initiated, it was not yet known whether Sivasankar was arraigned in the case. A bank official said to the Customs that he was compelled by Sivasankar to convert a big amount of Indian rupees to US dollars. This amount, 1.9 lakh US dollars, was suspected to be handed over to an official of UAE consulate in Kerala from where it was smuggled it to the UAE. It was also being probed if Swapna smuggled US dollars to the UAE while travelling with Sivasankar. Sources close to Sivasankar said that the present moves of Customs against Sivasankar could be also due to political pressure as Sivasankar's arrest would cause further embarrassment to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as Sivasankar has been his close confidant over the last four years. Sivasankar had already moved the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail in connection with Enforcement Directorate's probe against him and the court restrained the ED from arresting him till October 23. Sivasankar is likely to file for an anticipatory bail plea in connection with the Customs cases as well.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dollar-smuggling-customs-department-to-probe-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayans-former-secretary-m-sivasankar-903324.html
17-10-2020||South||Hyderabad floods: Police win hearts with selfless service||When city police constable Veerender braved all odds to rescue 25 people caught in a deluge of unseen proportions, he symbolised the humane face of a perceived tough police force which went beyond its call of duty to reach out to stranded citizens. When the city was caught in the deluge, the first to respond to the crisis were the policemen who performed a myriad of tasks -- from clearing traffic on inundated roads to rescuing people in distress and providing food to the needy. More than 50 people were killed in Telangana, including over 11 here, in torrential downpour that lashed the state over the past few days, resulting in flooding and inundation that threw life out of gear for the common people, especially in and around the city. The quick response of the policemen from the three police commissionerates here Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda -- in extending a helping hand when it was needed the most, has won praise from the citizens. One among them was Constable Veerender of Chikkadpally police station. He almost single-handedly rescued 25 people, who were stranded at homes following the inundation of the locality, using a boat, an officer of the police station told PTI. The policeman's act earned the praise of Hyderabad Commissioner Anjani Kumar, who described him as his "hero" and "true stars" of the team. "Constable officer Veerender of Chikadpally PS is my hero. He rescued 25 stranded people while himself remaining in deep water. This was at Aravind Nagar Domalguda." "Such officers are the true stars of our team. I salute them and thank the community for encouraging the Hyd police," Kumar said in a tweet. Many Twitter users appreciated Veerenders brave act and the services rendered by the police during the heavy rains this week and during the Covid-19-induced lockdown earlier. Similarly, while the scary visuals of a man being washed away in swirling waters in the old city went viral, prompting prayers for his safe rescue, little did many know that he was pulled out to safety by alert policemen. The man was miraculously saved by alert police personnel on duty with the help of some local residents at Falaknuma in the old city, a police official told PTI. Further, "Saidabad PS officers won the hearts of many by conducting rescue operations at late night. This is just one example of the many such rescue and relief operations conducted by Hyd city police..." Kumar tweeted. "Community is our strength and we are dedicated for them completely," he added. The Rachakonda Police organised distribution of food and water to the needy, even as they attended to various tasks following the heavy rains. Following an appeal by Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat to extend a helping hand to the needy during the crisis, the volunteers and members of the Rachakonda Security Council supplied food, biscuit packets and water bottles, among others. In addition to supplying food items to the needy residents, biscuit packets were distributed to those stranded on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada highway following traffic disruption on the road due to the heavy rains. Further, a constable of Abdullapurmet police station, Surender, bravely took out a body from running water, sitting in the front portion of an excavator, Rachakonda police said. Cyberabad Police was also involved in helping people, with Commissioner V C Sajjanar, actively engaged in rescue and relief activities during the heavy rains and flooding, himself helping in carrying an old woman in a chair in an inundated locality. In many areas, traffic police attended to exigencies like removing fallen tree branches, filling potholes on roads with gravel and pumping out water from water-logged roads.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-floods-police-win-hearts-with-selfless-service-903331.html

Jayakumar alleged that Muralitharan had been a "voice" of former Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the cricketer supported the leader, who was "responsible" for the killings of the Tamil people during the 2009 civil war. "Muralitharan had been the voice of his master (Mahinda) Rajapaksa. How will the Tamil people accept him?" he asked. "It will be a good thing for Vijay Sethupathi to reconsider his decision to play the lead role in the movie," he said adding if he reversed his decision to act in the film, it would earn him respect. The actor's fans themselves have not accepted his move to recreate the career of the cricketer on screen, the Minister claimed. Muralitharan had on Friday said the proposed biopic '800' on him was only about his sports accomplishments despite the challenge of decades long conflict in his country and his humble beginnings. He expressed anguish over him being accused as against the Tamils and asserted that it was for "political reasons" and out of "ignorance." "I know the pain of war and the loss it causes. I have never supported the killings of innocent people and will never support that," he said. MDMK, PMK and Naam Tamizhar Katchi and veteran Tamil filmmaker Bharathirajaa were among those who have opposed Sethupathi being a part of the movie. They had alleged that the cricketer was a "betrayer" of the Tamils.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-joins-chorus-against-vijay-sethupathi-in-muttiah-muralitharan-biopic-903355.html

Zilla Janapada Parishat president B G Anantashayana said that the folklore was close to nature. Folklore is a form of knowledge. But, the modernity has been taking us away from this knowledge, he added. Taluk Janapada Parishat president Anil H T said that Ponnacchana Madhu, the exhibitor, had collected rare items in the last three years. These items will be on display till October 26. The work by Madhu and Preethu couple is laudable, he added. Collector and Exhibitor Ponnacchana Madhu said that he purchased old items in the households, after convincing the elders in the houses. Many tourists have been willing to purchase them from me. However, they are not for sale.

The ministers in charge of the districts should have stayed there to guide the DCs and officials. The revenue minister’s visit was for namesake, whereas the CM didn’t go at all,” Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah told reporters.  On compensation, Siddaramaiah said victims of the floods in August were yet to receive any benefit. “Now, the government says Rs 85 crore was given, but it hasn’t reached people. Homes, crops, roads and electricity are gone. People have become houseless. This government isn’t doing anything and even the Centre isn’t helping,” he said, asking the Centre to declare the flood situation as a ‘national calamity’. “But this government lacks the guts or courage to face the Centre.”  Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D K Shivakumar said all his party’s leaders were instructed to locally help people. “But, it’s the government’s duty to help people. PM Modi says he’ll help, but he hasn’t come here a single day,” Shivakumar said.  In a statement, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol lamented that he was advised against travelling. “I’m in touch with the deputy commissioners of Kalaburagi and Bagalkot,” he said.  Shivakumar, without naming Karjol, said ministers who cannot perform should resign and go home.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/north-karnataka-floods-siddaramaiah-d-k-shivakumar-hit-out-at-bjp-govt-903433.html

The notification of the reconstitution that came in the evening on Friday shocked many activists who expressed concern over its advisory capacity when its membership is based more on political affinity and recommendation. The government has appointed Alok Vishwanath, son of Yelahanka MLA S R Vishwanath, as an expert member of the Board. The action comes nearly six years after the BJP opposed the appointment of Rana George, son of then home minister K J George, as member of the board.Dinesh Singhvi, the CEO and managing director of Bharat Mines, has been retained as another expert member while activists like Sanjay Gubbi and Ajai Desai have been dropped from the board. The Board, chaired by none other than the chief minister and having the forest minister as deputy chairman, has come under criticism over its decisions. In March, within two weeks after rejecting the proposal to build a railway line from Hubballi to Ankola, the Board was reconvened and the project cleared. The High Court of Karnataka stayed the clearance for the project recently after activists questioned the U-turn. An activist said that almost all the expert members were appointed based on political recommendations or influence. “Rest assured, the Board would not be able to put an effective check considering most of the members are political appointees,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-state-wildlife-board-loses-its-green-gets-political-appointees-903038.html

Owing to Covid-19 situation, the district administration has allowed a limited number of people to be physically present during the event. The live telecast of the Theerthodbhava will be streamed on social and electronic media for a larger number of people to witness the event. Taking a dip in the Theertha pond is prohibited. The holy water emerging out of the Theertha Kundike, will be sprinkled on the people present at the venue. Entry will be given to only those who carry Covid-19 negative certificate. Entry of vehicles from Bhagamandala to Talacauvery will be allowed only after 6 am. Inauguration District In-charge Minister V Somanna inaugurated a new building meant for ‘Mudi’ offering, ‘Pinda Pradana’ and for performing other rituals near Triveni Sangama in Bhagamandala. Virajpet MLA K G Bopaiah, ZP social justice standing committee president Kavita Prabhakar, Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy, SP Kshama Mishra and others were present. The minister later offered special prayers at Talacauvery. ‘District admin’s move not right’ MLC Veena Achaiah objected to the move of the district administration to impose ban on the entry of devotees into Talacauvery on the occasion of Theerthodbhava. “This is a sensitive issue. Devotees wait for Theerthodbhava with which they have emotional attachment. It is not right on the part of the district administration to hurt the feelings of people, under the pretext of Covid-19.” The MLC said that the district adminstration should have prevented the entry of tourists into the district, 15 days ago, if it wanted to reduce the crowd. “The opinion of the local elected representatives was also not elicited by the DC before issuing the order. It is not appropriate to pass the order in the last minute,” she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/here-comes-mother-cauvery-903063.html

"Several districts of north Karnataka have been affected by floods and I assure the people there that the government is with them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to me last night and took stock of the situation. He has assured all necessary assistance from the centre," the Chief Minister said. Speaking at the inaugural of the 10-day-long Dasara festivities in the palace city of Mysuru, Yediyurappa said he has reviewed the situation with Deputy Commissioners of flood-hit districts and Revenue Minister R Ashoka was personally touring the regions. Orders have been issued to provide compensation within a week to the next of kin of those killed and to those who had lost livestock and property, he said. Officials have been directed to ensure that there are no complaints over compensation,he said,adding that input subsidy of Rs 36.57 crore has been directly deposited to the bank accounts of 51,810 farmers, whose crops have been damaged. In the wake of the flood situation emerging for the third time within a span of three months, the government on Friday said it has released Rs 85.5 crore for immediate relief and rescue equipment has been supplied to the affected districts. Yediyurappa cited a government report which said Kalaburagi, Bidar, Yadgir, Ballari, Raichur, Bagalkote, Davangere, Koppal, Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga, Udupi, Vijayapura and Belgaum districts are the worst hit due to rains between October 10-15, caused by the upper air depression over the Bay of Bengal.

With the Covid-19 pandemic casting a shadow, the government had decided to organise the 410th Dasara festivities in a "simple" way, by and large restricting it to keep up with the traditions. Noting that the state was observing Dasara or Navaratri festivities amid Covid and the people are in distress, the Chief Minister said he would pray to goddess Chamundeshwari to rescue humanity and the state from this pandemic. He urged the people to celebrate Dasara with all precautions and follow the SOPs issued by the government. Remembering the service of all front line Covid warriors with gratitude, Yediyurappa also prayed for their well being.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-effectively-responding-to-flood-situation-confident-of-revival-of-states-economy-says-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-903266.html

Speaking to mediapersons here, Horatti said classes must be conducted batch-wise for students from Class 8th to 10. Besides, students of pre-university and first-grade colleges are not kids and their immunity power would be high. So, colleges could be opened, he suggested. More than 250 teachers have tested positive for Covid-19 and around 70 teachers have died.  "Is there a government in the state?" he questioned. Referring to the Vidyagama scheme, he said the government is of the view that around 47 lakh students have benefitted from it. But in reality, not even 5% of students attended classes. Horatti said that food items that should have been distributed to students were rotting in godowns and the government's apathy was responsible for this. He urged the government to initiate action against the officials concerned. On the New Education Policy, he said the Centre must collect opinions from the states before implementing it. Except for the point that education must be given in mother tongue, the remaining factors are in favour of the BJP and not the education sector, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-declare-2020-21-zero-academic-year-for-students-up-to-class-7-mlc-basavaraj-horatti-tells-karnataka-govt-903279.html

17-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19: Doctors face burnout, some opt to go on vacation||Overcome by fatigue and a sense of burnout, healthcare professionals, on the frontline fighting Covid-19 for over six months, are trying to regain their peace of mind by taking a break. They are into a wide range of activities from trekking to meditation to long rides.  Doctors, who spoke to DH, said many members of their fraternity are tired of handling Covid-19 cases. Many feel that a two-day break is essential, they said.  Dr Jagadish Hiremath, CEO of Ace Suhas Hospital, said, “We haven't had time for ourselves and the family. We have observed severe stress and anxiety among doctors who were on Covid-19 duty as they have to spend considerable time in PPE kits and stay away from their family." "To deal with this and to stop attrition, we have started the roster recuperation break wherein doctors on Covid duty can take a break for a day or two. They have to take Covid-19 test before they go for the de-stress break,” he added. Dr Suri Raju V, managing director and chief urologist, Regal Hospital, told DH, “Since pandemic set in, healthcare workers have been at the helm. For the last eight months, we have been working without a break for extended hours. When there is a rush of patients, we have worked for 18-20 hours and spending an eight-hour shift in PPE is in itself a humongous task.” “We deal with dehydration and weakness, we have to deal with the fury of the patients' family and so on. The stress and anxiety have become an everyday feature. At the end of the day, we are also human who has a breaking point. Thus, we have taken an initiative to ensure that all the healthcare workers are in a sound state of mind to be able to deal with the situation,” he added. Dr Raju said he went to Skandagiri recently as a day trip to break the monotony of work and meditate in the midst of nature. He said, “I have also written a book called ‘Kidney Secrets Revealed’ during this period as during the Covid-19 period cases of dialysis increased and many patients started calling us for renal ailments.” At GVG Invivo Hospital, a one-day trip was arranged for staff to Talakadu in August. "After that, we never really got time to even think about it. While the nursing staff manage to get breaks in their work, doctors have not got time off yet. We are eagerly looking forward to seeing the decline in the cases so that our doctors too can take a break," said Dr Gunasekar Vuppalapati, CMD of GVG Invivo Hospital. Dr Vuppalapati said burnout comprises exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy, but one does not have to experience all three to suffer serious consequences.  Dr Jagadish noted that burnout will have deleterious effects that reverberate throughout the whole system in and out of the workplace. "Unfortunately, in contrast to the systemic medical responses that abate epidemics, organizations, like hospitals, burnout vectors often go unchecked.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-doctors-face-burnout-some-opt-to-go-on-vacation-903434.html

Casting director Sahil Ashrafali Sayyed had lodged the complaint in the court, seeking its direction for registration of an FIR under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity), 295A (malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings), 124A (sedition) against the actor and her sister, his lawyer Ravish Zamindar said. The complainant has alleged that the actor has been defaming Bollywood since the last two months by calling it a "hub of nepotism", "favouritism", etc, through her tweets and television interviews. In the complaint, he said that Ranaut has tweeted "very objectionable" comments, which has not only hurt his religious sentiments, but also the feelings of many artists. Sayyed alleged that Ranaut has been trying to divide the artists on the communal lines. "Her sister, too, has made objectionable comments on social media to spread communal tension between two religious groups," the complaint said. Upon perusal of the documents on record and the lawyer's submission, the court found that "cognisable offence" has been committed by the accused. It then directed the police station concerned to initiate necessary action and investigation against the actor and her sister under relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). "Total allegations are based upon the comments made on electronic media- Twitter and interviews- and a thorough investigation by an expert is necessary," the court said.

17-10-2020||West||Mumbai airport extends Covid-19 express test facility to departing passengers, visitors||The city airport on Saturday said it has extended the availability of its express Covid-19 infection test facility to departing passengers and non-passengers. The RT-PCR test facility is functional from Oct. 15, the airport said in a release. Initially launched for arriving international transit passengers in line with the Civil Aviation Ministry's directives, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has now further extended the availability of the test facility for passengers departing from the airport as well, the airport operator said in a release. The testing facility, located on the curbside of Level 4 at Terminal 2 for departing passengers, is also available for non-passengers visiting the airport to drop off or receive their loved ones, it added. The initiative addresses passenger concerns regarding the different Covid-19 regulations across domestic and international destinations, it said adding, departing passengers can undergo the test at CSMIA before travelling to their onward destination and produce their negative test report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination. The Mumbai airport had first launched the RT-PCR test facility last month for arriving international passengers transiting to a domestic destination from Mumbai as a measure to skip institutional quarantine upon arrival. This was later extended to all passengers arriving at the airport as directed by the MoCA. Since the commemoration of the test facility on September 6, the airport has witnessed a total of over 3,340 passengers opting for the test, with an average 100 test per day being conducted, said the release. Till date 38 passengers tested positive, of the total tests conducted at the airport facility so far and they were transferred by the state authorities to designated Covid-19 institutions, according to the airport operator. Departing passengers can make an online booking through the test feature available on the CSMI airport website or register themselves at the helpdesk set up at departures to enrol for the RT-PCR test before entering the terminal and have a digital copy mailed directly or collect the physical copy of the test report within eight hours, it stated. Passengers departing from the airport are encouraged to arrive at the terminal 8-12 hours before their scheduled departure, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-airport-extends-covid-19-express-test-facility-to-departing-passengers-visitors-903275.html

In a letter to the chief minister, Fadnavis said the average number of tests per day between October 1 and 15 was 75,296, down from 91,743 during the September 16 to 30 period and 84,675 in the September 1 to 15 period. He said the low number of tests in October might be behind the reduction in coronavirus numbers on a daily basis, which he claimed was "hiding reality". The leader of opposition in the state Assembly said Maharashtra's death per million figure was high and so was the case for Mumbai. The national death per million figure was 97.6 while it was as high as 333 in Maharashtra, the former CM claimed. "In Mumbai, the infection ratio in the first fortnight of September was 15.95 per cent which increased to 17.61 per cent in the second fortnight of September and remained 17.39 per cent in the first fortnight of October," Fadnavis said, wondering why test numbers were not being ramped up despite "high prevalence of infection". He said the rising infection numbers in the state meant all sectors of the economy cannot resume operations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/daily-maharashtra-covid-19-test-numbers-have-dipped-in-october-says-bjp-leader-devendra-fadnavis-903371.html

The suspects were known to the victims' family, he said. "Besides these three suspects, we are questioning a few more people," said the senior police officer who is part of the investigating team. Another official said the suspects were friends of the elder brother of the victim children, and before leaving for Madhya Pradesh with his parents, he had asked them to look after them. The horrific incident which took place at Borkheda Shivar village in Raver tehsil came to light on Friday morning. The children's parents, who worked on a farm, had gone to Madhya Pradesh with their elder son for 'dash-kriya' (tenth-day post-death ritual) for a dead relative. When the farm owner visited the house, he saw the four siblings, Sangita (13), Rahul (11), Anil (eight) and Nani (six), lying in a pool of blood. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who visited the family on Saturday, said the case would be tried in a fast track court. The killings were "a blot on humanity", he said. Renowned lawyer Ujjwal Nikam would be appointed as special prosecutor in the case, and state government will provide adequate financial assistance to the family, he said. Notably, senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse and Raver BJP MP Raksha Khadse were among those who accompanied the minister during the visit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/siblings-killing-case-three-suspects-detained-by-police-903380.html
