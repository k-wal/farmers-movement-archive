16-10-2020||First Edit||A sign of our hate-stricken times||The intolerant response to a Tanishq advertisement featuring an inter-faith marriage is a sign of our stricken times when all human interactions are measured in terms of separateness and exclusion rather than of amity and unity. The response was not just one of disapproval but was intimidatory and violent, as most responses of disagreement have been of late in the country. The advertisement featured an inter-faith event in a family setting and depicted a baby shower for a Hindu mother-to-be in the home of her Muslim husband. In normal and saner times, it would have been welcomed as a positive sign of our liberal society or, at the very least, simply ignored as an advertisement. But it has been dubbed as an instance of the dubious idea of ‘love jihad’, a manufactured threat, and troll armies have bombarded the company and those behind the ad with hate speech, abuses and threats of violence. The company has withdrawn the ad.  The Tata Group, which owns Tanishq, has been known as much for its ethical standards as for its professional norms and practices. It has promoted the best social values in its ads, campaigns and activities. It has run campaigns on the theme of communal and social harmony. It is no pushover and has the wherewithal to stand its ground in the face of pressure or coercion. That is why, the decision to withdraw the advertisement is again a sign of the times, and a pointer that defences against the rising tide of unreason and hatred are weakening. The company might have felt that lives and property would have been endangered, and more importantly, no protection would have come forth from the authorities and law enforcement forces. When businesses, individuals, organisations or other entities feel that they cannot live by and sustain the right values of life and follow the best ideals that they believe in, it is not just the rule of law but the bigger idea of life in a constitutional, democratic society that is in peril.  When an advertisement with a social message is opposed and forced out of public view, it is not just freedom of expression but that message itself that is under attack. It is the idea of Hindus and Muslims living together and establishing friendly relations at individual, family and social levels that is opposed and rejected by the attack on this advertisement. In ‘New India’, the relationship has to be one of exclusion and even hostility, and not of understanding and friendliness. Anything that depicts otherwise is unacceptable. The message is that no area of life, including the arts, family, society and politics, is exempt from this.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/a-sign-of-our-hate-stricken-times-902544.html

Ahead of the 2017 edition of the Indian Premier League, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) was looking desperately for a bowler to take the place of Mitchell Starc who had pulled out of the tournament. RCB bought the English seamer Tymal Mills for a whopping sum of Rs 12 crore in the auction. Mills played only five matches and picked up five wickets at an average of 8.57 runs per over. For Mills, this was the first and last season in IPL. Circa 2007. A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) took over ABN Amro in a fierce M&A battle with its rival Barclays Bank in October 2007, paying 49.2 billion sterling pounds, mostly in cash. The British government had to later bail out RBS as it had exhausted its reserves to fund the takeover. It was estimated that the winning bid was equal to the combined market value of Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Barclays then. These are instances of what economists call ‘winner’s curse’. RCB, just like RBS, was the winner of the bid but was “cursed” because the intrinsic value of the asset (read, Mills) bought was far less than its estimated value. Winner’s curse is a phenomenon that occurs in common value auctions, where bidders have no way of knowing the intrinsic value but bid based on their own assessment of that object. The winner is the bidder with the most optimistic estimation (evaluation) of the asset. However, the results of the auction show that the estimates of the product’s value of other bidders are usually much lower than that of the winner, giving him the impression that he bid too much. In fact, the theory of the winner’s curse, which reflects the quirks of auctions or the bidding process, does not conform to the hypothesis of market efficiency. If the markets were efficient, the actual price paid by the highest bidder for an asset should be equal to its intrinsic value. Richard Thaler, the 2017 Nobel Prize winner in Economics and the proponent of the Nudge Theory wrote in Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioural Economics, “When many bidders compete for the same object, the winner of the auction is often the bidder who most overvalues the object being sold. The phrase ‘winner’s curse’ was first put forward by three petroleum engineers of Atlantic Richfield, Capen, Clapp and Campbell, in their seminal work Competitive Bidding in High-Risk Situations and was published in the Journal of Petroleum Technology in 1971. They claimed that oil companies suffered low returns year after year in early Outer Continental Shelf oil lease auctions. In common value auctions, the value of the asset or item is essentially the same to all bidders, but the estimation of that value varies from one bidder to another. For example, it is difficult to estimate the potential value of an offshore oil field. So, if an oil field had an intrinsic value of $100 million, oil companies might guess its value to be anywhere between $50 million to $20 million. That said, winner's curse may not apply to winners in all auctions. Many products or services will have a private value and a common value. The paintings of Pablo Picasso or that of V S Gaitonde are bought for millions of dollars or rupees by collectors. The paintings will have a common value for all, but the private value may vary from one bidder to another -- information about which is not available to all bidders. Winner's curse may not arise in such cases. The Nobel Prize in Economics this year has been awarded jointly to Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson of Stanford University for, to quote the Nobel Prize committee, “improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats." Wilson developed the theory for auctions of products, which have a common value – a value that is uncertain before the auction but, in the end, is the same for everyone. Some of the examples of products or services which have a common value are the telecom spectrum auctions, i.e., the future value of radio frequencies, or of the amount of minerals or coal in a particular area. The uncertainty for the bidders is in estimating the value of the telecom market in a particular circle or the value of minerals or coal in the block they are bidding for. Wilson showed why rational bidders tend to place bids below their own best estimate of the common value, as they are worried about the winner’s curse – that is, about paying too much. Milgrom formulated a more general theory of auctions that not only have common values but also have private values that vary from one bidder to another. He analysed the bidding strategies in a number of well-known auction formats, demonstrating that a format will give the seller higher expected revenue when bidders learn more about each other’s estimated values during bidding. Milgrom and Wilson started out with fundamental theory and later used their results in practical applications, which have spread globally. Auction theory is indeed very useful as a branch of Economics and as Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Prize Committee said, “Their discoveries are of great benefit to society”.  (The writer is a CFA and a former banker and currently teaches at Manipal Academy of Banking, Bengaluru)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/winner-s-curse-and-the-theory-of-auctions-902545.html

As Padmakshi's health deteriorated on Thursday, the district administration in consultation with elected representatives toyed with the decision to airlift Padmakshi for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, which was available only in Bengaluru. Hours later, the teacher lost her battle to the coronavirus. Padmakshi, who taught at Jawahar Nehru School in Makki near Shirtady, first contracted the infection while conducting classes under Vidyagama. Her husband, Sashikant, who served as a headmaster in D J Higher Primary school in Moodbidri had also tested positive for Covid-19. While Sashikant recovered and was discharged from the hospital, Padmakshi's health continued to worsen. Padmakshi's deteriorating health and mounting hospital bills grabbed the attention of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and the district administration when her daughter, Aishwarya Jain, took to social media and sought help for her ailing mother. Both the Chief Minister and Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar along with district administration responded swiftly. Even as the district administration was discussing therapies to ensure the survival of teacher, Padmakshi passed away on succumbed to the fatal virus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/high-school-teacher-from-mangaluru-succumbs-to-covid-19-902689.html

Though the rain receded, flooding has left the villagers in tatters.  Thousands of agricultural fields were marooned in flood water. Due to unavailability of drinking water, residents of the village were seen lining up to collect water from water tanker.

16-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||‘We drank floodwaters for 2 days to quench our thirst’||Floodwaters have left residents of villages located on the banks of Bhima and Kagina rivers in tatters.  “Several residents spent two nights on the rooftop of their houses as the flood water suddenly marooned the village. We drank floodwater to quench thirst. Except four houses, all houses in the village were under water for two days,” said Nagamma Natikar Agadi, a resident of Metaga village in Shahabad taluk.   Narrating her ordeal during the floods in Kagina river, she said most of the villagers had taken shelter in the unaffected three-four houses in the village.  Bhimu Ravoor said there was no power in the village as the electric poles came crashing down during the floods. Crops on vast tracts of agriculture fields have damaged. “No officials visited the village since there is no road connectivity. The bridge leading to Metaga village was under water. The village was cut off from rest of the world for two days”, he said. Similar was the situation at Honagunta village where about 500 houses were flooded due to the furious Kagina and Bhima rivers. The villagers are still spending life without electricity after the deluge. The people lined up in front of a water tanker to collect drinking water. Some houses were damaged in the flash floods.  Ninganna Varavi Poojari, a resident of the village, said not a single official visited the village during the deluge. “No arrangements were made to provide food for the affected people”, he said.  Kallappa Pyati, a resident Firozabad in Kalaburagi taluk alleged that the officials had allotted new houses to such persons who will not be affected by floods.  “Though around 20 families of the village bear the brunt of the floods of Bhima river, they have not been allotted the houses,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/we-drank-floodwaters-for-2-days-to-quench-our-thirst-902964.html

16-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||Swollen Bhima unleashes misery in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura||Although rain intensity has come down in Kalyan Karnataka and the undivided Vijayapura and Belagavi districts, the flood situation remained grim in the region. The Bhima river, bolstered by heavy discharge of water from dams/barrages in its basin, is unleashing its destructive force in Kalaburagi district. Heavy discharge of water from Veer and Ujani dams in Maharashtra and Sonna barrage in Afzalpur has triggered flood threat in over 100 villages in Chittapur, Afzalpur, Jewargi and Shahabad taluks. An unprecedented 6.30 lakh cusecs of water was released into Bhima river from Sonna barrage. The swollen Bhima has damaged houses, road infrastructure and power lines in Kalaburagi, Vijayapura and Yadgir districts.  Most of the villages and towns, including the industrial town Wadi, have plunged into darkness for the past three days following the heavy showers which brought down power lines in the region. The Buddhist sites Sannati and Kanaganahalli, and Chandrala Parameshwari temple in Chittapur taluk have gone under Bhima waters. The road connectivity between Kalaburagi-Sedam, Chincholi-Bidar and Sedam-Chittapur has been cut off. The state government has dispatched two helicopters to manage the flood situation in Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir and Raichur districts. Meanwhile, Krishna river near Raichur is surging at a drastic pace following the heavy discharge of water from Narayanapur reservoir (1.79 lakh cusecs) and Sonna barrage (3.05 lakh cusecs). The swollen Krishna has submerged the island-villages in Lingasugur taluk. The residents of Gurjapur village have been evacuated to safety. Acres of ready-for-harvest paddy in Lingasugur and Raichur taluks have gone under water.  With Bhima river flowing above danger mark, the vehicular movement on the busy Vijayapura-Solapur national highway has been stopped. The firemen and local fishermen rescued a family of seven, including five children, from an island in Doni river near Talikoti. A woman and her son were rescued from the flooded Hale Hingani village on Bhima banks in Inditaluk. Muttur and Tubachi villages in Jamkhandi taluk have turned into islands following a discharge of 1.5 lakh cusecs from Hippargi reservoir.The low-lying bridges across Ghataprabha at Dhavaleshwar, Nandagaon and Mirji have gone under water. The situation is no different in Chikkodi and Nippani taluks of Belagavi district, where scores of villages on Krishna river banks are facing flood threat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/swollen-bhima-unleashes-misery-in-kalaburagi-vijayapura-903000.html
16-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Attracting votes from other parties just election time politics: D K Shivakumar||A day after JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy accused Congress of trying to lure party workers ahead of the November 3 bypolls, its Karnataka unit chief D K Shivakumar on Friday said inducting people from rival parties and attracting their votes was just "election time politics." Ruling out competition between him and Kumaraswamy for the Vokkaliga leadership, the dominant community to which both leaders belong to, he said he has never indulged in caste politics and for him Congress was his only caste. "...he (Kumaraswamy) has his party and we have ours. They (JDS) are doing their duty and we are doing ours," Shivakumar said in response to a question on the JD(S) leader's statement. Speaking to reporters here, he said it is common for a political party during election time to try and attract votes of rival parties. "JD(S) tries to attract votes of Congress and BJP and similarly we will try to attract votes of the two parties." Also if anyone from the other parties expresses willingness to join Congress, looking at their candidate, the party would take them in. "This is what is happening, it is nothing but election time politics," he added. Kumaraswamy on Thursday had alleged that Congress, which lacks a worker base in Rajarajeshwari Nagar assembly constituency, was trying to lure his party workers ahead of the bypolls. To a question about competition between them to gain leadership of a community, considering people joining Congress are Vokkaliga leaders from JD(S), Shivakumar said he has never indulged in caste politics and for him his caste is Congress. "Both my parents are Vokkaligas, so in my school application, it is mentioned that I'm a Vokkaliga. Also I'm an agriculturist by birth, which is the occupation of the community. But now I'm a Congress President and we have a caste -- which is Congress. Why should I speak about other castes? I don't like to speak about it," he said. Rajarajeshwari Nagar (R R Nagar), along with Sira assembly segment in Tumakuru, will go for the bypolls on November 3. With both seats having considerable presence of Vokkaliga community, winning them is crucial for both leaders to consolidate their position in the community. With the community seen as strong vote base of JD(S), Kumaraswamy is looking at keeping it intact, while Shivakumar, who is top leader in the Congress from the community, is looking at consolidating his position within the party by winning this bypolls. Winning R R Nagar is even more crucial for him as it comes under the Bangalore Rural Lok Sabha constituency, represented by his brother D K Suresh. In R R Nagar, Congress' Kusuma H is pitted against V Krishnamurthy of JD(S) and N Munirathna of the BJP. In Sira, Congress has fielded former Minister T B Jayachandra against JD(S)' Ammajamma, the wife of late party MLA Sathyanarayana and Dr Rajesh Gowda of BJP. The Sira by elections was necessitated following the death JD(S) legislator B Sathyanarayana in August, while the Rajarajeshwari Nagar (R R Nagar) seat fell vacant after the disqualification of Congress MLA N Munirathna under the anti defection law last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/attracting-votes-from-other-parties-just-election-time-politics-d-k-shivakumar-902721.html
16-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||People are tired of trusting Congress, BJP: JD(S) leader Krishnamurthy V||The JD(S) has picked a ‘loyal party worker’ Krishnamurthy V, 41, as its candidate for the November 3 Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll. He talks to Shruthi HM Sastry on his electoral debut and his optimism about winning. Excerpts: The JD(S) has lost considerable ground and the stakes are high. As a debutant, are you feeling the heat of this pressure?  It’s true that there is a huge responsibility. But, I’m optimistic of victory. People in the constituency are feeling that they did a mistake by voting for the Congress and the BJP. The BJP candidate Munirathna was accused of a vote scam when he was previously with the Congress. B S Yediyurappa himself tweeted about it back then. Then, through Operation Kamala, Munirathna jumped to BJP for his own selfish gains, misusing the voters’ mandate. Meanwhile, honest party workers such as BJP’s Tulasimuniraju Gowda have taken a backseat. People have been watching all these developments. On top of it, the ruling party’s Covid-19 management has been poor, too. Taking all this into account, I’m confident that people will support me. The Congress has fielded Kusuma Hanumantharayappa. What do you make of her? Kusuma is like a sister to me. I don’t want to comment on her personally. However, I feel that the contest, in general, is between the BJP and the JD(S). And, I’m confident of winning.  RR Nagar has a significant Vokkaliga population. Do you see this working in your favour? I don’t see this as a caste issue. I’m the son of a farmer. I’m not interested in caste politics. I intend to take everyone along. Anybody who plays caste politics will not be able to grow. People are interested in voting a youngster who is interested in working for their welfare. The entire state is watching how I will take on powerful opponents. I want to do a good job.  What are your priorities for the constituency if you win? I want to build schools on the lines of what the Delhi government has done, so that common people can send their children to good schools at an affordable price. The other thing I will focus on is improving government hospitals. These are the two main things that people need. Rest of the infrastructure comes later.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/people-are-tired-of-trusting-congress-bjp-jds-leader-krishnamurthy-v-902951.html

16-10-2020||Main Article||All the waters of the Ganga||Uttar Pradesh, the hallowed land of sacred rivers and holy temples and of sadhus and saints, has become a map of rape and death. All the waters of the Ganga will not wash the blood and cleanse the sins of the perpetrators of the rape of the Dalit girl in Hathras, nor all its holy waters purify the defenders of rapists and their lusty cheerleaders. The rapists and killers may hang or may go scot free under political patronage, but can those in ochre robes who wield power, where criminals under their watch have a free run, those leaders who sing Vande Mataram and end their speeches with zesty cries of Bharatmata ki Jai, can they go unpunished? Can any amount of worship in the temples of Kashi and singing and chanting of beads in Mathura to appease the Gods exculpate one from one’s dastardly crimes when they violate women with such cruelty? Can such a land ever aspire to Ram Rajya?  Why did the UP government busy itself pointing fingers at Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi or assaulting and arresting journalists and civil rights activists who were showing solidarity with the victim’s family? If there is such a rape or murder in West Bengal, shouldn’t the BJP protest against the administration of Mamata Banerjee? If there are violent sexual assaults and brutalisation of Dalits in Rajasthan, as has been the case, can the BJP sit quiet and let Ashok Gehlot off the hook?   Doesn’t the UP government realise that its soft-pedalling of atrocities against Dalit women and highhandedness and exploitation of minorities will be taken as tacit approval of these by the upper castes and will result in a backlash against them and against the BJP itself and its affiliates as has happened in West Bengal and Kerala previously, where they are at the receiving end? The autocratic ways of Mayawati when she rode roughshod channelling Dalit anger against upper castes gave way to lumpen elements from the Yadav community and Muslim leaders during the rule of Mulayam and Akhilesh Yadav. Did not the BJP ride to power promising to rid UP of violence and goondaism, on the promise of good governance?  Some political commentators have observed that “While Muslims as ‘enemies’ suits the BJP’s political strategy perfectly, alienating the Dalit vote could exact a heavy price.” Uma Bharti has been openly critical of the Yogi government’s handling of the Hathras rape and assault. Others have commented that while Muslim lives might not matter for BJP, Dalits lives matter. Their votes do. They have warned that Yogi is playing with fire, stoking it to appease the upper castes. Is this the time to descend to such depths, to dissect caste calculations and vote bank arithmetic? We cannot be more depraved than this. Every life matters. Every daughter is inviolate. Be it a Dalit or a Muslim, a Thakur or a Jat, Brahmin or a Baniya.   When Nirbhaya was raped and murdered bestially during UPA rule, no one asked what caste she belonged to. The whole country rose in one voice against the brutal sexual assault on her. The BJP rightly joined the protests of students and the youth and held the UPA government to account and demanded that our cities be made safe. Maybe the BJP exploited the situation by dipping into the anger of the people and derived political mileage from the Nirbhaya episode and hastened the demise of the UPA regime. Congress, which is being accused of “politicising” the Hathras rape and murder may be doing the same.  Now, the boot is on the other foot. The Yogi government must be held responsible for the lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh. The writing is on the wall. UP is not safe for women. Any woman. Dalit women are bearing the brunt of it. The government’s own statistics reveal that UP has an unenviable record and tops the charts for crimes against Dalit women. The latest National Crime Records Bureau figures show that in India, 88 women are raped every day, out of which 10 are Dalit women. UP holds the dubious record, laying claim to 14.7% of all crimes against women in the country. Yogi was handpicked to emancipate the state and free it of violence against women, unshackle its people from the grip of the Samajwadi Party and its hoodlums. Sadly, the state has simply passed from the hands of goons of one party into the arms of the thugs of the next party. This has been the fate of the people of UP over the last few decades, with no respite from atrocities, from social instability, conflict and strife.  Can this be the land of Tulsi Das’ Ramcharitmanas, considered widely the highest essence of our culture, that eulogises the noblest ideals and deeds of Rama, the very epitome of glorious Indian devotional poetry of universal love, where now terror reigns and rapists stalk the land and where women fear to tread outside their homes? Our mythology places women over men, gives them precedence as we worship and chant their names -- Radha-Krishna, Siya-Ram, Parvati-Parameshwara, who are invoked as the embodiment of Shakti, Durga and Kaali who ward off evil so that in flesh and blood, we may hold our daughters, sisters and mothers in awe and reverence. Tulsi Das wrote the epic poem in vernacular Awadh Hindi, shorn of high-flown poetic Sanskrit, synthesising it from many versions of Ramayana and stories from the Puranas so that the ethos of Sita and Ram could reach and suffuse the common people and ennoble them in their daily deeds and prayers.  It should be a people’s good fortune when a ‘Yogi’ becomes the ‘King’ of his state. For he is supposed to combine in himself the virtues of an ascetic and attributes of a just ruler who administers through Dharma, what Atal Behari Vajpayee eloquently called Raj Dharma. It will be a great misfortune if it were to be otherwise in UP, as has been the case so far.  (The writer is a soldier, farmer and entrepreneur)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/all-the-waters-of-the-ganga-902542.html

Even members of Mahisha Dasara Committee, who had warned of holding demonstrations to register their protest against not allowing them to celebrate Mahisha Dasara, withdrew, citing inconvenience to people. As it rained on Monday night, the climate and environment in the city is clear and pleasant, despite bright sunlight. While seating arrangement is made for 28,000 people on the Palace premises, over 2 lakh people are expected to watch the procession on both sides of the Rajamarga, the path of the Jamboo Savari. A total of 11 elephants would be part of the Jamboo Savari. Launch of procession Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa will perform Nandi dwaja puja at Balarama Gate of Mysuru Palace during Makara lagna, between 2.15 pm to 2.58 pm, to launch the Dasara procession. He will offer floral tributes to the idol of Sri Chamundeshwari, mounted on the golden howdah, carried by caparisoned elephant Arjuna, during the Kumbha lagna from 4.31 pm and 4.57 pm in front of the Durbar Hall of the Palace. He will be accompanied by scion of the erstwhile royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, District incharge Minister V Somanna, Mayor Pushpalatha Jaganath and MLA S A Ramdas. The golden howdah will be mounted on Arjuna, the elephant carrying the howdah for the eighth year, near the residential side of the Palace, where head of the erstwhile royal family Pramoda Devi Wadiyar will guide the team lead by Akram, a retired mahout. As Arjuna is now 60 years old, this might be his last responsibility to carry the 750 kg howdah. There will be a total of 38 tableaus of various Zilla Panchayats and government departments and 39 folk art troupes in the procession on the Rajamarga that will reach Bannimantapa via, Chamaraja Circle, Albert Victor Road, KR Circle, Sayyaji Rao Road, Bamboo Bazar, and Highway Circle, covering a distance of 5 km. Torchlight Parade Governor Vajubai R Vala will receive the guard of honour, during the Torchlight Parade by the Police and other security forces at Bannimantapa Grounds at 7 pm.

Kotak, who is also the president of industry chamber CII, said the government's response to the pandemic has underlined the need for better coordination between the Centre and the states. Speaking at an event organised by Bloomberg, Kotak said, "We need to increase our spends (in healthcare) from 1.3 per cent to at least more than double, because we are very under-invested in healthcare" and also increase the efforts on education. The country will have to find the resources over the medium term for these two areas because it is a necessity for its long-term prospects, he emphasised. During the conversation with private equity major Carlyle Group's co-founder and co-chairman David Rubenstein, Kotak said this is the best time to invest in India for foreign investors, adding that the best returns were made on the bets taken between 1999 and 2003, when the country was facing challenging economic prospects. He said digital, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, technology and consumer goods are the best sectors for investment, though there can be surprises across sectors. Rubenstein said India and China are the best places to invest over the next 10 years outside of the US. However, he admitted that India has not received adequate investments as compared to China. "But I do think that in the next 10 years it will change as India is increasingly seen as an attractive place in which to invest capital," he said. Kotak said the Indian government's response to the pandemic has been more cautious and welcomed the RBI's work. He explained that the monetary policy has been more accommodative but there is conservatism on the fiscal side because of the rising fiscal deficit which will take the public debt to GDP ratio to 85 per cent. He said India's combined fiscal deficit, including the gap in both central and state governments' finances, will come in at 13 per cent in FY21. There are some successes lately on the Covid-19 front but the country will have to be cautious in the upcoming festive season, he said. Kotak Mahindra Bank has a succession plan like any other institution, Kotak said, adding that his elder son Jay, who has joined the bank, can come up only on merit. His younger son may settle in the US, where he is studying right now and the elder son may stay back in India, he added. India needs to re-imagine its financial sector to be more robust and the government will have to take tough decisions on its ownership of the state-run lenders, he said. Kotak said the market share between the state-run banks and the private sector ones will be evenly split in the next 5-10 years as against 65:35 at present. "We have to dramatically take advantage of opportunities arising out of tech and digital. Transformation of the financial sector across technology, risk management, cost of intermediation, effectiveness of financial institutions is crucial for our future," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-under-invested-in-healthcare-should-double-spending-uday-kotak-902503.html

"New manufacturers will be eligible for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme under which they will be eligible for financial incentives on basis of their sales for first 5-6 years," Gowda said while addressing the virtual Latin America & Caribbean session on ‘Reimagining Distances’, during  LEADS 2020, organised by FICCI. Gowda said that India is the only country with the largest number of US-FDA compliant Pharma plants (more than 262 including APIs) outside of USA with exports $ 20 billion worth of pharma products to various countries including high standards complying countries like the US and Europe. The Minister further emphasised that this is a very- very good time to invest, and set up a manufacturing base in India in the pharma sector. "One can enter the India market through Joint Ventures also. The advantage is that you can get access to big markets like the domestic Indian market, US, Japan, EU and South East Asia through India as far as pharma sector is concerned. Anybody can contact my office if they are interested in the Indian pharma sector, we will provide all possible facilitation and hand-holding," he stressed. Gowda also said that the market size of Chemicals & Petrochemicals sector in India is around $ 165 billion. The size is expected to grow up to $ 300 billion by 2025. This presents a huge opportunity in the Chemical sector India. For example, to meet the growing demand India will need 5 crackers by 2025 and an additional 14 by 2040. These crackers alone will require a cumulative investment of $65 billion. To attract foreign participation, he said, Government of India is revisiting policies for chemical and petrochemical sector. "We are thinking to extend financial incentive based on sales similar to what is being extended in our pharmaceutical sector. We are also tweaking our policies to strengthen our chemical industrial cluster which we call as PCPIRs and plastic parks,"  Gowda said. "I am told that Latin American and Caribbean countries are also net importers of chemical fertilisers. Instead of competing in the market as buyers, we should be cooperating for making supply chains more efficient so that adequate quantity can be sourced at competitive prices," he added||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-pharma-sector-to-grow-to-65-billion-industry-by-2024-gowda-902516.html

16-10-2020||National||Modi govt's agriculture reforms could help turn India into food-export powerhouse||Of all the controversial reforms Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sprung on the market, the recent laws to liberalize farm sales could turn out to be the most far-reaching. In a fractious and unruly session last month, parliament passed three laws that some say could pave the way for India to upend the global food trade, while others fear it will wreck the livelihoods of millions of farmers. Within days, rural groups and opposition leaders launched public protests. The move toward a free market for farm sales goes to the heart of a system that directly affects more than half of the nation’s 1.37 billion people, altering government controls that millions of families have come to rely on, but that have hobbled the nation’s efforts to productively farm one of the largest areas of fertile land on earth. If they succeed, India could not only feed itself but become a major food exporter. “We need private sector investment in technology and infrastructure for Indian agriculture to realize its full potential and compete better in the global marketplace,” said Siraj Chaudhry, managing director and chief executive officer of agriculture services company National Collateral Management Services Ltd. But the government must make its intent very clear to win over sceptics. “This is a major policy change that impacts a large and vulnerable section of the population.” India processes less than 10% of its food production and loses about 900 billion rupees ($12.3 billion) a year due to wastage from inadequate cold storage, said Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer at government think tank NITI Aayog. Modi has a long resume of contentious policy steps, including a ban on high-value cash notes, the biggest tax reform since independence in 1947 and the world’s toughest coronavirus lockdown rules. The latest seems mild by comparison: a set of amendments to laws that govern the purchase, sale and storage of farm produce. Yet eight opposition lawmakers were suspended for unruly behaviour when the new bill was passed and groups representing farmers and political parties organized demonstrations, sit-ins and tractor rallies in grain-producing states such as Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Shiromani Akali Dal, a long-term supporter of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which rarely went against the decisions of Modi’s coalition, quit the government. It said farmers fear the measures will eventually kill the government’s price support regime for crops and leave them at the mercy of big corporations that would control the market. Modi and his ministers say the concerns are baseless and the price guarantee program will continue. His administration even raised some minimum prices for winter crops to try to reassure farmers that the price supports aren’t in jeopardy. I said it earlier and I say it once again: System of MSP will remain. Government procurement will continue. We are here to serve our farmers. We will do everything possible to support them and ensure a better life for their coming generations. It’s a highly emotive subject in India. The government sets price floors for more than two dozen crops and buys mainly wheat and rice for its welfare programs together with some pulses and oilseeds to prevent distress sales by farmers. The massive subsidies help distribute staples to the poor through a chain of more than 500,000 fair-price shops. The issue has become even more heated because of the pandemic. The disruption to farms and supply chains has exposed weaknesses in the government welfare system, which is hampered by bureaucracy, underfunding and archaic distribution facilities. Farmers point out that, while the government’s guaranteed prices are often considered benchmarks, private buyers don’t have to pay them. “We are disappointed,” said Charanjeet Singh, who grows rice, wheat and vegetables on his farm in the northern state of Haryana. “The government should guarantee that all farmers, irrespective of whether they are selling in the designated grain markets or to private buyers, will get at least the minimum support price.” Contract Farming Analysts and industry experts say the new policy has the potential to change the face of Indian agriculture, which has been hampered by low yields and inefficient smallholdings, by encouraging more contract farming. That’s a system where private companies agree prices for crops with farmers prior to the harvest or even before sowing, and offer loans, provide quality seeds and encourage mechanization. The new rules would also make it easier to sell crops in other states or abroad. Farmers would get a more stable income and the increased production would boost exports and revenue, they say. “Overall, the reforms should benefit farmers and encourage contract farming,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. said in a report. “As private sector participation increases over the years, the Indian agriculture sector’s supply chain and infrastructure would improve.” Farming has lagged behind other sectors of India’s economy. The rural poverty rate is about 25% compared to 14% in urban areas, according to World Bank data. Underinvestment has made the food supply vulnerable, a fact that is being underlined as the coronavirus spreads across the country. Food inflation accelerated 9.7% in September as Covid hit the nation’s already fragile supply chains. While supporters of the farm reforms say the changes would make the system more robust in future, others argue that the crisis reinforces the need for a safety net for farmers. ‘End of the Road’ “It will be the end of the road for the food security program,” said Kannaiyan Subramaniam, general secretary of a farmers union in southern India, who grows gooseberries, potatoes and other vegetables. “In the long run, corporations will monopolize trade, production and stockpiles. The government will succumb to pressure from the WTO and get rid of the public grain procurement.” Before the new amendments, farmers in most states were restricted from selling their crops outside government-facilitated wholesale markets and faced legal hurdles in transporting harvests to other states. Central to the reforms is an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, a 1955 law that some say is the root of India’s agricultural inefficiency. “It was an anti-farmer policy,” said Atul Chaturvedi, president of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India, which represents vegetable-oil processors. “This one act stymied the growth of Indian agriculture big time.” When prices rose due to demand, the law’s price-control measures kicked in, discouraging investment to increase production, said Chaturvedi, who is also executive chairman of Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. The government would also sometimes ban exports of some farm goods to control local prices, as well as limiting the ability to store crops. Farmers suffered huge losses when production, especially of perishable commodities, surged. Some critics of the amendments to the law say the new situation could be worse for farmers. Corporates and multinational companies buy agricultural products at a cheaper rate and sell at higher prices, “squeezing both ends by hoarding and black marketeering,” said the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, a farmers’ pressure group. “There is no penalty for failure to honour contracts.” If the government can push through the reforms while retaining the support of farming communities, it could create a platform for wide-scale improvements in the nation’s food output, The country is already the world’s largest producer of milk and the second-biggest grower of wheat, rice and some fruits and vegetables. It’s also one of the biggest exporters of cotton, rice and sugar. If India can raise productivity to global norms, the country could become “an important link in global food supply chains,” NITI Aayog’s Kant wrote in a newspaper article. The new reforms, he said, set the stage for India to become “a food-export powerhouse.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-govts-agriculture-reforms-could-help-turn-india-into-food-export-powerhouse-902591.html

The workers will be able to register through their phones directly, said Apurva Chandra, the Union labour secretary.  "The workers themselves can register through Aadhaar. Various authorities can also help in this purpose," he added. After facing severe backlash over lack of data on job loss and death of migrant workers during the coronavirus lockdown, the government has come up with a plan to start an official survey on the migration patterns of labourers in the country. The survey will cover both seasonal and long term migration.  Chandra added that the survey, which will be collected through various modes, will help the government to understand migration patterns and track movements of those who need governmental help. This action will increase fixed-term employment as a number of industries are keen to employ people during peak season, Chandra said according to the report.  Bhartruhari Mahtab, the head of the labour panel, appreciated the government's approval of the panel’s suggestion to register workers from the unorganised sector. Of the 25 crore labourers, the primary target is the construction sector which constitutes the maximum number of migrant workers.  According to reports, more than 1.6 crore migrant workers returned to their home states during the Covid-19 lockdown. Approximately 40 crore people work in the organised sector according to government estimates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/25-crore-migrant-labourers-to-enroll-for-jobs-through-new-government-portals-report-902655.html
16-10-2020||National||Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw feels India is dealing with Covid-19 in 'ad-hoc manner'||By Chris Kay and Haslinda Amin India has the ability to aggressively ramp up coronavirus testing capacity, a move that will help it check a wave of new active cases hitting hospitals and skirt an economically unviable lockdown, according to the head of one of the country’s largest drug makers. With pooled testing that can include as many as 10 people in one go, India “could potentially scale up its testing 10-fold,” said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, the founder and chairman of Biocon Ltd. Pooled testing increases the number of people that can be tested using the same amount of resources but it works well in clusters with low prevalence. Shaw suggested using this technique in combination with the more prevalent rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. “We are way below the testing levels of other countries,” she said at the Bloomberg India Economic Forum on Thursday. “We need to ramp up our testing -- the number of active cases are manageable at this point of time, but if the active cases start surging we simply don’t have the capacity.” India, which in March imposed the largest nationwide lockdown globally in response to the pandemic, was taken by surprise by the surging number of infections when it started removing the restrictions, Mazumdar-Shaw said. Now more than 7 million people in the South Asian nation have been infected with Covid-19 -- the second-largest outbreak in the world.  With about 830 tests per million, India’s current virus testing rates are among the lowest in the world, according to most recent data from Johns Hopkins University. The steady rise in cases is making it harder for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revive an economy that shrank 24% in the quarter ended June. ‘Ad-hoc Manner’ “We are going about it in an ad-hoc manner, opinions count and science is not being looked at rationally,” said Mazumdar-Shaw, 67, who in August was infected with Covid-19 and experienced mild symptoms. She advocated early diagnosis to treat the infection and recover faster. Fortunately, India has a youthful population that has kept fatalities low, she said, along with a large vaccine production capacity with multiple firms currently holding clinical trials. The biggest challenge for the country will be building up cold chain logistics to distribute vaccines across India in a short period of time, Mazumdar-Shaw said. “I do hope by the end of November that we are able to say we have a plan” and digital platforms to help roll out vaccines, she said. The race to develop an inoculation against Covid-19, involving developers in more than 30 countries, has fostered cross-border collaboration and high-stakes competition. Modi’s administration had promised an indigenous vaccine as early as mid-August, a claim the government and its apex medical research body has since walked back. Vaccine Nationalism By year-end or January “a few” vaccine emergency use authorizations will likely be approved by different regulators, including India’s, Mazumdar-Shaw said. Quantities will be scarce at first, “but will ramp up very quickly,” she said. Still, public health specialists have warned that vaccine nationalism could result in the pandemic lasting longer, by preventing the most efficient allocation of shots to prevent Covid-19. Some countries are trying to buy the first place in line for supplies in the event an experimental vaccine proves effective, even though many have signed up to an access collaboration called COVAX. “Unfortunately, it is likely to play out in an unfair way -- countries are becoming very self-centered,” Mazumdar-Shaw said. “It doesn’t protect you from your neighbouring country which isn’t vaccinated -- this is a global pandemic, we are all in it together, we need to be a collective force.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kiran-mazumdar-shaw-feels-india-is-dealing-with-covid-19-in-ad-hoc-manner-902661.html

He made the remarks during a video conference after releasing a commemorative coin of Rs 75 denomination on the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). PM Modi said he has been receiving letters from across the country asking about the committee and when would the government take a decision on it. "There is an important deliberation going on to decide what should be the ideal age of marriage for daughters...I want to assure them, the government will soon take its decision after the submission of the report," Modi said. In his Independence Day speech, Modi had said that the government was looking at suggestions on increasing the minimum age of marriage of women from the present 18 years. The minimum age for marriage for men is 21 years. The proposal was first mooted during the Budget Speech of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this year. Later, a committee under senior leader Jaya Jaitly was set up to examine the issue. Modi also said the girls' gross enrolment ratio in education has turned higher than that of boys for the first time in the country because of several efforts taken by the government in the last six years. He also said that his government has taken an integrated and holistic approach to deal with the challenge of malnutrition. Complementing the FAO for playing an important role in raising farm production and making efforts towards eradicating starvation and malnutrition across the world, including in India in the last 75 years, he said the commemorative coin of Rs 75 denomination has been released in recognition of FAO's contribution and services||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-to-soon-take-decision-on-minimum-age-of-marriage-for-girls-pm-modi-902673.html

"Inspite of measures, there have been reports of increase in stubble burning which will pollute atmosphere of NCR inevitably. There needs to be some monitoring of stubble burning before it assumes unhealthy proportions," a three-judge bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said. The court accepted a suggestion by senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for a minor, Aditya Dubey, for appointment of Justice Lokur to monitor the situation and devise ways to tackle the problem of smog affecting Delhi and parts of north India. "There needs to be some monitoring of stubble burning before it assumes unhealthy proportions," the top court said.

Gadkari also conducted the bhumi puja (groundbreaking) for the development of another 16 projects at a cost of Rs 7,585 crore. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy presided over this event conducted in virtual mode via a video conference from New Delhi and Vijayawada. Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways General (retired) V K Singh, Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy, Union Secretary (MoRTH) A Giridhar, state minister for Roads and Buildings M Sankara Narayana, Principal Secretary M T Krishna Babu and others attended. The projects inaugurated included the long-awaited 2.7-km Kanaka Durga flyover, a new jewel for Vijayawada city, built at a cost of Rs 501 crore, with the state governments contribution of Rs 146 crore. An engineering marvel, it is only the third six-lane bridge in the country with a unique spine-and-wing design supported by a single pier. Gadkari called it "the pride of the country." A four-lane road was also developed that would connect the National Highway-65 to NH-16 in Vijayawada. The other flyover at Benz Circle on NH-16 is part of the expansion of the Vijayawada-Machilipatnam section of NH-65 into a four-lane road. Incidentally, Gadkari laid the foundation stone for these flyovers in December 2015. Both were delayed for many years due to various reasons but the Benz Circle flyover was completed early this year and the Kanaka Durga flyover last month. Gadkari laid the foundation stone on Friday for a parallel three-lane flyover on NH-16, to be built at a cost of Rs 100 crore for a length of 2.47-km. He also launched the development of a major six-lane bypass (17.88 km), including a major bridge on river Krishna, which would connect the NH-65 (at Gollapudi near Vijayawada) with NH-16 (at Chinakakani village near Guntur) at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore. Another 30-km bypass being taken up will connect NH-16 (at Chinaavutapalli) with NH-65 (at Gollapudi) at a cost of Rs 1,225 crore. These two projects would significantly reduce the traffic load on Vijayawada city, besides cutting the costs and easing the movement of transport vehicles on these crucial highways.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-inaugurates-10-major-road-projects-in-andhra-pradesh-902686.html

President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished Patnaik over phone on the occasion. The PM also took to Twitter to greet the BJD chief. "Birthday greetings to Odisha CM Shri Naveen Patnaik Ji. Praying for his long and healthy life," he tweeted. Patnaik had said on Thursday that he would skip celebrations this year, in view of the Covid-19 crisis. He advised his party members, supporters and well-wishers to help those in need to mark his birthday. Leaders cutting across party lines, including Union Minister Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and Dharmendra Pradhan, extended their greetings to the chief minister on Friday. His counterparts in Tripura, Nagaland and Madhya Pradesh also prayed for his health and long life. Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik created a sand sculpture of the CM to wish him on his birthday. Earlier, too, Patnaik had skipped birthday celebrations of multiple occasions, including last year, when Cyclone Fani had struck the state, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Patnaik had joined politics in 1997 after the demise of his father and former CM Biju Patnaik. He took over the reins of Odisha in 2000 and had since held the post of the chief minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/president-vp-pm-modi-greet-odisha-cm-naveen-patnaik-on-his-75th-birthday-902692.html

The man's body, whose head and some other parts were missing, was found on October 3 on the Machna bridge near Betul by the Government Railway Police (GRP), he said. "During the investigation, it came to light that the man was run over by the New Delhi-Bengaluru Rajdhani express train, following which an alert was sounded," GRP Betul's head constable Vedprakash said. Police collected the body parts from the tracks, which were preserved after autopsy, he said. "The railway staff in Bengaluru recovered the head on October 4. The police there circulated its photo to ascertain the identity of the victim. They finally zeroed in on Betul after they came to know that the headless body of a man was found there," he said. "About four days back, the Betul GRP was informed about the recovery of a man's head found entangled in the engine of the Rajdhani express train. It was found to be that of Ravi Markam (28), a resident of Betul, as his family members identified it," Vedprakash said. A police team from Bengaluru arrived in Betul to conduct a probe into the case, he said. "As the deceased's family members were unable to go to Bengaluru due to financial reasons, the police buried the head there only," he said, adding that the remaining dismembered body parts were handed over to the family for the last rites. Police said it is not yet clear whether the man died by suicide or died in an accident on the tracks. According to Vedprakash, investigation into the incident is on and a case is being registered.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/severed-head-recovered-under-train-in-bengaluru-after-torso-found-in-madhya-pradesh-902698.html

The Wireless Monitoring Organisation (WMO) has also issued notice to e-commerce companies warning against the sale of network boosters without valid permit, the official said. "We got an assignment from WMO regarding unauthorised mobile boosters in East of Kailash, Sant Nagar and South West. We have identified some unauthorised mobile boosters but people are not aware that installing them without a valid permit is illegal. We made them aware of it," G K Reddy, engineer-in-charge, international monitoring station, Wireless Monitoring Organisation, told PTI. Telecom operators have complained to the Department of Telecom that illegal mobile boosters are interfering with their network which is leading to frequent calls drops, hampering call connection etc. According to industry sources, there were reports of around 3,000 illegal boosters working in Delhi. "We have been conducting raids for the last one year and have removed around 400 boosters so far. We have asked people not to illegally instal boosters again and a notice is issued to them to refrain from such illegal activity in future. We will also issue notice to vendors selling boosters without permit," Reddy said. The Wireless Planning Commission under the DoT has in 2019 issued notice to e-commerce platforms for selling network boosters in an unauthorised manner. The DoT on its website uploaded a public notice asking people to not instal unauthorised mobile signal boosters. "The general public is informed that any person shall not establish, maintain, work, process or deal in unauthorised wireless transceiving apparatus such as unauthorised mobile signal boosters as it is punishable offence as per the provisions of Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933 and India Telegraph Act 1885," the public notice said. It added that use of unauthorised mobile signal boosters creates interference in telecom networks and deteriorates the quality of service for telecom service providers, thereby hurting the experience of mobile phone users.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dot-clamps-down-on-illegal-mobile-network-boosters-in-delhi-902699.html

In his address on the occasion of the force's 36th Raising Day, NSG director general (additional charge) S S Deswal said the force has acquired the most modern weapons and equipments to distinguish itself as a "world class zero-error force". "The NSG close protection force has trained 21 personnel of Sri Lanka's PM security division in close protection skills. The honourable Prime Minister of Sri Lanka wrote to the honourable Indian PM and praised the training," Deswal said. The National Security Guard, also known as the 'black cat' commandos, was raised as a federal contingency force in 1984 to undertake specialist counter-terrorist, counter-hijack and hostage rescue operations. It has a special component called the CPF (close protection force) that provides security to high-risk VIPs under the top category Z+ cover. It has about 13 protectees under its charge at present, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah. Deswal said the CPF, during the Covid-19 outbreak, provided security to its VIPs in about 4,000 events held in various states. The NSG DG said the force had enhanced its mobility, training, weaponry and equipment by "many times" as terrorism is a complex and global problem in this century and the tactics of terrorists were changing and terror groups were possessing modern weapons.  "We are determined to adopt modern technology and specialisation," the DG said during the event at the force's garrison here that was chaired by Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy. He said the force has been training special combat units of state police forces so that they are better prepared to combat terrorist incidents even as he invited them to share NSG's expertise in counter-terrorism, bomb disposal and sniffer dogs training. "Post the 26/11 Mumbai attacks of 2008 we have corrected and upgraded in many areas...the force has remotely operated vehicles, satellite communications system, armoured robots, unmanned aerial vehicle detection radar system and anti-drone capabilities," Deswal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nsg-has-trained-sri-lankan-pms-security-personnel-in-close-protection-force-chief-902709.html

Efforts are being made to improve mandi infrastructure so that MSP buying continues in a scientific way, he said, adding that recent agri reforms reflect India's commitment to global food security. "MSP and government procurement are an important part of the country's food security. It is important that it continues to function with better facilities and in a scientific way. We are committed towards this," Modi said after releasing a commemorative coin of Rs 75 denomination on the 75th anniversary of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Noting that wholesale mandis or Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) have their own identity and strength, Modi said these mandis were in place for years in the country and their infrastructure is being improved. He said about Rs 2,500 crore investment was made in the last six years to boost mandi infrastructure. Even IT infrastructure is being built to connect mandis with electronic National Agriculture Market (eNAM). "The recent three big agri reforms are major steps towards expanding agriculture and increasing farmers' income," he said, adding that the reforms in the Essential Commodities (EC) Act will make mandis more competitive, enhance farmers' income and address the problem of food wastage. Further, Modi said that earlier farmers did not have access to mandis and were forced to sell their produce to middlemen. "Now, the market will reach the doors of small farmers and ensure higher prices. They (farmers) will be free from middlemen and consumers will also benefit," he said. The recent law on contract farming will also benefit farmers by protecting them from price volatility as they can enter into a contract to sell their produce at a pre-determined price with private entities prior to sowing. Farmers' interests are protected if there is any breach of contract, he added. Lauding farmers' initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic that has helped the country fight malnutrition, Modi said farmers have broken the previous record in foodgrains production this time. Similarly, the government has broken past records in procurement of wheat, rice and pulses. "Farmers, agri scientists, anganwadis' asha workers have played an important role in our efforts to address malnutrition. Even during the corona crisis, we are fighting malnutrition due to their efforts," he said. In the last seven to eight months, the government distributed free ration worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore to 80 crore people although there is less discussion about it at the global level. "Free ration given in India is higher than the population of Europe and the US," Modi said. He also mentioned that the government has implemented ration card portability scheme 'One Nation, One Ration Card' in 28 states and union territories. Prior to 2014, the food law was rolled out in only 11 states. To address malnutrition, the government is promoting crops with high nutrition. Millets like ragi, jowar, bajra are being promoted. Modi, who released 17 new bio-fortified varieties of eight crops on the occasion of World Food day on Friday, said these varieties are being made available to farmers across the country and will help boost production of high-nutrition crops. Prior to 2014, only one variety used to reach farmers but now 70 varieties are reaching farmers, he said. According to him the acceptance of India's proposal by FAO to declare 2023 as International Year of Millets will not only promote high-nutrition food and its availability but also benefit rain-fed small farmers in the country. The UN agency FAO has seen India's fight against malnutrition closely. Earlier, efforts were made in silos but now multidimensional approach is being adopted to address malnutrition issue in India, he added. Modi also recalled the contribution of Indian civil service officer Binay Ranjan Sen who started the World Food Programme when he was Director General of FAO during 1956-1967 and that programme has won the Nobel Peace Prize 2020. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Women and Child Development Smriti Irani, Ministers of State for Agriculture and senior FAO officials were present in the virtual event.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/msp-government-procurement-important-part-of-countrys-food-security-pm-narendra-modi-902718.html
16-10-2020||National||No exclusivity clause dampens railway route privatisation: Report||Railway route privatisation is not as rosy it looks as there is no bar on competition on one hand and demand risks outweigh the benefits on other, even though the private operator is free to fix the tariffs, warns a report. Currently, the railways cross-subsidises passengers by overcharging freight to minimise the losses generated in running passenger trains. Learning from previous public-private partnership models, the government has drafted a new concession framework for private train operators giving them autonomy to fix tariffs. "But the absence of a non-competing clause for the route amplifies the cash-flow risks on one hand and on the other bid variable or the revenue share, resembles ports or airports' concession model, where the experience has been mixed for concessionaires," notes India Ratings in a report on Friday. Additionally, the operators are obligated to pay haulage charges towards track maintenance, signalling, terminals and others on a per km basis for 16 coaches train and cargo-related risks are higher than anticipated. Though the concession period is long enough at 35 years, the full exposure to demand risk poses an elevated risk for operators and that the corridor demand/traffic risk combined with competition from existing trains would influence developers' return expectations, says the report. Even though the framework allows a developer to win more than one routes opens up the opportunity to commingle multiple projects to raise funding, "however, we expect demand risks to outweigh the benefits of pooling in the event of incorrect demand risk forecasting", it said. While demand risks also exist in other sectors like airports and ports, the introduction of competition elevates the risk in the case of railways. "In other sectors, there are some exclusivity clauses prohibiting competition. Absence of this clause casts higher uncertainty on revenues. The model allows only some time exclusivity from the originating point," it notes. However, full autonomy to fix the tariff lends strength to the model, it says adding a dynamic pricing model similar to the taxi-aggregator model will be a better way, though. Given the minimum maintenance gap of either 31 days or 40,000 km of running, the operator's ability to maintain trains in a good condition to meet the key performance indicator plays a critical role in the assessment methodology. The haulage charges are paid for identified support from the railways.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-exclusivity-clause-dampens-railway-route-privatisation-report-902724.html

The plea filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has also sought a direction to all the states to enforce 'Model Builder Buyer Agreement' and 'Model Agent Buyer Agreement' and to take steps to avoid “mental, physical and financial injury” to customers. "Promoters, Builders and Agents use manifestly arbitrary one-sided agreements that do not place customers at an equal platform with them, which offends Articles 14, 15, 21 of Constitution. There have been many cases of deliberate inordinate delays in handing over possession and customers lodge complaints but police don't register FIRs, citing arbitrary clauses of the agreement. "Builders issue revised delivery schedule again and again and adopt arbitrary unfair restrictive trade practices. All this amounts to criminal conspiracy, fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of the property, dishonest misappropriation of property and violation of corporate laws," said the plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey. Due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering from mental and financial injury but also from brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood. The PIL contended that many developers across the country still follow a common practice of pre-launching a project without securing requisite approvals for the project from the authorities, and term it as 'soft launch' or 'pre-launch' etc. thus, openly violating the law but no action has been taken against any builder till date. "It is necessary to state that registration of the project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale, and for registration, the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals. "Thus the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals which are one of the major causes of delay for the project," the plea said. The plea has also sought directions to compensate the buyers for losses incurred due to inordinate delays on the part of Promoters-Builders and to recover their money.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-in-sc-to-frame-model-pacts-to-protect-realty-customers-902730.html

At a meeting with all the 41 zonal revenue officers (ZROs), Chadha said he came across a number of complaints on Delhi Jal Board's Twitter handle regarding erroneous bills. "It has come to my notice that in the last few rounds, bills are being generated on the basis of incorrect water meter readings. The reasons can be many, such as feeding incorrect information, a locked water meter, human error, etc. This has an adverse impact on DJB's billing mechanism," he said. He said every water meter reader should be physically present while taking reading at a consumer's home. DJB has over 1,000-meter readers. Chadha said that ZROs with minimum adjustment cases and least complaints will be felicitated on a quarterly basis. Action will be taken against the ZROs with the most number of complaints from consumers, least accurate bills, and those who make the most adjustments in bill generation. Chadha also directed the officials to maximise the use of Android-based tablets.

During a hearing on a petition against undue delay in the construction of Lahore-Narowal Road, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Qasim Khan on Thursday asked a federal law officer as to who was responsible to construct the road -- federal or provincial government. The law officer said the matter of releasing funds for the construction of the road in question did not fall within the ambit of the federal government. Chief Justice Khan asked: "If construction of the road was the subject of the province how the federal government constructed and controlled the project of Kartarpur Corridor. Do the governments work on their personal wishes or under the law?” The judge directed the law officer to tell the court whether the Kartarpur Corridor’s project carried out by the federal government "was not an intervention in the affairs of the province of Punjab." The judge said the court may issue a notice to the prime minister if the meddling on the part of the federal government in the affairs of the province was established. "We would issue a notice to the prime minister if necessary,” he said. The chief justice adjourned the hearing for two weeks and also directed Additional Attorney General Ishtiaq A Khan to file a reply in the matter. In November last year, India and Pakistan threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative as part of commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev The Imran Khan government had taken credit of the construction of the corridor, while Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid claimed that it was the "brainchild" of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur. The corridor – which allows Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free travel to the historic Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara - was closed on March 16 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-court-questions-federal-governments-construction-of-kartarpur-corridor-902750.html

Gadkari said five lakh road accidents were happening in the country, resulting in the death of at least 1.5 lakh people every year. "Give the highest priority to saving the lives of people. We have to reduce the number of accidents. This is very important," he said, addressing a virtual event from New Delhi wherein he dedicated several road development projects in Andhra Pradesh to the nation. "I am personally very much sensitive and will support you in this mission," Gadkari observed. The Union Minister pointed out that the Tamil Nadu government successfully reduced the road accidents and deaths by 25 per cent. "If you plan and take measures...there is a good example of Tamil Nadu. At the same time, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are helping us. They are ready to sanction Rs 14,000 crore for improving road engineering for black spots," Gadkari said. He said 435 black spots have been identified on National Highways in AP. Temporary rectification measures have been completed for 295 black spots and permanent measures for 150. Temporary measures for the remaining black spots were targeted for completion this year while permanent measures would be completed by December 2021. "I am ready to support you. My suggestion is...on a mission mode...if you can decide and accept this challenge...I am 100 per cent sure we can resolve this issue. And that can be a great thing for the people of AP," Gadkari told Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-lauds-tamil-nadus-efforts-to-reduce-road-accidents-related-fatalities-902759.html

The decision was taken with the approval of the Prasar Bharati Board, said Prasar Bharati News Services and Digital Platform Head Samir Kumar in letters to PTI and UNI. The Prasar Bharati Board had held a meeting on Thursday in which the decision was taken. The letters written by Kumar said Prasar Bharati had been availing subscription to the services on the basis of an ad-hoc pro-rata arrangement since 2006 after the formal contract between the agencies and the public broadcaster ended. The agencies have since discussed the same and communication to provide fresh viable pricing was sent to them. The PTI was served a notice on 23 April, 2019 while the UNI was issued a letter on 16 October, 2019. "Prasar Bharati has now decided to call for fresh proposals for a digital subscription to English text and related multi-media services from all domestic news agencies," the letters said, adding that the PTI and the UNI can also participate in the process once it is notified by the broadcaster. The fresh move comes months after Prasar Bharati threatened to discontinue the services of PTI after it interviewed the Chinese ambassador amid a raging India-China border row. In June, Kumar had written to the PTI saying that the "recent news coverage" on the India-China border row was detrimental to national interest and undermining India's territorial integrity. He had also said that the Prasar Bharati had alerted the PTI about the editorial lapses that were detrimental to the public interest. An RTI by transparency activist Venkatesh Nayak had later revealed that Kumar had written the letter without the approval of the Prasar Bharati Board.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prasar-bharati-decides-to-end-pti-uni-subscriptions-to-call-for-fresh-proposals-902768.html
16-10-2020||National||Air pollution, hypertension among top 5 risk factors for deaths in India in 2019: Study||Air pollution, hypertension, tobacco use, poor diet and high blood sugar levels were the top-five risk factors for deaths in India in 2019 according to a new study. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, published in the Lancet journal on Friday, assessed more than 286 causes of death and 369 diseases and injuries in more than 200 countries and territories across the world. It noted that India has gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, but with wide inequalities between states. According to the researchers, including Srinivas Goli from the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, life expectancy in India has risen from 59.6 years in 1990 to 70.8 years in 2019, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh. However, they said the increase in 'healthy life expectancy' in India has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy since "people are living more years with illness and disability. The study found that the largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years were non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like ischaemic heart disease, COPD, diabetes, and stroke. In 2019, the research noted that the top five risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million). According to the researchers, over the past decade there has been more than 0.5 per cent annual increase in the exposure to several highly preventable risks such as obesity, high blood sugar, alcohol use, and drug use globally. They warned that the greatest cumulative impact on health comes from the striking rise in metabolic risks like high blood sugar, hypertension, and high cholesterol, which have risen 1.5 per cent a year since 2010, and account for nearly 20 per cent of total health loss worldwide in 2019. The study noted that these metabolic risks have grown by a staggering 50 per cent since 1990, and are responsible for a huge number of deaths globally -- with high blood pressure contributing to one in five deaths (almost 11 million) in 2019, followed by high blood sugar (6.5 million deaths), high BMI (5 million), and high cholesterol (4.4 million). In the South Asia region, they said non-communicable diseases now contribute to more than half of the years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, which was dominated by infectious, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 30 years ago. Citing an example, the researchers said 58 per cent of the total disease burden in India is now due to non-communicable diseases, up from 29 per cent in 1990, while premature deaths due to NCDs have more than doubled from 22 to 50 per cent. According to the study, hypertension is the third leading risk factor after air pollution, responsible for 10-20 per cent of all health loss in eight states in India, primarily in the south. "Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits," said study lead author Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US. "We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research," Murray said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/air-pollution-hypertension-among-top-5-risk-factors-for-deaths-in-india-in-2019-study-902771.html

These results have been boosted by 22 states and Union Territories which have demonstrated better performance and are reporting even lower deaths per million population compared to the national average, it said. "The Covid-19 case fatality rate has been on the slide continuously. At the current figure of 1.52 per cent, it is the lowest since March 22," it highlighted. Thirteen states and Union Territories, including Puducherry (403), Maharashtra (335), Goa (331), Delhi (317),  Karnataka (152), Tamil Nadu (135) and Punjab (131), had deaths per million population more than the national average. As part of Covid-19 management and response policy, the Centre's sharp focus has been not only on containing the spread of the disease but also to reduce deaths and save lives by providing quality clinical care to the critical and severe patients, the ministry said. Collaborative efforts of the Centre, states and Union Territories have resulted in the strengthening of health facilities across the country. A total of 2,212 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals have been providing quality medical care. The Centre has also issued a standard of care guidelines thus ensuring the standardised quality of medical care for all coronavirus patients in government and private settings. A unique initiative to build the capacities of the ICU doctors in the clinical management of critical patients towards reducing the fatality, e-ICU has been started by AIIMS, New Delhi. India on Friday too maintained the trend of registering more recoveries than the new cases, with 70,338 people having recuperated in 24 hours as against 63,371 fresh instances of the infection being reported. The total number of recoveries have surged to 64,53,779 and exceed active cases of Covid-19 by 56,49,251. "Recovered cases are eight times more than active cases which are sliding continuously. Presently, active cases comprise merely 10.92 per cent of the total cases," the ministry highlighted. The national recovery rate has improved to 87.56 per cent. The ministry said 78 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and Union territories. Maharashtra alone has contributed the maximum with more than 13,000 single-day recoveries. Also, 79 per cent of the new infections are from 10 states and Union territories. Maharashtra continues to report more than 10,000 cases daily followed by Karnataka with more than 8,000 cases. Of the 895 fatalities reported in 24 hours, nearly 82 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and UTs of Maharashtra, Karnataka, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha and Delhi, the ministry said. Maharashtra has reported 337 deaths which comprise more than 37 per cent of the new fatalities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-covid-19-fatality-rate-152-lowest-since-march-22-health-ministry-902773.html

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that the government had reservations about appointment of the Justice Lokur committee for monitoring stubble burning. Addressing a press conference, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the Centre did not favour formation of the panel because it wanted to "downplay" stubble burning as the main cause of pollution in north India as it does not suit the BJP's narrative. "We welcome the Supreme Court's decision in the matter. The formation of the panel proves four things. It proves that stubble burning is the main cause of pollution in Delhi," Bhardwaj said. "Secondly, it also proves that the Centre and state governments of Punjab, Haryana and UP have no interest in solving the problem of pollution and that is the reason that the SC had to intervene and form the committee to look into the pollution," he said. "Thirdly, the SC-appointed EPCA also failed to address the issue of stubble burning in the last five years. Fourthly, the opposition by the SG (Mehta) shows that the Centre, for its politics, wanted the pollution to continue so that they can continue to blame Delhi government for it," he added. The apex court directed the court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) and chief secretaries of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to assist the Lokur panel to enable it in physical surveillance of fields where stubble is burnt. It said the panel shall submit its report on stubble burning fortnightly to the apex court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-opposed-formation-of-lokur-panel-to-downplay-stubble-burning-issue-aap-902774.html

The district court, while admitting the petition, issued notices to the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Shahi Masjid Idgah Trust and others and posted the matter for further hearing on November 18. The lawyer for 'Shri Krishna Virajman', Vishnu Shankar Jain said that the district judge had accepted their contention in support of the petition and now the hearing of the matter would begin. Earlier the court of the civil judge in Mathura had rejected the petition stating that it was not maintainable. The lawyers for 'Shri Krishna Virajman' had challenged the decision in the court of the district judge. The petition has sought removal of the Shahi Idgah mosque, which was adjacent to the existing Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi, from the complex and has challenged the agreement signed between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and Shahi Idgah Mosque Management Committee in 1968. It claimed ownership over the entire 13.37 acres of land on which they were situated. The agreement allowed the Mosque to continue to exist and use the land on which it was situated. The petitioners contented that the Sansthan did not have any authority to enter into agreement with the Mosque managing committee and hence the agreement should be cancelled. Although the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), which had spearheaded the Ram Temple movement, had made it clear that Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi was not on its agenda, the All India Akhara Parishad (AIAP), an apex body of the seers in the country, had extended its support to the petition The AIAP had also called for removal of the Gyanvapi Mosque, which was adjacent to the famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. A court in Varanasi was currently hearing a petition in this regard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mathura-court-admits-petition-seeking-removal-of-mosque-from-krishnas-birthplace-902780.html

Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik stepped down as captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders team, handing over the reins to his English deputy Eoin Morgan.  Here are the top stories of the day, October 16, 2020: The BJP appears to be the favourite for corporates when it comes to donations, with the party bagging 82.3% or over Rs 2,300 crore given to national parties in seven years between 2012-13 and 2018-19. In contrast, Congress received only Rs 376 crore during these seven years while other national parties got much lesser. The analysis by private election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed that BJP had pipped the Congress in attracting corporate donations even when it was not in power at the Centre.   Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad tested positive for coronavirus. "I have tested positive for Covid-19. I am in home quarantine. Those who came in contact with me in the last few days may kindly follow the protocol," he tweeted.   Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik stepped down as captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders team, handing over the reins to his English deputy Eoin Morgan hours before the IPL match against Mumbai Indians here. Karthik told the KKR management that he wants to "focus on his batting and contributing more to the team's cause." Appointed skipper in 2018, the 35-year-old led KKR in 37 matches.   Midway into the ongoing season, KKR find themselves at fourth place in the points table with four wins and three losses. Morgan was widely tipped to take over at some point from Karthik given the topsy-turvy run. Do listen to our IPL podcast from this morning, link will be available in the shownotes.   Defending holding public events during the coronavirus pandemic, US President Donald Trump, who tested positive for Covid-19 early this month, has said that as a president he cannot remain locked in a basement and he has to meet people despite the risks.

In a letter to Sonia Gandhi, he expressed disappointment over the ticket distribution for the 70 seats the party is contesting in the Bihar elections. "The choice of candidates has left much to be desired and there are apparent gross irregularities," he claimed. The leadership chose to "ignore" the voices from within, including of Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, that the party should not give tickets to persons facing charges of crimes against women, alleged Tiwari, who was seeking a ticket from Govindganj. In December 2012, the Nirbhaya Trust was formed by the family of a woman who was brutally gang-raped and murdered in Delhi. The trust assists women who have experienced violence to find shelter and legal assistance. The Congress on Thursday released its second list of 49 candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, fielding Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv Sinha from Bankipur and Sharad Yadav's daughter Subhashini Yadav from Bihariganj seats.

Foodgrain production stood at 143.38 million tonnes during the 2019-20 kharif season, as per official data. Currently, harvesting of kharif crops is underway. Rice is the main kharif crop. "Foodgrain production will be better than last year. As per the initial estimates, foodgrain production is projected to be 144.52 million tonnes in the 2020-21 kharif season," Tomar said addressing a digital conference organised by industry body CII. Production of cash crops such as sugarcane and cotton is also expected to be good, he said. According to the first estimate accessed by PTI, the ministry estimated a record rice output at 102.36 million tonnes during the kharif season of 2020-21 crop year (July-June) as against 101.98 million in the previous year. Similarly, pulses output is likely to increase to 9.31 million tonnes this kharif season from 7.72 million tonnes in 2019-20, while the production of oilseeds is projected to increase to 25.72 million tonnes from 22.31 million tonnes. However, coarse cereals production is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.84 million tonnes in the 2020-21 kharif season as against 33.69 million tonnes. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be at record 37.11 million bales as against 35.49 million bales of 170 kg, while sugarcane output is projected to increase to 399.8 million tonnes from 355.7 million tonnes in the said period. Earlier addressing the virtual conference, Tomar said the bumper production is estimated following a record increase in kharif acreage notwithstanding the pandemic. Despite the Covid-19 crisis, there has been a record increase in area sown to kharif crops by 4.51 per cent to 1,121.75 lakh hectares this year, he said. Tomar said agriculture is the pillar of the Indian economy. The sector grew 3.4 per cent during the first quarter of 2020-21 fiscal even as the total economy showed a decline in the said period. "This shows how strong our agriculture and rural economy is.  Earlier too, the agriculture sector has shown its strength in facing similar challenges. I am fully confident that this sector will give a fillip to the economy in future." Despite the pandemic, rabi crops were harvested on time and kharif sowing was done in a record area, the minister said. Farm exports too rose 43.4 per cent in the first six months of this fiscal despite the Covid-19 crisis, he added. On new farm laws, the minister asserted that farmers are being "misled" about the reforms and reiterated that procurement at minimum support price as well as mandis will continue to function across the country. "Two laws will bring revolutionary changes in the agriculture sector but some people are spreading lies and misleading farmers due to their personal interest. However, farmers are well aware of their tricks," he said. "Neither MSP nor mandis will be affected because of the new laws. These two will continue," Tomar said adding the new laws give freedom to farmers to sell outside mandis at better price and earn better profits. The minister said the government is taking many measures to strengthen the farm sector and Rs 1 lakh crore has been earmarked for strengthening agriculture infrastructure. About 37 food parks have also been sanctioned and of which 20 are operational, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kharif-foodgrain-production-likely-to-be-record-14452-mn-tonnes-in-2020-21-agri-min-902810.html

Once the user dialled the number given on the pop-up, he was directed at call centre executives who demanded huge sums of money to clean the non-existent malware and also installed unnecessary damaging softwares of the users' computers, he said. The central agency had conducted searches at the premises of accused companies -- New Delhi-based Softwill Infotech Private Limited and Saburi TLC Worldwide Services Pvt. Ltd, Jaipur-based Innovana Think labs Limited and Systweak Software Private Limited, Noida-based Benovellient Technologies Private Limited, Noida and Gurugram-based Saburi Global Services Pvt Ltd. The searches were spread across various locations including Jaipur, Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) at the premises of private companies and residential premises of accused persons in an on-going investigation of the case, Gaur said. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement on Thursday that in an "unprecedented collaborative" effort, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in India took actions in parallel with today's filing against corporate and individual participants in the scheme located in Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, and Jaipur.. “The Department of Justice sincerely appreciates the CBI's efforts to disrupt and prosecute technical-support fraud, government imposter fraud, and all other schemes directed at the American public.” Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Civil Division said in a statement in the US. The US authorities have filed a complaint in a Florida court against the scam on which the court on Thursday has issued a restraining order to dismantle internet based infrastructure of the alleged fraudsters. According to the complaint Michael Brian Cotter, 59, of Glendale, California, knowingly provided US support for India-based accomplices in furtherance of the scheme, the DOJ statement said. "Cotter facilitated the scheme through several companies, including Singapore registered Global Digital Concierge Pte. Ltd., formerly known as Tech Live Connect Pte. Ltd., Nevada registered companies Sensei Ventures Incorporated and NE Labs Inc., New York registered Kevisoft LLC, and United Kingdom registered Kevisoft UK LTD. The temporary restraining order issued by the court today dismantles these defendants' U.S. infrastructure, such as websites and payment processing relationships, and prohibits the defendants from continuing to facilitate the alleged scheme," it said. The complaint has alleged that Cotter was working with Indian conspirators since 2011 to set up domains, setting up shell companies and putting in place payment infrastructure through banks and payment operators. "Individual victims are alleged to have reported paying hundreds to thousands of dollars to the scheme for unwanted and unnecessary technical-support services," it said. Gaur said similar coordination is being done by the CBI with federal agencies of the other countries. The CBI has been making concerted efforts to identify and rapidly dismantle any such network of transnational cyber frauds operated out of India, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-searches-6-firms-over-computer-tech-support-fraud-recovers-assets-worth-rs-190-crore-902819.html
16-10-2020||National||Farm sentiments remain positive led by good monsoon: Report||Farm sentiments have remained buoyant mainly driven by healthy monsoon and further optimism of a good Kharif crop, according to a report. Agriculture income is likely to benefit over the medium term aided by increased government focus on rural income coupled with the recently introduced farm reforms, Icra Ratings said in the report. Moreover, it said the rural household incomes have stayed resilient in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and have been supported by healthy farm cash flows across regions, aided by high levels of rabi procurement under various government schemes after a season of a bumper harvest. Further, increased government support through schemes like MNREGA and PM-KISAN have helped in creating employment and easing liquidity pressure on rural incomes, brought about by large scale reverse migration from urban to rural areas post the imposition of the nationwide lockdown, it added. "While the sudden imposition of nationwide lockdown had led to fears of disruption in the Rabi procurement process, the same was mitigated by the prompt lifting of restrictions by the government for agricultural activities. "This, along with a significant increase in spending on social welfare schemes during the first quarter of FY21 helped in absorbing the excess labour availability in rural areas created by reverse migration," the ratings agency's Vice President Shamsher Dewan said. Further, timely and healthy monsoon rain across regions and labour availability has supported early Kharif sowing with its acreage at record highs during the current year, the report added. The same is likely to result in a healthy harvest for most Kharif crops, therefore, keeping the farm sentiments up, it said. Notwithstanding the risk of Covid-19 spreading in rural areas, Icra expects the farm sentiments to remain healthy over the next few months supported by favourable reservoir levels. It said agriculture income is likely to benefit over the medium term aided by increased government focus on rural income as well as the recently introduced farm reforms, which are capable of creating increased value in the sector. Farmers would potentially benefit from improved price discovery for their produce, stability brought by long-term contracts with corporates as well as increased investment in agriculture infrastructure by the private sector over the medium-term, the report added. "Various high-frequency sentiment indicators including fertiliser sales and tractor retail sales are pointing towards continued healthy demand in rural areas. Food prices have also remained at high levels which generally is a positive for the farmers. "With reservoir levels being favourable, there are expectations of a good Rabi sowing over the next few months which could further extend the upbeat sentiments in rural India. However, lower than average reservoir levels in north India - a major contributor of Rabi production, could be a possible dampener," Dewan added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farm-sentiments-remain-positive-led-by-good-monsoon-report-902825.html
16-10-2020||National||Most Indian executives prefer continuing with remote working: Survey||As people have settled down to remote work that became a norm following the nationwide lockdown, a global survey found that 52 per cent employees and 64 per cent C-suite executives interviewed in India prefer to continue with the new ways of doing business or work. Almost overnight, the business world shifted to remote work, unleashing a more agile workforce and a period of experimentation and innovation at work. About 52 per cent employees and 64 per cent C-suite executives in India are seeing just how effective remote work can be and embrace the new ways of working, according to the 'The Work Survey' by cloud-based company ServiceNow. The survey was conducted during September 1-10 among 900 C-suite executives and 8,100 office professionals from companies of 500 or more employees in countries including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, India, Japan, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. In India, The Work Survey was conducted among 100 C-suite leaders and 1,000 employees from various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, telecommunications and public sector. Further, the survey showed that in India, there is a strong appreciation of digital transformation and also an appetite for more. Both executives (69 per cent) and employees (55 per cent) interviewed acknowledge the need for further investment as the top priority for organisations seeking to leverage any pandemic-induced cost savings. There is likely to be any funds for this purpose, with 91 per cent of India's executives interviewed agreeing that cost savings will be derived by changes to company operations, brought on by Covid-19, it added. The survey also showed that India holds the number one global standing when it comes to utilisation of digital workflows. While the trend at first seems encouraging, there is still a long road ahead, it stated. "Seventy-four per cent of India's executives said their business continues to use offline workflows, the lowest among all other countries surveyed (US 89 per cent, UK 98 per cent, Australia 98 per cent)," said ServiceNow Managing Director (India and SAARC) Arun Balasubramanian. While the figure indicates greater adoption of digital workflows in India, there is clearly plenty of scope for greater utilisation of digital work processes, he added. The pandemic has helped companies forge new and better ways of working, something India's executives (97 per cent) and employees (93 per cent) firmly agree on. However, one of the biggest challenges for India to overcome is transforming the many old processes that remain disconnected across systems and departments. Less than half of Indian employees (49 per cent) and executives (42 per cent) believe they have a fully integrated system for workflow management across business functions. "The appreciation for digital workflows in India is among the highest in the world but there is still a long road ahead for the sub-continent. We are on the cusp of an unprecedented wave of workflow and workplace innovation and there's no going back," Balasubramanian added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/most-indian-executives-prefer-continuing-with-remote-working-survey-902828.html

The CPI-IW is used primarily for measuring Dearness Allowance (DA) payable to workers in the organized sector including PSUs, Banks and Insurance companies besides government employees. "Labour Ministry denies reports in a section of media appearing under the caption “Govt. employees set to get more DA” published on October 16, 2020," the ministry said in a statement. The ministry has never said that the new index would lead to a hike in salaries of industrial workers and government employees, it clarified. Labour Bureau, an attached office of the ministry, is going to release new series of CPI-IW with 2016 as base year on October 21. At present, the base year for the index is 2001. The ministry said this index is used for revision of dearness allowance payable to government employees and workers in the organized sector. However, it explained that the hike in salaries of industrial workers and government employees will depend on the behaviour of new series, which is too early to predict at this stage. The new series of CPI-IW would be more comprehensive as it would have over 300 items in its basket like health, education, food compared to 200 in the existing index. Besides, it would collect data from around 90 different centres or markets across the country in the new series compared to 77 in the existing index.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/labour-min-dismisses-reports-of-new-cpi-iw-series-leading-to-pay-hike-of-employees-902837.html

The key focus of this year is the elimination of trans-fat from the food supply chain. Presiding over the event organised by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Vardhan reminded everyone of the government's effort to make India free of trans-fat by 2022, a year ahead of WHO's target. Present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils such as vanaspati, shortening and margarine, trans-fat is a major contributor to the rise in non-communicable diseases in India, the health ministry said in a statement. "Trans-fat is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Eliminating CVD risk factor is especially relevant during Covid-19 as people with CVD are predisposed to have serious conditions having an impact on mortality," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement. Due to the unprecedented challenges faced by the world on account of the pandemic, there has been a renewed focus on food, nutrition, health, immunity and sustainability, he said. "FSSAI's Eat Right India movement targets to promote safe and healthy food for everyone in an environmentally sustainable way. It is a part of its mandate to provide safe and wholesome food for all citizens. This will improve the food safety ecosystems and lift the hygiene and health of our citizens," Vardhan stressed. Reiterating the game-changing potential of 'Eat Right India' and 'Fit India Movement',  Vardhan said, "These two movements along with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jal Jeevan Mission and other efforts of the Environment Ministry will improve the health of Indians and heal the environment." Expressing his amazement at the marvels of the Internet where curious citizens can look up things on the whole gamut of information available, he asked officials of FSSAI to promote awareness and consumer education leveraging technology so that informed citizens can make responsible choices. The health minister launched the 'Eat Right Creativity Challenge' for schools which is a poster and photography competition and aims to promote healthy dietary habits.  He also launched the 'Eat Smart City' challenge by FSSAI in partnership with Smart City Mission and The Food Foundation, UK to create an environment of right food practices and habits in India's smart cities and can set an example for others to follow, the statement stated. Vardhan also launched the 'Food Safety and Hygiene Guidelines for Safe Reopening of School Canteen/Mess' -- a document that highlights the best practices to be followed in the 'New normal of Covid-19' by all the stakeholders. It also includes tips on personal and environmental hygiene and common myths with their clarifications.  The 'Do you Eat Right?' book will help in translating the technical concepts on food and nutrition and Eat Right initiatives into simple conventional style for the general public, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-pandemic-renewed-focus-on-nutrition-health-immunity-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-at-world-food-day-event-902845.html

The economy is projected to contract by a massive 10.3 per cent this year, according to an IMF forecast. Even the Reserve Bank of India expects the economy to shrink by 9.5 per cent in the current financial year.  As per the finance ministry schedule, the nearly one-month long exercise to finalise the Revised Estimate (RE) for 2020-21 and Budget Estimate (BE) for 2021-22 began on Friday. The meetings will conclude on November 12. Officials of the Department of Financial Services, as well as ministries of MSMEs, housing, steel and power were among those who participated in the first meeting, as per the schedule. "This year, however, keeping in view the Covid-19 situation and the need to maintain social distancing, the number of participants for the pre-budget meetings may be restricted to a maximum of 5 officers (for each meeting) from a Ministry/Department, not below the rank of Director/DS," the Budget Division of the finance ministry had said in a notice. It will be the third Budget of the Modi 2.0 government and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Budget 2021-22 is likely to be presented on February 1. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government scrapped the colonial-era tradition of presenting the Budget at the end of February. The then finance minister Arun Jaitley had for the first time presented the annual accounts on February 1, 2017. With the preponement of the Budget, ministries are now allocated their budgeted funds from the start of the financial year beginning April. This gives government departments more leeway to spend as well as allow companies time to adapt to business and taxation plans. Previously, when the Budget was presented at the end of February, the three-stage Parliament approval process used to get completed some time in mid-May, weeks ahead of onset of monsoon rains. This meant government departments would start spending on projects only from August-end or September, after the monsoon season ended.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/finance-ministry-kick-starts-budget-making-exercise-amid-contraction-pressure-902862.html

Speaking during an online event hosted by the Asia Society, Jaishankar said, “In terms of your… question, how are we with Pakistan. Well, I am afraid we're still at the, if not the perennial issues, at least the long-lasting ones, which is terrorism from Pakistan continues." "Terrorism from Pakistan remains publicly acknowledged by their government as a policy that they are justifying. So it makes it very hard to conduct normal relations with them,” Jaishankar said. He added that it is not only terrorism, but Pakistan doesn't do normal trade with India and has not given New Delhi MFN (Most Favoured Nation) status. “We don't have a normal visa relationship, they are very restrictive on that score. They have blocked connectivity between India and Afghanistan and from Afghanistan to India,” he said. Jaishankar said that normal neighbours do visas and trade, “they give you connectivity and most important they don't practice terrorism. And I think until we address that problem, this challenge of how do you have a normal relationship with this very unique neighbour is a very troubling issue for our foreign policy.” Responding to a question on the developments in Kashmir since the bifurcation last year, Jaishankar said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir has now become two union territories. “The external boundaries of India have not changed. The external boundaries of India remain what they are today as opposed to what they were five years ago or 20 years ago, 40 years ago,” he said. “So as far as our neighbours are concerned, our point to them is that this is something which is internal to us. Every country after all reserves the right to change its administrative jurisdictions. A country like China has also changed the borders of its provinces and I'm sure a lot of other countries do that. “Neighbours get impacted only if your external boundaries change. That has not happened in this case,” he said. Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship. The relationship further dipped after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26 last year in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed. Withdrawal of Jammu and Kashmir's special powers and bifurcating the state into two union territories in August last year also evoked a strong reaction from Pakistan, which has been unsuccessfully trying to rally international support against India on the Kashmir issue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/terrorism-from-pak-continues-making-it-very-hard-to-conduct-normal-relations-with-them-jaishankar-902864.html

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait issued notice and sought response of complainant, BJP leader Rajiv Babbar, on Tharoor’s plea challenging the summons issued against him by the trial court in the defamation case. The high court listed the matter for further hearing on December 9. Tharoor, represented through senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Vikas Pahwa, has sought setting aside of the trial court’s April 27, 2019 order by which he was summoned as accused in the criminal defamation complaint. The plea, filed through advocate Gaurav Gupta, has also sought quashing of the complaint of November 2, 2018. Pahwa argued that the trial court’s order is bad in law and against the settled principles of criminal jurisprudence and it has completely overlooked the fact that the complaint filed by Babbar is completely false and frivolous. The criminal complaint was filed against Tharoor in the trial court by Babbar, who had claimed that his religious sentiments were hurt by the Congress leader's statement. In October 2018, Tharoor had claimed that an unnamed RSS leader had allegedly compared Prime Minister Modi to "a scorpion sitting on a Shivling". He termed it an "extraordinarily striking metaphor". Tharoor was granted bail in the case in June last year by the trial court. The complainant had said, "I am a devotee of Lord Shiva... However, the accused (Tharoor) completely disregarded the sentiments of crores of Shiva devotees, (and) made the statement which hurt the sentiments of all Lord Shiva devotees, both in India and outside the country." "The complainant's religious sentiments were hurt and the accused deliberately did this malicious act, intending to outrage the religious feelings of Lord Shiva devotees by insulting their religious belief," the complaint had claimed. It had also described Tharoor's statement as "intolerable abuse" and "absolute vilification" of the faith of millions of people. The complaint was filed under sections 499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-high-court-stays-criminal-defamation-proceedings-against-tharoor-for-scorpion-on-shivling-remarks-902866.html

Thakur, while defending the legislations, said the Congress and some other parties were opposing the farm laws due to their “vested interests” keeping an eye on the 2022 Punjab assembly polls. But the Modi government is committed to double farmers' income by 2022, he asserted. “Punjab is the only state in the country where the ruling party (Congress) is trying to misguide, create confusion and mislead farmers,” Thakur said addressing a group of farm scientists in Ludhiana through virtual conference. The Minister of State for Finance said instead of making the farmers understand (about the laws), the state government was trying to instigate them. He also accused the Congress of speaking in favour of ‘arthiyas’ (commission agents) rather than farmers. Raising the issue of mandi tax collections, the BJP leader said the Punjab government had claimed that it would face a loss of Rs 3,500 crore. “Does Chief Minister Amarinder Singh not want doubling of farmers' income?” he said as he accused the CM of playing politics over the mandi issue. Thakur clarified that the mandis would continue to stay under the new farm laws and farmers have been given the option of selling their crops outside notified mandis. He slammed the Congress for “spreading lies” about dismantling of mandi system. “The Modi government has given Rs 2,500 crore for bringing improvement in the mandi system during the last five years,” the MoS added. He also lashed out at the Amarinder Singh-led government for “failing” to waive off complete debt of farmers as promised before the 2017 assembly polls. “The Congress makes false promises before polls and later backs out,” he alleged. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said before the 2017 assembly polls that they would bring amendment to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, Thakur said. Earlier addressing media in Ludhiana, he said the new farm laws were in no way detrimental to the interest of farmers.

The apex court said the issue can be raised before the concerned high court. “We decline to entertain the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution since the petitioners are at liberty to adopt appropriate remedies available in law, including by virtue of a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution (before the High Court),” a bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee said. AT-1 bonds are direct, unsecured and subordinated debt in the issuing bank and they rank below to the claims of all creditors and above to common equity with no fixed repayment date. As part of the bailout package for the private bank, the AT-1 bond holders' investment was written-off citing existing rules which gave the new management of Yes Bank a huge breather to get the operations out of the restrictions imposed by RBI and the government, and start functioning normally. Aggrieved by the decision, several pleas have been filed by bondholders and others in various high courts including that of in Bombay and Delhi. Senior advocate Ajit Sinha, appearing for 343 bondholders, said the writing down of AT-1 bonds, secured by them in 2016 and 2017, be declared as illegal and the invested money through bonds be returned to the petitioners along with interest. The bondholders had also sought the supply of data pertaining to the sale of AT1 Bonds by the institutional investors to the retail investors. The senior lawyer said that the writing down of the AT-1 bonds was the gross abuse of process leading to a situation where the retail investors have been deprived of their investments and deposits. Earlier, the Yes Bank had moved the top court seeking transfer of the petitions pending before various high courts and consumer forum to the Bombay High Court against its decision of March 14 to write down the AT-1 bonds.  The bank, which is now headed by SBI's former CFO Prashant Kumar, has showed a marginal improvement in the gross non-performing assets ratio at 16.80 per cent in the March quarter as against 18.87 per cent in the three months ended December 20. To avoid a possible collapse of Yes Bank, RBI had sacked its management and placed the lender under an administrator on March 5 with a 30-day moratorium, which was later on curtailed to nearly two weeks. The moratorium on the bank which restricted cash withdrawals limits to only Rs 50,000 was lifted after banking hours on March 18. On March 13, the government notified the rescue plan drafted by the RBI. As part of the 'Yes Bank Limited Reconstruction Scheme 2020', SBI and other investors made equity capital infusion to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore. Private lenders ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IDFC First Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank and mortgage lender HDFC Ltd have also infused capital of over Rs 3,000 crore in cash-starved Yes Bank to keep it afloat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-writing-down-of-at-1-bonds-by-yes-bank-902871.html

The court's order came on Thursday after it took cognisance of a chargesheet filed by the ED against Bhandari, linked foreign companies and others on June 1 under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The special judge at Rouse Avenue Court here said, "Issued summons to the accused persons and directed the ED to expedite the process of extradition against Sanjay Bhandari pending before UK authorities so that he can be brought to India for trial in accordance with law." The agency said its probe found that "Bhandari stashed black money abroad with the assistance of his accomplices to evade taxes, causing huge financial loss to the national exchequer". "Bhandari owned assets in various foreign jurisdictions, incorporated various entities in UAE as owner or beneficial owner and also had financial interest in an entity incorporated in Panama.  "It was revealed that all those foreign assets and entities were not disclosed by Bhandari to Income Tax authorities in India," it claimed. The ED filed a criminal case of money laundering against him and others in February, 2017 taking cognisance of an Income Tax Department chargesheet filed against him under the anti-black money law of 2015. Bhandari, who the central agency says has never cooperated with it in the probe, is absconding from the country and was last stated to be in the UK. He is being probed by the ED in two other money laundering cases, apart from the CBI, Income Tax Department and the Delhi Police for various criminal charges of corruption and tax evasion. Bhandari's case first came to light after the I-T Department conducted searches against him in April, 2016 and recovered certain "sensitive" official defence documents from his premises.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/court-issues-summons-to-sanjay-bhandari-in-money-laundering-case-902872.html

Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' launched the Asean PhD Fellowship Programme (APFP) at a virtual event attended by envoys of the 10 nation grouping with 42 research scholars pursuing their subjects of interests at Indian Institutes of Technology across the country. The APFP was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018 when leaders of the 10 ASEAN nations were chief guests at the Republic Day celebrations. India had announced 1,000 fellowships over a three year period with 250 students getting the research grant in the first year. However, according to the website of the programme, 42 students have been shortlisted after two rounds of applications. Nishank said the APFP was the largest capacity development programme undertaken by the government for foreign beneficiaries. The Asean PhD Fellows will be recognized as the alumni of the respective IITs from where they will be completing their doctoral research, he added. “New Education Policy (NEP)-2020 will bring transformational change in the education system of India, promote research and innovation in higher education and internationalisation of education,” Amit Khare, Secretary, Department of Higher Education said at the function. Khare said the PhD Fellows will begin their academic journey through the virtual route and were expected to report to their respective campuses in the next two to three months, if the Covid situation improved. “The programme will be India’s contribution to the education and upskilling of ASEAN’s IT capacity,” Sidharto Reza Suryodipuro, Ambassador of Indonesia said. IIT-Delhi Director V Ramagopal Rao said the APFP will also bring in the much needed cultural diversity in India’s academic institutions and was in line with the Look East policy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-education-policy-india-launches-fellowship-program-for-asean-scholars-902888.html

Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the government instead of building "false narratives" should get down to doing the right things that will increase consumption, investment and jobs. Citing grim International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections, she alleged India will become the "fastest falling economy" from being the fastest growing economy. She also cited the IMF projections of 10.3 per cent contraction in India's GDP, which is the highest in the world after the UK's 9.8 per cent. "India from being the fastest growing economy would be the fastest falling economy in the world," she said. Shrinate also said that a country like Bangladesh, whose per capita GDP used to be 25 per cent less that of India's five years ago, now has the per capita GDP of 1,888 against India's 1,876. Instead of taking a cue from Bangladesh in improving India's GDP, she said, the entire BJP and its leaders are busy building a narrative to negate this and claim that the purchasing parity of India is far more than that of Bangladesh. “The intrinsic value of your currency is calculated by the purchasing power parity and not the per capita GDP which is more in Bangladesh,” she said. The Congress leader also pointed out that due to government policies, India did not benefit from the trade war between the USA and China and the three countries that benefitted most were Mexico, Vietnam and Bangladesh. "We failed to take any advantage of that Trade war. We did not make any gains out of it, whereas, we were the fit and the right candidate to have got a lot of business from China, from the US. But, we failed to do so, because of all the misdirected policies of the Modi Government,” she claimed. She also said that Bangladesh’s garment export with the US is USD 32 billion, while for India it is USD 8 billion.  Taking on the government over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, she said it has no strategy to fight the pandemic as India is number 2 in the world in terms of caseload and has a death rate twice that of Pakistan or Bangladesh and eight times that of Sri Lanka. "It is absolutely certain that the Modi government has no cognisance, no strategy to fight the Corona pandemic, because under their watch we are number two as far as infections are concerned," she said. Shrinate said while on one hand there is has been a "gross mismanagement" of the pandemic, on the other the Modi government has ensured that "the Indian economy has completely got ruined”. “It is in complete shambles. Today, there is no demand, no consumption, no investment and hardly any jobs." She said it is a cause of deep concern that the IMF revised its earlier forecast of 4.5 percent contraction in Indian economy and now says that it would contract by over 10 percent. "It is a cause of deep concern because today Bangladesh has a higher per capita GDP and the government, instead of doing something about it, turns around and says our purchasing power parity is higher," she said. “Even now, as jobs are being lost, as wages are being cut, the double-whammy is that people are struggling with high prices. Inflation has soared to the levels of nearly 7.5 percent," she alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-has-no-strategy-to-deal-with-coronavirus-pandemic-revive-economy-says-congress-902893.html

The company also said the MSTECL transmission system failure led to cascading impact on all the downstream suppliers of electricity including Tata Power and BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport). "The power failure was attributed to cascade tripping at sub-stations and transmission lines of MSETCL, the state-run transmission company, leading to grid failure at Mumbai that resulted in power outages on Monday morning, October 12th 2020," a Tata Power statement said. It said a central team comprising officials from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is investigating the power breakdown in the city. Tata Power is supporting the central team by providing information and data related to the chain of events which transpired on the day of the outage, it added. On Monday, Tata Power had said as per its preliminary assessment of the situation, many parts of Mumbai experienced an unforeseen electricity failure in the morning due to tripping of MSETCL’s 400 KV transmission system at Kalwa, which supplies power to Mumbai and adjoining areas. "There are four incoming Ckt (circuit) /lines to MSTECL Kalwa receiving stations for further transmission of power to Mumbai. Out of these four lines, MSETCL’s 400kV Pune-Kalwa line was under forced shutdown since October 10th 2020," it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mumbai-power-outage-due-to-cascade-tripping-of-msetcl-lines-sub-stations-tata-power-902901.html

Jaishankar also said the violent clashes at the de facto border in the Ladakh sector in June had a very deep public and political impact, and left the relationship between India and China “profoundly disturbed”. Tensions had escalated manifold between India and China after the Galwan Valley clashes in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese People's Liberation Army also suffered an unspecified number of casualties. Jaishankar, speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Asia Society, said that India has built the relationship with China over the course of last 30 years “and a basis for building that relationship has been peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control.” He said there are multiple agreements, starting from 1993, which created the framework for that peace and tranquillity, which limited the military forces that came to the border areas, how to manage the border, how border troops behave when they approach each other. “So, from the conceptual level down to the behavioural level, there was an entire sort of framework out there. Now, what we saw this year was a departure from this entire series of agreements. The massing of large amount of Chinese forces on the border was clearly contrary to all of this. “And when you had friction point which was large number of troops at different points very close to each other, then something tragic like what happened on 15th of June happened," he said. "To underline the enormity of that, it was the first military casualty we had after 1975. So what it has done is, it has obviously had a very deep public impact, very major political impact and it has left the relationship profoundly disturbed,” Jaishankar said. Jaishankar said that apart from the Wuhan Summit in April 2018, there was a similar summit in Chenna last year and the idea of the summit was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping spend time, talk to each other directly about their concerns. “What happened this year of course was a very sharp departure. Now it's not just a sharp departure from the conversation, it's a sharp departure over a course of relationship over 30 years,” he said. In response to a question on what did the Chinese actually do on the border and why they did it, Jaishankar said: “I haven’t frankly got any reasonable explanation that I can tell myself from them on this matter. "There are today a very large number of troops with weapons concentrated on that segment of the border and that is obviously a very critical security challenge that we face.” In the special Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) event, Jaishankar was in conversation with ASPI President Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister. The two also spoke about Jaishankar’s new book ‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World.’ Jaishankar said that apart from the Wuhan Summit in April 2018, there was a similar summit in Chennai last year and the idea of these parleys was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping spend time, talk to each other directly about their concerns. “What happened this year of course was a very sharp departure. Now it's not just a sharp departure from the conversation, it's a sharp departure over a course of relationship over 30 years," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chinese-troops-with-weapons-at-lac-in-eastern-ladakh-very-critical-security-challenge-s-jaishankar-902907.html

This is the third time that Air India flights from India have been banned by the Hong Kong government for bringing passengers who tested positive for the infection after arrival. Previous bans were during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31. Vistara's flights are being banned for the first time by the Hong Kong government during the coronavirus pandemic. Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a Covid-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July. Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight Covid-19 test at the Hong Kong airport. "A few passengers who travelled on Delhi-Hong Kong flight of Air India and Chennai-Hong Kong flight of Vistara on Thursday tested positive for Covid-19 post-arrival," the senior government official said. "Consequently, the flights of these two airlines have been barred from October 17 to October 30 by the Hong Kong government," the official added. Besides India, a pre-flight Covid-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and the US, according to the Hong Kong government's rules. An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from any of these nine countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers onboard have Covid-19 negative certificates. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the pandemic. However, the Indian airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July this year. Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. India has formed such pacts with approximately 17 countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hong-kong-bars-air-india-vistara-flights-till-october-30-after-passengers-test-positive-for-covid-19-902921.html

Lobsang Sangay, the ‘Sikyong’ or the President of the TGiE, was hosted by Robert A Destro, whom President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this week appointed as the US Special Coordinator for issues related to Tibet triggering strong protest from China. Though the past US Presidents like H W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush and Barack Obama had hosted the Dalai Lama at the White House in Washington DC, Trump never had a meeting with the icon of the global resistance against Chinese Government’s rule in Tibet. But the US government’s latest move to host the TGiE chief at the State Department just a couple of weeks before the US presidential elections signalled not only a course-correction by the Trump Administration, but also a subtle recognition of the entity, which is elected by the Tibetans living in exile in India, the US and other countries around the world and which is being primed for leading the struggle to free Tibet from China’s occupation beyond the lifetime of octogenarian Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama set up the TGiE – formally called Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) - on April 29, 1959, just a few weeks after he arrived in India following his escape from Tibet, which had been occupied by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in 1950-51. The CTA, which has its headquarters in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, calls itself the “continuation of the government of independent Tibet”. “Today’s unprecedented meeting further strengthens the narrative that the Central Tibetan Administration will be treated akin to other governments by the US State Department, and it is yet another significant win for Tibetans and allies,” said Sangay, who was first elected as the TGiE chief in 2011 and was re-elected to the post in 2016. The US earlier this year for the first time directly provided funds to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile based in India – a move, which also irked China. The Trump Administration’s moves to lend a degree of legitimacy to the TGiE came amid escalating tension between the US and China. The US President, himself, as well as other top officials of his administration has over the past few months launched a tirade against China, slamming the communist country for its belligerence, not only along its disputed boundary with India, but also in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and East China Sea as well as in the Taiwan Strait. Destro’s appointment as the new US Special Coordinator for the issues related to Tibet was strongly opposed by China, which called itself a move by the American Government to interfere in the internal matters of India. Beijing in the past pressed the Government of India hard to shut down the TGiE. New Delhi, however, has been allowing it to function, albeit without officially recognizing it. And, even as the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA are now engaged in a stand-off in eastern Ladakh, New Delhi has given a quiet unofficial nod to the TGiE to hold a global election early next year to let the exiled Tibetans elect a new ‘Sikyong’.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-tacitly-lends-legitimacy-to-tibetan-government-in-exile-hosts-its-leader-in-state-department-902936.html

A comprehensive review of the bilateral cooperation was carried out at a virtual meeting of the India-Chile Joint Commission which was co-chaired by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chilean counterpart Allamand Zavala. Official sources said both sides are also looking at firming up a bilateral investment protection treaty. In 2017, India had expanded its preferential trade agreement with Chile that resulted in boosting of bilateral trade ties. At present, Chile is the fifth largest trading partner of India in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement, said both sides discussed the future trajectory of their wide-ranging engagements in the meeting. "They agreed to add new momentum to the relations of the two countries in the fields of trade and commerce, agriculture, health and social security, defence, space, science and technology, energy, mining, culture and education, disaster management and cooperation in Antarctica amongst others," the MEA said. It said India welcomed Chile's decision to designate India as a priority country in its foreign policy, adding the country will also be opening its Consulate General in Mumbai. Chile has control of a large part of Antarctica and has a very large maritime boundary, having the distinction of being the longest country in the world. The sources said that in addition to discussions on the bilateral investment protection treaty, the two sides also deliberated on further expansion of the preferential trade agreement. They said there was a discussion on export of generic medicines from India to Chile and that an MoU on it is in the final stages. In the meeting, the two sides exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest, especially in the context of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. "The external affairs minister underlined the prime minister's vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' for enhancing resilience through self-reliance and human-centric globalisation as the basis for India's economic revival," the MEA said. It said Jaishankar invited Chile to take advantage of India's new economic capacities and growing market. "Based on their convergence of views on many global and regional issues, both sides agreed to coordinate closely at the multilateral fora," the MEA said. It was the first meeting held under the framework of India-Chile Joint Commission.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-chile-to-add-new-momentum-to-ties-looking-at-firming-up-investment-protection-pact-902939.html

Participating in the 102nd meeting of the World Bank Development Committee Plenary, Sitharaman said the Covid-19 pandemic, which started before its last meeting in April, continues to impact the developing and developed countries. The hard fought gains in reducing the level of poverty, achieved over a number of years, are at great risk of being lost, she added.  The Government of India has taken several measures to contain the spread of the pandemic, and also to mitigate its social and economic impact, Sitharaman said. The government had announced the first stimulus of $23 billion to provide direct cash transfers and food security measures to poor, she said. This was followed by a special economic package of $271 billion -- equivalent to 10 per cent of India's GDP -- based on a clarion call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' or self-reliant India, she pointed out. "Measures have been announced to provide relief to the business, bring about major reforms in the labour sector by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalising 44 central labour laws, provide effective social protection to the migrant workers through National Portability of ration cards," she said, as per a statement issued by the finance ministry. The rural sector has been provided support by way of refinance support through NABARD, injection of additional liquidity of $27.13 billion in the farm sector and by way of increased allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), she said. With regard to strengthening of health infrastructure in the wake of the pandemic, the finance minister said the government has committed $2.03 billion for this. Being a responsible member of the global fraternity, India is ready to share its experience and also play a leading role in the South Asian region as part of its 'Neighbourhood First' policy, she noted. The Finance Minister stated that collective action is the key for effective response to the pandemic and welcomed the strong performance in Q4 of FY 2020 wherein World Bank Group has committed $45 billion for Covid-19 response.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-took-host-of-measures-to-combat-covid-19-impact-nirmala-sitharaman-to-world-bank-902965.html

In the GHI for 2020, India ranks below neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal which are placed at 88th, 75th, and 73rd position respectively. Countries such as North Korea, Rwanda, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone are worse off than India. On the brighter side, India has improved its position in the rankings since last year, when it was placed 102nd in the list of 117 countries. South Asia and Africa South of the Sahara have the worst hunger conditions among global regions, the GHI found. According to GHI 2020 report, India’s overall score is 27.2 which puts it under the “serious” category. As per the report, 14% of India’s population is undernourished. India’s child wasting rate for 2020 stands at 17.3%, marginally better than last year, when it recorded a wasting rate of 20.8%. Child wasting refers to a condition where they have “low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition.” India also recorded a child stunting rate of 37.4%, but marked a reduction in the under-five mortality rates in the country. The GHI is “a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger at the global, regional, and national levels”. Data from the United Nations and other multilateral agencies are used for the calculation. “The GHI 2020 shows that although hunger worldwide has gradually declined since 2000, in many places progress is too slow and hunger remains severe,” the 80-page report said. “The Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, as well as a massive outbreak of desert locusts in the Horn of Africa and other crises, are exacerbating food and nutrition insecurity for millions of people, as these crises come on top of existing hunger caused by conflict, climate extremes, and economic shocks,” the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-ranks-94th-on-global-hunger-index-below-pakistan-nepal-and-bangladesh-902968.html

The state-of-the-art surface-to-surface missile blasted off around 7.30 pm from launch complex 3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur near Balasore and the trial was successful, they said. The last trial of Prithvi-2, carried out after sunset on September 23 from the same base, was also successful. The trial of the missile, which has a strike range of 350 km, was carried out from a mobile launcher, a Defence Research and Development (DRDO) official said. "The missile trajectory was tracked by radars, electro-optical tracking systems and telemetry stations by the DRDO along the coast of Odisha," he said. The missile was randomly chosen from the production stock and the entire launch activity was carried out by the Strategic Force Command (SFC) of the Army and monitored by scientists of the DRDO as part of a training exercise, defence sources said. The downrange teams on board a ship deployed near the designated impact point in the Bay of Bengal monitored the terminal events and splashdown. The Prithvi-2 missile is capable of carrying 500-1,000 kg of warheads and is powered by liquid propulsion twin engines, the sources said. The sophisticated missile uses an advanced inertial guidance system with a manoeuvring trajectory to hit its target, they said. Already inducted into the armoury of Indian defence forces in 2003, the nine-metre tall 'Prithvi' was the first missile to have been developed by DRDO under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/night-trial-of-nuclear-capable-prithvi-2-missile-successful-902970.html

Attacking the Yogi Adityanath dispensation on Twitter, Gandhi also tagged a media report which said that a Dalit girl in Barabanki was allegedly raped before being killed and the victim's family members accused the police of trying to cover up the case. The former Congress chief said that unable to prevent rape, the UP government, instead of getting justice for the victim's family, was again suppressing facts to save the accused. "How many more girls? How many more Hathras (incidents)," he said in a tweet in Hindi. The Congress has been attacking the UP government over the Hathras incident in which a 19-year-old Dalit woman from the district was allegedly raped and attacked by four men. She later succumbed to injuries at a Delhi hospital. The Yogi Adityanath government is fighting severe criticism for its handling of the Hathras case, particularly after the local police cremated the woman's body at night allegedly without the family's approval. However, officials said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family". The probe in the case has been taken over by the CBI.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/how-many-more-hathras-congs-rahul-gandhi-asks-up-govt-902976.html

He showed purported pictures and videos of the burning happening at Baba Vidyapati Marg. Hitting back, the Delhi BJP said a solitary accident happens somewhere and the AAP says that MCDs are burning garbage as a practice. Such allegations are a part of the party's strategy to tarnish the image of hard working civic sanitation workers, it said. Chadha said it is "most unfortunate" that on one hand, the Delhi government has been working tirelessly to come up with solutions for combating Delhi's pollution and is implementing steps for it, but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) couldn't care less. "Right now, in Kirari, which is a residential area where many people live, the MCD, which comes under the BJP, is openly burning garbage. The plume of black smoke you see is not only dangerous, but can be potentially deathly too," he said. "I would like to ask the CPCB and the EPCA how is the BJP openly indulging in this criminal act with rampant impunity? How is the MCD burning garbage with such brazenness," he asked. The Delhi BJP called it a solitary accident. "Today, the Delhi BJP draws attention towards massive dust pollution due to callous working at PWD projects across the city, including at Ashram Chowk, Pragati Maidan and especially Chandni Chowk for which Delhi High Court has shown concern, and demands a reply from the Delhi government on this," the Delhi BJP said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aap-claims-mcds-permitting-open-burning-of-garbage-in-kirari-902979.html

These companies "would be required to align their FDI to the 26 per cent level with the approval of the central government, within one year from the date of issue of this clarification", the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said. In August last year, the Union Cabinet approved 26 per cent FDI (foreign direct investment) under government route for uploading/streaming of news and current affairs through digital media, on the lines of print media. A section of industry players and experts had stated that the move to cap FDI in the digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications. The department said that it had received representations from stakeholders seeking clarifications on certain aspects of this decision. "After due consultations, it is clarified (that) the decision of permitting 26 per cent FDI through government route would apply" to certain "categories of Indian entities, registered or located in India," it said. The categories are -- entities uploading/streaming news and current affairs on websites, apps, other platforms; news agencies which gather, write and distribute/transmit news, directly or indirectly, to digital media entities and/or news aggregators; news aggregators which, using software/web applications, aggregates news content from various sources, such as news websites, blogs, podcasts, video blogs, in one location. It also said that compliance with the FDI policy would be the responsibility of the investee company. The company would also have to adhere to certain conditions such as the majority directors on the board of the firm shall be Indian citizens; the chief executive officer shall be an Indian. "The entity shall be required to obtain security clearance of all foreign personnel likely to be deployed for more than 60 days in a year by way of appointment, contract or consultancy or in any other capacity for functioning of the entity prior to their deployment," it said. It added that in the event of security clearance of any of the foreign personnel being denied or withdrawn for any reasons whatsoever, the investee firm will ensure that the concerned person resigns or his/her services are terminated forthwith after receiving such directives from the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/digital-media-news-aggregators-agencies-need-to-comply-with-26-fdi-cap-902982.html

Hit by unpaid salaries, doctors at North Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and Rajen Babu Tuberculosis Hospital say they are now battling financial and mental stress. Sinha is a senior doctor at 450-bed Kasturba Hospital, which started as Victoria Zenana Hospital, and participated briefly at a joint protest organised by resident doctors of the three facilities at Jantar Mantar on Friday. "We doctors don't want to go on strike,” she told PTI. “It is always the last resort.” “I am a permanent doctor and our association, the MCDA (Municipal Corporation Doctors' Association) had given a call for an indefinite strike from Monday if our demands are not met. At least the resident doctors got salary for July, we haven't got anything, and it is due for the last three months," she said. Sinha, a resident of Janakpuri area in west Delhi, belongs to a family of doctors. Her husband, her 28-year-old son Rahul and daughter Nayanika (26) are all doctors.  "My husband is a surgeon but his clinic has been affected by Covid-19. My daughter is a dentist and based in Singapore. My son has just qualified for MCh examination through NEET. He's hoping to get a government college through counselling as I won't be able to afford now his higher education if he gets to any private institution," she lamented. “The crisis of one generation is percolating to the next,” said Sinha, also the general secretary of MCDA, an association of senior permanent doctors of civic hospitals which was established in 1974, and has about 1200 members. As the crisis over pending salaries of doctors of the civic-run hospitals in Delhi deepens, many medics have expressed their pains, saying they would bravely combat the pandemic situation and serve people but "corona warriors can't march on empty stomach". K P Rewani, a doctor at civic-run Swami Dayanand Hospital and a member of MCDA, said "Without salaries, all our life plans have come to a halt". "Our children's tuition fee, EMI, loan repayment, car loan, house loan, how do we pay these? Do clanging of utensils and showering of floral petals from helicopters feed your family," he asked. “They clapped for doctors, but with no salaries, it all rings hollow now.” R R Gautam, the president of the Municipal Corporation Doctors' Association (MCDA), said, society treats us as Gods, "but, they should accept that we are humans". "As doctors, it is our solemn duty to serve humanity, and we will continue to do so. They call doctors as Covid warriors. But, how long will an army march on empty stomach. Soldiers stationed in inhospitable Siachin, will they be able to fight the adversaries without food supplies?" he asked. Resident doctors of three North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run hospitals, also expressed their anguish, many unable to pay rents, and some "digging into their savings" as a rescue measure. Hindu Rao Hospital resident doctors were the first one to come out in the open for protest after "being sick of their voices not being heard when they agitated online". The facility till a couple of days ago was a dedicated Covid-19 facility. "Are doctors superhumans? Do authorities just expect us to keep working with no salaries, and for how long.

16-10-2020||National Politics||82% of corporate donations to parties in seven years went to BJP: ADR||The BJP appears to be the favourite for corporates when it comes to donations, with the saffron party bagging 82.3% or Rs 2,319.48 crore of the Rs 2,818.05 crore given to national parties in seven years between 2012-13 and 2018-19. In contrast, Congress received only Rs 376.02 crore during these seven years while other national parties -- NCP (Rs 69.81 crore), Trinamool Congress (Rs 45.01 crore(, CPI-M (Rs 7.5 crore) and CPI (Rs 22 lakh) -- got much lesser. Another national party, BSP has declared that it has not received any donation above Rs 20,000, which needs to be reported, while Trinamool Congress was accorded national party status only on 2 September, 2016. The analysis by private election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed that BJP had pipped the Congress in attracting corporate donations even when it was not in power at the Centre. When the Congress-led UPA was in power, the BJP got Rs 72.99 crore in 2012-13, which rose to Rs 156.98 crore the next fiscal. In comparison, Congress got just Rs 7.54 crore, one-tenth of what the BJP received in 2012-13 and Rs 53.51 crore, around one-third the saffron party received in 2013-14.    For the year 2018-19, Rs 876.10 crore, which was 92% of the total donations received, was donated by all the corporate and business houses to BJP, Congress, Trinamool Congress, NCP and CPI(M), the ADR report said. While CPI reported that it did not receive any corporate donations, BSP said it did not receive any donation above Rs 20,000, which needs to be reported. Donations from corporates to National parties increased by 131% from the period between 2004-12 to 2018-19. In the last fiscal, BJP received Rs 698.08 crore from 1,573 corporates, which was 94% of the Rs 742.15 crore it received as donations. Congress was a distant second with Rs 122.5 crore (82% of Rs 148.58 crore) from 122 such donors. Trinamool Congress got Rs 42.98 crore from one donor while NCP got 11.34 crore from 17 donors and CPI(M) 1.18 crore from 62 corporate or business houses. CPI received Rs 1.59 crore as donations but none from corporates. Progressive Electoral Trust was the top donor to BJP, Congress and Trinamool Congress in 2018-19. The Trust donated three times in a single year to the three parties each, amounting to a total of Rs 455.15 crore. Of the Rs 876.10 crore donated by the corporates to five national parties, Rs 20.54 crore was received from the unsegregated category, which includes companies with no details available online or whose nature of work was unclear. "A total of 319 donations through which National parties received Rs 31.42 crore do not have address details in the contribution form. National parties have received Rs 13.57 crore from 34 donations which do not have PAN details in the contribution form. Rs 13.33 crore or 99.75% of such donations without PAN as well as address details worth Rs 13.36 crore belong to the BJP," the report said. Also, it added. 341 donations amounting to Rs 20.54 crore were corporate entities which have zero internet presence or if they do there is ambiguity about the nature of their work. "Contact and address details of most of these companies were unavailable in cases where they were visible online," it added. In its recommendations, the ADR said all donors who have donated a minimum of Rs 20,000 as a single or multiple donations should provide their PAN details. Such incomplete contributions reports must be returned to the parties by the Election Commission, to deter them from providing incomplete information. Corporates should make details of their political contributions available in the public domain through their websites (in annual reports or in a dedicated page) for increasing transparency in political financing. "Annual scrutiny of donations reports of National, Regional and unrecognised parties should be initiated by a dedicated department of the CBDT, to discourage donations from shell companies or illegal entities," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/82-of-corporate-donations-to-parties-in-seven-years-went-to-bjp-adr-902658.html

Enlisting a slew of pro-farmers measures by his government in Uttar Pradesh, the Chief Minister said his government ensured the crop procurement without any disruption due to the coronavirus lockdown. Addressing an online CII event, Aityanath pointed out that over 100 sugar mills functioned successfully in Uttar Pradesh following all anti-Covid precautions and protocols. The Chief Minister said as the Rabi crop in UP got ready for harvesting amid the lockdown, the state government set up 6,000 procurement centres to help farmers sell their produce and these centres functioned successfully adhering to all precautions. He said these centres procured 36 lakh metric tonnes of wheat. For the Kharif crop too, 4,000 procurement centres have been established, he noted. In the next four years, the state government has also decided to build over 5,000 godowns at the grassroots level to store farm produce, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farmers-welfare-uttar-pradesh-governments-top-priority-yogi-adityanath-902713.html

Paswan's statement came on a day when he was excoriated by Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, who called the LJP leader a "vote Katua" (splitter of votes) and accused him of trying to create confusion by harping on his equations with senior leaders of the saffron party. "The prime minister lives in my heart....I am like his Hanuman. If they (his critics) want, they can prise open my heart and see that. I don't need to use the prime minister's photograph," Paswan said. Paswan, who led his party out of the NDA in Bihar and is contesting alone, was recently warned by senior BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, of legal action if his party were to use the prime minister's photograph for the election campaign. "The chief minister (Nitish Kumar) needs his (Modi's) photograph more, he needs to share the dais with the prime minister as he had consistently opposed him on the issue of Article 370, instant triple talaq, CAA, and NRC. "One thing I make clear today that I was, I am and will be with the BJP in the future too. It's my resolve to form a BJP-LJP government in Bihar after November 10, the day the election results are announced," he said, with his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan's photograph forming the background. Paswan faced stinging criticism from Javadekar who said, "We want to make it clear that we have no relations (with LJP), and we do not like this politics of spreading confusion." Other senior BJP leaders, including party general secretary Bhupender Yadav, too hit out at Paswan. Yadav accused Paswan of practising "politics of lies", saying he had been praising the Bihar government in February this year. "Chirag should not either live in illusion or nurse any illusion or spread illusion," Yadav tweeted. Javadekar said BJP's alliance in Bihar is with JD(U), Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM(S), and Vikassheel Insaan Party, asserting the NDA combine will win a three-fourth majority in the state. The LJP is nothing more than "vote katua" and it will not be able to make much impact, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/chirag-paswan-claims-he-is-modis-hanuman-bjp-calls-ljp-leader-vote-katua-902800.html

The former Congress President tagged a graph of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) GDP projections for several countries in the neighbourhood, with India’s economy expected to contract by 10.3%, the highest among the group. “Another solid achievement by the BJP government,” Rahul said. Another solid achievement by the BJP government. According to the IMF, the Indian economy is expected to contract the most – 10.3% – among countries such as China, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Afghanistan. However, the IMF said India is expected to bounce back with 8.8% growth rate in 2021, to reclaim its position of the fastest-growing emerging economy. Rahul has been sniping at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a range of issues from women’s safety, handling of the economy, to the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Congress party also sharpened its attack on the Modi government claiming that it did not have any strategy to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are number two as far as infections are concerned and our death rate is twice that of our neighbours like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered the suspension of the sub divisional magistrate (SDM), circle officer and all other policemen present at the spot in Durjanpur village in Ballia's Reoti area, police said. Jai Prakash (46) was shot dead allegedly by Dhirendra Pratap Singh after the SDM decided not to go ahead with the meeting due to a dispute between members of self-help groups, Superintendent of Police Devendra Nath said. Bairia MLA Surendra Singh confirmed that Singh heads the BJP's ex-servicemen's unit in Ballia district. "This is a casualty that can happen anywhere. In this incident, there was stone-pelting from both sides. The law will take its own course in the matter," the BJP legislator said. Police registered an FIR naming four and mentioning 15-20 unnamed people on the basis of a complaint filed by Chandrama, the victim's brother. There was no immediate arrest. The meeting was held in a tent, where a large number of people gathered. The administration and police officials were also present there, local residents said. "Taking a serious note of the incident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed that the SDM, CO and all police personnel present at the spot be suspended immediately and strictest action taken against the accused," Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said in Lucknow. He said the role of the officers will be investigated and if they are found responsible criminal action will follow. A sizeable police force has been deployed in the village to maintain law and order, the Ballia SP said. Meanwhile, opposition parties, including the Samajwadi party and the Congress attacked the ruling BJP as they called the incident an example of "breakdown" of law and order in the state. "This is an example of breakdown of law and order in the state. In the presence of senior administration and police officers, a BJP leader shot dead a man in Ballia. Is this the model our CM Yogi Adityanath is giving to the state?" SP spokesman Sharvendra Bikram Singh said. "In Ballia, an incident has come to the fore in which in front of SDM and circle officer, a BJP leader after killing Jai Prakash Pal managed to flee," the Samajwadi Party said on Twitter. The Congress also attacked the ruling BJP, saying that it was "shameful” and “unfortunate" that someone kills in front of senior officials. “The incident of Ballia is shameful and unfortunate. Killing in front of officers and the accused conveniently fleeing is serious matter. CM talks of taking action, but when will he sent his own partymen behind the bars and take action against senior officers?” Congress media coordinator Lalan Kumar said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) demanded lodging of an FIR against the officers present at the spot during the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-leader-in-up-allegedly-shoots-man-dead-at-meeting-on-ration-shop-allotment-902585.html
16-10-2020||North and Central||Supreme Court seeks K K Venugopal's assistance on orders trivialising victim's trauma in sexual assault cases||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Attorney General to decide, if a court can issue a direction like accused should get 'Rakhi' tied on his hand by the victim as a condition of bail in sexual offences, trivialising the trauma suffered by her. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and B R Gavai sought the assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal, as senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, representing a group of woman lawyers, contended such orders objectified the victims. The counsel contended the High Court should not have put such weird conditions for bail, which was against the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The plea was filed under extraordinary situation against a Madhya Pradesh High Court's order of July 30, but there have been instances of such orders from other states, he said. The court agreed to examine the matter on November 2. The women lawyers had approached the court asking it to set aside the Madhya Pradesh High Court's direction to a rape accused to get 'Raksha Bandhan' tied by the victim as a condition for bail. In their plea, they said it has been seen in sexual assault cases, women and families do not seek redressal from the criminal justice system primarily to avoid such kind of secondary trauma that they are subjected to in the process of a criminal trial. They asked whether High Court ought not to have employed circumspection and sensitivity while dealing with a case involving a sexual offence and also related to wrongful entry into the property of the victim. The lawyers led by Aparna Bhat said imposing a condition where the accused would be required to go to the house of the complainant on the festival of 'Raksha Bandhan' and request her to tie a rakhi around his wrist with the “promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come” resulted in further victimisation of the survivor in her own house. They challenged the validity of the Madhya Pradesh High Court's order of July 30 by which the accused was also told to pay Rs 11,000 to the complainant as customary ritual and seek her blessings and pay Rs 5,000 to her son for the purchase of clothes and sweets. "While it is routine for courts to award certain compensation to survivors of sexual offences to be paid by the accused, it is highly objectionable for the High Court in the present case to put the complainant in a position where she is forced to accept the sum of Rs 11,000," they said. They further pointed out that the present case was of particular concern since it took years to undo the damaging approach followed by courts whereby cases involving sexual offences committed against women were attempted to be compromised by way of marriage or mediation between the accused and the survivor.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/supreme-court-seeks-k-k-venugopals-assistance-on-orders-trivialising-victims-trauma-in-sexual-assault-cases-902644.html

Ranveer, Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Guwahati Central Police District, issued an order on Thursday asking the landlords not to rent out accommodation to any person until he/she furnishes his/her particulars to the officer-in-charge of the police station concerned. "Reports received that due to the situation prevailing in the area of Central Police District, Guwahati, it is apprehended that terrorists/anti-social elements may seek hideouts in the residential area of the said police district. "There is every likelihood of breach of peace and disturbances of public tranquility and also there is likelihood of grave danger to human life and safety and injury of public property on that account," it said. The order, however, did not specify the "prevailing situation" in the Central Police District of Guwahati. "It is necessary that some checks should be put on landlords/tenants so that terrorists/anti-social elements in the guise of tenant may not cause explosion, riot, shootout, affray, etc., and that immediate action is necessary for the prevention of the same," the order said. People dealing in properties were also asked to furnish details of the tenants to the OC of the police station concerned.

16-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi residents worry about toxic mix of pollution, Covid-19||Families in Delhi with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma are stocking up on oxygen cylinders and pulse oximeters, fearing that the city's worsening air quality will make them more vulnerable to the coronavirus. After months of relatively clean air because of a lockdown imposed to fight the virus, pollution levels have spiked to their worst in two years for October, caused by farmers burning crop stubble in surrounding states and cooler weather. On Friday, haze hung over the capital of 18 million people and the air quality level was at 235 on a scale of 500. Rupesh Gupta, 45, who has recovered from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, said he was an asthmatic and having difficulty breathing the city's dirty air. "I am neither able to walk, nor get out of the house. Even if I try and get out of the house, it takes me an effort to breathe," he said. He lost his mother to Covid-19, so his anxiety levels are high. "There is paranoia that you never know from what source we might get infection again in our home," his wife, Neelam Gupta, told Reuters at their residence in a congested west Delhi suburb. The family has bought a 15 kg oxygen cylinder for emergency use and a portable pulse oximeter to measure oxygen levels in the blood each day. They are also keen to stock up on air purifiers that most well-heeled families own in Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has remained in the "very poor" category all week due to slowing wind speeds that allow deadly pollutants such as PM2.5 particles to remain suspended in the air. "Air pollution will weaken the respiratory tract, lung functions will be compromised. The probability of catching Covid-19 would increase substantially," said Vivek Nangia, principal director and head, Max Super Speciality Hospital in New Delhi. India is behind only the United States in terms of coronavirus cases, touching 7.37 million on Friday. Delhi is one of the hot spots of the disease, with 3,21,031 cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-residents-worry-about-toxic-mix-of-pollution-covid-19-902754.html
16-10-2020||North and Central||Decision to reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients temporary: Delhi govt to HC||The Delhi Government Thursday told the Delhi High Court that the policy decision directing 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for Covid-19 patients was taken as a stop-gap and temporary measure with an intent to mitigate the surge of coronavirus cases in the national capital. The government defended its decision and opposed a plea challenging the September 13 order, directing all the private hospitals having bed strength of 50 or more to reserve at least 80 per cent of their total ICU bed strength for Covid-19 patients. In an affidavit filed before Justice Navin Chawla, the AAP government vehemently denied that the decision, which was stayed by the high court on September 22, was in violation of any fundamental right of the citizens of Delhi and termed the petition by 'Association of Healthcare Providers' as wholly misplaced and baseless. The high court granted one week time to the petitioner association, which claims that the 33 private hospitals against whom the order was passed are its members and sought to quash the order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, to file rejoinder to the government’s affidavit and listed the matter for further hearing on November 18. The government has already challenged the single judge’s stay order before a division bench which has listed it for hearing on November 27. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the government, said there is a prediction that in the upcoming festive season, the number of Covid-19 cases will go up. The affidavit, filed through additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Urvi Mohan, contended that the petitioner association was looking to secure the financial interests of its member hospitals, under the garb of expressing masked concerns over securing healthcare facilities for non-COVID patients, to be able to levy arbitrary and exorbitant medical treatment fee and other such charges from critical COVID-19 patients. “The act of the answering respondent (Delhi government), being that issuing the GNCTD Order, is a policy decision, that had been implemented, as a stop-gap and temporary measure, with the intent and objective to mitigate the surge in the Covid-19 cases in the NCT of Delhi,” it said. It also referred to various judicial pronouncements saying it is settled law that courts will ordinarily exercise restraint while dealing with a challenge preferred to a policy decision of the State. It said it is not the domain of the court to embark upon the uncharted ocean of public policy in an exercise to consider as to whether a particular public policy is wise or a better public policy can be evolved and such an exercise must be left to the discretion of the executive and legislative authorities as the case may be. The Delhi government said several other states like Maharashtra and Odisha have also taken similar steps and put in place similar measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. “On account of the Covid-19 pandemic graph taking an alarming rise nation-wide and also impacting upon the cases in the national capital, the Government of the NCT of Delhi has been adopting a hands-on dynamic approach for the management and mitigation of this disaster,” the affidavit said. It said since certain private hospitals have been the preferred choices of patients, it has been found that they hardly have any free and available ICU beds for COVID-19 patients and there is a section of the society including those with health insurance, CGHS, DGHS and ECHS beneficiaries who prefer admission in private hospitals despite availability of beds in the government sector. It was found that many such patients were made to wait for long hours/ days prior to their admission due to non-availability of COVID-19 ICU beds as a result of which their condition deteriorated, it said. The government said when the emergency meeting was convened by it on September 12, out of 33 private hospitals, 25 participated in it and none of them raised any protest or objection to the decision of the authorities to reserve the ICU beds. Almost all of the 33 hospitals also started implementing the government's order with immediate effect, it claimed, adding that order only covers 33 private hospitals and nursing homes, out of over 1150 private nursing homes and hospitals across the city. It said no patient, suffering from a critical illness other than Covid-19, has objected to the government’s order or complained of having been deprived of necessary medical treatment. “The alleged violation of fundamental right to life of one class of persons (being non- Covid patients, none of whom have come before the court alleging such a violation), cannot be given primacy over the fundamental right to life of critical COVID-19 patients,” especially when the government order is only a stop-gap and temporary arrangement, to cater to the present and dynamics rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases, it said. The government said the petition is an attempt to seriously imperil its pandemic management efforts and actually jeopardises the interests of hundreds of Covid-19 patients who have availed of the benefit of the order and secured ICU beds in private hospitals, at capped rates. It said the stay on the operation of the government’s decision, which has been granted to the petitioner, further leaves such patients at the mercy of these private hospitals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/decision-to-reserve-80-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients-temporary-delhi-govt-to-hc-902766.html

16-10-2020||North and Central||AAP govt responsible for 95% Delhi air pollution: Adesh Gupta||Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Friday claimed that crop stubble burning accounts for only five per cent of air pollution in the city while local factors contribute to the remaining 95 per cent for which the Arvind Kejriwal government is to be blamed. Gupta said the BJP-ruled municipal corporations in the city are "battling air pollution at the forefront" and alleged that the Delhi government is busy with publicity only. No immediate reaction to the claims and allegations made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was available from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). "In Delhi, crop stubble burning accounts for 5 per cent air pollution. Rest 95 per cent of pollution is due to local factors for which the Delhi government is answerable. It should tell what steps it has taken so far to tackle pollution," Gupta said in a joint press conference with three mayors of the party-ruled municipal corporations. The mayors elaborated on the steps taken by the three corporations to tackle air pollution. Gupta also alleged that the Delhi government is hampering work of municipal corporations by depriving them of due funds. A total of around Rs 13,000 crore is pending so far that the Delhi government has to pay to the three corporations, he claimed. "We just want to ask the Delhi chief minister if his government is concerned only about publicity," Gupta said. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash said the civic body has deployed 130 sprinklers that cover over 600-km roads every day to mitigate dust pollution. "Jet machines to clean trees; plantation of thousands of shrubs and plants on central verges of road and teams to check open garbage burning are other steps taken for reducing pollution," he said. East Delhi Mayor Nirmal Jain said a special chemical is mixed in water used by 40 sprinklers that keep dust settled for longer period of 8-10 hours as compared to plain water. "We are working on the ground to tackle pollution but have received no help from the Delhi government. It announced to pay us Rs 310 crore but gave just Rs 94 crore," Jain claimed. South Delhi Mayor Anamika Mithilesh said water is being sprinkled on roads under jurisdiction of the civic body with the help of 83 sprinklers while over 700 km of roads are swept daily to tackle dust. Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 251 at 10 am on Friday. The 24-hour average AQI on Thursday was 315, which falls in the 'very poor' category. The city's average AQI on Thursday was also the worst since February 12 (AQI 320).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aap-govt-responsible-for-95-delhi-air-pollution-adesh-gupta-902779.html

Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said that there is a need to open more colleges and universities in Delhi to provide higher education opportunities to students. "Around 2.5 lakh students in Delhi pass class 12 board exams every year and of them, only 1.25 lakh get admission in city colleges," Kejriwal said. He said that there are 91 colleges and institutes affiliated to Delhi University, while IP University, which offers professional degrees, has 127 colleges and institutes. He said that under Section 5(2) of the DU Act, new colleges established in the city will have to be affiliated to Delhi University. In the last 30 years, DU has not given affiliation to any new college, Kejriwal claimed, adding that it may be due to its full capacity. Kejriwal said he has requested the Union Education Minister for amending Section 5(2) of the DU Act so that more colleges and universities can be established in the city. Earlier this week, Delhi University had announced its first cut-off list for undergraduate admission with Lady Shri Ram College pegging the aggregate score at 100 per cent for three Honours courses. The 100 per cent cut-off for undergraduate admissions in Delhi University comes after a gap of five years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/arvind-kejriwal-seeks-amendments-in-delhi-university-act-for-establishing-new-colleges-902784.html

16-10-2020||North and Central||Resident doctors of NDMC hospitals protest at Jantar Mantar||Resident doctors of a few North Corporation-run hospitals, who are currently agitating over their pending salaries, held a joint protest at Jantar Mantar here on Friday to press for their demands. Wearing masks, doctors from Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and Rajen Babu Tuberculosis Hospital, held placards and raised slogans. Representatives of their RDAs said no resolution seems to be in sight on the issue, so the protest is taking place at Jantar Mantar. "Many doctors have already gathered, and more will be joining from other NDMC hospitals too. At 6 PM, we will hold a candle light march from Jantar Mantar to India Gate. We want our due salaries," said Abhimanyu Sardana, president of RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital. The members of the Resident Doctors' Association of the Hindu Rao Hospital have been protesting for the past several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking release of salaries due for the past three months. Since Wednesday, resident doctors of the Kasturba Hospital are on a week-long strike over their pending salaries too. "The RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital stands in solidarity with the RDA of Kasturba Hospital and RDA of Rajen Babu TB Hospital in the ongoing agitation on the grounds of non-payment of salaries for almost four months. We cumulatively would like to state that there hasn't been any resolution to our issues regarding the aforementioned," the RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital had said in a statement on Thursday. "Therefore, we all North MCD residents would like to join hands on a common platform to demonstrate our agitation validating our affliction with the administration due to strict non-compliance" it had said. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash in a tweet late Wednesday night had claimed, "Today, salaries released of all doctors, nurses, paramedics and group C and D staff and for the rest, it will be released soon."

16-10-2020||North and Central||Baroda bypoll: BJP, Congress, INLD candidates file nomination papers||BJP nominee and Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt, Congress candidate Induraj Narwal and the INLD's Joginder Singh Malik on Friday filed their nominations for the high-stakes bypoll to Baroda assembly constituency, slated for November 3. While the BJP announced Dutt's candidature on Thursday night, the Congress and INLD declared their candidates hours before the nominations for the bypoll were to close on Friday. The bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda in April. Dutt had contested the seat unsuccessfully last year when the state assembly polls were held. The scrutiny of nomination papers will be conducted on October 17. Withdrawal of papers will be allowed till October 19. Polling will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will take place on November 10. The candidates filed their nominations before the returning officer at Gohana in Sonipat. Kapoor Singh Narwal, who was an aspirant for Congress ticket, has jumped into fray as an Independent, spicing up the contest. Talking to reporters after filing the nomination papers, Dutt said the voters of Baroda constituency have made up their mind that they will cast their votes on the basis of development work done in the state. Dutt, whose candidature is backed by the BJP's coalition partner JJP, said his main objective is to serve people of Baroda constituency, which falls in Sonipat district. He thanked the party leadership for reposing faith in him. Replying to a question if caste factor will play a role in the bypoll, with the Congress and the INLD announcing candidates from the predominant Jat community, Dutt said, "The BJP does not believe in caste politics. When I got about 38,000 votes during the state assembly elections last year, it was not from one or two castes. All sections of society supported me." "People will vote for the BJP and we will win. My single aim is to serve people, four years of the term of this government remain and we will further accelerate development work," he said. The wrestler-turned-politician, who hails from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonipat district, had joined the BJP in 2019 ahead of the state assembly polls. He had lost to Krishan Hooda by less than 5,000 votes. Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan and several senior state BJP leaders accompanied Dutt to the nomination centre. On Baroda being considered a Congress stronghold, BJP MP from Sonipat Ramesh Chander Kaushik said, "If that was the case, B S Hooda would not have lost the Sonipat LS seat last year. Now, it is not about bastions, but about development and people vote for that." Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state Congress chief Kumari Selja, party senior leaders Kiran Choudhary and Deepender Singh Hooda, who accompanied Induraj Narwal for his nomination, exuded confidence that their party would retain the seat. The Congress has fielded former Sonipat Zila Parishad member from Baroda, with B S Hooda saying that the party gave ticket to a "grassroots worker from a farmer family." Hooda and Selja claimed that people of Baroda had wanted the candidate to be a local and dedicated party worker. "This is not just an election to elect an MLA for one seat, but a fight for the honour of Baroda and the future of Haryana. The Congress stands with the common man, the farmers and the workers in this fight against the BJP-JJP government," Hooda said. INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala claimed that the Baroda seat may have been won by late Krishan Hooda for three consecutive terms in the past, but that was "not with big margins" and "people of the constituency have always been with us". "We had won this seat in 2005 when the Congress had returned to power (with overwhelming majority)," Abhay Chautala said, adding that "the BJP candidate will lose his security deposit while the Congress will also be rejected by the people". The INLD's Joginder Singh Malik had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly elections from Baroda on the party ticket.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/baroda-bypoll-bjp-congress-inld-candidates-file-nomination-papers-902867.html
16-10-2020||North and Central||Plea filed in Supreme Court against law taking over temples in Uttarakhand||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against a Uttarakhand High Court's judgement rejecting a petition against a 2019 law that set up a Devasthanam Board to manage 'Char Dhams', including Badrinath and Kedarnath in the state. NGOs 'People for Dharma' and 'Indic Collective' filed separate petitions against July 21, 2020 judgement that dismissed a petition filed by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy. The petitions settled by advocate J Sai Deepak and filed by advocate Suvidutt M S contended that the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act of 2019 was violative of the fundamental rights of millions of devotees of the 'Chhota Char Dham' shrines and in particular the communities that have their hereditary and religious rights invested in these temples. Two main temples-- Shri Badrinath and Shri Kedarnath had been under as per existing legislations since 1939 and the state legislature had more than an opportunity for the betterment of any mischief in the secular aspect of their management. "The new Act merely expands the powers limitlessly without differentiating between the secular or religious character of the activities that are being interfered with," they contended. The Act that appoints the Chief Executive Officer without stating any mismanagement and for unreasonably indefinite period usurped the rights of the 'Santani Hindus' and in particular the communities that have traditional hereditary rights of appointment and management of shrines, they added. The petitioners said the High Court failed to appreciate that Article 26 (right to establish religious institutions) is a special right created to protect the rights of denominations and sects within a community but does not preclude the general right of the communities or devotees under Article 25 (right to practice religion) of the Constitution, i.e. to establish and manage their religious institutions in pursuance of their right to practice their religion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/plea-filed-in-supreme-court-against-law-taking-over-temples-in-uttarakhand-902884.html

"The coming together of mainstream regional parties of J&K to fight a constitutional battle to restore the rights of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh is a development that must be welcomed by all the people of India," he said on Twitter.

The decision to this effect was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. "Keeping in view the broad objectives of the special festival package for central government employees and the scheme for making advance payments for it, the state government has approved proposal to implement it for state government employees also," an official statement issued here said.  "This facility will be given to all employees of the state government and will remain in force till 31 March 2021. Under this scheme, an advance special festival package of Rs 10,000 will be sanctioned by the Head of the Office to the government employees concerned before any important festival, which will be interest-free. With the implementation of the scheme, the state government will incur an expenditure of about Rs one thousand crore rupees," the statement said. A special festival package for central government employees and advance payment allowance has been implemented by the Centre to enable festival-related expenditure. The state cabinet also decided to allow special cash package in lieu of LTC (leave travel concession) facility for state government employees. The cabinet has approved the proposal to implement it for the state government employees, keeping in view the broad objectives of the plan to allow a special cash package in lieu of LTC facility for Central Government employees also. This facility will be admissible to those employees of the state government who are eligible to avail this facility under the LTC pre-issued government orders till March 31, 2021 and who are willing to get special cash package in lieu of this facility, it said. "To make the benefit of this arrangement permissible, the concerned employee can be paid 50% of the LTC's deemed rental amount in advance to the employee's bank account, which can be adjusted to him on submission of the purchase voucher of the goods," the statement said. The rules of income tax will apply to the amount of special cash package allowed in lieu of LTC, in the same way as payment of rental of LTC. Implementation of the scheme will incur an expenditure of about Rs 960 crore on the state government. A special cash package has been decided by the Centre in lieu of LTC facility for its employees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-govt-approves-special-festival-package-advance-payments-to-state-employees-902909.html

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted bail to Mohd Sagir, and Mehtab on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of like amount in each of the two cases related to vandalism and torching of vehicles during the riots in Jaffrabad area. The court said in its order passed on October 14, “The present case was registered on the complaint of the complainant Wasim Khan who stated that he had parked his vehicle on February 24, 2020, and when he returned on February 25, 2020, at 8.00 am, he found that parking had been burnt including his vehi­cle. He is not an eye­witness to the incident.” It noted that Sagir was arrested on the basis of CCTV footage and his disclosures in another case, in which he was arrested earlier. It also said that Mehtab was also arrested in the case based on his disclosure in another matter. The court directed them not to tamper with evidence, not to leave the jurisdiction of Delhi or indulge in any criminal activity. During the hearing, Sagir's counsel said that there was no cogent evidence against the accused in any of the two cases except for an alleged CCTV footage wherein he is alleged to have shown standing with bare hands along with other persons.  His lawyer further argued that the complainant in his complaint, nowhere stated that he can identify the persons who had participated in the riots, but suddenly he was identified on April 24 at the police station which was not believable. Mehtab's counsel argued that he was not part of any unlawful assembly nor was he making any slogan or instigating and leading the mob during the riots. Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, opposed the bail pleas, saying Sagir and Mehtab can be seen in the CCTV footage indulging in riots. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-two-persons-902923.html
16-10-2020||North and Central||Digvijaya Singh ran Kamal Nath govt from behind curtains: Madhya Pradesh BJP chief||Madhya Pradesh BJP chief V D Sharma on Thursday accused senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh of running the previous Kamal Nath-led government in the state "from behind the curtains". He also dared state Congress chief Kamal Nath to rope in Digvijaya Singh to campaign for the upcoming bypolls to 28 Assembly seats scheduled on November 3. "Kamal Nath was the chief minister...but it was Digvijaya Singh who was running his government from behind the curtains. But where is he now ahead of the bypolls?" Sharma asked. "Kamal Nath should rope in Digvijaya Singh, on whose instructions he was running the government. Why is he scared of involving Digvijaya Singh in electioneering?" he asked. Asked about Congress-turned-BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia's name being placed below those of several other leaders in the BJP's list of star campaigners for the bypolls, he said, "Scindia is getting importance like our senior leaders in the party." MP Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta, however, hit back at Sharma and said that Digvijaya Singh never ran a proxy government in the state. "Instead, Sharma should clear the strong impression from people's mind that Home Minister Narottam Mishra is running the present government in the state," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/digvijaya-singh-ran-kamal-nath-govt-from-behind-curtains-madhya-pradesh-bjp-chief-902974.html

16-10-2020||North and Central||'Gupkar alliance' formed on Pakistan, China directions, won't let it succeed: J&K BJP||The BJP in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday alleged that the "Gupkar alliance" has been formed on directions of Pakistan and China and guided by "anti-India" forces, and warned that the alliance partners will have to face serious consequences for any "misadventure". Mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday held a meeting and formed the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration for the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state as it existed before August 5 last year and also to initiate a dialogue between all stakeholders in the issue. To focus on the political developments in Kashmir and formation of the alliance, the BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit convened a meeting of its senior leaders and heads of various social and religious organizations in Jammu on Friday. "Gupkar alliance has been formed on the direction of Pakistan and China. The Gupkar alliance is being directed and guided by anti-national forces", Jammu and Kashmir BJP chief Ravinder Raina told reporters here. Raina said the formation of the alliance by the NC and the PDP under the Gupkar agenda "is an agenda of anti-national forces that want to destabilize the situation in the Kashmir valley". "We will never ever allow the agenda of the Gupkar alliance to be implemented in J&K and allow it to succeed," he said. The J&K BJP president warned these alliance partners that if any misadventure is carried out and any "anti-national" agenda is carried forward, they have to face serious consequences. "We will not tolerate it. At no cost their nefarious designs will be allowed to succeed," he said. Raina said that after the abrogation of Article 370, the common mass in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh jumped for joy because Article 370 did criminal injustice with the common people of Jammu & Kashmir. He said that a conspiracy is being hatched by Abdullah Parivar and Mufti Parivar against the Country and we will not tolerate this anti-National move. "The alliance formed by Abdullahs and Muftis has nothing to do with the betterment of the people of J&K. they are just dancing on the tones of Pakistan and China and demanding the restoration of the Article 370 which is next to impossible because it did criminal injustice to common mass in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh'', Raina said. He said, "Article 370 will not be implemented till doomsday. It doesn't matter how much cry Abdullahs and Muftis make" He further said th Article 370 had given birth to separatism and terrorism and also tried to develop Pakistanism in J&K, which gave rise to terrorism in which thousands of innocent people got killed. He said that Pakistan and China are carrying on atrocities against the people living in Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK), Gilgit, Baltistan, Eastern Ladakh and Shaksgam Valley. "We will not tolerate anyone who tries to instigate the people of Kashmir against India," Raina said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gupkar-alliance-formed-on-pakistan-china-directions-wont-let-it-succeed-jk-bjp-902995.html
16-10-2020||Opinion||If US Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett were Muslim||Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, has faced immense scrutiny of her religious beliefs, and we need to be vigilant against any religious bias or discrimination. But I marvel at the hypocrisy of Republicans who are expressing shock and outrage over this, after the way the right has treated Muslims. President Trump responded to the alarm over Judge Barrett’s nomination by accusing Democrats of bias against Catholics and “basically fighting a major religion in our country.” This is rich from the man who is running against Joe Biden, a Catholic; who promoted a Muslim ban; and who told America, “I think Islam hates us.” On Monday, the first day of the Senate hearings on Judge Barrett’s nomination, Josh Hawley of Missouri accused his Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of attacking Judge Barrett for being “too Catholic to be on the bench.” He is apparently living in the Twilight Zone, because this didn’t actually happen. Mr Biden went out of his way to say Judge Barrett’s faith shouldn’t be considered a factor in her hearing. I can’t help wondering: How would Republicans behave if Judge Barrett were a Democrat whose strongly held religious beliefs came from Islam instead of Catholicism? We all know how it would go. Republicans would demand she prove that she was not “working with our enemies.” That’s what Glenn Beck, the conservative radio host and conspiracy theorist, called for when Keith Ellison was elected as the first Muslim to Congress. They’d probably use her faith to accuse her of hoping to create a “Shariah state” through judicial activism. That what conservative bloggers did in 2011 when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey nominated Sohail Mohammed, a Muslim originally from India, for a seat on the Superior Court of Passaic County. If Judge Barrett wore a hijab, Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host, would question whether her religious beliefs were in opposition to the Constitution. That’s the ugly accusation Ms Pirro levied against Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota in 2019. The scrutiny of Judge Barrett’ to the People of Praise religious community — which opposes abortion, gay rights and marriage equality, and which believes that men are leaders of their families — has been intense. It’s fair to debate whether that kind of scrutiny is reasonable, and concerns that Judge Barrett has faced bias because of her religious beliefs are understandable. What is clear, though, is that if a little-known Muslim group made headlines in connection with the nomination of a justice, Republicans wouldn’t have the same concerns about religious bigotry. For example, former People of Praise members told The Associated Press that women in the group are expected to obey their husbands and provide sex on demand. If Judge Barrett were Muslim, these former members would probably be invited to appear on “Fox & Friends” to give voice to their concerns about the judge’s regressive stances. Judge Barrett co-wrote a 1998 law review article about themoral and legal “bind” that death penalty cases might present Catholic judges. What if she had been Muslim and had written about Muslim judges instead? Would Ben Carson call her “schizophrenic?” In 2016, that’s how he described Muslims who embrace American values like democracy and the separation of church and state. Earlier, in 2015, Mr Carson wrote in a Facebook post, “I could never support a candidate for president of the United States that was Muslim and had not renounced the central tenant of Islam: Shariah law.” That happens to be the same year Judge Barrett signed an open letter to Catholic bishops saying, “We give witness that the church’s teachings — on the dignity of the human person and the value of human life from conception to natural death; on the meaning of human sexuality, the significance of sexual difference and the complementarity of men and women; on openness to life and the gift of motherhood; and on marriage and family founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman — provide a sure guide to the Christian life, promote women’s flourishing, and serve to protect the poor and most vulnerable among us.” If she were Muslim and had made these statements, Republicans would no doubt smear her as a woman oppressed by a barbaric Islamic culture that promotes misogyny. It’s easy to imagine all of this, because it all comes from the playbook that has been used to attack Muslim elected officials, many of whom are in fact archetypes of moderation and secularism compared with Judge Barrett. I am not critical of Judge Barrett’s nomination because of her Catholicism. I am deeply sensitive to religious bigotry and stereotypes. I’m a practicing Muslim living through an administration that campaigned for a Muslim ban. My community has endured two decades of hazing after the Sept. 11 attacks, and our loyalty is still deemed suspect. I would never wish that kind of judgment on a person of another faith. Like most Americans, I am worried that Judge Barrett will use her seat to advance an extreme agenda that will be detrimental to the interests of a majority of people in this country. We fear that, if confirmed, she’ll help the religious right drag equal rights and progress back 50 years. One thing is certain: If the Notre Dame law professor and darling of the religious right were Muslim, she would have had a much harder time becoming a judge, let alone a Supreme Court justice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/if-us-supreme-court-nominee-judge-amy-coney-barrett-were-muslim-902569.html
16-10-2020||Opinion||Beyond same-sex marriage: The right to parent||While the Delhi High Court is hearing a petition that seeks marriage equality for same-sex couples, the Russian government is cracking down on gay men who have become parents through surrogacy. What is the connection between these developments? The former is concerned with the extension of “legal rights and social benefits that flow from the institution of marriage” to all individuals without discrimination based on sexual orientation. The second is an attempt to stoke anti-gay sentiments by linking “non-traditional sexual orientation” with child trafficking so that single men can be denied the “right to have children.” In his book The Pink Line: Journeys Across the World’s Queer Frontiers (2020), author Mark Gevisser writes of “those places increasingly integrating queer people into their societies as full citizens” and “those finding new ways to shut them out now that they had come out into the open.” His analysis is helpful when used to understand how the world is not moving in a singular direction. The freedoms and anxieties fuelled by globalisation are shaped by multiple factors such as grassroots activism, electoral politics, cultural gatekeeping, international funding, and the circulation of ideas via the internet. I believe it is futile to classify countries into boxes such as ‘queer friendly’ and ‘not queer friendly’. Countries that are proud of being inclusive must look within, and acknowledge the multiple exclusions that go unaccounted. While the reading down of Section 377 has paved the way for petitions to legalize same-sex marriage in India, what seems missing is a dialogue around the rights of LGBTQIA+ people who desire single parenthood but not coupledom or marriage. What would it mean to delink the right to parent from the right to marry? In 2019, the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy published a digital resource called Queering the Law. Authored by Akshat Agarwal, Diksha Sanyal and Namrata Mukherjee, it states, “The body of family law governs institutions which regulate our most intimate personal choices. Family law governs significant personal relationships which have a bearing on the ways in which caretaking responsibilities, entitlements, benefits and obligations are distributed. Yet, like most laws, the body of family law privileges opposite gender, monogamous, conjugal relationships.” Why is the institution of marriage so central to how family is conceptualised? How can individuals who wish to stay unmarried because they are asexual or polyamorous or unable to find compatible partners fulfill their dream to be parents? If they want the primary relationship in their life to be the parent-child bond, and not their commitment to a wife or husband, why must they invest in a marriage that they are not interested in? These questions are important for LGBTQIA+ people who reject marriage because of its patriarchal history as an institution that not only allows marital rape but also reinforces gender stereotypes, perpetuates homophobia, and controls inter-caste relations.  In his article titled An ‘official’ family: Laws of Parenthood in India (2017) for Firstpost.com, Saptarshi Mandal, who teaches at the Jindal Global Law School, writes about the Juvenile Justice Act amended in December 2015 “to provide that a single male could not adopt a girl child.” According to him, this provision is based on “the fear of sexual abuse of female children by adoptive fathers.” He wonders about the rationale behind restrictions placed on single men in adoption law “when the criminal law prohibiting sexual abuse of children acknowledges that abuse can be perpetrated by both men and women.” I draw on Mandal’s critique to envision the barriers that might come up when LGBTQIA+ people advocate for the right to parent as distinct from the right to marry. Deeming them unsafe for children to interact with is a tactic to deprive them of the experience of parenting. He writes, “What about the possibility of sexual abuse of male children by single fathers? Further, adoption of female children by married couples only, does not rule out possibilities of abuse, since every study on the subject points out that children are as vulnerable to sexual abuse within the family as they are outside. Clearly, sexual paranoia obliterates reason.” It seems that India and Russia have much in common. In 2018, after the Law Commission of India (LCI) prepared a report on the Uniform Civil Code, a group of queer-feminist activists including Chayanika Shah, Minakshi Sanyal, Maya Sharma, Rituparna Borah, Rumi Harish, Deepti Sharma and Jaya Sharma sent written recommendations to Justice Dr. B S Chauhan. Their response has been digitally archived by Orinam, a Chennai-based collective of LGBTIQA+ people and allies. It is a valuable document to revisit because it speaks for the rights of people who do not identify within the gender binary of man/woman. It also serves as a reminder of ‘the right to found a family’ articulated within the Yogyakarta Principles on Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics (2007, 2017).   (Chintan Girish Modi is a writer, educator and researcher who tweets @chintan_connect)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/beyond-same-sex-marriage-the-right-to-parent-902587.html
16-10-2020||Opinion||Online shopping the pandemic away? There's a better way||By Teresa Ghilarducci  You probably want to buy something. To be sure, online shopping is up. And over the last six months, income-secure households have spent more on sporting equipment (up 29% from last year) and beer, wine and liquor stores (up 22%). But the urge to buy something doesn’t go away. So, if you’re one of the lucky people with a job, enough to eat and a place to live, what should you buy in a pandemic? First, buy a picture frame. Now print out a bank statement showing you saved money. Put it in the picture frame. Make saving the new status good — flaunt it like a golf club. The bottom line is that both robot and person will probably tell you the same thing: Save more. Look, I know that getting advice to save more has roughly the same effect as advice to eat less. The point here isn’t to produce shopping-shaming to go along with fat-shaming. If the pandemic has you, at last, in the fortunate position of having some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket, consider yourself lucky — and save up. Orient your pandemic buying to those things that may add to your security and savings. Buy a cushion, not a crutch.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/online-shopping-the-pandemic-away-theres-a-better-way-902930.html
16-10-2020||Panorama||The political economy of America two weeks from Election Day||Weeks before Americans vote for their next presidential election, a lot of news and noise chatter has been created in what has now become one of the most polarised, divisive American elections ever. The outcome of this election will have serious ramifications for the very nature (and future) of what remains of the ‘liberal-democratic’ international order. We attempt here to discuss some of the key factors that are likely to influence American voters. Our focus here is mainly on non-committed or swing voters (estimated to be 24% of the total electorate).  According to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in August, the ‘most important issue’ for American voters in the election seems to be the ‘state of the economy’. The second most important issue, but by a considerable margin, is the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Let’s study the facts on the first issue. According to the US bureau of labour statistics, unemployment rates were falling at a national level until the pandemic forced state-wide shutdowns. Data on employment across different ethnicities provide a critical picture. So far, unemployment rates for White voters (Trump’s largest electoral base) have dwindled significantly, i.e., from 14.2% in April to 7.3% by August. The unemployment rate for other ethnic groups -- Blacks, Hispanics and Asians -- persist at 13%, 10.5% and 10% respectively. The average GDP growth during the last three years of Barack Obama’s second term was 2.48% as compared to 2.42% during Trump administration (before the pandemic). While a high growth rate is expected to benefit an incumbent President, a consistent trend in growth during Trump’s tenure as President could bend a swing voter’s preference in his favour. Annual trends in real median household income of workers from 2013 appeared to be growing steadily under Trump’s presidency, especially after 2018. Again, while growth in this parameter picked up during the last years of the Obama presidency, there has been a steady acceleration of that growth under Trump. The breakdown of income growth across income-classes or bottom-quintiles, however, indicates a different picture. If one looks at the nominal wage growth of non-farm workers under Trump, one can see a 2.14% average growth rate for nominal wages of workers seen during the last three years of the Obama presidency, while this has been around 2.88% under Trump. Healthcare Record According to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre, about 68% of the electorate thinks that issues around healthcare are critical. About 27 million Americans stand the risk of losing their employer-sponsored insurance now, making healthcare and its financing one of the most important issues this election. The number of uninsured in the United States have continued to drop, largely due to the broader success (and access of) Obamacare, which Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden promises to expand upon. But, despite ‘Obamacare’, or formally the Affordable Care Act (ACA), not being up for appeal till 2019, the number of non-elderly uninsured increased between 2016 and 2018. This is the first time since 2010 that this trend is seen to be on the rise in the United States. This can perhaps be traced to Trump’s removal of fines imposed on the uninsured and successive dilution in the compliance regime imposed by Obamacare on private insurance companies.  America’s economic performance under Trump can further be deconstructed by seeing the results of two major policy decisions of his administration: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Trade-Tariff Protections. The American trade deficit remains quite high. While Trump’s popularity among voters might have increased with the rhetorical sloganeering of ‘America First’, during his presidential term, he hasn’t been able to fundamentally re-order the trade deficit volume. He did reduce the US trade deficit with China from about $419 billion in 2018 to $345 billion in 2019, by demonstrating more of a stick-than-carrot approach against the Chinese through tariff threats. However, this didn’t make American manufacturers better off. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the largest overhaul of tax structure in the past three decades. It did reduce the individual income tax rates for most of the tax slabs but the major beneficiaries of the move were big corporations, who had absolute federal tax slashed from 35% to 21%. While tax cuts may have had a positive impact on the wage growth rates for certain non-farm sectors, the record and trends for (rise in) private investments -- as a consequence of the announced tax cuts -- isn’t consistent, nor a reason to celebrate. Private corporate investments could also not rise at the expected rate because of the proliferating trade war between US and China, triggering waves of business uncertainty across global supply chains that connected the US and China in one way or another. X-Factor: The pandemic The coronavirus pandemic as a black swan X-factor has changed all odds and pushed the narrative against Trump’s re-election hopes. The dismal response to the current pandemic has brought into focus thepre-existing shortcomings of the American healthcare system. Trump’s earlier attempts at diluting Obamacare, his lack of clarity on any alternative Medicaid (plan) haven’t sent encouraging messages to the electorate. The economic fallout of the pandemic has also done serious damage to the ‘economic legitimacy’ gained during Trump’s first three years.  As of now, it looks like -- if this is a fair election with all votes counted -- the average American swing voter is set to swing Donald Trump out of the White House and vote Joe Biden in.   (Deepanshu Mohan is Associate Professor of Economics and Director, Centre for New Economics Studies, O P Jindal Global University; Samarth Gupta is a Research Analyst with the Centre for New Economics Studies)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/the-political-economy-of-america-two-weeks-from-election-day-902547.html
16-10-2020||Panorama||The pink tightrope||I carefully gathered the flare of my clothes and stooped down to inspect the third bottle of sanitiser from the lower rack of a fumigated store. The stench of disinfectant made me dizzy. I could not settle for anything with less than 60% of ethanol. My painstaking Google research, after all, had to be put to good use. I have been fastidious with diapers and rash creams too, typical of most urban mothers. My ‘supermom moments’. However, now I am too anxious and disturbed to savour this inconsequential obsession. The Hathras victim was no less a daughter. My angst is fuelled for the umpteenth time by macabre images of a family not powerful and upper-caste enough to claim its dead. Shopping cannot distract a conscience or silence or guilt. A naive effort. My N-95 mask made me flinch at the thought of being gagged, of losing not just my voice but my tongue, too. The lump in my throat got bigger. Though the dolorous Hathras episode will soon be expunged from the media to make room for Bihar’s ballot boxes and the horse-trading circus, it will continue to ghost our psyche and forever linger in our hearts. Nirbhaya can never be forgotten. Kathua was never distant. If only our scars had not numbed us but fired our rage. The collective reaction to crime, rape or otherwise either works as a deterrent or emboldens budding rogues. If only we were angry enough to scare them. We grieved, shrivelled, and took cover, allowing them to strike again with unpardonable monstrosity.  A rape every fifteen minutes, with 90% going unreported and a very poor conviction rate, indicts an entire nation. This is not a women's issue but a human and universal one. Placards should have changed hands to be held not just by feminists but men and women alike. The Hathras girl lost not just to her gender, but to her caste and class. Her story made me miserable. Its denial and cover-up made me furious. The connivance of the police and administration dishonours an entire population. What are millions of impressionable minds (exposed to the media) to make of such a fiasco? By not handling it with the enviable fervour of decoding Bollywood drug parties, we end up desensitising an entire generation to crimes against women. Today, rapes run the risk of going the groping and eve-teasing way... sexual violations that have fallaciously lost their gravity. Even a rapist is not bashed up like the eve-teasers of yesteryears. As a society, if we do not address the easy access of our children to sexual content and pornography, aren’t we guilty of being partners in crime? My helplessness getting the better of me, I dashed to the billing counter and embarrassed myself yet again with the pinkness of the stuff I bought. Can someone like me who enjoys the luxury of affording painless vaccinations share her pain? I want to reach out to her. How? On my drive back home, my eyes searched for posters of protests and candle marches. None. Isn’t it scary that from Nirbhaya to the Hathras girl, our reaction to gangrapes is relegated from street protests to mere drawing-room regret? I shall not lose hope because movements like charity should begin at home. The fact that casual conversations of children are peppered with sexual escapades from the neighbourhood or out of a movie warrant a proactive involvement. Sexual memes of classmates going viral speak volumes of the rot. The rise in child sexual abuse by insiders and outsiders alike is propellant enough. The key lies in not just teaching my daughter to stand her ground but also in teaching my son to lower his gaze. In sanitising our hearts along with our hands, we can surely make a difference. No worries. Unlike ethanol, less than 60% sensitivity can also get us start.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/the-pink-tightrope-902548.html
16-10-2020||Panorama||As global barriers rise, China's Xi seeks 'atmanirbhar' market||When China first opened to overseas investors, the country was desperate for foreign technology to revive its growth. Now, as China faces rising global barriers, its leader, Xi Jinping, is urging greater domestic innovation. Xi delivered this message Wednesday while making an anniversary pilgrimage to the southern city of Shenzhen, which in 1980 was established as a “special economic zone” next to the global financial hub of Hong Kong. Shenzhen quickly became an incubator for “reform and opening up,” the strategy championed by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping that paved the way for the country’s decadeslong economic takeoff. Forty years later, Xi said China still welcomed foreign investors, but he also said it must prepare for a less welcoming world. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the rise of barriers to the free flow of goods and technology, Xi said, a theme that he has stressed recently. “The world economy is at low ebb, and international trade and investment have drastically shrunk,” Xi said to a conference hall packed with officials and guests wearing protective masks, in a speech that was promoted heavily by the Chinese news media. Xi did not refer directly to the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict Chinese companies’ access to U.S. technology amid escalating tensions between the two countries. Instead, Xi broadly warned that “the world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation.” Shenzhen’s experience, he said, showed that China must “gain the initiative in the global technological revolution.” China is striving to revive its economy and repair its international standing amid the coronavirus pandemic, which began late last year in the central city of Wuhan. The pandemic has driven negative views of China to new heights in the United States and other wealthy democracies, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center that was published last week. Xi is also trying to quell jitters about Hong Kong, the semi-autonomous Chinese territory where a sweeping security law was recently imposed in response to tumultuous anti-government protests last year. Xi’s speech in Shenzhen gave a likely preview of a Communist Party leaders’ meeting late this month, when he will lay out China’s economic strategy for the next five years, including harnessing more domestic innovation and consumer spending. Xi pledged to make Shenzhen a proving ground for upgrading China’s economy and strengthening innovation, citing plans to step up spending on technology research. He stressed Shenzhen’s importance in a regional economic initiative that also encompasses Hong Kong, a strategy that could enhance Chinese influence over the former British colony and underscore its reduced importance for Beijing. Xi’s speech and other comments during his trip this week to Guangdong province, which includes Shenzhen, have also underscored his effort to redefine China’s decades-old strategy of “opening up.” Past leaders stressed drawing in foreign capital and technology to help China catch up; Xi wants to shift the balance by taking Chinese technology, investment and power to the world. “We’re experiencing a transformation the likes of which hasn’t happened for a century,” Xi said Monday while visiting a factory in Chaozhou, another coastal city in Guangdong. “We must take the road toward a higher level of self-reliance.” Officials have already spent years trying to shift Shenzhen from low-end industry to high-tech design and manufacturing. Xi wants to wean China off foreign suppliers for crucial components, such as silicon chips, and the city is a part of those plans. Shenzhen is home to the headquarters of big Chinese tech firms such as Huawei, one of the world’s biggest smartphone sellers. The United States has imposed several restrictions against Huawei in the past year, deeming the company a security threat, a claim that the company denies. “This is a new spin using Shenzhen to say, ‘We can be economically strong, we can be technologically innovative, we can be socially progressive — on Chinese terms,’” said Juan Du, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong and author of a recent study, “The Shenzhen Experiment.” “A lot is riding on this for Shenzhen to be able to set an example for other cities in China,” she said. “Shenzhen’s importance to the national psyche is far greater than just its economic importance.” But China remains greatly dependent on imported technologies, especially semiconductors, the brains of all electronic devices. Despite billions of dollars in state support, Chinese chipmakers are still far behind rivals in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States. The Trump administration is threatening to block Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China’s most advanced chip manufacturer, from using U.S. software and equipment out of fear that its products are used by the Chinese military, which the company denies. The technology involved in chip production is fiendishly complex to master, making it difficult for Chinese companies to easily catch up with foreign makers. “The Chinese government is pretty much aware that technology, by and large, comes from the private sector,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University. Shenzhen and its tech companies, he said, are “very much part of this effort to leapfrog and catch up with Western countries in high-tech.” Xi’s vision of Shenzhen as a base for China’s rising technological prowess carries extra resonance because his father, Xi Zhongxun, was an official who helped to establish the region as a scrappy boomtown. After former Communist Chairman Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, a surge of people fled to Hong Kong, and Xi Zhongxun, then the party secretary of Guangdong, hoped zones like Shenzhen would help revive the economy and stanch the departures, said Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University in Washington who is writing a biography of the elder Xi. The younger Xi mentioned his father indirectly in his speech, citing him only as an unnamed provincial leader. Hong Kong investment and expertise were crucial to Shenzhen’s rise in the 1980s, but Xi’s speech Wednesday showed the financial hub’s reduced role in China’s ambitions. The officials applauding Xi in Shenzhen included Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who is charged with enforcing the draconian new national security law. Earlier this week, Lam abruptly postponed her annual policy speech to avoid it coinciding with Xi’s visit to Shenzhen. “It shows again that Hong Kong is a kind of appendage to mainland China,” Cabestan said. Xi also used his speech in Shenzhen to vow a bigger role for markets, but Chinese entrepreneurs and economists have expressed skepticism about his commitment. Since coming to power in 2012, he has stressed that the party must keep a tight grip on the economy and that state companies must dominate key sectors of industry. Last month, the Chinese party announced plans to extend its role in private businesses. Xi’s visit to Shenzhen did not signal any shift from his established economic course, said Deng Yuwen, a former editor for a party newspaper who now lives in the United States. “I think the propaganda pitch has been set this high this time to try to shift the outside world’s view saying that China is not reforming and is closing itself off,” Deng said by telephone. “Oftentimes, what action you take is not the same thing as in the propaganda.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/as-global-barriers-rise-chinas-xi-seeks-atmanirbhar-market-902549.html
16-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Coronavirus: Don’t let the mask slip||Up until March this year, the only people one spotted wearing masks apart from surgeons were transplant patients and monks of a certain sect. Covid-19 has changed all that and masks are now a standard fixture in our wardrobes. A few weeks ago, my daughter decided to go grocery shopping as soon as the supermarket opened. She made a quick dash armed with gloves, hand sanitiser and a mask. She picked up the stuff, breezed out and drove herself back home. As she stepped out with her bags, her spectacle lenses got fogged. Not wanting to touch anything she quickly hurried up to the front door, missed a step and sprained her ankle. While some people are complaining that masks make it difficult to breathe, masks fogging spectacles and leading to mishaps is not uncommon.  “The easiest thing in such situations is to remove the spectacles for a couple of minutes and vision should clear up," says Dr Girish Shiva Rao, President, Medical Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya. What many of us may not know is that the N-95 surgical masks used by health care professionals afford a customised fit, eliminating fogging. The surgical three-ply masks have a plastic clip on the nose bridge that can be pressed down.  Fashion-conscious women complain that they are forced to go without lipstick and now focus solely on eyewear, it won’t be long before masks become a style statement. From ikkat masks to brocade ones for weddings and home-made cloth masks with rubber bands to elastic edged ones that go over the ears, the designs are constantly evolving. And to think that initially, people used old vests and inner-wear to make the most basic of masks.  While the debate to mask or not to mask is losing steam, remember there is a lot you can do with masks. You can have identical masks for the family, use them for brand promotion and to send out messages (in the US they are urging people to vote while a Madurai restaurant came up with mask parottas). You can also design fun masks that can spread cheer around, which is just what the doctor ordered!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/coronavirus-don-t-let-the-mask-slip-902546.html
16-10-2020||Second Edit||Free all political prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir||People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti’s release from preventive detention on Tuesday night was long overdue. Like other J&K leaders, including National Conference leaders Farooq and Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba was taken into preventive custody on August 5, 2019, hours before the Narendra Modi government announced the abrogation of Article 370, revoking J&K’s special status. Mehbooba spent a total of 14 months and eight days in custody. Throughout this period, the Modi government has been silent with regard to the reasons for detaining her and other Kashmiri leaders and booking them under the draconian Public Safety Act. It gave no explanation for its reluctance to free Mehbooba even after it had freed other leaders such as the Abdullahs and Sajjad Lone. Likewise, no explanation has come with regard to her release now. Only a fortnight ago, in response to a petition filed by Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija, the Supreme Court had ordered the J&K administration to explain why the former continued to be kept in custody. Clearly, the government had no valid or legitimate explanation to give the court. Hence, it decided to free her before the next hearing was to take place this week. The Modi government may have escaped the embarrassment of a rap on the knuckles by the Supreme Court on the matter, but it is not off the hook yet. At least two dozen petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the revocation of Article 370 are still pending before the apex court. The judiciary must rule on these petitions immediately. The court’s ruling in this matter is important and keenly awaited. While most Kashmiri leaders have been released, thousands of activists and ordinary civilians continue to languish in jails. They must be freed immediately. Their detention was illegal in the first place, and there is no justification to continue to hold them in incarceration. If the government is interested in moving forward in Kashmir, it will have to first free those in chains and talk to them and hear what they have to say about the change the government has made on paper. Releasing all those jailed since August 2019 is the necessary first step. It should be followed up with a dialogue and revival of political processes in J&K. The road ahead is not easy as Kashmiri disaffection is understandably high. The contemptuous manner in which the Centre has treated Kashmiris, their elected representatives and the question of Kashmiri autonomy will not be easily forgotten. Still, India can and must reach out to Kashmiris and work with them to restore the fractured bond between New Delhi and Srinagar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/free-all-political-prisoners-in-jammu-and-kashmir-902543.html

The agency submitted that the order creates a serious roadblock in the investigation of the case in connection with allegedly receiving funds from a foreign sponsor for construction of dwelling units in Thrissur district. The CBI said because of the stay order the agency is unable to collect the files of the LIFE Mission and also from the state government relating to the case. In its order dated October 13, the single bench of the high court had granted the interim stay on a plea by Life Mission CEO U V Jose challenging the registration of the FIR by the central agency against unknown officials of Life Mission. The Court, however, had allowed the CBI to continue its probe initiated against the Managing Director of Unitac, a private firm which has been awarded the contract for construction of the houses in Wadakkanchery Municipality. In the petition for early posting of the case for hearing and its disposal, the CBI on Thursday said it was also unable to summon and question officials, government servants and people acquainted with the facts of the case and therefore the stay order creates serious roadblocks in the investigation. "Besides the case is one that requires judicial settlement of important and seminal questions of importance. The CBI is ready and willing to address arguments as soon as possible. The subject matter of the case is relating to the interests of the state," the agency said in the petition. The CBI said serious investigation has to be undertaken to unearth the deeper conspiracy in the case. "So the interim order has to be vacated in the interests of justice.This court has already said that larger questions are involved in this case and required to be determined. The CBI is ready to argue the whole case and the continuation of the interim stay order is against interests of justice," the agency said. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint by Congress MLA Anil Akkara alleging violation of the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) in acceptance of funds from a UAE aid agency for executing the housing project for the poor. Akkara, representing Wadakkancherry constituency, in his complaint with the CBI's unit here contended that acceptance of funds by Unitac Builders and Developers and Sane Ventures LLP from Red Crescent, the UAE-based aid agency, with the 'concurrence' of the LIFE Mission, a Kerala government agency, was illegal and in violation of FCRA provisions. Based on the complaint, an FIR was registered by the CBI, for offences under Indian Penal Code Section 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) read with Section 3 of the FCRA against Unitac Builders and Developers Managing Director Santosh Eappen, Sane Ventures LLP and unknown officials of the LIFE Mission Kerala and others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cbi-files-plea-seeking-to-vacate-stay-on-probe-against-life-mission-ceo-902534.html
16-10-2020||South||Cinema halls continue to remain shut in Andhra Pradesh||Cinema halls and multiplex screens remained shut in Andhra Pradesh though the Centre permitted them to reopen to half capacity from Thursday under Unlock 5.0. Film exhibitors made it clear that they could not resume shows given the various constraints, primarily the steep maintenance costs. Besides the financial burden, the other major issue that is deterring exhibitors from resuming business is the lack of new movies for screening. As film shootings did not happen for more than five months now due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, no major Telugu movie is lined up for release immediately. Films of top stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun and Prabhas are expected to hit the screens only in January next year for Sankranti festival. "Shootings haven't picked up yet and they may pick up speed only if the cinema halls reopen. But it will take some time for new films to release," noted producer-director Anil Sunkara told P T I. But, the exhibitors say they have a whole set of problems to re-open cinema halls. "The state government should first waive the power charges that are due. Though the Chief Minister promised to waive the charges during a meeting with film industry heads recently, relevant orders were not issued so far," Andhra Film Exhibitors Association president K S Prasad said. He said the exhibitors were discussing the issue with Information and Public Relations Minister Perni Venkataramaiah. More than 500 cinema theatres in the state could not pay the power bills in the last six months due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, though the government levied only minimum charges. Each theatre had to pay a minimum of Rs 4 lakh a month as power charges. The total dues amount to about Rs 12 crore, the Exhibitors Association Secretary Gorantla Babu said. The Association leaders said there were other issues because of which cinema halls could not be reopened. "Each theatre has to spend at least Rs 4 lakh for implementing Covid-19 rules. Coupled with other expenses, we need to spend at least Rs 10 lakh a month to re-open theatres," they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cinema-halls-continue-to-remain-shut-in-andhra-pradesh-902535.html

Inaugurating through video conference the 1,261st greenhouse set up here by the Haritha Kerala Mission, he said though the target was to construct 1,000 greenhouses, it was an achievement that 1,261 had been set up in an area of over 454 acres. "Greenhouses are our great contribution to future generations. Every year, more greenhouses should be set up in this manner and it will be possible with the cooperation of local bodies and the people," he said. Thousand more greenhouses are to be established. If there is no public space, interested persons should be encouraged to put up greenhouses in their place, according to Vijayan. Each greenhouse was set up by selecting plants suitable for each area. The first greenhouse containing rare herbaceous plants was established at Vengode, Pothencode, in Thiruvananthapuram with the help of the botanical garden at Palode. In some places, there were only bamboo shoots and in the backwaters and beaches, mangroves and allied trees were planted in the greenhouses. The stalks have expanded and green stems have come creating a visible change in the habitat in the last one year. The greenhouses of the mangroves in Kumarakom have made a positive difference to the fishing ecosystem there. The plants are maintained for three years as part of the project, he said. CPI leader and MLA C Divakaran planted a tree-sapling at the 1,261st greenhouse at Nedumangad block in Thiruvananthapuram district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/make-kerala-carbon-neutral-through-greenhouses-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-902537.html

Virtually sounding the bugle for the Assembly elections due next April-May, AIADMK top leaders O Panneerselvam and K Palaniswami said, "2021 will be a very important year for all of us." On the eve of the party's foundation day celebrations, the duo, in a letter to party workers, recalled the electoral success reaped by party founder M G Ramachandran and late supremo J Jayalalithaa and emphasised hard work to reprise victories. Panneerselvam and Palaniswami are coordinator and co-coordinator of AIADMK respectively. "Let us make the historic achievement of AIADMK remaining in the seat of power during its golden jubilee celebrations," they said and exhorted cadres to start work right from today. Jayalalithaa had vowed in 2015 that the party would be in power during the centenary celebrations (2016-17) of party founder leader MGR (1917-87) and she fulfilled her vow, they said and wanted party workers to take a similar pledge to see the party in power during its jubilee fete. Hailing the sacrifices of scores of cadres since its inception,Palaniswami and Panneerselvam said, "Let us start a new journey towards the golden jubilee year. Let us take a vow for continuance of the golden rule of the party." The AIADMK was founded on October 17, 1972 by its iconic leader Ramachandran and the golden jubilee celebrationis due between 2021 and 2022. Popularly known as MGR, Ramachandran became the Chief Minister in 1977 and was in power till his death in 1987. The AIADMK won two Assembly elections back to back in 2011 and 2016. During 1991-96 and 2001-06 also, the AIADMK was in power.

The inscription on the Badagas says, "Traditionally buffalo herders, recently there is a strong trend back to farming with particular attention to organic farming." On the Badaga language, the inscription says, "Badaga language (Badaga) is part of the Dravidian language family." One of the world's primary language families spoken by over 200 million people in the south, central and north India, the IBA president Ayyaru told reporters here. Welcoming the inclusion of the community in the UN Mountain Partnership, he said it was a big international- level recognition for Badagas, which has more than five lakh population in the district. Mountain Partnership is a United Nations alliance of partners dedicated to improving the lives of mountain peoples and protecting mountain environments around the world. Founded in 2002, it has more than 400 members, including international organisations, major private sector organisations and NGOs and 60 governments, including India, and is currently preparing an international database of indigenous peoples and a detailed global map to identify who are the indigenous and local mountain communities and where such communities live. Indigenous Mountain Peoples are defined by the UN on the following criteria: How long they have been living in a specific territory, their cultural distinctiveness, including exclusive language, social organisation, religion and spiritual values, modes of production, laws and institutions; self-identification as well as recognition by other groups or by state authorities as a distinct community and a history of struggle and exploitation, their continued inhabitation, at least part of the year, on a mountain, their continued use of traditional food systems around mountain ecosystems and their clear connection to a particular mountain or range, he said. Based on these criteria, the Nilgiri Documentation Centre (NDC), a local research body, with nearly four decades of work, submitted the case of the Badagas of Nilgiris for inclusion in the Worlds Indigenous Peoples database with necessary supporting evidence and documents. The UN Mountain Partnership has accepted the application of the NDC and included the Badaga community in their database of worlds indigenous peoples, Ayyaru said. Ayyaru, along with community leaders, met the district collector Innocent Divya and handed over a copy of UN letter to her. She welcomed it by saying she was also happy for getting the international recognition for the community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadus-badagas-now-in-un-database-of-worlds-indigenous-people-902729.html

While the average monthly sale of biocapsules was 400, during May this year it reached 4,000. The sales during May to August was 6,000. Apart from Kerala, farmers from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Northeast states including Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura are using the biocapsules. IISR director Dr Santosh J Eapen said that biocapsules would help in maintaining soil fertility and productivity as well as in improving soil quality and environment quality. It would also ensure successful delivery of biologically competent beneficial microbes. "During the lockdown, there has been considerable spurt in household vegetable cultivation. Grow bag cultivation of ginger and turmeric also witnessed a spurt. One capsule can be diluted using 100 to 200 litre water based on the microorganism present in the capsule. Four thousand capsules is equivalent to 4000 kg talc-based formulation of microorganisms. As one capsule weighs only one gram, a farmer can easily replace four ton of formulation with four kg capsules," said Eapen. The biocapsule developed by IISR, which is an agency under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, uses miro organisms like Trichoderma, Pseudomonas and Bacillus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/surge-in-farming-activities-during-lockdown-reflects-in-spike-in-biocapsule-demand-902749.html

The incident occurred in Khammam town on September 18 after the girl, a domestic help in the man's house, warded off his attempt to rape her. "She died on Thursday night while undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Hyderabad," Khammam commissioner of police Tafseer Iqbal told PTI on Friday. He said some of the Sections under the Indian Penal Code under which the accused was booked would be altered. He said Section 307 (attempt to murder) would now be altered to Section 302 (murder). Though the incident took place on September 18, police came to know about it on October 5 after she was admitted to a private hospital here for treatment of burns. On the day of the incident, the man had tried to molest the girl and she resisted it. He then doused the girl with petrol and set her ablaze, police had earlier said,adding she suffered 70 per cent burns. The Telangana State Human Rights Commission (TSHRC) on its own took cognisance of media reports about the incident and sought a report from the Khammam police. The Commission pointed out lapses on the part of the private hospital where the girl was initially treated without informing the police, and even her family. It posted the matter to November 6.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-tribal-girl-set-on-fire-for-resisting-rape-dies-in-hospital-902755.html

While the Nationalist Congress Party is concerned about losing the Pala Assembly seat in Kottayam district, Revolutionary Socialist Party (Leninist) is upset as the party is yet to be formally inducted into the Front despite its lone MLA backing the Left Front over the last five years. The NCP has already reiterated that it would not make any compromise on the Pala seat even as Jose K Mani keeps on reiterating that his party is emotionally attached to the Pala seat as his father and Kerala Congress (M) leader K M Mani represented the constituency for five decades in a row till his death last year. NCP state president T P Peethambaran Master and present Pala MLA Mani C Kappan said that so far there has been no suggestion from the Left Front for giving up the Pala seat. Jose K Mani, who held talks with Left Front senior leaders including CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Friday also maintained that there has been no talks on seats yet. There were reports that CPM wooed the Jose K Mani faction by offering the Pala seat as it hopes to make inroads into Christian votes banks of south and central Kerala. Meanwhile, RSP(L) demanded that the party should be formally made part of the Left Democratic Front. The lone MLA of the party, Kovoor Kunjumon, wrote to the CPM state secretary that being a party that is backing the LDF over the last five years, they should be also inducted soon. Son-law too eyes Pala seat K M Mani's son in law and former IAS officer M P Joseph has expressed his desire to contest for the Pala seat as a Congress candidate in the 2021 Assembly polls. Joseph flayed the decision of Jose K Mani to join the Left Front.

After constituting a committee to prepare the party’s manifesto, the DMK has lined up a series of meetings with district functionaries to discuss the strategy to be adopted for the crucial assembly elections. The party has convened meetings of office-bearers of the party units at district, union, town, and area levels from October 21 in Chennai. Except Chennai, office-bearers from 32 districts have been asked to attend meetings to be held in phases. Dividing the state into four zones – West, South, East and North – the party has allotted one day for each zone for the meetings to be chaired by DMK President M K Stalin. The meeting was scheduled only for the West zone comprising six districts, originally AIADMK stronghold, to devise the election strategy but the party on Friday announced office bearers from other zones will also be invited for the meetings. Office-bearers from west will meet Stalin on October 21, South (Oct 23), East (Oct 27), and North (Oct 28). “The strategy to be adopted by the DMK will be discussed at the meeting. Since they have called office bearers at all levels, this meeting assumes significance as the elections are just seven months away. We are likely to be asked about issues being faced in districts and how to reach out to the people,” a district secretary told DH on condition of anonymity. DMK, which has been out of power in the state for 9 years now, is unwilling to take chances and has begun election work seven months before the elections. On Sunday, the party constituted an 8-member committee to prepare the election manifesto and asked inputs from people for the same. The zone-wise meetings are also expected to ask party workers to give inputs to the manifesto committee and ensure that problems of their areas are conveyed to the panel when they visit districts. “I think the meeting will also discuss manifesto preparation. In general, it is about elections and its preparations,” a senior leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-gears-up-for-2021-assembly-polls-calls-meeting-of-party-functionaries-902820.html

Alleging that those accused in the case are "hand in glove" with the people in power, Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Kerala BJP leader V Muraleedharan said that the state government was making efforts to destroy evidence. Mentioning a fire incident in a government department, the Union Minister said that it was the handiwork of people in power to destroy the evidence allegedly linked to the case. "The moral authority of the chief minister is lost. The BJP has been demanding, the people of Kerala have been demanding that the chief minister should resign owning moral responsibility of the whole incident," he told reporters here. Alleging that Vijayan has been changing his stand on the matter from the day the case was registered, Muraleedharan said that the Left government in the state had first asked the Centre to order a probe into the matter and has now moved court against the CBI, claiming that agency does not have the authority to investigate. "This shows that those involved in smuggling gold are hand-in-glove with those in power," he alleged, adding that this case is distinct from other cases of gold smuggling because it is "directly" linked to the chief minister's office. The principal secretary to the chief minister has been suspended as well, he added. The Union minister noted that the case relates to the seizure of 30 kg of gold in Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5 after the precious metal was found camouflaged in diplomatic baggage.

As many as 59 persons were chargesheeted on Friday, which included the office bearers of the temple, organisers of the festival and workers involved in the fireworks. Revenue and police officials were spared from the charge- heet despite strong allegations of lapses in preventing the illegal firework. Police sources sought to justify this citing that departmental actions were being initiated against the officials. The mishap occurred on April 10, 2016, during the annual festival of Puttingal Devi Temple at Paravur, about 25 kilometres from the Kollam city. An illegal firework competition between two groups of the locality resulted in the major explosion as the entire stock of explosives stored illegally burst all on a sudden. Apart from claiming 110 likes, over 350 suffered injuries and many houses even within several kilometres around the temple were seriously damaged. Concrete block of the building in which the explosives were stored was thrown several kilometres away in the impact. There were allegations that revenue and police official did not prevent the illegal firework due to political pressure. A judicial probe into the tragedy had found lapses on the part of the police and revenue officials. However, police and revenue officials are made witnesses in the case. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also visited the mishap spot.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/four-years-after-kerala-firework-tragedy-police-files-charge-sheet-officials-spared-902835.html

Pilgrims have already reached the base camp and after conducting Covid-19 tests, only those testing negative would be allowed to trek from early hours of Saturday. Pilgrims from other states would have to produce a Covid-19 test done 48 hours ahead of reaching Sabarimala. Pilgrims would also have to produce fitness certificates. In order to ensure social distancing, only 250 pilgrims would be allowed every day till the temple closes on October 21. During the annual pilgrimage season from next month only 1,000 devotees would be allowed daily. All type of offerings by devotees have been restricted to avert chances of infection spreading to priests. Devotees would not be also allowed to halt at the temple premises. Selection of the new 'Melsanthi' (head priest) for the temple for one year beginning from November would be held on Saturday. Owing to the Covid-19 scenario, the number of applicants for 'Melsanthi' was comparatively low this year. Though entry of pilgrims to the temple was banned since March, regular monthly poojas were being held. Though the government and the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages the temple earlier planned to allow devotees to the temple in June, the temple tantri (head priest) objected to it and hence the plan was dropped. There was a revenue loss of around Rs 150 core owing to the ban on pilgraims for the last six months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-reopens-for-devotees-after-six-months-902849.html

The total length of the network to come in use through these completed and to be constructed roads is 1411 KMs. Among the projects dedicated to the public on Friday are the 2.6 km long six-lane Kanakadurga flyover constructed at a cost of Rs 502 crore, and the 2.3 km long Benz Circle flyover costing Rs 80 crore. The flyovers located in Vijayawada are expected to significantly reduce the traffic congestion along the national highways passing through the city. Interacting through a video conference with Gadkari, who logged in from Nagpur, CM Reddy sought the centre’s help in taking up eight more projects including the four-lane bypass road from Visakhapatnam to Bhogapuram airport. While the Reddy government has planned to make Visakhapatnam the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, Bhogapuram, 60 KMs away from Vizag, is where a greenfield international airport will be coming up.   "There is a need to build an alternative road connecting Visakhapatnam and Bhogapuram airport. This can be taken up as a coastal highway project by turning the Beach Road into a four-lane highway,” Reddy told Gadkari. Reddy, whose recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi has led to speculation that the YSRCP could be joining the NDA government at the centre, was in profuse praise of the infrastructure development in the country in the last six years. Reddy thanked Modi and Gadkari for their vision, expanding the pace of highway construction from 12 km per day in 2014 to 30 km per day now.

The Jaganmohan Reddy government is bracing for a massive flood of about nine lakh cusecs at the Vijayawada's Prakasam Barrage, as the incessant rains caused floodwaters to continue to deluge many parts of the city 280 km away from Hyderabad. On Friday, Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz visited the barrage's upstream areas Chandarlapadu, Ibrahimpatnam and reviewed the preparedness of the official machinery to deal with contingencies. “Nine lakh cusecs of Krishna water are expected to reach the Prakasam Barrage by Friday night. We are setting up the mitigation measures in the flood-prone areas, ”the district's administrative head said. As of Friday evening, the flow at the barrage is 7.14 lakh cusecs. While the outflow at the Srisailam project is 4.7 lakh cusecs, the same at the Pulichintala project (between Srisailam and Prakasam) was about eight lakhs by Friday afternoon. The extremely heavy rains in Karnataka and Telangana have risen the water levels at these projects. In the neighboring Guntur district, revenue officials had earlier served notices to the residents of bungalows along the Krishna river right bank, including former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, advising them to move out to safer places. Revenue, police, and irrigation officials are on alert from Jaggayyapeta, where the river enters Krishna district, up to Nagayalanka, where it merges into the Bay of Bengal — in all 18 revenue mandals.   Bhupesh Gupta Nagar, Taraka Rama Nagar etc areas in Vijayawada are already submerged. 2,300 people here are evacuated to relief centers, provided with food etc., essentials. The increased inflows in the river now pose the danger of deluge in more areas of the city and dozens of villages, on either side in Krishna and Guntur districts, downstream till the sea. Special attention is on the delta's island villages. Evacuation and relief efforts were on at some places like Ravilala where the waters entered habitations on Friday. NDRF, SDRF teams are on standby in Vijayawada, Nandigama and Thotlavalluru.

16-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka devises protocol to spot Covid-19 after RT-PCR negative||Karnataka on Thursday officially recognised a new category of patients with "Covid-19 Like Syndrome", who test negative for Covid-19 in RT-PCR but are later found to have serious Covid-like illness through high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan. In a new circular to diagnose 'Covid-19 probable' cases, the government suggested a four-pronged approach to identify such patients: Clinical, radiological, blood investigations and nasal and throat swab. The state will employ Covid-19 Reporting And Data (CORAD), a new method to assess the risk factor of such patients. CORAD score is a CT scan-based system that is used to assess the suspicion of pulmonary involvement in Covid-19. A score ranging from 3 to 6 means the level of suspicion is 'equivocal' to 'very high', meaning 'features are compatible with Covid-19' or are 'typical of Covid-19'. Based on the official assessment, DH on October 15 highlighted that up to 5% of total Covid cases may test negative in RT-PCR but are found to have serious infections through HRCT and later test positive for the disease. Noting that identifying such false-negative patients was crucial to prevent mortality and infection, the government has stressed the need to conduct an HRCT scan. Now, if a patient has clinical features suggestive of Covid-19, a CORAD of 5 and blood investigations suggest markers above certain values, and an RT-PCR negative report, then he/she will be considered a 'Covid-19 Probable Case'. "With the increase in the spread of Covid-19 and increase in the number of tests every day, the percentage of False Negative Reports are increasing and it's expected to increase further in future," the circular stated. It goes on to say, "And many times, in spite of clinical-radiological features suggestive of Covid-19 disease, the RTPCR test, which is considered as Gold Standard Test, maybe negative." With sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests for nasal and throat swab ranging between 60-70%, we may miss many positive cases, i.e., get false negative reports. Rapid Antigen Detection test, which is recommended by the ICMR has shown sensitivity (ability to detect true positives) ranging from 50.6% to 84% and specificity (ability to detect true negatives) of 99.3% to 100%, after two independent evaluations. Additionally, several retrospective studies have shown that CT Thorax (chest) has greater sensitivity (86%-98%) and lower false-negative rate than RT-PCR. Hence, a proxy syndrome, called "Covid-19 Like Syndrome" (or) Covid-19 Probable case, has to be used to identify such cases with a correlation of clinical features, CT Thorax findings and laboratory investigations, to initiate treatment similar in lines to Covid-19 confirmed cases as early as possible. All government and private health establishments treating Covid-19 should strictly adhere to the above approach, in the larger interest of reducing mortality due to Covid-19, the circular said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-devises-protocol-to-spot-covid-19-after-rt-pcr-negative-902532.html

Yediyurappa, who chaired a review meeting with deputy commissioners, zilla panchayat chief executives and police superintendents of over a dozen flood-hit districts, directed officials to ensure the Covid-19 standard operating procedures are followed in the relief centres that have been set up. “DCs have sufficient funds. I have also appraised the Centre. I have spoken with the Union Home Minister (Amit Shah) and he has assured cooperation,” Yediyurappa told reporters. “We are committed to protecting our farmers,” he added.  Due to a depression in Bay of Bengal, districts such as Bidar, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Yadir, Bellary and others received very heavy rainfall resulting in record inflow in Bhima river and its tributaries. Residents in villages who might be susceptible to flooding should be shifted to relief centres where masks should be provided and social distancing maintained, Yediyurappa said.  Measures should be taken to shift any patients with Covid-19 symptoms to hospitals, Yediyurappa said during his review meeting. A total of 12 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were involved in rescue operations, which included six teams dispatched from Chennai and Pune. The State Disaster Response Force also was also deployed in such regions.

Among those inducted into the Congress was the Rajarajeshwari Nagar JD(S) unit president Bettaswamy Gowda. He was a ticket aspirant to contest the upcoming bypoll. All the JD(S) leaders were inducted by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D K Shivakumar and his brother, Bangalore Rural MP D K Suresh. “We were trying to bring them on board for 15 years. The time has come now,” Shivakumar said. “They are joining the Congress unconditionally because they wanted to identify with a national party.” The JD(S) has fielded Krishnamurthy V for the November 3 bypoll to Rajarajeshwari Nagar. JD(S) legislature party leader HD Kumaraswamy had said Krishnamurthy’s candidature was "unanimously" finalized by Bettaswamy Gowda and the party’s Bengaluru unit president R Prakash who were also shortlisted for the ticket. “In the 2018 election, the JD(S) had bagged 60,000 votes,” Shivakumar said, adding that the regional party leaders joining the Congress was helpful. Shivakumar also pointed out that the JD(S) has never won the Rajarajeshwari Nagar segment, which was earlier under the Uttarahalli constituency. “In 1983, when I was a student leader, M Srinvas of the Janata Party won. Then, in 1989, S Ramesh of the Congress won. It was Srinivas again from the BJP and so on. Since 2008, when the Rajarajeshwari Nagar segment came into being, the BJP has won once and Congress twice,” Shivakumar said. The Congress has fielded Kusuma, the daughter of former JD(S) leader Hanumantharayappa, as its candidate. The BJP’s candidate is disqualified legislator Munirathna, who won the constituency twice when he was with the Congress before joining the saffron party. Kumaraswamy has been fuming against Shivakumar and the Congress for luring Vokkaliga votes and the regional party’s leaders ahead of the bypoll. Vokkaligas are known to form a sizable number of voters in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. “Our party workers trying to gain votes from other parties and vice-versa...this is politics that happens during every election,” Shivakumar told reporters. On Kumaraswamy’s caste charge, Shivakumar said: “Vokkaliga or other caste, I’ve never got into that. My parents are Vokkaligas and I can’t help that. Even my school application says I’m a Vokkaliga. But, I’m the Congress president and our caste is the Congress. I’ve never liked talking about caste and I won’t going forward.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/240-jds-leaders-join-congress-ahead-of-rajarajeshwari-nagar-bypoll-902834.html

It can be recalled that the state had sought Rs 4,000 crore aid for flood relief back in August. For the 2020-21 fiscal, the Centre has already releasedRs 790 crore under SDRF, whose total allocation for the state is Rs 1,054 crore. The state is hit by a third spell of floods during the second and third week of October. In the preceding two spells - between July 25 and September 15 and from September 15 to 30 - government has estimated crop loss in 10.07 lakh hectare worth around Rs 5,521 crore. For this, compensation under SDRF will only be Rs 813 crore. Similarly, infrastructure losses are estimated at Rs 4,851 crore as 30,455 km of roads, 1,659 minor irrigation projects and tanks and 444 water supply schemes suffered damages. Relief under SDRF norms on this account will only be Rs 410 crore. Loss figures will only surge after government assesses overall damage of the floods in north Karnataka. Initial estimates show that crops on 2.2 lakh hectares land were damaged due to heavy rainfall and overflowing Bhimariver. Manoj Rajan, Commissioner, Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority said that a report on the extent of losses during October floods would be submitted to the Centre by October 30. To a question on limited SDRF grants, Rajan said that additional compensation would be released under the National Disaster Relief Fund if SDRF grants were exhausted. “There is a difference between relief provided and losses suffered,” he said, explaining that “loss” is the estimated cost to restore a house or farm land to its previous state. “Irrespective of the loss, relief will be limited,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-eligible-for-just-8-relief-of-rs-15000-crore-rain-damages-903001.html

Baby Kavya was born a year ago through In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) technique in Ahmedabad, under the concept known as 'saviour sibling'. Her bone marrow was successfully transplanted to her brother Abhijeet Solanki in March this year and the boy is now "risk-free", doctors said on Thursday. Abhijeet, the second child of Sahdev Singh Solanki and Alpa Solanki, was diagnosed with Thalassemia-major, a blood disorder, and was dependent on blood transfusion every month, they said. Thalassemia-major patients require frequent blood transfusions and their life expectancy is also less. His parents were advised bone marrow transplant as the last resort to treat the child, but they could not find the required HLA (human leukocyte antigen) match. "Due to unavailability of matching HLA donors for the transplant, we opted for IVF with HLA matching," city-based Nova IVF Fertility's medical director Dr Manish Banker told PTI. This process of HLA typing is an established method for conceiving a child, who may donate cord blood or hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation to save a sibling with a critical illness. Abhijeet's father approached Banker after he found that the bone marrow of his family members, including the boy's elder sister, was not matching. "Bone marrow transplant from an HLA-identical donor is the best therapeutic option for thalassemia major patients. We took the challenge and created a healthy savior sibling to save her elder brother," Banker said. With the help of IVF, Abhijeet's mother delivered a healthy baby girl Kavya a year ago, who was found to be the HLA match for the sibling. In March this year, after Kavya gained the required weight, a successful bone marrow transplant was done for Abhijeet at the CIMS Hospital here, Banker said. "Now, Abhijeet is risk-free and doesn't require a blood transfusion," Banker said. "This is the first case in India when an HLA matching baby was born through IVF specifically to save the thalassemia-major sibling," he said. The siblings' father, who himself researched well about this technique, thanked Banker and other expert doctors for saving his son. "It gives me immense pleasure to see both my children healthy and full of life. I am thankful and will always be indebted to Nova IVF Fertility for giving us hope to live," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/girl-conceived-to-donate-bone-marrow-saves-brothers-life-902536.html

Thakur (46), a Congress MLA, is also the Working President of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee. The incident took place around 4.15 pm on 24 March 2012, near the Ambadevi temple in Chunabhatti area under Rajapeth police station in Amravati district, when she and her aides were allegedly involved in assaulting an on-duty police constable Ulhas Rorale. The Congress-NCP Democratic Front government was in power at the time. District and Sessions Judge of Amravati, Urmila Joshi also convicted three others, Thakur’s driver Sagar Suresh Khandekar and two of her party associates Sharad Kashirao Javanlal and Raju Kisan Ingle, in the eight-year-old case and sentenced them to three months’ imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 each on them. The police constable had stopped the car of Thakur, a three-time MLA from Teosa, from entering a single-lane route from the wrong side. Thakur, who is also the Guardian Minister of Amravati district, said that she would move the Bombay High Court. “I have always respected the judiciary as I am myself a lawyer…I do not want to comment more than saying that I will move the high court against the verdict…truth shall ultimately prevail,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-minister-ordered-to-undergo-jail-for-assaulting-cop-902619.html
16-10-2020||West||Gujarat police register FIR against NDTV for 'false reporting' on Tanishq store||The Gujarat Police on Friday registered an FIR against news channel NDTV for its report on an 'attack on a Tanishq store by a mob' in Gandhidham, Kutch district for the jewellery brand's advertisement "Ekatvam" (oneness), "forcing" it to write an apology on October 14. The FIR is based on a complaint lodged by one of the men who allegedly forced the staffers to write this note of apology and display it on the front door of the store. Hours later, Minister of State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja made a statement on Twitter saying that "The news of an attack on a showroom in Gandhidham, Kutch by @ndtv is TOTALLY FAKE. This is a motivated attempt to adversely impact the law & order & incite violence in Gujarat. I have asked to register a case & take strict action against those who spread this fake news. " "An FIR has been registered against NDTV under section 153 (A) and section 505 of Indian Penal Code and we have started looking into the matter," Kutch (East) district superintendent of police Mayur Patil told DH over phone while confirming the development. He refused to divulge further information by stating that "investigation is on." The FIR is based on a complaint filed by Ramesh Ahir alias Maitra who had approached the police on Thursday with a written application accusing the news channel of reporting "false news". When contacted, he told DH, "NDTV accused me of attacking and threatening the staff of the showroom which I never did. If you look at the video, which has gone viral, I am only requesting them with folded hands to apologise." When asked if he is associated with any organisations he claimed, "I am a small BJP worker, a simple businessman and a farmer. I will never encourage violence." According to police sources, the FIR allegedly mentions that NDTV reported falsely of a "mob attack" but only two men entered the store while around four to five men waited outside the store. "Due to coronavirus, only two men including Ramesh entered the store. He raised his objection over the advertisement and asked them to write an apology. The staffers told him that an apology in English was already out in public but he insisted on writing an apology in Gujarati so that locals can understand. Since the staff didn't know Gujarati they asked Ramesh to write it for them. Ramesh wrote on a blank paper which was approved by the store manager and it was copied on a whiteboard which was put on display at the entrance of the store," sources said. Titan-owned Tanishq, a jewellery brand, was under fire on social media for its 45-second video advertisement featuring a Muslim family celebrating a traditional baby shower of pregnant daughter-in-law. The brand was trolled by netizens and the advertisement was accused of "love-jihad," a term used to refer to an alleged venture by Muslims to convert Hindu girls in the name of love. While Tanishq was being criticised, a video of Ramesh Ahir, a resident of Gandhidham, Kutch, surfaced on October 14 showing him allegedly forcing the staffers to write an apology. The showroom management followed the "instructions" and wrote an apology in Gujarati which read, "The campaign of Tanishq circulated in the media is shameful and Gandhidham Tanishq apologises to Samagra Kutch Jilla Hindu Samaj."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-police-register-fir-against-ndtv-for-false-reporting-on-tanishq-store-902640.html

In Pandharpur tehsil alone, over 10,000 people from 46 flood-hit villages have been shifted to safer places, while 14 people have died in rain-related incidents since Wednesday in the western Maharashtra district, they said. "Though there is a reduction in rainfall activity since yesterday, due to discharge of water from dams, including Ujani, several areas in Pandharpur tehsil are still flooded.

Additional sessions judge R M Sadrani granted anticipatory bail to Pradeep Bhandari, a journalist with Republic TV, who was booked by the Khar police under IPC sections 353 (assault), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant) and relevant provisions of the Bombay Police Act. The prosecution's case was that the accused person had paid a group of around 15 to 20 persons to gather outside the premises, where the demolition was on. The group had shouted slogans and tried to prevent policemen from discharging their duties, it alleged. Bhandari, in his plea, argued that section 353 is not attracted in the case, as he had not assaulted any public servant. The court in its order noted that the allegation of the prosecution is against the mob. "The contents of the FIR do not disclose that any force or assault was done against any public officer in order to deter him from discharging public duty," the court said. It further said that section 353 was added in the FIR a week after it was lodged. "Therefore, it is clear that when the FIR was lodged, the public servant was not aware that he was deterred or prevented from discharging his public duty," the court said. With regard to the allegation that Bhandari had paid the mob to gather at the said premises, the court said, "Paying money to the public for announcing slogans is not the offence here." The bench noted that custodial interrogation was not required in the case and granted anticipatory bail to Bhandari, directing him to appear before the Khar police as and when required.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kangana-ranaut-office-demolition-court-grants-journalist-pre-arrest-bail-902719.html

Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said farmers, mostly in districts coming under the Pune division, have suffered huge crop damage in heavy rains on October 14 and 15 caused by a depression in the Bay of Bengal. "I am going to ask the Union government to provide some compensation to farmers who have lost their livelihood. "An assessment of damaged crop is going on. I have asked officials to speed up the damage assessment exercise," he said. So far, 28 people have died in rain-related incidents in the Pune division, half of them in the worst-hit Solapur district, said an official. Besides Solapur, the other flood-affected districts in western Maharashtra are Pune, Sangli and Satara. "The heavy showers also took a toll on domestic animals. As many as 379 fully grown cattle and 134 smaller ones have died," he said. The downpour has forced 21,292 people to move out of their homes. They can not return to their homes immediately because roads and houses are filled with mud and items carried by floodwaters, the official said. The rains have also damaged 2,319 homes so far, he said. "Primary reports suggest crops spread over 57,354 hectares have been damaged. These include sugarcane, soyabean, rice, lentils, pomegranate and cotton, among others, the official said.

The state government had on Wednesday ordered a probe into the project and announced on Thursday that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) would investigate it as the CAG had raised questions on the quality of work and results achieved. The BJP has alleged that there was "political vendetta" behind the decision to conduct a probe. The 'Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan', a pet project of Devendra Fadnavis, was launched in 2014 with the objective of making Maharashtra drought-free by 2019. "The probe has not been announced intentionally or out of vendetta. This is not deliberate. After the CAG report was discussed in the cabinet, the chief minister said a probe should be conducted," Pawar told reporters here. He said there was no need to look into a political angle into the probe being ordered. "I can recall that the then water conservation minister Tanaji Sawant in the Fadnavis government had admitted in the upper house (Legislative Council) about irregularities in the Jalyukt Shivar scheme," Pawar said. "Bring out the records. It was he who made this kind of statement and now an inquiry will take place," Pawar added. The Jalyukt project involved deepening and widening of streams, construction of cement and earthen stop dams, work on nullahs and digging of farm ponds. Shiv Sena, whose president Uddhav Thackeray is now the state chief minister, was also a part of the Fadnavis-led government during 2014-2019. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report submitted to the state legislature last month had observed that the scheme, under which Rs 9,633.75 crore were spent, was not much effective. It had little impact in achieving water neutrality and increasing the ground water level and its execution was characterized by lack of transparency, the CAG had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/no-vendetta-behind-probe-into-jalyukt-scheme-ajit-pawar-902793.html

Bombay High Court asks Centre||Expressing deep concern over “media trials”, the Bombay High Court on Friday wanted to know from the government if there was any mechanism for checking the content broadcast by news channels before the "damage is done". "In a case where the media crosses the `Laxman rekha', it is for the Parliament to step in. Why should the court do it?.... you do not seem to be in a mood to ruffle the feathers with respect to the electronic media,” observed a division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni. The observations came during the hearing of PIL filed by a group of retired IPS officers, who had petitioned the Bombay High Court in the wake of the news reportage vis-à-vis the Sushant Singh Rajput case. "All public officers are liable to be removed if something happens. Same for (people in) private employment. People are taken to task for not behaving properly,"  the court said. The bench then went on to add, “For the print, there is the Press Council for the films there is the Censor Board… what about a similar statutory body for the electronic media…” However, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the Union government, argued that the Supreme Court has maintained that the government must not interfere with the freedom of the press, and the press must be encouraged to have a system of self-regulation. However, the bench pointed out that these judgments are from 2012-2013 but now times have changed. “This is the most misused freedom now," it said. "Media has a fundamental right to freedom. But that cannot be used to infringe on the rights of others. This cannot go unregulated," it added. Singh said the Union government was of the same view and was looking into what is needed to be done. Senior counsel Arvind Datar, who appeared for the National Broadcasters Association, said it did impose fine on several TV channels for objectionable reportage on Sushant Singh Rajput's death.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/is-there-a-mechanism-for-checking-of-tv-news-before-damage-is-done-bombay-high-court-asks-centre-902794.html

He made the statement a day before the commencement of the nine-day Navratri festival, one of the biggest religious events in Gujarat. The Gujarat government has banned organisation of 'garba' events, a key feature of Navratri involving traditional dance, across the state. A week back, the state government had said permission will not be granted for Navratri celebrations, be it commercial garba events or those held inside residential societies. "Navratri holds special importance for the people of Gujarat. People eagerly wait to enjoy garba during this season. "But this time, the situation is different. The entire world is fighting against coronavirus," said Rupani in a video message. "We are also fighting against this pandemic. Putting special emphasis on public health, we have not given permission for Navratri events this time. "People's health is our priority and we must ensure that efforts we all have made so far to control the outbreak do not go in vain," said the CM. He said though festivals are important, it is not advisable to risk lives to celebrate them. Rupani sought people's cooperation and hoped citizens understand the seriousness of the situation. "I know that you all agree with me on this. The government took a tough decision in the interest of people. "I appeal to people to wear masks, wash hands properly and regularly and maintain social distancing until a vaccine comes," headded. Till October 15, Gujarat had recorded 1,56,283 Covid-19 cases and 3,609 deaths.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/prioritised-peoples-health-over-navratri-celebrations-says-gujarat-cm-rupani-902798.html

The Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that the trees were being chopped for the work related to the new zoo that had been planned in the Aarey Milk Colony. Acting promptly, state Environment, Tourist, and Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray issued a “stop work” notice. “Received some photos of some old work tendered earlier, happening now in Aarey for a proposed concrete wall. I have asked the authorities to issue a “stop work” notice immediately and asked for a report on the same,” Aaditya tweeted. AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon tweeted, “This is ridiculous! Heard that there is tree felling going on inside Aarey forest for Aaditya Thackeray's zoo?!!! Wasn't killing baby penguin enough to satisfy his childish plans…Why on earth would we destroy a forest to make a zoo??!!”. According to AAP’s National Joint Secretary Ruben Mascarenhas, his party strongly objected to the felling of trees and clearance of land at Aarey for the proposed zoo. “The locals on the ground were quick to respond and raised objections with the government officials present. The pretext of the felling of trees is the proposed zoo basis a work order, which is prima facie an 'expired work order', which has been accessed by AAP.  It is plain foolish to destroy a forest to build a zoo. Globally, zoos are an obsolete concept, which is cruel to animals too,” he said. It may be recalled, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation, which is controlled by Shiv Sena, had in 2019 unveiled plans to build an international standard zoo in Aarey.
