If one of them says that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and banks need to cut interest rates in order to revive the economy, most others follow. Take the idea of a central bank and commercial banks cutting interest rates when the economy of a country is not doing well. Why do economists offer this advice? The idea is that as banks cut interest rates, people will borrow and spend more. At the same time corporates will borrow and expand, by setting up more factories and offices. Businesses and the economy will benefit. The trouble is that what the economists believe in doesn’t always turn out to be true. Or to put in a more nuanced way, there is a flip side to what they recommend. And I have seen very few professional economists talk about the flip side till date. In fact, low interest rates hurt a large section of the population especially during an economic recession and contraction. In India, a section of the population is dependent on the level of interest rate on bank deposits (especially fixed deposits). Currently, the average interest rate on a fixed deposit is around 5.5%. The inflation as measured by the consumer price index in September stood at 7.34%. Hence, the actual return on a fixed deposit is in the negative territory and has been so through much of this year. This doesn’t even take into account the fact that interest earned on fixed deposits is taxable at the marginal rate. This hurts people living off interest income, in particular senior citizens. Senior citizens whose fixed deposits have matured in the recent past have seen their interest income fall from around 7.5-8% per year to around 5.5% per year, in an environment where food inflation is higher than 10%. The only way to keep going for them is to cut monthly expenses or start using their capital (or the money invested in fixed deposits) for regular expenses. It is worth remembering that Indians have very little social security of the kind common in developed nations. Lower interest rates also impact a large section of the population which saves for the future through bank fixed deposits. It is worth remembering that it is this section of the population which actually drives private consumption in the country. When returns on their savings fall, the logical thing is to cut consumption and save more. If this is not done, then the future gets compromised. Lower interest rates also hurt institutions like non-government organisations, charitable trusts etc., which save through the fixed deposit route. They even impact returns on insurance policies and provident/pension funds. The stock market-wallahs love low interest rates because some investors continue to bet on stocks despite the lack of company earnings. The price to earnings ratio of the stocks that constitute the Nifty 50, one of India’s premier stock market indices, is currently at more than 34. Such high levels have never been seen before. It’s not the possibility of future high company earnings which have driven up stock prices but the current low interest rates, leading to more and more people trying to make a quick buck on the stock market. Between March 27 and October 9, the deposits of banks have increased by a whopping Rs 7.4 lakh crore or 5.4%. In the same time, the total loans of banks have shrunk by Rs 38,552 crore or 0.4%. This basically means, on the whole people are repaying loans instead of taking on fresh ones, despite lower interest rates. In this environment, with banks unable to lend out most of their fresh deposits, it is but natural that they will cut interest rates on their fixed deposits. You can’t hold that against them. But what has not helped is the fact that the RBI has been trying to drive down interest rates further by printing money and pumping it into the financial system. Between early February and September end, the central bank has pumped more than Rs 11 lakh crore into the financial system. Not all of it is freshly printed money, but a lot of it is. This has apparently been done to encourage corporates to borrow. The bank lending to industry peaked at 22.43% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012-13. Since then it has been falling and in 2019-20, it stood at 14.28% of the GDP. Clearly, Indian industry hasn’t been in a mood to borrow and expand, for a while now. And high interest rates, cannot be the only reason for it. The real reason for the RBI pumping in money into the financial system and driving down interest rates has been to help the government borrow money at low interest rates. As tax collections have fallen, the government needs to borrow significantly more this year than it did last year. All this has hurt the saver. But clearly like the corporates and the government, the savers are not organised and do not have a voice. Hence, no one is talking about them. We already know that no economist talks about this phenomenon or more specifically the fact that low interest rates and high inflation should have led to a cut in consumption. How big and significant is that cut? Is this cut in consumption more than the loans given by banks because of low interest rates? How is it hurting the Indian economy? These are questions that need answers. But the problem is, to a man with a hammer everything appears like a nail. For economists, interest rates are precisely that hammer which they like to use everywhere. This situation is no different.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/why-no-one-is-worried-about-savers-906618.html
25-10-2020||Comment||The economics of college cut-offs||I’m no economist, but there were two curious pieces of data that aroused the economics enthusiast in me this month. As many parents would know, Delhi University’s (DU) entrance cut-offs have literally gone through the roof, hitting as high as a perfect 100% for some courses, and leaving many young dreams in the mud. And yet, on the other hand, there was a distressing report about struggling engineering colleges. Over 600 colleges have reduced their intake this year, according to authorities, while another 140 had decided to shut down entirely. I know your inner voice is already blaming Covid-19 for this, but the story goes deeper. Many colleges have been cutting intake and shutting down for years. The reason: Lack of demand. How is it possible that some colleges are able to turn toppers away without a thought, while others struggle to fill up enough seats to even survive? India’s higher education is a Malthusian nightmare. The country has nearly one-fifth of the world’s population, but only eight universities good enough to be in the top 500 in the world. By contrast, Russia has 17 and Brazil has five. And both of them have fewer people than Uttar Pradesh. Quality matters. In a country where thousands of college graduates – even technical graduates – have had to queue up to be hired as peons, many now believe that paying to attend a poorly ranked college is just as good as not going to college at all. And that leaves hundreds of colleges empty. But on the other hand, colleges of repute struggle to meet demand. The rat race is worse for those who wish to pursue the humanities. DU is not even ranked in the top 500 in the world, but it is among the few worthwhile places in India to study economics, history or journalism. The yawning gap between supply and demand leaves colleges like DU with only two choices: They can either hike fees or hike cut-offs. Demanding exorbitant fees is politically impossible for State-owned universities, so they have instead taken to targeting grades. Spiralling college cut-offs also present perverse incentives at the school-level and feed into a vicious cycle: Since college cut-offs are astronomical, examination boards across states now compete with each other to award their students progressively higher grades each year. But this simply pushes the cut-offs further and further away. Alas, when the education sector is reduced to a ruthless marketplace and grades serve as ‘prices’ by which to decide who goes to college, it is learning that suffers. The easiest way to award students higher grades is to water down the syllabus and ask them simpler questions in their exams. But since the student population only grows each year and quality institutes remain scarcer than water on the moon, this strategy does nothing to give students greater opportunity to access quality universities. If anything, it only dilutes the skills and knowledge that students gain in high school. Parents are now forced to send their children to schools that grade exams more leniently, rather than looking for schools that are harder to pass out of but are more worthwhile to learn in. The ordeal of the high school student is now truly pitiable. The whole purpose of schooling has been reduced to just one grade sheet. Rather than requiring students to demonstrate a thirst for knowledge, colleges ask them to perfect the art of exam-writing. And the result of all these endeavours: A chance to attend a university that does not even rank in the top 100 in the world.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/the-economics-of-college-cut-offs-906620.html
25-10-2020||Comment||The wonder of retrieval||On a Sunday afternoon, during one of DR Nagaraj’s visits to our home, I had held out towards him my new acquisition, a copy of Vaclav Havel’s Living in Truth. He took it from me saying, “This has an exciting essay, ‘The Power of the Powerless.’” On another occasion, it was The Essays, Articles and Reviews of Evelyn Waugh. Pushing back his black, square horn-rimmed glasses, he exclaimed: “Oh! I learnt the niceties of English from Waugh.” I was finishing high school during this time, the late eighties. My father, who had studied and taught English literature before joining the Karnataka civil services, and DR Nagaraj (DRN), had become close after having met through common friends. The range of DRN’s reading was truly stunning. Primarily a Kannada literary critic, his passions moved across Indian, English, American, European and African literatures. Indeed, literature from any part of the world was up his alley. Indian and Western philosophers and political thinkers also mattered greatly to him. His recall of books, writers and literary episodes had an endearing nerd-like quality. And the delight he took in ideas and in making details tell was independent of anything else. DRN would narrate one of the case dreams from Freud’s The Interpretation of Dreams to show his excitement about the great psychoanalyst’s method. His review of Mao’s biography written by his personal physician began thus: “Among the tallest revolutionary leaders of the twentieth century, Mao didn’t have the habit of brushing his teeth in the morning: he only rinsed his mouth with tea.” True, literature could have a political side, but the power of the literary imagination soared above it. While referring to Kannada writers who he felt had “written more authentic stories” on matters of concern to Dalit and feminist movements than the latter’s ideologues, he noted: “Literature probably has its own way of ditching ideology.” After being beholden to the socialist ideas of Marx, Lohia and others in his youth, DRN had struggled to see freshly. The great folk epics of Male Madeshwara, Manteswamy and Junjappa, the vachanas of Allama Prabhu and the poetry of Rumi, the Persian poet, offered him new angles to regard the socialist ideals, helping shake his ideological fixity to an extent. The folk epics showed the radiant literary and aesthetic creativity as well as intense critical sensibilities seen among the lower castes, a fact that appears counter-intuitive to fossilised histories of caste relations where the upper castes triumph in all instances. DRN had joked once, “Do you think a Shudra landlord would let molten lead be poured in his ears as punishment for hearing the Vedas? The Manu Smriti is an ideological fantasy of the orthodox Brahmins. It isn’t a document of how things actually were.” Not proposing a diminished place for the power of Brahmin culture, DRN was asking instead that the cultural experiences of lower castes be properly understood. An attention to how the social worlds of castes and religions in India cross-fertilised each other all the time while institutional memory erased the history of that co-influence was needed to overcome what he termed “cultural amnesia.” Mystical traditions which revealed hitherto hidden relationships in the world through metaphors also fascinated DRN. A sense of vismaya (wonder) and a relish for metaphors, which modern scholarship so easily dispensed with, better aided the work of overcoming cultural amnesia. The truckloads of books that emerged in the wake of Edward Said’s Orientalism concentrated their energies on how European thought dominated social life in colonised countries. But what about the hundreds of ways in which small communities preserved their creativity amidst colonial rule? In this regard, the Kannada poets of the early 20th century appeared to DRN like tiny birds that had reached for twigs, feathers and leaves from anywhere to build a nest amidst a storm: “They saved Kannada poetry from the vulture that was colonialism.” For modern minds like him, DRN confessed, history was like a mother’s saree in whose folds frightened children sought refuge at the sight of violence. Having seemed opaque at first, Rumi’s poetry (which he translated into Kannada) later proved to be like ‘a seed that waits patiently in the folds of darkness to burst through the cracks at some point and flourish as a plant.’||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/the-wonder-of-retrieval-906624.html
25-10-2020||Comment||Half a world apart, two elections strangely connected||Early next month, the world’s richest democracy will elect the world’s most powerful man. Currently, opinion polls put Joe Biden on track to showing the door to a president regarded by many as the worst in history, Donald Trump. If such a result comes to pass – though no one is ruling out a surprise – it will end an improbable four years for a man whose angularities contrast sharply with the grace of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump, by demeanour and behaviour, is still an outsider in the circles of power, taking on Biden, the dyed-in-the-wool ‘insider’ in Washington, a word Trump has managed to turn into a pejorative one. Around the same time, 12,000 kilometres away, a population one-third the size of America’s, crammed into a landmass the size of South Korea, also goes to the polls. Narendra Modi, who personally fights every Indian state election, is locked in another pandemic-time battle, in Bihar. It’s a stretch to draw any parallels between the two elections: After all, the Hindi heartland that spawned the BJP is one of India’s poorest regions. Modi is a seasoned administrator with a track record of two decades of governance in Gujarat and the Centre. No one is contemptuous of him, in contrast with Trump, often the object of ridicule. Still, many Bhakts will react with indignation at any criticism of the American president, suggesting a deep, if ultimately meaningless, bond with the Trumpian movement. This is bewildering, given that their Objects of Devotion are very different, and Trump’s feelings toward Modi are as inconsistent as his other likes and dislikes. But that may be a shallow reading. There are, after all, pronounced similarities in the two ‘revolutions’ – the one that catapulted the Republican to the White House in 2016 and the one that first swept India in 2014. Like Trump, Modi was an outsider to the circles of power, and disdainful of their trappings. Both are supremely self-assured politicians who are convinced of their own rightness: Maybe they listen too much to their followers, in whose eyes they can do no wrong. They are arch-polarisers, and their supporters use the classical right-wing playbook of whipping up fear and exploiting insecurities. As a result, fissures along race and community that always existed in both countries are now truly out in the open. Much has been made of Modi regularly referring to himself in the third person; Trump is the ultimate narcissist. They are both consummate communicators and use social media to great effect. And neither has much time for political correctness or the graces of convention. Trump and Modi preside over the two largest Covid-19 caseloads in the world. Around the time they bromanced in Ahmedabad earlier this year, the coronavirus was beginning to take hold. Modi was off the mark relatively quickly after that in fighting the virus, even if there were gimmicks in the early days, while Trump lived in denial. If he loses, Trump would have paid the price for that; if Modi wins, it will only show how effective spin has been in minimising the pandemic as an electoral issue here. Right-wing governments are seen as economy-friendly, often to the point of kowtowing to Big Business, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average under Trump has done less well than under Bill Clinton and Obama at a similar stage in their presidencies, according to data from macrotrends.net; the Sensex under Modi hasn’t done as well as in the UPA years as his reforming instincts have been strangely restrained. A point of departure is the way Modi’s party bends over backwards to attract his attention, while Trump’s Republicans don’t speak in one voice. A normally proper finance minister uses the fear of Covid-19 to garner votes in Bihar, the head of the women’s welfare watchdog is known for her illiberal views, pungently expressed, and the chief minister of the most populous state speaks in a way calculated to shock, and perhaps stake a claim to promotion. The contrast that stands out most, though, is how the two politicians are treated by their electronic media. Trump is regularly roasted, and takes it on the chin. He meets the press often, even if he hates many journalists. But 12,000 km away, supine broadcasters provide a free pass, if not much more. And the link between the two sets of supporters breaks among the Indian diaspora in the United States. Judging by the crowds when Modi goes calling, they adore him. But they also historically vote Democrat. Is this set to change, or do they prefer centrism to govern their lives while wishing for strongman, right-wing politics to rule in the mother country?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/half-a-world-apart-two-elections-strangely-connected-906627.html

The district administration has received 318 applications seeking permits for sand extraction. In the first phase, 105 applications were scrutinised. According to the recommendations of the seven-member committee, it was decided to give permits for 79 applicants. To check illegal mining other than identified sand bars, the committee has decided to make GPS mandatory for the boats used for extraction and trucks used for transportation of sand. Further, CCTV cameras will also be installed at strategic locations. “If anyone is found violating the rules on GPS fitted boats and trucks, then a fine of Rs 25,000 will be slapped for a first violation, Rs 50,000 for a second violation. The temporary permits will be cancelled for the third violation,” the committee has said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/district-level-panel-okays-conditional-temporary-sand-extraction-permits-906680.html

Karnataka has one tiger, which needs to be sent to the forest, thereby protect the state.” Speaking at the BJP district working committee meeting, he asked: "Who is better? Whether wild animal or a caveman?" “The MLA who had divided society on the basis of religion, the voters chased him away from Varuna constituency. On one hand people chased the ‘wild animal’, while on other hand, people ensured the victory of the caveman by a margin of over 2 lakh votes,” he added. He said Siddaramaiah is in charge of the Congress in Sira constituency for the byelection while D K Shivakumar is in charge of RR Nagar constituency byelection. “Huli (Huliya as Siddaramaiah fondly referred) is trying for the defeat of the Bande” (D K Shivakumar) and “bande is trying the defeat of huli.” The Congress is in a pathetic condition in Karnataka. There is a fight for leadership in the Congress,” he mocked. “Owing to the infight between ‘Bande’ and ‘Huli’ there was violence in D J Halli in Bengaluru. Former Bengaluru mayor Sampathraj was the follower of D K Shivakumar while MLA Srinivasmurthy was the follower of Siddaramaiah. The investigation into the violence has revealed that to unseat Srinivasmurthy, Sampathraj joined hands with SDPI workers and engaged in riots,” said Kateel. “We are from Gomathe Vamsha and do not go back on our promise. We have acted as per the promises given to 17 MLAs in the past. They have been elected as MLAs and given the ministerial berth as well. The Congress MLAs are dejected over the infight in the Congress. Sixteen MLAs from Congress are eager to join the BJP,” he added. The central government will decide on the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine. There is no need for anyone to inform on the distribution, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-has-one-tiger-which-needs-to-be-sent-to-forest-nalin-kumar-kateel-906688.html
25-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||New Karnataka tourism policy draws flak over 'regional disparity'||The tourism department’s ambitious plan to develop select destinations across the state under Focus Tourism Destinations (FTD) has come under criticism for regional disparity. As per the Tourism Policy 2020-25 that was unveiled recently, select destinations in each of the 30 districts have been picked for development on priority. However, eight districts have been chosen for overall tourism development, with several questioning the intent of this move.  Speaking to DH, Hyderabad Karnataka Horata Samithi’s Razak Ustaad claimed that it was nothing but regional bias. “In the previous policy, they had not made district-wise bifurcation. They had identified tourist places across the state. However, this time the policy itself is partial. There are better places than the ones they have selected for special focus,”he said.  As per the policy, in eight districts - Chamarajanagar, Chikkamagaluru, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Kodagu, Shivamogga, Udupi and Uttara Kannada - all tourism destinations within these districts will be consideredas FTDs. As for the rest of the districts, important places have been picked for development. Badami, Basavakalyan, Kittur, Lakkundi, Munirabad are among the few of the destinations selected from north Karnataka districts.  The policy stated that the tourism department conducted a “detailed review” of the previously identified tourism destinations across the state along with other destinations that held promise for business, to identify theFTDs.  Tourism secretary T K Anil Kumar said the policy was purely based on research and analysis and the criticism did not hold ground. Research had shown that the southern tourism circuit, for example, Bengaluru-Mysuru-Coorg was “more vibrant”, he said, emphasising that the department had the best interest of the entire state. While previously, the government had identified 319 places of tourist importance, that list would still be valid,he added.  Former tourism minister Priyank Kharge of the Congress, however, felt that the department had taken on unrealistic ambitions by identifying whole districtsunder FTD. “Going by the tourism department’s budget, it is impossible to do justice to entire districts. A better approach would have been to consider places across the state based on footfall,” he observed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/new-karnataka-tourism-policy-draws-flak-over-regional-disparity-906630.html
25-10-2020||National||Govt waives interest on interest for loans up to Rs 2 crore||In a major relief to borrowers amid Covid-19, the Centre on Saturday asked banks to credit 'interest on interest' charged for loans up to Rs 2 crore in the six-month moratorium period between March and August. The moves will benefit those who took homes loans for home, education, automobiles, consumer durables, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and credit card dues. The scheme will be applicable irrespective of whether a borrower in the specified category took full moratorium on loans or took it partially or did not take it at all. Banks and lending institutions, after crediting the amount to the accounts of eligible borrowers, have been asked to claim the amount from the Central government. The government is expected to bear about Rs 6,500 crore on this account. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had offered a moratorium on repayments over these six months to help lessen the impact of the pandemic, but banks continued to accrue compound interest over this period. This was challenged in the Supreme Court. Thereafter, the government came up with the scheme to waive compound interest for loans below Rs 2 crore. Eight categories of loans have been identified for the purpose which should not have turned non-performing as on February 29, 2020. They are MSME, housing, education, loans for consumer durables, credit card loans, auto loans, personal loans to professionals and consumption loans. The scheme is applicable to banks, NBFCs and housing finance companies. The rate of interest will be as per the rate mentioned in the loan agreement in case of education, housing, automobile, personal and consumption loans. The SBI will act as the nodal agency for the government for settlement of claims. Lenders have also been asked to set up a grievance redressal for the scheme. Hearing the matter last week, the Supreme Court had said it was concerned about how the benefit of interest waiver would be given to borrowers. "Something concrete has to be done," a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said, adding that the benefits of waivers to borrowers of loans up to Rs 2 crore must be implemented as soon as possible. The top court told the advocates appearing for the Centre and banks that "Diwali is in your hand".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-waives-interest-on-interest-for-loans-up-to-rs-2-crore-906634.html

Bhagwat pointed out that India intends to be friendly with all. “This is our nature. But mistaking our benevolence for weakness and attempts to disintegrate or weaken us by sheer brute force is unacceptable. Our reckless detractors should know this by now,” he said in a message across the border. "The message sent by our leaders with a sense of self-respect and the indomitable ethical-patience of our citizens must compel China to reform its attitude but if push comes to shove we will not fall short of alertness, firmness and readiness,” said Bhagwat. “Until recently the philosophy of integrating the world on the basis of the market forces dominated but with the latest turn of events, the idea of safeguarding life and exercising international cooperation has started to take shape in the global mind,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-has-responded-effectively-to-china-rss-906698.html

Earlier this month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced additional budget of Rs 25,000 crore as capital expenditure (capex) on roads, defence, water supply, urban development and domestically produced capital equipment. Besides, the central government approved issuance of a special interest-free 50-year loan to states of Rs 12,000 crore for infrastructure development. Approval for this additional spending will be sought through second supplementary demands for grants, sources said. This was part of the third stimulus announced by the government earlier this month to boost demand during the festival season. The additional spending of Rs 37,000 crore is over and above Rs 4.13 lakh crore capex plan approved by the government in Budget 2020-21.  For various schemes of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, the government sought approval of additional spending through first batch of supplementary demands for grants last month. The second supplementary demands for grants usually presented during the winter session of Parliament. The government has assured various infrastructure related ministries and departments that it will provide more money if needed and it is ready to provide the additional funds even at the revised estimates level, sources said. Highlighting the importance of infra development, the finance minister recently said money spent on infrastructure and asset creation has a multiplier effect on the economy.  It not only improves current economy but also future GDP, she had said while announcing Rs 37,000 crore extra spending for infra development. Sitharaman last week exhorted central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) under coal and petroleum and natural gas to achieve by December 75 per cent of their planned capital expenditure (capex) target for 2020-21. This was the fourth in the ongoing series of meetings that the finance minister is having with various stakeholders to accelerate the economic growth amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While reviewing the performance of CPSEs, Sitharaman had said capex by CPSEs is a critical driver of economic growth and needs to be scaled up for the financial year 2020-21 and 2021-22.  The government had pegged capex spending of Rs 4.13 lakh crore for the current financial year, as per the Budget 2020-21.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-to-seek-parliaments-nod-for-rs-37k-crore-infra-push-in-2nd-supplementary-demands-for-grant-906729.html

The Defence Minister made the remarks after performing "Shastra Puja" -- the customary worship of weapons -- at the Sukna-based headquarters of the Indian Army's 33 Corps in Darjeeling district of West Bengal on the occasion of Dussehra. The Defence Minister was scheduled to perform the puja at Sherathang, a high-altitude border area near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Sikkim, but could not go there due to inclement weather, officials said. "India wants an end to the ongoing border tension with China and restoration of peace. This is our objective. But at times, some nefarious incidents keep happening. I am very confident that our soldiers will never allow even an inch of our land to be taken away by anyone," Singh said after performing the "puja". Chief of Army Staff Gen. MM Naravane and several senior officers of the Army were present on the occasion when the Defence Minister performed the "puja" at the key military base, which is responsible for guarding the LAC in the Sikkim sector. After performing the puja, Singh inaugurated a new road in Sikkim through a video-conference from Sukna. "I can say with confidence and on the basis of concrete information that the courage and deeds of Indian soldiers during whatever has happened at the India-China border in Ladakh recently will be written in golden letters by the historians," the minister said without elaborating. Twenty Indian soldiers laid down their lives while valiantly fighting a group of Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, an incident that had significantly escalated the border tension between the two countries. China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash, though it has officially admitted to have suffered casualties. According to Indian officials, China suffered "heavy casualties" in the incident. Indian troops also occupied a number of strategic heights in the Mukhpari, Rezang La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh, after the Chinese military attempted to intimidate them in the area on the intervening night of August 29 and 30. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row that began on May 5, following a violent clash in eastern Ladakh. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. The Defence Minister's "Shastra Puja" at the strategically important military base was a message to India's adversaries, a military official said. Singh has been performing "Shastra Puja" during Dussehra for the last several years, including during his tenure as the Union home minister in the previous NDA government. Almost all formations of the Indian Army along the LAC are on a very high level of alert in view of the border row with China in eastern Ladakh. The Defence Minister arrived at the Sukna-based headquarters of the 33 Corps on Saturday. In an address to a group of soldiers at the base on Saturday evening, Singh said India always tried to maintain good relations with its neighbours, but situations arose from time to time when its armed forces had to make supreme sacrifices to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. The Defence Minister also reviewed the combat preparedness of the Army during a high-level meeting at the military base. The Army has significantly bolstered deployment of troops and weaponry along the nearly 3,500-km-long LAC, including in the Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh sectors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-wants-to-end-border-tension-with-china-but-will-not-cede-an-inch-of-land-rajnath-singh-906731.html

In his monthly Mann ki Baat radio broadcast, Modi wished people on Dussehra and said that with various festivals coming up, they need to show patience and follow health guidelines in celebrating these auspicious occasions during the Covid times. The prime minister also asked people to keep the 'vocal for local' resolve in their mind and give priority to local products while shopping for festivals. The world is taking note of India's products, he said, citing the example of rising popularity of Khadi. The prime minister hailed the contribution of soldiers and their service to the nation. "We have to remember our soldiers, who are standing guard at the borders even in times of festivals. We must celebrate festivals while remembering them. We also have to light a 'diya' in our homes to honour these brave sons and daughters of mother India," he said. He also paid glowing tributes to India's first home minister Sardar Patel, whose birth anniversary falls on October 31, and asked people to work for the country's unity through their words and deeds.

Paul said the government is committed to strengthening the traditional system of medicine (homoeopathy and Ayurveda) as well as the modern system of medicine (allopathy). "It makes eminent logic that the best of traditional medicine and best of modern medicine therapies be brought together for a larger good of people and there are ways of practising integrated medicine," he told PTI. Paul pointed out that it has already happened to an extent, as yoga is now part of practice in several conditions like in hypertension. "There is a scope to align these approaches for the larger benefit of society... as a think tank, we are looking at many reform ideas in the health sector, aligning traditional and modern approaches for a larger good," he said. Integrative medicine is an approach that combines modern medicine with alternative systems like Ayurveda and yoga. India's National Health Policy (NHP) also recognises the need for integrated courses for ISM (Indian systems of medicine), modern science and Ayurgenomics (a combination of Ayurveda with the study of all the genes of an organism, called genomics). It also talks about getting AYUSH systems to contribute to 'meeting the national health goals and objectives through integrative practices'. Recently, a meeting chaired by Paul was held to begin formulating the new system.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/niti-aayog-looks-to-strengthen-homoeopathy-ayurveda-906746.html

The pharma company was given nod to continue with phase III clinical trials on October 22. Covaxin is being developed in association with the Indian Medical Research Council.(ICMR) In addition to Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India, who is developing a coronavirus vaccine called Covishield, is already in the midst of recruiting and vaccinating volunteers for its third phase of trials.  Prasad also said that there are talks of government approving the vaccine before the trials are completed for emergency use. "We are committed to doing all our phase-1, phase-2 and phase-3 clinical trials in its entirety, but I think the government may also be considering emergency use approval,” Prasad said, adding that the company is "not pushing for such approval." "Our intent is to develop everything to its logical conclusion in terms of empirical evidence and data, and efficacy data and safety data. But there are discussions, I guess, within the government about that (emergency use approval)," he added. The company had said on October 23 that the Phase I and Phase II vaccine trials were completed and had reached out to the drug controller for continuing with Phase III trials.

No-frills carrier SpiceJet is in the process of procuring a seaplane for the venture from the Maldives which is expected to arrive on October 26 for the first regular service on the about 205 km stretch. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier used a seaplane flight from Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. "The first seaplane service in the country is likely to be launched on October 31 from Sabarmati riverfront to Statue of Unity which will be a new beginning for the country... Infrastructure is ready for it on both the sides including the floating jetty," the shipping minister told PTI. The minister said SpiceJet is in the process of procuring a seaplane from the Maldives which is likely to land on October 26. He said benefits will be provided to the air carrier under the government's Udaan scheme. "Once launched this will give a major boost to tourism," the minister said and added that this will be one of its kind service with a 19-seater plane that can accommodate 12 passengers. The Gujarat government in July this year had cleared a proposal to enter into a tri-party agreement with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the construction of four water aerodromes under the regional connectivity scheme for seaplane service. A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used by seaplanes, float-planes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off. The water aerodrome was planned at the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, Sardar Sarovar dam at Kevadia in Narmada district, Shetrunji dam at Palitana in Bhavnagar district and Dhaori dam in Mehsana district. Mandaviya had reviewed seaplane projects in India recently. Sabarmati and Sardar Sarovar -- Statue of Unity route are included in the 16 seaplane routes identified in the country and hydrographic surveys of this route had been completed, as per the government. Mandaviya said that post the launch of this service, regular services are planned on various routes including Guwahati, Andaman & Nicobar and Yamuna to Tupper Dam in Uttarakhand. Earlier bullish on the growth prospects for seaplanes in India, SpiceJet’s CEO Ajay Singh had said this new mode of transport can boost the country's tourism sector in a big way as they can convert any pond into an airport and can make any river a runway. Seaplanes are typically fixed-wing aircraft with a much fewer number of seats and can take off from, and land on, water. While they have been in use since 19th century, they lagged behind full-fledged aircraft after heavy investments were made in setting up airports in the 20th century but have again been re-emerging on the scene as a niche segment. Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari during his tenure as Shipping Minister has been emphasising on the huge growth potential for seaplanes and has been pitching for manufacturing them within the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-first-seaplane-to-take-off-in-gujarat-on-october-31-906753.html

The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister on Friday had said that she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back. Mufti said she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state is restored. "I request your honour to consider her statements in the light of their seriousness, which are available on the public domain, as anti-national and anti-constitution of India and also de-recognise her party, PDP, as a genuine political party in J&K with immediate effect," senior BJP leader and in-charge of department of political affairs and feedback, Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo said in his formal complaint to the ECI. He alleged that the PDP president issued various outrageous statements against Parliament, parliamentarians, the national flag and symbol of the nation and also against the scheme of elections in the Union Territory.     "She didn't only keep herself confined to the usual political rhetoric on matters that are on her party's manifesto and agenda but went ahead to question the basis of the national flag, national symbols, sovereignty of parliament and dignity of the parliamentarians," the complaint read. "She even went to the extent to say that 'not to even touch the national flag and also not to contest any election till her dream flag, constitution and status of the UT are given back'," it said. Chrungoo, also a Kashmiri pandit leader, alleged that she even went to the extent to call names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath who are elected representatives of the people under the due process of the law and the Constitution of India. "Her offensive and anti-constitutional statements constitute serious contempt of Parliament and also 'privilege issue' against the ECI," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-leader-seeks-de-recognition-of-mehbooba-led-pdp-over-anti-national-remarks-906764.html

Raut's remarks came in the wake of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray being recently targeted by the opposition for not moving out of his house during the pandemic. Talking to reporters here, Raut said Thackeray has given directives to ensure that Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the state Assembly, gets the best treatment. Fadnavis on Saturday said he had tested positive for coronavirus. The BJP leader was admitted to a government-run hospital in Mumbai and his condition was stable, a party source said. After returning to Mumbai on Friday evening, Fadnavis got himself tested as some of the BJP leaders who had travelled with him during the Bihar poll campaign tested positive for coronavirus, the source said. Fadnavis also toured the flood-affected areas of western Maharashtra and Marathwada from October 19 to 21. "We were telling Devendra Fadnavis to take care. He will now realise that the situation outside is serious. The opposition was targeting the Chief Minister for not moving out," Raut said, when asked if Thackeray's annual Dusshera address on Sunday evening would target the BJP. He said Fadnavis has set a good example by getting admitted to a government hospital, and Thackeray has given directives to ensure he gets the best treatment. The Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson also said the Covid-19 vaccine should be for all citizens and its politicisation was not right. He further said the Shiv Sena has made arrangements to ensure Thackeray's Dussehra address reaches two crore people in the state. Had there been no Covid-19 outbreak, the Shivaji Park in central Mumbai would have been smaller for the "sea of Shiv Sainiks" who would have come to hear Thackeray's address, he said. Raut also pointed out that at the Dussehra rally last year, he said the next Chief Minister of the state would be from the Shiv Sena. Thackeray will deliver his Dussehra speech at the Savarkar auditorium opposite the Shivaji Park in the evening and it will be attended by 50 people, including MLAs, MPs from Mumbai, ministers and the CM's family members.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/devendra-fadnavis-will-now-realise-covid-19-situation-is-serious-sanjay-raut-906768.html

The cadres, including 10 women, turned themselves in at Barsoor police station, saying they were impressed by the district police's rehabilitation campaign and disappointed with the "hollow" Maoist ideology, Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava told PTI. Of these 32 cadres, 19 are natives of Bakeli village, four are from Korkotti, and three each hail from Udenar, Tumarigunda, and Matasi villages, he said. The police did not disclose their identity citing security reasons. These ultras belonged to the Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan, Krantikari Mahila Adivasi Sangthan, both frontal wings of Maoists, Chetna Natya Mandli (a cultural offshoot of Maoists), and Janatana Sarkar groups, Pallava said. They all were allegedly involved in attacks on police teams, polling parties, and triggering IED (improvised explosive device) blasts, he said, adding that four of them carried rewards of Rs 1 lakh each on their heads. In their statement, the cadres said they were disillusioned by the "hollow" Maoist ideology, and recent surrenders by their colleagues as part of the local police's Lon Varratu campaign encouraged them to quit the banned outfit, he said. They were given immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 and will be provided facilities further as per the government's surrender and rehabilitation policy, he said. Under the Lon Varratu (term coined in local Gondi dialect which means a return to your village/home) initiative, the Dantewada police have been putting up posters and banners in the native villages of Naxals, who carry cash rewards on their head and appeal them to return to the mainstream. Since the drive was launched in June this year, 150 Naxals have so far surrendered in the district, the police official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chhattisgarh-32-naxals-surrender-in-dantewada-906796.html

The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has urged for a transfer of the cases pending in the Delhi High Court, Meghalaya High Court and Gauhati High Court, which have challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, under which the notification was issued on October 23, 1993. The petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said in order to avoid multiplicity of litigations and conflicting views, the plea has been moved before the apex court. "Denial of minority rights to real minorities and arbitrary and irrational disbursement of minority benefits to majority infringes upon the fundamental right to the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth," the plea said. In his petition, the petitioner said Hindus, who are a majority community according to national data, are a minority in several north-eastern states and in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the Hindu community is deprived of the benefits that are available to the minority communities in these states, the plea said, adding that the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) should reconsider the definition of minority in this context. The plea has sought to declare section 2(c) of the NCM Act 1992 "void" and "inoperative" for being "arbitrary", "unreasonable" and "offending". The definition of "minority", according to Article 29-30 of the Constitution, has left leakages in the hands of the State, which shall be misused and are being misused for political benefits, the petition said, adding that the minority status be granted to Hindus in states where the number of the community members has decreased. The plea has sought the minority status for Hindus in six states and two Union territories, where the number of the community members has fallen according to Census 2011. The petition has stated that according to the 2011 Census, Hindus are a minority in six states -- Mizoram (2.75 per cent), Nagaland (8.75 per cent), Meghalaya (11.53 per cent), Arunachal Pradesh (29 per cent), Manipur (31.39 per cent), Punjab (38.40 per cent) -- and in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir (28.44 per cent) and Lakshadweep (2.5 per cent). "Their minority rights are being siphoned off illegally and arbitrarily to the majority population because neither the Centre nor the state governments have notified Hindus as a 'minority' under the National Commission for Minorities Act. Therefore, Hindus are being deprived of their basic rights," the plea has said. It has pointed out that Christians are in majority in Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland and there is a significant Christian population in Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, but they are treated as a minority community. Likewise, Sikhs are in majority in Punjab and there is a significant Sikh population in Delhi, Chandigarh and Haryana, but they are treated as a minority community, it said. Muslims are a majority in Lakshadweep (96.20 per cent), Jammu and Kashmir (68.30 per cent) and there is a significant representation of the community in Assam (34.20 per cent), West Bengal (27.5 per cent), Kerala (26.60 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (19.30 per cent) and Bihar (18 per cent). However, they are enjoying the "minority" status and communities, which are real minorities, are not getting their legitimate share, jeopardising their basic rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 of the Constitution, the petition has said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-in-supreme-court-seeks-transfer-of-petitions-challenging-minority-status-of-five-communities-906802.html

Started by Raja Nabakrishna Deb in 1757, the year of the Battle of Plassey, the household puja has taken a slew of health safety measures to contain the spread of the disease. "We have installed a sanitiser tunnel before the entrance of the courtyard where only 25 people are being allowed at a time. We have also arranged for thermal checking and made wearing of masks mandatory," said Soumit Narayan Deb, a descendant of Gopi Mohan who was adopted son of Nabakrishna. The puja is known as the Sovabazar Rajbari "Boro Taraf". "While thousands of people used to visit our premises during the puja days in the past years, the situation is different this time. The turnout is much less. But we have not barred visitors as we believe in the inclusiveness of the Durga Puja festival," he said. At the opposite of the Sovabazar Rajbari is the 'Choto Rajbari', also built by Nabakrishna later when his son Rajkrishna was born. There too his descendants have been organising Durga Puja for 231 years. The Sovabazar Rajbari "chhoto taraf" puja, however, banned the entry of visitors due to the pandemic situation, and are allowing close family members, Alok Krishna Deb, in- charge of this puja, said. Among other prominent "bonedi barir" (household) pujas in the city, the more than 200-year-old Durga Puja at the Janbazar residence of Rani Rashmoni is also not allowing visitors to enter its premises. "Apart from visitors, we could not let distant relatives and family friends in the courtyard where the goddess has been put on pedestal. Only close relatives are bein allowed," family member Prasun Hazra said. The selected people, allowed inside in strict adherence to all health safety protocols, could go up to a point near the idols. Only the priest and his assistant could go to the idols, he said. The Daw household puja in Jorasanko area of the city is alow allowing close relatives only inside the courtyard. "Due to the Covid-19 situation, we can't take the risk. Only close relatives after all mandatory checking have been allowed inside," a family member said. No guided tour of these household pujas was organised this year due to the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/low-visitor-turnout-at-centuries-old-durga-puja-in-kolkata-906842.html

Police personnel were deployed in the village since morning as part of security measures. At the protest site, farmers raised slogans against the Centre and the BJP-led state government demanding the withdrawal of the agriculture laws. Later, as part of their protest, they burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Similar protests by BKU activists were also held at some other places in the state. Later, talking to reporters, Singh said that the agitations against the new farm laws will continue till the Union government withdraws them. Earlier this month, the Kurukshetra police had booked Singh for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Modi. The complaint was lodged at the Shahbad police station, barely hours after the BKU leader had appealed to farmers to burn effigies of the prime minister's during Dussehra, which is being celebrated today. The complaint was lodged by social activist Sahil. Reacting to it, Singh had alleged that the government is using such tactics to suppress the voice of farmers protesting against new farm laws. The BKU Haryana chief was booked for allegedly “promoting enmity” between different groups and the intent to provoke the "breach of peace" besides other charges, police had said earlier.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bku-activists-hold-protest-against-centres-farm-laws-906844.html

The Chief of Army Staff is scheduled to hold extensive talks with the top civilian and military brass of Nepal including his counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa on a range of key issues such as further boosting the management of the nearly 1,800 km-long border between the two countries. "The Chief of Army Staff is scheduled to visit Nepal from November 4 to 6 with an aim to strengthen overall ties including in areas of defence and security," a highly-placed government source told PTI. In continuation of an age-old tradition that started in 1950, Gen Naravane will be conferred with the honorary rank of 'General of the Nepal Army' by Nepalese President Bidya Devi Bhandari at an event in Kathmandu. India also confers the honorary rank of 'General of Indian Army' to the Nepal Army Chief. It will be the first high-level visit from India to Kathmandu since the ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory. India's decision to send the Army Chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region, Earlier this month, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmarese Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties. Nepal is important for India in the context of its overall strategic interests in the region, and leaders of the two countries have often noted the age-old ‘Roti-Beti’ relationship. Land-locked Nepal relies heavily on India for the transportation of goods and services. Nepal’s access to the sea is through India, and it imports a predominant proportion of its requirements from and through India. According to official data, Nepal's imports from India in 2017 were worth USD 6.52 billion while its exports to the country were pegged at USD 420.18 million. The figure for China, which was second on the list of countries from which Nepal imported its requirements, was five times lower than that of India. On the security side, India's strategic thinkers are concerned over reports of China grabbing Nepalese territories in a number of locations along the borders between the two countries, though Kathmandu had clarified recently that there were no such encroachments. "According to reports, Beijing is fast moving forward and further pushing Nepali boundaries by encroaching more and more landmass. The actual scenario could be worse as the ruling Nepali Communist Party (NCP) is trying to shield the expansionist agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)," said an expert on the condition of anonymity. It is learnt that India is for expanding overall ties with Kathmandu provided its security interests are protected. The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. In the midst of the row, Gen Naravane said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to the road at the behest of "someone else", in an apparent reference to a possible role by China in the matter. The comments triggered angry reactions from Nepal. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it. In its reaction after Nepal's lower house of parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country. India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to "reclaim" them from India. The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-army-chief-general-mm-naravane-scheduled-to-visit-nepal-from-november-4-6-with-an-aim-to-reset-ties-906854.html

In his monthly Mann ki Baat radio broadcast, Modi wished people on Dussehra and said that with various festivals coming up, they need to show patience and follow health guidelines in celebrating these auspicious occasions during the Covid times. The prime minister also asked people to keep the 'vocal for local' resolve in their mind and give priority to local products while shopping for festivals. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India wants an end to the border tension with China in eastern Ladakh, but at the same time asserted that Indian soldiers will never allow even an inch of the country to be taken away by anyone. The Defence Minister made the remarks after performing "Shastra Puja" -- the customary worship of weapons -- at the Sukna-based headquarters of the Indian Army's 33 Corps in Darjeeling district of West Bengal on the occasion of Dussehra. In a controversial remark, BJP’s Uttar Pradesh chief Swatantra Dev Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided when the country would be at war with Pakistan and China. His remarks on Friday came amid tension at the Line of Actual Control between India and China, where the two countries have massed troops. With a total of 70,78,123 people having recuperated from Covid-19, the national recovery rate for the disease has touched 90 per cent, while 62,077 people have recovered in a span of 24 hours as against 50,129 new cases of the infection reported in the same period, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday. This achievement is matched by the downward spiral fall in the number of active Covid-19 cases, which was maintained below the seven-lakh mark for the third successive day, it added. South Korea's richest and most powerful industrialist Lee Kun-hee, who turned Samsung Electronics into one of the world's biggest tech companies, died today. The 78-year old inherited the chairmanship of the Samsung group in 1987 —  founded by his father as a fish and fruit exporter — it was already the country's largest conglomerate, with operations ranging from consumer electronics to construction.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-samsung-chief-lee-kun-hee-no-more-pm-urges-people-to-light-diyas-to-honour-security-forces-906856.html

Onion prices showed a declining trend even in producing areas. For instance, in Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asia's largest wholesale onion market, onion prices dropped by Rs 5 per kg to Rs 51 per kg in just one day after the government's order on stock limits. Among consuming markets, government data showed that wholesale onion prices in Chennai declined to Rs 66 per kg on October 24 from Rs 76 per kg on October 23. Similarly, the rates in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Bhopal too fell by Rs 5-6 per kg to Rs 70 per kg, Rs 64 per kg and 40 per kg, respectively, in just one day, the data showed. The prices dropped following some improvement in daily arrival of onion in these consuming markets. According to the data, the daily arrival in Delhi's Azadpur mandi, the world's largest vegetable market, increased to over 530 tonnes, while it improved to 1,560 tonnes from 885 tonnes in Mumbai. In Chennai, daily arrivals rose to 1,400 tonnes from 1,120 tonnes earlier. Similarly in Bengaluru, daily arrival in mandis rose to 3,000 tonnes from 2,500 tonnes. However, in cities such as Luckdown, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Kolkata and Pune, the arrivals are yet to increase. On October 23, the government had invoked the Essential Commodities Amendment Act and imposed stock limits of 2 tonnes for retailers and 25 tonnes for wholesalers till December 31 in order to check hoarding and cool down prices which have touched Rs 100/kg in some retail markets. "The improvement in arrival shows that some traders were hoarding and have started offloading it on fear of action. The other reason is that onion is a perishable commodity and one cannot hold it for long, especially in areas facing heaving rainfall," a senior government official said. The government has also taken several measures to boost domestic availability and check price rise. It has banned exports and relaxed norms for import of the commodity. Besides, the government is releasing onion from its buffer stock in the retail market and key mandis to provide relief to consumers from price rise. Onion prices have come under pressure due to heavy rainfall in key growing states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh that has damaged the standing kharif crop, which is expected to hit mandis from next month. The government is estimating about 6 lakh tonnes fall in onion production to 37 lakh tonnes this kharif season.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/onion-price-drops-by-up-to-rs-10/kg-in-consuming-markets-on-govt-action-against-hoarding-906858.html

The commanders will also deliberate on a slew of long-pending reform measures like cutting down on ceremonial practices and non-military activities to ensure a rational distribution of resources, they said. Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane will chair the Army Commanders' Conference (ACC), which is an apex level biannual event that formulates important policy decisions through a collegiate system of deliberation. It will be attended by all Army Commanders, Principal Staff Officers (PSOs) of the Army headquarters, and other senior officers. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria will address the commanders on Tuesday, the sources said. "The Army Commanders will carry out a comprehensive review of the security challenges facing the nation including the situation in eastern Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir," said a source. The situation in eastern Ladakh remains tense as both Indian and Chinese armies deployed over 50,000 troops each along the LAC following the escalation of the standoff that began in early May. The sources said that the commanders will exclusively deliberate on matters relating to human resource management in the Army on Monday while they will carry out an in-depth discussion on Wednesday on various agenda points highlighted by the top Army Commanders. There will be a discussion on issues flagged by the Commander-in-Chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, which is India's only tri-services command.

The bypolls, scheduled for November 3, are seeing a bitter tussle between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress and the terms used include 'item", "lucha lafanga", "rakhail" etc. "There are enough provisions in the model code of conduct and the People's Representation Act to deal with such indecent language. However, I am of the view that the use of such language cannot be checked by punitive provisions," Rawat told PTI. He said politicians are usually banned for a few days for the use of unparliamentary words but such moves do not last long. Rawat claimed politicians had lost the opportunity to gain knowledge in the age of social media and do not have the time to study new things. "High standards in language should be promoted so that politicians can enhance their knowledge of basic issues and policies. This will be more effective and meaningful in the national interest," Rawat said. He said politicians use such language to get media coverage, which they receive in the form of news headlines, while real issues get sidestepped.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punitive-provisions-cant-check-indecent-remarks-by-politicians-says-former-chief-election-commissioner-op-rawat-906875.html

The protesters described the three farm legislation introduced by the Centre as “black laws” and raised slogans against the BJP-led Centre. They demanded the withdrawal of the laws. Farmers under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Mod in Amritsar. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said farmers burnt effigies of the PM and Union government at several places in the state. Jamhoori Kisan Sabha general secretary Kulwant Singh Sandhu said they set effigies on fire in Phillaur and Adampur of Jalandhar district. The protesting farmers accused the Centre of trying to "ruin" the farming sector at the "behest" of some corporate houses. Farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws in the state since last month. Though they had eased their "rail roko" agitation, they continue to stage sit-ins outside fuel stations, toll plazas and residences of several BJP leaders in the state. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws will pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government, however, has been saying that the laws passed by Parliament recently amid a vociferous protest will raise their income, free them from the clutches of middlemen and usher in new technology in farming.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/punjab-farmers-burn-effigies-of-pm-modi-union-govt-906882.html

Exuding confidence of winning the bypolls, necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda in April, Khattar in another tweet said that the byelections will mark an end of the "15-year Congress misrule" there. Khattar said that he is convinced that people will vote for the BJP on the basis of development work initiated by his government. Meanwhile, Kurukshetra BJP MP Nayab Singh Saini said Khattar and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala will be campaigning jointly for the bypolls. They will seek votes for BJP candidate and Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt who is locked in a contest with Congress candidate Induraj Narwal and the INLD's Joginder Singh Malik. “On October 29, the chief minister will be campaigning in Baroda while on October 30, Dushyant Chautala will canvass in the constituency. On October 31, both will hold joint meetings and address programmes in five villages,” Saini told reporters in Gohana on Sunday. Saini said Yogeshwar Dutt has been backed by their alliance partner Jannayak Janta Party and will register a comfortable win as people will vote for development. “People have made up their mind to vote for the BJP-JJP combine. They will vote for development,” Saini said. Dushyant Chautala too on Sunday expressed confidence of winning the seat. He said supporters of the BJP and the JJP, the two parties who forged an alliance after the 2019 assembly polls, will vote for Yogeshwar Dutt. Dutt, who had contested the 2019 assembly polls from Baroda as a BJP candidate, had lost to Shri Krishan Hooda. "This time, he will get combined votes as an alliance candidate. He will get over 90,000 votes and register a historic win in Baroda," said Dushyant. He said the JJP chief and former MP Ajay Singh Chautala will also be campaigning in Baroda. With the BJP-JJP completing one year in office on October 27, Dushyant Chautala hit out at the Congress and INLD, saying, "When we came together and formed the government with the BJP, they used to say our government will not last six months." "When we completed six months, they used to say the government will fall before completing a year. But today as we complete one year, I want to tell them that we will not only complete the remaining four years of our term but also take Haryana on a new growth trajectory," he said. He said during the last one year, the BJP-JJP dispensation has taken a number of steps for the welfare of people. He said the Centre's farm laws will prove beneficial for farmers and the agriculture sector. Chautala said the state government will set up warehouses with a capacity of seven-lakh metric tonnes during the next one year. These warehouses will be constructed through panchayats, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/opposition-indulging-in-caste-politics-cm-khattar-906899.html

Officials said US Secretary of Defence Esper will be given a tri-services guard of honour at the lawns of South Block in the Raisina Hills on Monday afternoon. It is expected that the two sides may finalise the long-pending BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The BECA will provide for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries. The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years. In June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner" intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners. The two countries inked the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation. The two countries signed another pact called COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high-end technology from the US to India. The first edition of the two-plus-two dialogue was held in Delhi in September 2018 after the mechanism was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump. The second edition of the dialogue took place in Washington in December last year. The new framework of the ministerial dialogue was initiated in order to provide a forward-looking vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-defence-secretary-mark-esper-to-arrive-in-india-on-october-26-906907.html
25-10-2020||National Politics||MP bypolls: Congress, BJP slug it out as campaign heats up||For the first time in the history of Madhya Pradesh, as many as 28 assembly seats are going to bypolls at one go, giving the contest virtually the status of a "mini assembly election" with main rivals Congress and the BJP pulling out all the stops for victory of their candidates. Twenty-five of these seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned and joined the BJP, which again formed its government in March this year, just 15 months after losing power to India's oldest political party. Resignations by Congress MLAs reduced the strength of the assembly from the original 230 seats to 205, paving the way for the return of saffron rule in the state. Three other seats fell vacant due to the death of the sitting legislators, taking the number of such assembly segments to 28 - the highest at any one point of time in the Madhya Pradesh history. A significant feature of the November 3 by-elections is that they are being held under the shadow of Covid-19 and the polling centres will have a different look in view of EC- mandated protocols related to coronavirus. The BJP at present has 107 MLAs and it needs to win just nine more seats to reach the magic figure of 116 - the simple majority mark in the 230-member house. In contrast, the Congress with its current strength of 88 legislators needs to win all the 28 seats to reach the majority mark of 116. Though mathematical calculation is loaded in favour of the BJP, the final outcome will be decided by a host of other factors as well, including caste and development issues, said a political analyst. When Babasaheb Ambedkar framed the Constitution, he made a provision for bypolls in the event of death of a sitting legislator or an MP. "But he had never ever thought about a situation where byelections will be held because of horse trading. There was no provision for it in the law," said state Congress president Kamal Nath. Nath has been repeating these lines almost in all his bypoll rallies while targetting the BJP. "Today bypolls are being held in the country, but in Madhya Pradesh they are being held in 25 seats not because of the death of sitting MLAs, but due to trading and auctioning of legislators." It has tarnished the image of Madhya Pradesh in the entire country, said a bitter Nath, who had to resign as chief minister in March after a section of Congress MLAs revolted and quit, reducing his government to minority. Most of these rebel Congress MLAs were considered close to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who also walked out of the party and joined the BJP. Countering Nath's charge, Scindia said, Yes, I had ensured the fall of the Congress government because it had betrayed all." "Both Nath and former chief minister Digvijaya Singh have deceived people and my fight is with these betrayers," he said. The former Union minister alleged that the Nath administration was mired in corruption. They had turned the state secretariat into a den of corruption by starting a transfer industry with middlemen having a direct access in corridors of power, while peoples representatives were asked to go away (chalo-chalo), Scindia said. The Rajya Sabha MP had made these remarks at a bypoll rally apparently referring to allegations levelled by a section of Congressmen that whenever they went to meet Nath for any development-related work, he used to tell them "chalo- chalo", citing fund crunch. "Betrayer" has emerged as the most used term by both the Congress and the BJP while targetting each other in campaign rallies. While the BJP claims the Congress betrayed people's trust while in power, the opposition party uses the word to target Scindia for switching sides. Scindia also said that in 2018, the Congress was able to form its government in the state because for the first time in 70 years, the party had won more than 18 seats in the Gwalior-Chambal region, considered his stronghold. However, the people from the region were "betrayed" by the Congress leadership in the state, the former Guna MP said. Stakes are high for Scindia in these bypolls as out of the total 28 seats, 16 are in the Gwalior-Chambal region from where his supporters had won in 2018 on Congress tickets and joined the BJP more than seven months ago. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, while addressing rallies in support of BJP candidates, has been targetting Nath. Chouhan said while Nath, when he was chief minister, always cited lack of funds whenever legislators went to meet him for development works, there was no dearth of money for Chhindwara (Naths constituency) and events like IIFA. The CM said the Nath government lasted for only 15 months due to its insensitive attitude towards people and their representatives. While Nath is leading the Congress campaign from the front, Digvijaya Singh has confined himself to his pockets of influence. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has also campaigned in various constituencies for Congress candidates. Former ministers in the Nath cabinet, including Sajjan Singh Verma, P C Sharma, Jaivardhan Singh and former leader of opposition Ajay Singh, have been campaigning vigorously for the Congress, which is aiming to notch up a respectable tally. From the BJP side, besides Chouhan and Scindia, a battery of Union ministers and senior leaders have jumped into the campaign trail, showing the importance the saffron outfit is attaching to these bypolls. These include Narendra Singh Tomar, Thawarchand Gehlot and Faggan Singh Kulaste (all central ministers), Uma Bharti, Kailash Vijaywargiya, Vishnu Dutt Sharma and state ministers like Narottam Mishra, Gopal Bhargava, Bhupendra Singh and Kamal Patel, among others. The high-decibel campaigning so far in the midst of Covid-19 has generated a lot of heat with comments from Congress leaders against Chouhan and women and child development minister Imarti Devi hogging limelight and triggering controversies. Though the main contest is between the Congress and the BJP, the Mayawati-led BSP and some other smaller political parties are also in the fray. A total of 355 candidates are trying their luck in these 28 seats, whose results will be announced on November 10. A dozen BJP ministers, who joined the party after quitting the Congress and were inducted in the Chouhan cabinet, are also in the arena and they will have to win their seats to retain their current posts. Both the BJP and the Congress are confident of winning these bypolls, but it remains to be seen who will have a cracking Diwali as the results will be announced just four days ahead of the festival of lights.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mp-bypolls-congress-bjp-slug-it-out-as-campaign-heats-up-906691.html

"Dear Ravi Shankar Prasad ji, we don't expect you to restore anything but unless you are suggesting the Supreme Court has surrendered its independence & takes dictation from you please don't presume to know what the Hon judges will decide," Abdullah wrote on Twitter. Prasad, the Union law minister, on Saturday said the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 will not be restored. The Supreme Court is hearing multiple petitions filed by several mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir, including the NC, against the Centre's August 5, 2019 decision to revoke the special status of the erstwhile state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/dont-presume-what-sc-will-say-on-restoration-of-article-370-omar-takes-a-swipe-at-prasad-906742.html

His remarks on Friday came amid tension at the Line of Actual Control between India and China, where the two countries have massed troops. The BJP leader linked his claim to the beginning of construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya following a Supreme Court judgment and the abrogation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. “Like the decisions on Ram Mandir and Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided when there would be war with Pakistan and China,” he is heard saying in a video clip on social media. "Sambandhit tithi tai hai," he said in Hindi, claiming that a decision has been taken on the date. Singh was speaking at an event at the home of BJP MLA Sanjay Yadav, who released the video. In his address, Singh compared Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party workers with “terrorists”. When asked about the remarks, local MP Ravindra Kushwaha said the UP BJP president made them to boost the morale of party workers. Swatantra Dev Singh’s reported remarks appear to deviate from India’s stated stand. On Sunday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reiterated that India wanted an end to the border tension with China while asserting that it will not allow “even an inch” of land to be taken away by anyone.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-modi-has-decided-date-of-war-with-china-pakistan-up-bjp-president-906772.html
25-10-2020||National Politics||RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat welcomes Centre's new agriculture reforms, education policy||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday praised the Centre for the agriculture and labour reform bills recently passed in Parliament and said new policies should aim to make farmers aware of the modern agriculture science. Addressing the Sangh's annual Vijayadashami rally here which was this time attended by only 50 'swayamsevaks' due to the Covid-19 guidelines, he also welcomed the government's new education policy. Stressing on self-reliance, he said while designing the agricultural policy, farmers should be empowered to control their seed banks, create manure, fertilisers and pesticides on their own or procure from neighbouring areas. "The new policies should aim to make our farmers aware of modern agricultural science and also enable them to blend that knowledge with the time-tested, contextually relevant traditional knowledge," Bhagwat said. The policies should be such that a farmer is able to use the research findings and sell his produce without getting trapped under the pressure of market forces and middlemen, the RSS chief said. Incorporating these changes immediately within the present agrarian and economic system might not be possible. In that case, the policies should focus on creating a conducive environment to translate the suggested changes into reality, he said. "Some positive steps in the direction of assimilating this swa (selfhood) in our economic, agriculture, labour, manufacturing and education policy have been taken," he said. He further said a new education policy formed on the basis of extensive deliberations and dialogue has been launched and the Sangh has also welcomed it. The RSS chief also said that 'vocal for local' is a great start in the exploration of possibilities of 'swadeshi'. A policy-making process where all people and parties concerned discuss and deliberate extensively and draw consentient conclusions fosters the spirit of oneness and trust among all. "Fortunately, we can rely on the prevailing political leadership to engender the feeling of oneness and trust with regards to matters small and big among all people," he said. He further said the need to decentralise agriculture and manufacturing sectors by supporting small and medium scale enterprises and creating job opportunities has drawn the attention of many intellectuals alongside the policy-makers in this time of Covid-19. Those employed in these sectors, from small-time and seasoned entrepreneurs to farmers, are all eager to taste entrepreneurial success for the nation. "The government will need to provide extra cover for them so they can attain world-class standards that will allow them to stand a competitive chance alongside other economic giants of the world. "Along with the allocation of funds, its actual disbursement on the ground has to be ensured so that they can restart again after six months of the corona crisis," he said. Bhagwat said the consciousness that has prevailed in the aftermath of Covid-19, the realisation of the true meaning of self', a spirit of oneness with all, the importance of cultural values and environmental awareness, should not be disregarded. "We must not drop the momentum, lose sight of these indispensable values and fall back in a pattern of insensitive behaviour. Gradual and consistent practice of right conduct and responsible behaviour of an entire society alone can bring rewards," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-welcomes-centres-new-agriculture-reforms-education-policy-906794.html

He said that Congress leaders opposed the abrogation of Article 370 and indirectly supported Pakistan. "At a time when the entire country was celebrating after the abrogation of Article 370, Rahul Gandhi contended that injustice was done to the people in Srinagar," Nadda said while addressing party workers in Rajasthan through video conference. He was speaking after inaugurating two BJP offices and laying the foundation of six offices in various districts of the state. "It is unfortunate that the Opposition has gone directionless. It has started opposing the country in its antagonism towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi," he said. The BJP chief said that party workers have the responsibility to support government initiatives to ensure that they reach the people as well as to engage the Opposition in political discourse by giving the right information. Terming the agrarian reform laws as revolutionary, he said Prime Minister Modi freed the farmers of restrictions, and they can now sell their produce in any market. He said that the Modi government has worked to secure the country "on land and in air and water", and referred to the development of border infrastructure that has facilitated swift transport of Army personnel and logistics. Talking about the newly inaugurated offices in the state, Nadda said while others became a "party of a family", the BJP was like a "big family" in itself. He appreciated the work done by the party across the country during the coronavirus lockdown. Nadda also targeted the Congress government in Rajasthan, alleging that the state is reeling from corruption and lawlessness. He said that the state government lacks a commitment towards the people of the state, and the BJP should work to return to power in the next election.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/unfortunate-that-opposition-has-become-directionless-bjp-chief-jp-nadda-906841.html
25-10-2020||National Politics||Congress has formed 'radical syndicate' with Jamaat-e-Islami, PFI; RJD also its part, says BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi||The BJP on Sunday accused the Congress of forming a “radical syndicate” along with the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Popular Front of India and supporting extremism in the country, and asked if Tejashwi Yadav and his party RJD in poll-bound Bihar are also part of the alleged arrangement. Senior BJP leader and Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the opposition party has entered into an understanding with the Welfare Party, a political outfit of the Jamaat-e-Islami, and with the Popular Front of India (PFI). Political group Jamaat-e-Islami has been banned by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, while the PFI is an alleged radical group facing allegations of providing funds for protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “The grand old party has formed a brand-new alliance with radical organisations -- Jamaat-e-Islami and PFI. For the greed of power, the Congress has formed this ‘radical syndicate’ to support radicalism in the country,” Naqvi claimed while addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters.  “We want to ask Tejashwi Yadav whether along with Congress, his party (RJD) has also made an understanding with Jamaat-e-Islami and other radical elements in Bihar. These are questions of national security, not politics,” Naqvi said. He said Shiv Sena, which has formed a government in Maharashtra in alliance with the Congress, would also have to answer similar questions. Naqvi also claimed that when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was contesting the 2019 general elections from Wayanad in Kerala, people across the country were shocked to see more flags of Jamaat-e-Islami than of his party in the political rallies there. The Minister also alleged that Gandhi never misses a chance to meet the families of PFI members and those who were arrested by police for involvement in anti-national activities. This was an apparent reference to the recent meeting of Gandhi, a Kerala MP, with the wife of a journalist from the state who was arrested while on his way to Hathras in UP, to meet the family of the Dalit woman who died last month after being allegedly raped by four upper-caste men. The journalist, Siddique Kappan, is alleged to have links with the PFI. The BJP in alliance with the JD(U) and other parties is facing a challenge from an alliance of the RJD, Congress and left parties in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-has-formed-radical-syndicate-with-jamaat-e-islami-pfi-rjd-also-its-part-says-bjp-leader-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-906855.html

"If there was a delay of over two months, it was not on account of Maharaja Hari Singh but on account of the then Prime Minister Nehru who was not forthcoming in his approach and was instead being led by cues and inputs from Sheikh Abdullah (former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir)," said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel. He said if the first Home Minister of the country Sardar Patel had been given a free hand to handle the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir just as he was handling the other princely states of undivided India, not only the history of the Indian subcontinent would have been different, but also the accession of the state would have happened much earlier. "The part of Jammu and Kashmir presently under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as PoJK, would have also been a part of independent India," the minister told PTI. He further said history has been unfair to Maharaja Hari Singh and hoped that in the changed milieu of today, the record will be put straight and all the misgivings cleared for the benefit of future generations. The minister said historians need to address why Prime Minister Nehru violated the democratic propriety by intruding into the domain of his own Home Minister Sardar Patel. "To put the record straight, it was in fact finally Sardar Patel’s intervention which facilitated the landing of the Indian forces in Srinagar and saved the rest of the parts of the state also from being occupied by Pakistan," said Singh, a Lok Sabha member from Jammu and Kashmir’s Udhampur constituency. He claimed that the then Prime Minister chose backdoor parleys with Abdullah over a free and frank discussion with Maharaja Hari Singh, who was at that time the legitimate and official head of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. The minister said the draft of the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh was the same as that signed by the heads of other princely states, without any conditions or terms attached. "Article 370 and 35-A were anomalous additions which came later after Hari Singh had relinquished the throne," Singh said. The instrument of accession was signed on October 26, 1947, between Maharaja Hari Singh, the then ruler of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the Indian government to accede J-K to independent India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/accession-of-jammu-and-kashmir-with-india-final-complete-union-minister-jitendra-singh-906871.html

Uddhav to BJP||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday slammed the BJP over its poll promise of free Covid-19 vaccine in Bihar, adding does that party think those from other states hail from Bangladesh or Kazakhstan. He was speaking at the Sena's annual Dussehra rally, held at the Savarkar hall in Dadar due to coronavirus norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park. "You promise free Covid-19 vaccine in Bihar, then are people of other states from Bangladesh or Kazakhstan," Thackeray said. "Those speaking like that should be ashamed of themselves. You are at the Centre," he added. In a veiled attack on actress Kangana Ranaut, Thackeray said some people come to Mumbai for bread and butter and abuse the city by calling it Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). "Those crying for justice for Bihar's son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra's son," Thackeray said, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Thackeray also warned BJP not to divide people over caste, creed and religion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/free-covid-19-vaccine-in-bihar-are-others-from-bangladesh-uddhav-to-bjp-906892.html

No immediate reaction was available from the BJP. Four chief medical officers of Hindu Rao Hospital, which is run by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), were transferred the Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis (RBIPMT) on Saturday, according to reports. This came in the midst of protests by resident doctors and paramedical staff from three NDMC-run hospitals including Hindu Rao over non-payment of their salaries for months. Addressing a press conference, AAP leader Durgesh Pathak alleged BJP leaders are continuously threatening the protesting doctors and asking them to withdraw their protest. "Bharatiya Janata Party is now taking the path of hooliganism to solve the situation. Yesterday, the BJP-ruled MCD transferred four CMO-level doctors of the Hindu Rao Hospital. The reason behind this decision is that these doctors were supporting the protest of the doctors and nurses," he said. Such a harsh step was taken against these senior doctors for taking the side of the protesting doctors and nurses, he said. Five doctors of the Hindu Rao Hospital began an indefinite hunger strike on Friday, demanding that their pending salaries for the last three months be released. Earlier, doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital, Kasturba Hospital and RBIPMT held a protest at Jantar Mantar to press for their demand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-resorting-to-hooliganism-to-suppress-voices-of-protesting-doctors-aap-906900.html

Speaking at the Sangh's annual Vijayadashami rally, which this time was limited to an indoor event attended by 50 'swayamsevaks' due to Covid-19 guidelines, Bhagwat said India needs to be militarily better prepared against China. Many countries are now standing up to China, he said. Claiming that China was shocked at India's response to its intrusion, Bhagwat said, "Our defence forces, government and people responded sharply to China's efforts to encroach on our territories." "We don't know how it will react. So the way forward is to be alert and prepared. We should be more powerful than China in terms of military preparedness, economic conditions, international relations and also relations with neighbouring countries," he said. The government should forge an alliance against China with immediate neighbours like Nepal, Sri Lanka and others, he said. "India needs to grow bigger in power and scope than China," he added. "China encroached on our borders amid the pandemic," he said, adding the world knows the expansionist nature of that country. He cited Taiwan and Vietnam as examples of the Chinese expansionist designs. "We intend to be friendly with all. This is our nature. But mistaking our benevolence for weakness and attempts to disintegrate or weaken us by sheer brute force is unacceptable. Our detractors must know this by now," he said. Responding to Bhagwat's remarks on China, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Deep inside, Mr Bhagwat knows the truth. He is just scared to face it. The truth is China has taken our land and GOI & RSS have allowed it." Bhagwat said India is a Hindu Rashtra and Hindutva is the essence the country's selfhood. "When the RSS says Hindustan is a Hindu Rashtra, it does not have any political or power-centred concept in its mind," Bhagwat said. He said the term Hindutva has been distorted by appending a ritualistic connotation to it. The Sangh believes the term is applicable to all 1.3 billion people in the country who call themselves the sons and daughters of Bharatvarsh...and who are proud of the heritage of their ancestors, he said. On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Bhagwat said it is not against any particular religious community, but "some people misled our Muslim brothers" claiming it was aimed at restricting their population. "There was opposition to CAA claiming it was being used to check the Muslim population in the country. In fact, no Indian citizen was threatened due to CAA," he said. Before the issue could be discussed further, the focus shifted to coronavirus, which overshadowed all other topics, he added. "We need not fear coronavirus, but should be alert and cautious. We cannot stop living. Coronavirus is spreading but fatalities are less. Due to the pandemic, we have started learning the importance of hygiene, cleanliness, environment, family values all over again," he said. "Coronavirus has given rise to challenges of unemployment. Many lost jobs and labourers are now returning to cities. But the jobs may not be there. The challenge is to create employment opportunities in different places," he said. Bhagwat said before the pandemic, several issues which were in the public discourse took a backseat. "Article 370 was abrogated, the country accepted the Supreme Court verdict on Ram temple with patience and understanding," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-should-be-bigger-than-china-in-power-scope-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-906902.html

The Covid-19 testing facility, which started operating on September 12 at the Delhi airport, is available only for international arrivals currently. Earlier in the day, Genestrings issued a press release saying, "The (testing) facility has now been extended to air travellers leaving India for other countries." However, the company later revised its press release, saying that the testing facility "will soon" be extended to air travellers departing from India. "Notably, international travel rules require passengers travelling from one country to another to produce Covid negative reports," it added. The lab uses RT-PCR tests and provides reports within 4-6 hours. "The test is available 24/7 and is priced at Rs 2,400 as mandated by the Delhi government," the release said. "As more people are now taking up international travel, Delhi Airport authorities felt the need to provide the testing facility to outbound passengers as well," said Rajat Arora, Director, Genestrings Diagnostic Center. The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) started the Covid-19 testing facility on September 12 at the multi-level car parking area of Terminal 3 in collaboration with Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, which is a group company of Yashoda Hospitals. Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July. India started scheduled domestic passenger flights on May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-airport-starts-covid-19-testing-for-international-departures-genestrings-906612.html

Areas like Mundka, Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar and Bawana recorded "severe" levels of air pollution, authorities said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said some locations entered the "severe" zone but that will be shortlived as winds are expected to increase slightly. It said the air quality could improve on Monday. "Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) is in the 'very poor' category with few locations entering a higher zone but that will be shortlived. This is mainly because the extremely calm local surface winds, which were prevailing yesterday, are likely to increase slightly and may further pick-up by October 26," the SAFAR said. It added that the AQI is predicted to remain in the "very poor" range, but without further deterioration. "Slow improvement in the current condition is expected by October 26, leading to a middle range of 'very poor'," it said. The SAFAR said the stubble-fire count stood at 1,292 on Friday and its share in Delhi's pollution was nine per cent. The AQI was recorded at 346 on Saturday, at 366 on Friday and at 302 the previous day. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". Ten monitoring stations in the national capital entered the "severe" zone on Friday, according to SAMEER, the AQI-monitoring mobile application developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The figures are based on data collected from 36 monitoring stations in the city. The Delhi government has kick-started its "Red Light On, Gaadi Off" anti-pollution campaign, for which it has deployed 2,500 environment marshals at 100 traffic signals across the city to generate awareness and curb vehicular pollution. The drive will be carried out in all the 70 Assembly constituencies of the national capital till November 15.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-continues-in-very-poor-state-906736.html

25-10-2020||North and Central||Persistence pays: Scrap dealer's son clears NEET in ninth attempt||Unlike other aspirants, cracking an all-India entrance exam for a medical college was not just a dream for 26-year-old Arvind Kumar but a way to give a befitting reply to people at whose hands his family faced humiliation for years. A resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Kushinagar district, Arvind says he decided to become a doctor as his scrap dealer father, Bhikhari, was subjected to constant humiliation by villagers because of his work and name, which in English means a “beggar”. However, the success did not come easy. He first appeared in 2011 for the All-India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT), now replaced by the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). Arvind says the success came only in his ninth attempt this year, in which he secured all-India Rank 11603. He bagged Rank 4,392 in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. Arvind says at any moment, he did not feel disheartened. "I tend to convert negativity into positivity and extract energy and motivation from it," says Arvind. He gives the credit of his success to his family, self-belief and consistent hard work. Arvind says his father, Bhikhari, had studied up to Class 5 while his mother Lalita Devi has never been to a school. He grew up seeing his father facing humiliation just because of his unusual name. Leaving them behind, his father had to move to Jamshedpur’s Tatanagar for work around two decades ago. After some years, for better education of his three children, Bhikhari shifted his family from their village to Kushinagar town, where Arvind completed Class 10 with a mere 48.6 per cent marks. He showed a slight improvement in Class 12, scoring 60 per cent marks. It was here that Arvind made up his mind to become a doctor to fulfil his father’s wish. Attempt after attempts continued for nine years without success. "But improvement in marks at every attempt was a ray of hope that kept me concentrated at my goal," he says, adding that the change in the exam structure to NEET did disturb his preparation a bit. He moved to a Kota institute in 2018 for coaching fearing that he may miss achieving his goal due to the age bar for the exam. His father said over the phone from Jamshedpur’s Tatanagar that he had to work 12 to 15 hours a day to meet the expenses of his son’s stay in Kota. "I worked for 12 to 15 hours daily to earn enough to meet educational expenses of my children and would visit the family, around 800-900 km away in Kushinagar, once in six months for a brief period," Bhikhari says. "My son Arvind has proved his commitment to the goal. I am very proud of him," he further says. His brother Amit always motivated Arvind for improvement in marks at every attempt. It was Amit, who first suggested that he should move to Kota to take coaching there, the father says. "I am happy and my family is proud of me that I am now going to be the first doctor in my village of around 1,500-1,600 people," says Arvind. He still says villagers are threatening to trap his family in a criminal case to spoil his chances of getting a government job. But Arvind says he is now hopeful of securing admission to a medical college in Gorakhpur and wants to become an orthopaedic surgeon. "Even a minor bone injury hurts a lot. Increasing road accidents trouble me a lot so I just wish to serve people as an orthopaedic surgeon," he says.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/persistence-pays-scrap-dealers-son-clears-neet-in-ninth-attempt-906771.html
25-10-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradseh bypolls: 18% candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves, says report||Out of 355 candidates contesting in Madhya Pradesh bypolls, 63 (18 per cent) have declared criminal cases against themselves, according to a report by poll rights group Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). Eleven per cent or 39 candidates have declared serious criminal cases against themselves, the report said. Serious criminal cases are non-bailable offences with over five years of imprisonment. Among the major parties, 14 (50 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the Congress, 12 (43 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the BJP have declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, the poll rights group said. Eight (29 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the BSP, four (29 per cent) out of 14 candidates analysed from the SP and 16 (nine per cent) out of 178 independent candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, it said. Among the major parties, six (21 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the Congress, eight (29 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the BJP have declared serious criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, the ADR said. Three (11 per cent) out of 28 candidates analysed from the BSP, four (29 per cent) out of 14 candidates analysed from the SP and 13 (seven per cent) out of 178 independent candidates have declared serious criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, it said. While one candidate has declared case related to murder (IPC Section-302) against himself and seven candidates have declared cases related to attempt to murder (IPC Section-307) against themselves, the ADR said. Ten (36 per cent) out of 28 constituencies are red alert constituencies. Red alert constituencies are those where three or more contesting candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves, the report said. "The directions of the Supreme Court have had no effect on the political parties in selection of candidates as they have again followed their old practice of giving tickets to around 18 per cent candidates with criminal cases. All major parties contesting in Madhya Pradesh by- elections have given tickets to 25 per cent to 50 per cent candidates who have declared criminal cases against themselves," it said. The Supreme Court in in February had asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates with criminal background and why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates. The details of the financial background of the candidates was also given in the report. "Out of the 355 candidates, 80 or 23 per cent are crorepatis. Among the major parties 23 or 82 per cent out of 28 candidates analysed from BJP, 22 or 79 per cent out of 28 candidates analysed from Congress, 13 or 46 per cent out of 28 candidates analysed from BSP, 2 or 14 per cent out of 14 candidates analysed from SP and 14 or 8 per cent out of 178 Independent candidates have declared assets worth more than Rs. 1 crore," it said. By-elections are being held to 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh on November 3.

With this, 26 MLAs have quit the Congress in the state since March this year. "Lodhi has resigned and his resignation was accepted today," MP Assembly's Protem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma said. "He gave his resignation on Friday, but I asked him to rethink over it for two days. He called me last night saying he was firm on it and wanted his resignation to be accepted on the auspicious day today," Sharma said. BJP state spokesman Rajnish Agrawal later said Lodhi has joined his party. Lodhi represented Damoh seat in the state Assembly. There are speculations that one more Congress MLA may also quit the party. By-elections to 28 Assembly seats in the state are scheduled on November 3. Twenty-five of these seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned and joined the BJP, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led state government. Most of these rebel Congress MLAs were considered close to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who also walked out of the Congress and joined the BJP. Besides, three seats fell vacant due to the death of their sitting MLAs. The BJP at present has 107 MLAs and it needs to win just nine more seats to reach the magic figure of 116 - the simple majority mark in the 230-member house. The Congress's strength in the House has now been reduced to 87.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ahead-of-madhya-pradesh-bypolls-one-more-congress-mla-resigns-from-party-joins-bjp-906784.html

The Maharaja Bhupinder Singh Sports University will be developed at Rs 500 crore, of which Rs 60 crore will be invested in the initial phase for the development of academic and administrative blocks and hostels on the campus, according to a government statement. The chief minister recalled the contribution of his grandfather Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, whose 129th birth anniversary falls on Sunday. The university is being established in his memory. The university will help in the scientific development of sportspersons, Singh said, adding that he wanted to see Punjab develop as a sports hub and its sportsmen and coaches equipped with scientific knowledge. He thanked the panchayat and people of Sidhuwal who contributed land free of cost for the sports university. The residents of Sidhuwal had earlier donated land for a law university and have also offered another 100 kilas (acres) for other projects, the chief minister said, announcing a Rs 50-lakh grant for the village. Singh expressed hope that staff and students will be able to move into the campus by 2022. They will benefit immensely from the university's multiple courses, many of which are adopted from UK's Loughborough University, he said. He assured that despite the Covid-19 crisis, his government will provide more funds to the university for speedy completion of the construction work. Singh also extended Dussehra greetings to the people of Patiala, who, he said, "suffered a lot" due to the coronavirus infection. He urged them to take all precautions amid projections of a spike in cases in November-December. Other development projects which were launched included surface water-based water supply for Patiala city (Rs 503 crore), the development of a heritage street near Qila Mubarak (Rs 43 crore), and a new bus stand on Rajpura Road (Rs 65 crore).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-lays-foundation-stone-of-sports-university-in-patiala-on-dussehra-906797.html
25-10-2020||North and Central||J&K: Protests against Mehbooba Mufti's remarks on national flag||Protesting against PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti's remarks on the national flag, a group of youths took out a march outside the party office on Sunday and tried to hoist the tricolour atop the building but were stopped by police. The incident came days after the Peoples Democratic Party president said she is not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year are rolled back. Mufti had said that she would hold the national flag only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state is restored. Amid chants of “Tiranga ka apmaan nahi sahenge (will not tolerate the insult of tricolour)" and anti-PDP sloganeering, the youths led by activist Amandeep Singh came on two-wheelers and attempted to hoist the national flag on the PDP headquarters. However, they were stopped by the police personnel deployed at the PDP office, officials said, adding the protesters later dispersed peacefully. “We have no affiliation with any right-wing party. We are nationalist by core and will not tolerate any insult to the tricolor, which is our pride and honour,” Amandeep Singh told reporters. Singh had on Saturday hoisted the national flag on the boundary wall near the main entrance of the PDP office and had a heated argument with two senior party leaders, including former legislator Firdous Ahmad Tak. Before leaving, Singh had said that he would return with more youths on Sunday to unfurl the national flag at the building. After the BJP demanded her arrest over alleged “seditious" remarks, Mehbooba Mufti said in a tweet on Saturday that the Indian flag stands for diversity and peaceful co-existence among all. “If anyone has insulted the Tiranga it is BJP that persecutes minorities and sows division and hatred…,” the former chief minister alleged. On Saturday, the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration that is fighting for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir met in Srinagar and named National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah as its chairman and Mehbooba Mufti as its deputy chairperson. Abdullah asserted that the seven-party alliance is an anti-BJP platform and not an anti-national grouping.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-protests-against-mehbooba-muftis-remarks-on-national-flag-906814.html

The accused Anis Beg and Yusuf Beg were arrested on Saturday for the death of Nazir Beg (70), whose body was found nearly three weeks ago in an agricultural field in Bhalwa village under Jansath police station area, SHO Deepak Chaturvedi said. Police had registered a case against unidentified persons and a post-mortem was done on the body. During investigation, it came to light that the two grandsons were involved in their grandfather's murder case and police arrested them for questioning. The accused have confessed that Nazir Beg was murdered after he had refused to share his land with them in a will. During interrogation, they said that the senior citizen had written a will in favour of Anis and his mother because Nazir was living with them. After the will was formalised, the beneficiaries started harassing the elderly man for only parting with a part of the property. Nazir warned them that he will revoke his will if this continued. Angered over this, Anis with the help of a cousin brother Yusuf murdered Nazir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-youth-held-for-killing-their-grandfather-over-property-tussle-in-uttar-pradesh-906821.html

It started snowing in Drass and its adjoining areas, including Zojilla pass and Mina-Marg along the 434-km Srinagar-Leh national highway, in the morning and so far two to four inches of snow has accumulated on the ground, officials said.             However, the traffic on the Srinagar-Leh national highway was progressing smoothly till the last reports were received.              The early snowfall this year caused concern among the residents of Drass who said that the winter stocking of essential commodities was not completed yet. "The early closure of the Srinagar-Leh highway, the lifeline of Ladakh, might trigger scarcity of essentials as the outbreak of Covid-19 delayed the stocking operations this year,” Abdul Majeed, a resident of the area, said.              A government official said if weather permits, the administration would try its best to keep the highway open for a longer duration this time. "Last year, the highway was closed on November 9 following snowfall but reopened and kept open till December 10. The process of stocking of essential commodities is continuing and every effort will be made to keep the highway open for a longer duration to provide enough time for the refilling of the stocks," he said.   He said the local administration would review the situation later and if the need arises, the traffic will be stopped on the highway.               "If the snowfall continues for the next few hours, we will be forced to stop traffic on the highway as a precautionary measure to avoid any untoward incident due to slippery conditions," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/drass-adjoining-areas-experience-seasons-first-snowfall-906848.html

He was speaking on the 8th Sunday of '10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute' campaign against the vector-borne disease. Kejriwal changed water from potted plants and checked other sources of stagnant water at his residence under the campaign. The anti-dengue campaign was also supported by celebrities, including singer Shankar Mahadevan, who encouraged people to follow preventive measures against the disease. "On the 8th Sunday of Delhi's fight against dengue, I inspected my house for accumulated water and changed it. To prevent dengue, we have to stop the breeding of mosquitoes. Just like last year, dengue is under control in Delhi. Delhi is defeating dengue for the second consecutive year," Kejriwal said in a tweet.  The species of mosquito which causes dengue thrives in clean stagnant water. Water that deposits in pots, coolers, unused tires, vases and such sources need to be drained under the campaign.  Mosquito breeding can be checked by adding a small layer of oil or petrol to the accumulated water and covering water tanks with lids. The campaign encourages people to devote ten minutes at 10 am on Sundays for eight weeks to check mosquito breeding and encourages them to influence their 10 friends to follow suit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dengue-is-under-control-in-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-906874.html

The officials maintain that all safeguards are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease as the jails resume pre-Covid-19 activities. The Delhi Prisons comprises Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails. The first case of coronavirus was reported in Rohini Jail on May 13. A total of 93 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19 till October 24. Out of these, 84 inmates have recovered, two died and seven are active cases, data shared by the Delhi Prisons said. Besides, 223 prison staff have tested positive, out of which, 210 recovered and 13 are active cases, it said. According to jail officials, Central Jail No 2 of Tihar and Jail No 14 of Mandoli, which house the bakeries, have gradually started increasing the quantity of sweets they prepare, just like how they used to earlier. ‘Gulab Jamun’, ‘laddu’ and ‘coconut burfi’ are among the most sought after sweets prepared in these bakeries and later supplied in jails of Delhi Prisons for sale. The inmates can purchase these sweets and outsiders can get them through shops in the jail complex. These shops were closed in view of the pandemic situation, but they have now opened and gradually started supplying material. "The bakeries inside the jails were functional earlier amid the pandemic. However, less quantity of sweets was prepared. The preparation is done with extra precautions keeping in mind the risks involved in the pandemic situation," Sandeep Goel, Director General (Delhi Prisons) said. He said the prisons are moving towards normalcy by taking all due precautions against coronavirus. "We have also resumed ‘mulaqat’ between the inmates and their family members with due precautions. But now the inmates are allowed to meet their kin once a month to avoid overcrowding as against twice a week earlier,” Goel said. The jail administration had suspended the bi-weekly mulaqat (family meeting) following the Covid-19 outbreak. It, however, resumed the meetings from October 1, but now only one member of a family is allowed to meet the prisoners. Earlier, three members of a family were permitted. Since March, all activities inside the jails were suspended, but now the administration has given its go-ahead to tasks like painting ‘diyas’ (lamps) and manufacturing candles. With Diwali approaching, the jail authorities said the inmates of Central Jail No 4 of Tihar have started painting and decorating earthen diyas. These diyas are usually purchased from outside but painted by the prisoners and later sold through the shops in the jail complex, they said. Also in Jail No 6, which houses women members, the inmates have started manufacturing candles, the officials said, adding that they are quite popular during Diwali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/from-resuming-mulaqat-to-making-diyas-and-sweets-delhi-jails-inch-closer-to-normalcy-906878.html

25-10-2020||Opinion||Being nosy? There will be a price to pay||Being nosy is second nature to most of us in India. When seated next to any Indian above a respectable age on a flight, I ready myself for the inevitable onslaught of questions. The interrogation begins with family questions – ‘How many siblings do you have?’, ‘How have your parents let you travel by yourself?’ and goes all the way to questioning career choices: ‘Why are you studying religion instead of engineering or medicine?’ And I haven’t even mentioned marriage yet. Best I don’t. But these last few months, the media has been channelling its inner Desi too, to horrific effect. Everyone seems to have developed very strong feelings about who is really culpable for Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, and whether Rhea Chakraborty should have been granted bail or not. And the particularly bad satire that passes for TV journalism has been inexcusable in this regard. So why not look at stories from the ever-reliable Panchatantra about why it is disastrous to poke one’s nose in other people’s affairs? The first story is a rather popular one. Once, a temple was being constructed in the city. When the architects and workers had gone for lunch, some monkeys made their way to the construction site. One of these monkeys, curious by nature, peered at a half-cut log of wood. The carpenter had split the log halfway and driven a wedge in to hold the log apart until he returned from lunch. Now the inquisitive monkey sat on the log comfortably, his—well, let’s just say his tail— hanging down in the slit of the log. “This is all wrong,” he thought. “The log has not been split exactly midway.” And he forcibly pulled out the wedge. I shudder to tell you what happened next. The next story is about a jackal who literally got in between two battling rams. Seeing the bloodbath as the two rams went at each other, the jackal was sorely tempted to get himself a share of the meat. He impatiently waited until the rams separated from each other, and then he went in between the two. But the two rams charged at each other again, and the jackal was killed instantly by the impact. Even if the fights that the media covers aren’t as deadly, a wise Sanskrit saying tells us, “It is better to keep away from the puddle than to wash oneself after”. The final story is for those who give unsolicited advice, however well-intentioned or appropriate it may be. In the winter, a group of monkeys got very cold and tried to warm themselves. But they had no fire. After a lot of searching, they saw a firefly and convinced themselves that it was fire. They made a great show of fetching logs of wood, dried grass, and leaves to fuel the imaginary fire, and they covered the firefly with them. Then they proceeded to place their hands over the imaginary fire, rubbing themselves with their hands. One of the monkeys went even further and began blowing on the firefly to help it blaze brighter. A bird who was flying by could simply not bear it. He had to tell the monkey how very wrong he was. He flew down near the monkey’s ear and began to advise him: “My friend! Your efforts are of no use; that is not fire. It is just a firefly. It cannot give you any warmth.” The monkey ignored him. But the bird kept swooping down and repeating his advice. After multiple attempts, the monkey was furious, not at his own stupidity, but at the bird’s advice. He grabbed him when he flew down and killed the poor bird for giving him advice he did not want. Seeing as these animal stories have become allegories for news coverage, the turn of phrase seems even more appropriate: ‘Media circus’!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/being-nosy-there-will-be-a-price-to-pay-906625.html

Those sparkly bits of plastic that make ornaments twinkle, wrapping paper glimmer and wreaths shimmer are increasingly seen as an environmental hazard. In response, three British retailers are eliminating them from gift bags, Christmas crackers and other holiday staples. Thus a more sustainable and guilt-free Christmas will be had by all. Or so the thinking goes. It’s not a crazy idea. Tiny pieces of plastic are indeed a threat to the environment, and retailers can make a difference in reducing them. But doing so will require far more than banning holiday baubles. It’ll mean rethinking how everyday plastics are manufactured and marketed to consumers in the first place. Plastic pollution, especially in the ocean, is typically associated with single-use items such as bags and straws. But in recent years, scientists have also focused on the profusion of so-called microplastics, which are about the size of a sesame seed or less. Some of these are generated by the breakdown and abrasion of larger products. But a significant percentage are “primary microplastics,” such as synthetic clothing fibers, worn tire treads, and the microbeads used in products like toothpaste and body scrubs. They add up. Humans release 1.5 million tons of primary microplastics into the ocean annually, a sum equivalent to one disgorged plastic bag for every person each week. Such pollutants now make up as much as 31% of all ocean plastic, and they turn up all over the marine environment, from the ocean surface to the seafloor to the guts of a wide range of fauna. Fixing the problem isn’t easy, in part because the major sources of microplastics aren’t easily regulated. A comprehensive 2017 study of the problem found that just 2% of such plastics are derived from microbeads, which several countries have started restricting. The leading source — at 35% — turned out to be clothes made from synthetic textiles (such as holiday-themed polar fleece pullovers) that had been run through the laundry. In second place, at 28%, were the abraded bits of car and truck tires that wash from roads into waterways.  Glitter didn’t even make the list. But it has become something of a pop-culture pariah nonetheless. In 2017, glitter-skeptical studies inspired a British daycare chain to stop ordering the stuff for its preschoolers. In 2018, “Strictly Come Dancing,” a British television show, announced that glitter would no longer be welcome on contestants’ costumes. Retailers soon followed, with Waitrose Ltd. making plans to ban glitter from its own-brand products. In recent weeks, John Lewis Partnership Plc and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc have taken similar steps. These efforts won’t do much to reduce marine plastics (boat paint, not Christmas, is the leading market for glitter). But they do offer retailers a way to burnish their environmental bona fides without having to meaningfully alter how they operate. Morrisons recently went so far as to tell the BBC that it adopted its anti-glitter stance so customers can enjoy the holidays “without worrying about the environmental impact.” Shoppers are unlikely to be fooled by such rhetoric for long. As anti-plastic sentiment grows globally, British consumers are already demanding sustainable products and shopping experiences. In time, they’ll expect retailers and brands to address the products that are actually contributing to the problem. The good news is that several companies are on the right track. Leading apparel brands, including Patagonia Inc., Adidas AG and Hennes & Mauritz AB, have acknowledged that their synthetic garments are a major source of plastic microfiber pollution. Some are researching better manufacturing methods, while others are educating consumers about how to care for garments so that they pollute less. Retailers could play an important role in amplifying that message. They could start by marketing best practices for managing synthetic garments and offering products such as filter bags and front-loading washers that help reduce fiber pollution. In the long term, these efforts should pressure manufacturers into creating more sustainable products and nudge consumers to think twice about the environmental impact of their clothing. That won’t bring back the once-beloved holiday glitter. But it’ll ensure that retailers aren’t just faking it when they say they’re going green.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/banning-glitter-won-t-save-the-oceans-906745.html
25-10-2020||Opinion||To retire rich, don’t leave too much to your kids||By Andy Mukherjee Like self-improvement books, the purpose of pension adequacy surveys is to make us feel lousy about ourselves.Lousy and scared: We haven’t saved enough because we’re myopic and lack self-control. We don’t have a retirement plan, and it’s getting late. That next avocado toast may deny our future selves a pair of reading glasses. And the nagging chases us right into our graves. At the back of our minds, there's always the guilt that we should be leaving something — actually, a lot — to our children. Yet, after you throw in the bequest motive, the avocado toast is truly toast. So perhaps we shouldn’t bother having kids? Think about it: If our rationality wasn’t bounded, if we weren’t so conditioned to enjoy the present, if we could all do the probability and payoff math for every situation, and discount future utility correctly, would any of us ever walk out without an umbrella... or fall in love? But we do, and will. So why should our approach to money be any different, and why, for instance, should it be a surprise that 51% of Indians don’t have a retirement plan? People who do have plans aren’t doing a whole lot better. In the US, a third of 5 million defined contribution accounts for which Vanguard does the record keeping had a 2019 balance of less than $10,000. The median account balance was less than $26,000. And this was before Covid-19 withdrawals. Global life expectancy went up by five years between 2010 and 2015, the fastest increase since the 1960s. A post-pandemic boost to healthcare investment may make us all live longer, on average. Don’t be surprised if those retiring in 2035 need an extra five years or more of future income because of longevity alone. Where will that money come from in a low-yield environment? The most obvious answer is that retirement will keep getting postponed. In 1996, only 14% Americans saw themselves working beyond 65 years of age. Last year’s figure was 45%. The other strategy may be a natural byproduct of desperation. The nest egg promised by the superannuation industry will seldom prove sufficient after paying fund managers’ exorbitant fees. Nearing the end of their working lives, savers will buy riskier products. A Fidelity International Ltd. survey shows that 48% of younger Hong Kong residents allocate 25% or less of their savings to equities, while 22% of older workers have at least 75% of their holdings in stocks or shares. There’s a third trick, and most Asian cultures know it. Kobe University economist Charles Yuji Horioka is a scholar of our desire to financially enrich our progeny. In January, he co-authored a new paper highlighting the difference between those Japanese who want to leave a legacy for altruistic reasons, and those who use it strategically to exercise intergenerational leverage. The former will work both harder and longer, while those who want to be looked after by their children in old age will put in longer hours, but retire early to maximize the care they receive. They’ll work harder, not longer. Asians naturally don’t want to die working, and many societies have some form of non-family safety net. Japan has a public long-term care insurance. In South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia, retirees expect the government to play a role in ensuring income security. Yet Asians know it’s not enough. Horioka’s own past research has shown the Japanese and Chinese have a strong bequest motive. Indians have an even keener wish. Given the country’s youthful demographics, constrained state finances and underdeveloped pension markets, even limited financial assistance for the elderly may have to be “purchased” by them from the next generation. (That such help won’t be freely given by children is now a well-established fact. Asian family values are no longer as robust as they used to be.) Perhaps Indians are already strategic with their bequest motive. They aren’t postponing the act of giving to their final years. They’re doing it now. One of the world’s hottest education technology unicorns is Byju’s, an Indian online tutoring company valued at $11 billion after its last financing round. Bangalore-based Byju’s recently paid $300 million to acquire Mumbai-based WhiteHat Jr, which teaches coding to children. For $3,999, WhiteHat promises kids younger than 14 exposure to “full commercial-ready utility apps.” So this is a form of early bequest. If junior hits upon the idea for the next Facebook or Uber, the parents can retire today. Otherwise, the kid can always go work in Silicon Valley and send money home, grateful for a timely $3,999 investment the parents couldn’t really afford. In either scenario, there won’t be a need to give much more on one’s deathbed. Glaring wealth inequality makes it risky to bequeath anything more than the family pet in the will. As economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez have forcefully argued, inheritance taxes should be 50% to 60%, and even higher for bigger bequests. So the choice is either to spend the money on one’s own betterment, or to give it early to the offspring. Today’s workers can use the money. They can re-skill themselves to stand up to the robot overlords and stay employed for longer. But spending the same sum on the education of a couple of teenagers may offer superior returns. It may even be the only long-term investment that beats a broad equity index fund. That’s the retirement plan Indians and many perhaps struggling middle-class people everywhere are on. They just forgot to tell the wealth manager, who’s still shaking his head about how little clients are saving.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/to-retire-rich-don-t-leave-too-much-to-your-kids-906800.html
25-10-2020||Opinion||US President Donald Trump is one of the world’s lamer demagogues||By Pankaj Mishra Four years after his shock victory, U.S. President Donald Trump seems to be running on empty. Opinion polls predict a win for former Vice President Joe Biden. In some Democratic circles, the word “landslide” is being jubilantly whispered. It seems that Trump is finally being judged on his performance, especially his calamitous response to the coronavirus pandemic. His Republican colleagues have begun to recoil from him. The president himself, already complaining about rigged elections, seems to be expecting defeat. And it is too late for him to learn from two of his fellow elected autocrats and demagogues — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — who continue to win elections despite presiding over multiple political and economic disasters. Two self-proclaimed outsiders to the political system, Erdogan and Modi also rose to political power on the back of anger and disaffection with the establishments in their respective countries. Railing against the corruption and nepotism of local elites, they endeared themselves to numerous left-behinds. Like Trump, they connected with the lived experience of millions of people — the feeling of being scorned as well as excluded by establishment politicians and the mainstream media. The biggest asset all three leaders had was this acute sense of reality. It allowed them to renew visions of national greatness, asserting that these could be realized once the old elites had been effectively sidelined. Unlike Trump, however, Modi and Erdogan have diversified their means of self-perpetuation.     For one, they have been far more successful than the U.S. president in forging new realities for their audiences through conspiracy theories and fake news, which has helped them avoid crushing judgment on their performances. They not only mastered digital technology and social media, they’ve managed to control the legacy media through a regime of intimidation that has silenced and marginalized critics. Though successful in packing the Supreme Court, and assured of stalwart support from Fox News, Trump could not begin to imitate Modi and Erdogan’s long march through national institutions, from the education system and television channels to the military.   Even Republicans rallied relatively late around Trump. Modi and Erdogan have long had dedicated ideological cadres working for them. One sign of their success is that Modi even managed to benefit electorally from demonetization — his shock withdrawal from circulation of nearly all currency notes, which broke the back of the Indian economy long before the pandemic. Having effectively created a whole new world of feeling and thinking, Modi convinced enough Indians that he had done the right thing in his pursuit of rich and corrupt elites. Though guilty of a botched lockdown in the early days of the pandemic, Modi’s Hindu nationalist regime more recently dodged responsibility by blaming the virus on the handiwork of “corona-jihadists.” To the victims of his blunders, Modi invokes the Hindu value of sacrifice, arguing that pain and privation are the price individuals pay for national greatness. Erdogan’s persona as a faithful Muslim similarly helps many devout Turks identify with him. Trump confronts defeat partly because he can neither draw upon a spiritual and ethical tradition (as distinct from QAnon), nor appeal any longer to enlightened self-interest. He loudly denounces China and rails against “cultural Marxists.” But menacing images of the internal and external enemy, indispensable to any demagogue, don’t seem to have become electorally consequential outside Trump’s base of white voters without college degrees. Moreover, this base has shrunk in four years, part of a long-term demographic decline, and Trump has conspicuously failed to reach out to an expanding and politically significant demographic: minorities and college-educated white voters. In that sense, Modi and Erdogan appear to have mastered the art of the deal better than Trump, continuously shoring up their power with canny coalitions. Though an avowed Islamist, Erdogan is now allied with the secular and ultra-nationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Modi has successfully expanded, often with the help of small regional parties and secular politicians, his influence in states where he previously had little presence.   Modi and Erdogan also continue to benefit from a fragmented opposition. Trump, on the other hand, has struggled against serious political and legal challenges right from the beginning of his term. With his manifold bungles, he has united a unique and formidable opposition against him, spanning several ethnic/racial groups and socio-economic classes, as well as ideologies ranging from the Green New Deal to the Lincoln Project. The malign energies of the far right that Trump unleashed won’t fade quickly. But Nov. 3 is likely to expose the extraordinarily narrow and rickety platform on which this very stable genius perched for four years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-president-donald-trump-is-one-of-the-world-s-lamer-demagogues-906885.html

The patient’s son, Aslam N, a resident of Basaveshwaranagar explained that his mother first came down with a fever on August 19. “A day later, she was reporting pain in the waist and we bought her some over-the-counter drugs to help break the fever. By August 22, the fever had subsided and her appetite improved, but she still complained of pain around her waist. By the next morning, she was unconscious. Her oxygen saturation was 93%,” he said. The patient was admitted to HBS Hospital. Veeresh B S, manager at the hospital, confirmed that the patient was unconscious when she was brought to the hospital. “Her oxygen saturation levels were between 60% and 70%. She was placed in the ICU where she has remained since the day of admittance,” he said. However, a preliminary RT-PCR test found the patient negative for Covid-19. “But when the chest X-rays revealed a distinctive scarring in her lungs, we knew she had Covid-19,” Veeresh added. Dr C N Manjunath, Director of Jayadeva Hospital and nodal for Covid-19 testing in the state, explained a small percentage of Covid-19 cases test negative for the disease on both antigen tests and on the RT-PCR method. “The accuracy rate of both are not 100%. At the same time, some patients will never test positive on RT-PCR. However, they are what we call, HRCT positive,”he said. “Covid-19 creates specific lesions or scarring. If this is seen in scans, we must assume the patient is Covid positive,” Dr Manjunath explained. He added: “In such rare cases, it is possible that the virus is not present in the throat or nasopharyngeal regions from where swabs samples are collected. Therefore, the tests would be negative.” Veeresh explained that while the patient’s health had stagnated for a long time, she was showing reduced dependency on supplied oxygen in the last few days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-woman-with-covid-19-spends-63-days-in-icu-906638.html

25-10-2020||West||CAA does not oppose any particular religious community: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat||Hindutva as a word is applicable to all Indians, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Sunday. He also said that 'Muslim brothers' were misled by those who waned to oppose the CAA and the law is not against any community. Addressing the annual Dasshera rally in Nagpur virtually, Bhagwat said, “Hindutva is the word expressing our identity along with the continuity of its spirituality-based traditions and its entire wealth of value systems in the land of Bharat. Therefore this word is applicable to all 1.3 billion people. According to him, ‘Hindu’ is not the name of some sect or denomination, not a provincial conceptualisation, neither a single caste’s lineage nor privilege of speakers of a specific language. “It is a common denominator that honours and encompasses innumerable distinct identities,” Bhagwat said. Reiterating the Sangh Parivar’s concept of Hindu and Hindutva, Bhagwat said: “When Sangh says ‘Hindustan’ is ‘Hindu Rashtra’ it does not have any political or power centered concept in its mind. Hindutva is the essence of this Rashtra’s ‘Swa’ (self-hood). We are plainly acknowledging the selfhood of the country as Hindu.” He said that Hindu culture has expressed itself in diverse forms. “But, some groups are trying to spread hatred and aggression in society by creating insecurity among them, stating that diversity will be finished if they identify themselves as 'Hindu',” he noted."Acknowledgement of the fact that the emotional spirit of Bharat, its acceptance for and support to multiple belief systems and faiths, is a by-product of the Hindu culture, traditions and Hindu thought,” he said. On the issue of CAA, he said, “CAA does not oppose any particular religious community But those who wanted to oppose this new law misled our Muslim brothers by propagating a false notion that it was aimed at restricting the Muslim population." “Using CAA, opportunists unleashed organised violence in the name of protests. Even before something could be thought out, coronvairus crept in. In the background, the efforts by rioters and opportunists to reignite the conflict still continue,” said Bhagwat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/caa-does-not-oppose-any-particular-religious-community-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-906695.html

This is probably one of the longest fire-fighting operations in the city in recent times. Earlier this month, a blaze at a cutlery market in south Mumbai took almost 45 hours to be extinguished. The fire at the City Centre Mall in Mumbai Central area broke out on the second floor of the basement-plus-three- storey structure at 8.50 pm on Thursday. "It was a level-5 (massive) blaze and was doused around 5 am on Sunday," a fire brigade official said. Around 14 fire engines and 17 jumbo tankers were engaged in the operation, he said, adding that cooling operations are underway. Five fire brigade personnel, including a deputy fire officer, received injuries during the fire-fighting operation, but all of them are stable and discharged from hospitals, the official said. The fire was initially categorised as level 1 (minor), but was upgraded to level-5 after flames spread to other parts of the building, he said. Over 3,500 people from an adjacent residential high- rise were evacuated as a precautionary measure, he said. The Mumbai Fire Brigade had given a 'brigade call', in which fire engines are called from all agencies in the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/blaze-at-mumbai-mall-doused-after-56-hours-906703.html

Mumbai-based private company Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd, which last month showed interest in converting the aircraft carrier into a museum, is yet to get a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) for the project from the Ministry of Defence. The warship, inducted into the Indian Navy in 1987 and decommissioned in 2017, was bought by Shree Ram Group, an Alang-based ship-breaker, for Rs 38.54 crore at an auction in July this year. "We have started the process of pulling Viraat towards our scrap plot. It was 3,000 feet away in the sea and now it is being brought nearer. It is still 1,500 feet away," Shree Ram Group Chairman Mukesh Patel told PTI on Saturday. Further towing of the vessel towards the scrap plot will be done during the next high tide, he said. The company which has shown interest in buying it and converting it to a museum is still not able to procure the NOC from the defence ministry and is working on it, he said. "The company had asked us if the vessel can be salvaged. I replied that it is possible with the latest technology, but it will be very difficult and too costly," Patel said. Patel had earlier sought Rs 100 crore and the Centre's NOC to sell the warship to Envitech Marine to avoid any legal problem in future due to the deal. Asked about monetary negotiations, Patel said the money part comes into picture only if the company is able to get the NOC from the defence ministry to convert the warship into a museum. V K Sharma, the managing director of Envitech Marine, was not available for comments. He had earlier expressed confidence about getting the NOC from the Centre so that Viraat can be preserved. Sharma had claimed that he received support from the Goa government in his patriotic endeavour. Viraat, the world's longest-serving warship, is the second aircraft carrier slated to be broken down in India. In 2014, another decommissioned warship, Vikrant, was dismantled in Mumbai. The 70-year-old aircraft carrier, in its earlier avatar, had won the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982 for the Royal British Navy. Viraat weighs about 27,800 tonnes and served in the British Navy as 'HMS Hermes' from November 1959 to April 1984. After undergoing refurbishment, the vessel was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1987.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ins-viraat-towed-to-scrapyard-museum-hope-fading-906705.html

The tradition of worshipping Ravan for his "intelligence and ascetic qualities" has been going on in Sangola village here for the last 200 years, claim locals. A tall black stone statue of the demon king, with 10 heads and 20 arms, stands at the centre of the village where locals revere him. Talking to PTI on Sunday, local temple priest Haribhau Lakhade said while the rest of the country burns effigies of Ravana on Dussehra, symbolising the victory of good over evil, residents of Sangola worship the demon king for his "intelligence and ascetic qualities". Lakhade said his family has since long been worshipping Ravan and claimed the happiness, peace and contentment in the village is because of the Lanka king. Some elderly residents of the village hail Ravan as a "scholar" and believe he abducted Sita for "political reasons and preserved her sanctity", local resident Mukund Pohre said. While the villages believe in Lord Ram, they also have faith in Ravan and don't burn his effigies, he said. Visitors from across the country come to this tiny village on Dussehra every year to catch a glimpse of Ravan's statue and some even offer prayers, he added. This year, the festivities in the village are low-key in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Lakhade said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/in-maharashtras-sangola-ravan-is-honoured-not-condemned-906737.html

The ruling MVA in Maharashtra is here to stay, the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson told a news channel, and expressed confidence that it would win the civic polls in the country's commercial capital. The Shiv Sena-ruled BMC is the country's richest civic body with an annual budget of over Rs 33,400 crore. "The Shiv Sena-led MVA will fight the civic polls in Maharashtra's capital and will win it. In Mumbai, who else but Shiv Sena can win? The MVA is here to stay permanently," Raut said. The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress last year forged an alliance to form the government after the Uddhav Thackeray-led party parted ways with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post. Elections in Maharashtra's 10 municipal corporations, including the BMC, and 27 zilla parishads and gram panchayats are due in 2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mva-allies-to-contest-bmc-polls-together-sanjay-raut-906819.html

Addressing an online Dussehra rally from Bhagwan Bhaktigad in Sawargaon in Beed's Patoda area, 125 kilometres from here, Munde said crops like cotton, soybean and rice had been completely damaged in the rains and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray must come up with a bigger package to tide over the losses. Bhagwan Bhaktigad is associated with spiritual leader Bhagwan Baba. Speaking on the deadlock between workers and sugar factories amid the cane crushing season, Munde said NCP chief Sharad Pawar must find a way out. She said she planned to tour the country to take stock of issues facing sugarcane labourers. She also expressed hope she would someday address a Dussehra rally in Shivaji Park in Mumbai, a sprawling ground best known for cricket and the fiery rallies of Shiv Sena patriarch late Bal Thackeray since the 1960s.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtras-rs-10000-crore-package-for-farmers-not-enough-pankaja-munde-906832.html

He contacted over 1,000 users including minors between 10-16 years of age across the United States, Europe, and South Asian countries using photo-sharing application Instagram, they said. The agency recently searched the residence of the accused, who claims to be a junior artist in TV serials, from where his mobile phone and laptop have been seized, they said. The forensic analysis of the devices has prima facie provided material related to online sexual abuse which the accused later circulated to his clients internationally over WhatsApp and other platforms, they said. The accused, hailing from Haridwar, would pose as a film star to lure and entice minors into online relationships during which he would ask them for pornographic photographs and videos which he used to trap them into his illicit net, officials said. The accused would take their WhatsApp numbers to chat with them and during video, calls asked them to perform sexual acts which would be shared with his clients in various countries through Instagram, they said. In case any victims decided to stop meeting such demands or maintaining contact with him, the accused threatened them by saying he would share their sexually explicit photos with their families and friends, the official said. The agency has charged him under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Information Technology Act. Recently, the CBI had booked another person for allegedly selling child sexual abuse material (CSAM) for Rs 250 using messaging application Telegram through three accounts and 20 groups.  The CBI has a special unit on “Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/ Investigation (OCSAE)”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mumbai-man-posed-as-film-star-to-lure-minors-online-sold-child-porn-to-international-clients-cbi-906836.html

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi must personally look into the problems vis-à-vis GST", Thackeray, the Shiv Sena President, said addressing the annual Dussehra rally of the party. Thackeray, who heads the tri-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government, appealed to all Chief Ministers to come together and raise the issue. “The country is not of one party, let the Chief Ministers together raise the issue with the Centre,” he said. “Time has come to reconsider the present GST system and if necessary, it should be changed or reverted to the old system...the problems and anomalies must be removed because the states are not benefiting from this system,” he added. Thackeray also pointed out that Maharashtra’s GST dues from the Centre stands at a whopping Rs 38,000 crore and it has not received the refund despite appeals and reminders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/remove-the-problems-of-gst-or-revert-to-old-system-uddhav-thackeray-906884.html

From the day I became the Chief Minister, it was being said that the government will collapse. I challenge and say that if you have the courage, do it and show," he said. Thackeray also asked the BJP not to destablise the non-BJP ruled governments in the country.  “If you are doing so, you are inviting anarchy,” the 60-year-old Thackeray said. Thackeray ridiculed the BJP’s poll promise of free Covid-19 vaccines in Bihar.  “Vaccine is free in Bihar….are others Bangladesh, Pakistan or Kazakhstan? …..free in Bihar and others need to pay?” he asked BJP. Without naming Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the Chief Minister slammed him for his letter on the issue of demand for re-opening of temples. "We are being asked about Hindutva, that why are we not re-opening temples in the state. They say my Hindutva is different from that of Balasaheb Thackeray. Your Hindutva is about clanging bells and utensils, our Hindutva is not like that," Thackeray said and referred to the Dussehra address of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat who spoke of Hindu, Hindutva and politics. “Covid-19 is a big challenge. Lockdown and Unlock is a process….temples will also open in times to come…I do not want to keep everything closed,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/topple-my-govt-if-you-have-guts-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-dares-bjp-906898.html

"Frustration growing in different quarters as the state is steadily progressing over the past one year and the rule of law prevails, which they can’t digest, so they fire salvo at the state, defile Bollywood and indulge in other gimmicks," he added. Although Uddhav did not specifically mention Kangana's name, it is quite evident that the target was the Bollywood actress, who has been criticising the Maharashtra government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/uddhav-thackeray-takes-sly-dig-at-kangana-ranaut-indirectly-calls-her-namak-haram-906906.html

State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye alleged that Thackeray had nothing to highlight about his government's functioning to the Shiv Sainik. "Shiv Sena compromised on Hindutva for power. Uddhav Thackeray did not say a word about Congress criticising Savarkar and now he had to address the Dussehra rally from the Savarkar auditorium. This is poetic justice," he said. Upadhye said that the state government had made a mockery of the farmers by announcing only Rs 10,000 crore package. The state government had not responded to the GST proposal given by the Centre, he alleged. Upadhye said the state has the highest number of coronavirus patients in the country. During the rally held on Sunday evening, Thackeray hit out at the BJP saying that if the party remained interested only in toppling governments rather than improving the nation's economy there would be anarchy in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/cm-uddhav-thackeray-had-nothing-to-speak-on-his-govts-performance-bjp-906917.html
