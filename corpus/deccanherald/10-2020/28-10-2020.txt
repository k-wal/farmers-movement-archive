28-10-2020||First Edit||Sri Lanka moves towards autocracy||With the Sri Lankan parliament passing the 20th Amendment (20A) to the Constitution, the powers of its Executive Presidency have been expanded substantially. Its passage wasn’t in doubt; only recently the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment needed only a two-thirds majority for it to be enacted, which the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), with its allies, had. The 20th Amendment rolls back the 19th Amendment, which was passed in 2015 under the previous government. The 19th Amendment had clipped presidential powers by requiring the president to consult the prime minister and making him liable to prosecution for official actions that violate fundamental rights. With the passage of 20A, powers are concentrated in the office of the president, the prime minister’s role has been diminished to a ceremonial one, and parliament has been reduced to a rubber stamp. Sri Lanka has taken a decisive step towards becoming a constitutional autocracy. This is a distressing state of affairs, especially since the country is Asia’s oldest democracy. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had made a case for empowering the presidency in order to improve governance. Will he use his substantial powers to improve the wellbeing of the Sri Lankan people or to entrench the rule of the Rajapaksa family? The concentration of power in the hands of one authority has never been good for any people. Opposition parties and civil society activists did put up a fight. Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court challenging 20A. However, the apex court ruled that 20A was constitutional and only four of its provisions would have to be put to a referendum. As expected, 20A sailed through parliament, with 156 MPs voting in its favour; six opposition MPs voted with the government. An already powerful and triumphalist government will now move to the next item on the agenda – the 13th Amendment, which provides for devolution of power to the provinces. This legislation gave a measure of autonomy to the Tamils. The government proposes to take that away. A section of Buddhist monks opposed 20A. But even they can be expected to rally behind the government on the revocation of 13A. The 13A was the result of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka Accord and India has been its strong proponent. If fully and meaningfully implemented, 13A has the potential to address Tamil political grievances. But successive governments have refrained from implementing 13A fully. Now, the Rajapaksa government is set to do away with it. India will be watching but is unlikely to do much as it is more concerned about the Rajapaksa government’s pro-China tilt than the well-being of Tamils.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/sri-lanka-moves-towards-autocracy-908411.html
28-10-2020||In Perspective||Kamaladevi: How could we forget!||November 1 is the day that Karnataka remembers its celebrated people. But one noteworthy name has slipped away from public memory, almost without a trace. This is a case of historical amnesia, not just of Karnataka, but of India at large. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, freedom fighter and more, was born in Mangaluru, and her remarkable life journey included significant contributions to society -- as a social reformer, a feminist, the creator of ‘Faridabad’ for craftsmen who migrated from Pakistan, a tireless activist who revived Indian handicrafts, handlooms and theatre, and as the founder of many post-independence institutions of repute. Kamaladevi was born in April 1903 in a liberal Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin family in Mangalore (now Mangaluru). She completed her primary education at the local St Ann’s Convent. Growing up in a land with a rich cultural heritage, especially of the music and dance form Yakshagana, she developed a taste for traditional art forms. After her father’s untimely death, Kamaladevi moved to her maternal uncle’s house. There, she met renowned freedom fighters, including Gopalkrishna Gokhale, Srinivasa Shastri, Ramabai Ranade and Annie Besant. Kamaladevi was married off at the age of 14 and widowed two years later. Unperturbed by these life events, she joined Queen Mary’s College in Madras (now Chennai) for higher studies. There, she met Sarojini (Chattopadhyay) Naidu’s brother Harindranath Chattopadhyay. Their mutual love for theatre led to their wedlock. Though widow remarriage was quite a rare phenomenon during those days, Kamaladevi rebelled against societal constraints. The couple travelled across the country, producing plays and skits. Later, she accompanied Harindranath to London and enrolled for a diploma at Bedford College.  However, their marriage ended over incompatibility issues and this, too, created history – Kamaladevi’s was the first legal divorce granted through an Indian court of law. Kamaladevi played a prominent role in political reforms and India’s freedom struggle. She was the first woman to contest the Madras provincial elections. Though she lost by a narrow margin, she got recognition and was appointed secretary of the All-India Women’s Conference. She joined Indian National Congress in 1927 and was elected to the All-India Congress Committee within a year. During the Salt March to Dandi, she convinced Gandhi to give women equal opportunity to be in the forefront of the march. Later, she joined Seva Dal and trained women activists. However, the British government banned Seva Dal and threw Kamaladevi into jail. There, she contracted jaundice. Having experienced the pathetic condition of the prison hospital, she built a hospital for inmates upon release. Kamaladevi got attracted to socialism and took up the problems of labourers and peasants. During World War II, she visited America and met several political activists, mostly blacks, and shared with them India’s non-violent approach to freedom struggle. The British got wind of her activism and banned her from returning to India. Unmoved, Kamaladevi continued on her journey, visiting South Africa, China, Japan and Vietnam. Kamaladevi was inarguably the embodiment of women’s empowerment. She was an advocate of female sexual freedom and birth control. Her remarriage after widowhood and legal divorce from her second marriage were symbolic of her self-empowerment. She acted in many films (a Kannada film, too) when the film industry was not considered a respectable place for women. Nor do we know of another globetrotting Indian woman of her generation. Asked by a journalist her views on women’s empowerment, she replied, “Let men learn to be equal to women first.” Truly, she lived her life to the full, rare for women in her times. Indeed, Kamaladevi’s immense travel and experiences shaped her as a secular, socialist world citizen. Such were her ideals that led to her building the city of Faridabad to rehabilitate some 50,000 craftsmen who moved to India from Pakistan during Partition. Post-independence, she helped revive Indian handicrafts and built institutions for a ‘New India’-- to name a few, the National School of Drama, Bharatiya Natya Sangha, Lady Irwin College, Sangeet Natak Academy, Central Cottage Industries Emporium, World Craft Council, Craft Council of India, and the Delhi Craft Council. Kamaladevi was a prolific writer, too. She wrote 18 books altogether, touching upon women’s issues, Indian handicrafts and her foreign visits. She published her autobiography, “Inner Recesses, Outer Spaces: Memoir” (1986). She received several awards in recognition of her public service, like Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the UNESCO Award. She died in Mumbai on October 29, 1988, aged 85. Kamaladevi was ahead of her times, and she would perhaps be so even today. A woman of substance, she remained a mystery to the traditional Indian mindset. We speak of great national traditions, but we forget many who are true builders of post-independence India. Sadly, Kannadigas, too, have failed to remember this great daughter of the soil.

28-10-2020||Karnataka Districts||All parties distribute money to voters: MLC||MLC Basavaraj Horatti, on Wednesday, stated that voters and politicians had become corrupt. Nobody was morally correct. All three political parties distributed money and liquor to voters during elections. Speaking to media persons after visiting polling booth at government pre-university college for girls for the elections to South West Graduates constituency, in the city, he said that a voter called him and asked how much money JD(S) would give to each voter. One party gave Rs 1,500 to a voter and the other candidate is giving Rs 1000 to each voter. "This was the current saga of elections in the country. So, he is disappointed with the current politics. Those who win the elections enjoy political power and voters will get nothing. Moral-based politics is no longer present in the state. It disappeared from the state after the exit of veteran politician Ramakrishna Hegade from politics", he added.  Defending JD(S), he said that the party has worked for the welfare of teachers and graduates when it was in power. What has Congress and BJP done for them? he questioned and said JD(S) MLA B Satyanarayana had implemented development projects in the Sira assembly constituency. His death necessitated the by-poll. "We are confident that voters of the constituency would back JD(S) in the by-polls." He also made it clear that he has no idea of the situation in the RR Nagar assembly constituency.  Referring to MLA Basavana Gouda Patil Yatnal's remarks against the chief minister B S Yediyurappa, he said BJP high-command is backing Yatnal to make such comments.  If not, Yatnal should have been expelled from the party by now.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/all-parties-distribute-money-to-voters-mlc-908219.html

Wastewater management is a huge challenge in today’s world. Owing to a lack of planning and infrastructure for waste management leads to unhygienic conditions giving rise to diseases and unhealthy situations. Realising it, District Sanitation ambassador Sheena Shetty, Jana Shikshana Trust motivated the gram panchayat to take up a drive to construct soak pit in the households.  The drive has yielded good results and over 50 soak pits have been completed already. There are plans to construct 100 soak pits under MGNREGS. Going by the progress, it may cross 100, said Sheena Shetty to DH. The soak pits constructed at household level under MGNREGS is helpful in solving wastewater management issues, Shetty added. The construction of pits aims at the collection of waste water from the kitchen and bathrooms in a hygienic manner thereby not letting it to flow down the roads and open public places. To facilitate the percolation of water, gravels and sand is also used in the soak pits. The cement ring or laterite stones are used for the construction. After the construction, work on channeling waste water into soak pits is taken up, said Shetty. In fact, Zilla Panchayat CEO R Selvamani too visited the site of construction of soak pit in Balepuni recently and lauded the efforts. Under MGNREGS, Rs 7000 for wages and Rs 7000 for materials are given for the construction of soak pits. House-owner possessing job cards under MGNREGS can also take up the work on his land and get paid for the work. While to improve the ground water table, the gram panchayat has started the work on rain water percolation pits on 10-acre land belonging to the gram panchayat. Already, 157 percolation pits have been dug by the job-card holders including women. The percolation pit is five feet long, two feet deep and two feet wide. The job-card holders get Rs 250 for digging each percolation pit, said sources.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/balepuni-gram-panchayat-to-construct-soak-pit-in-households-908251.html

The elephants, Vikrama, Gopi, Vijaya and Kaveri, their mahouts and kavaadis were camping on Mysuru Palace premises from October 2, to participate in the Vijayadashami procession held on October 26. While Abhimanyu returned to Mathigodu elephant camp, Kaveri and Gopi shifted to Dubare elephant camp, near Somwarpet in Kodagu. Vikrama and Vijaya returned to Anekadu elephant camp. The first leg of Gajayapayana, the traditional march of Dasara, was held at Veeranahosahalli, the entry point of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in Hunsur taluk on October 1. The elephants were brought to Aranya Bhavan on the same day and were shifted to Mysuru Palace the next day. For the first time, Abhimanyu from Mattigodu Elephant camp in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, played the lead role of carrying the golden howdah with an idol of goddess Chamundeshwari during the procession. Abhimanyu has been part of Mysuru Dasara from the last two decades. He was pulling the ‘Ane Gaadi’, in which the police band used to perform during the procession. He used to carry the wooden replica of the howdah, during Srirangapatna Dasara in Mandya district. District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar had visited the Palace and had performed puja on Tuesday. He offered sugarcane, paddy and jaggery, as a thanksgiving for their successful participation in Dasara. He also presented a honorarium to the mahouts and kavaadis, given by the Palace Board. The Forest department, district administration and Mysuru Palace Board gave the elephants a grand farewell. This time, the mahouts and kavaadis were given Rs 10,000 honorarium by the Palace Board. The elephant caretakers were given Rs 7,000 last year. Abhimanyu, also known as ‘troubleshooter’ and ‘AK 47’ among Forest department officials and Gopi, lent their service to the authorities of Mysuru Zoo on Tuesday. They were taken to Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens (Mysuru Zoo) to shift an elephant calf to Chamundi Animal Conservation, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Koorgalli on the outskirts of Mysuru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/dasara-elephants-return-to-forest-camps-908364.html

28-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Oppn releases video of BJP men 'promising' cash to Sira voters||Opposition parties released a video of BJP workers allegedly promising money to women voters of a village in Sira Assembly constituency. The video, shot late Monday evening, showed an unidentified functionary of BJP assuring Rs 200 each to women for ‘Arishina Kumkuma,’ allegedly on behalf of BJP MLA Preetham Gowda. The speaker in the video promised to give the same amount of cash on Wednesday and before the bypoll date. Congress and JD(S) leaders mounted an attack on BJP over the issue, accusing the saffron party of trying to win the byelection by buying votes and filed a complaint with the Election Commission. Gowda, however, denied the allegations, contending that the video was the handiwork of the Opposition Congress. Multiple videos of alleged bribing of voters in Sira constituency was released by the Congress. While one of the videos shows a speech of a party worker assuring money, Congress workers are seen questioning BJP workers over the alleged assurance in another video. Soon after the video surfaced, Congress filed a complaint with the Election Commission, demanding that it bar BJP Sira candidate Rajesh Gowda from continuing in the electoral fray. It submitted a pen drive of videos of the alleged speech, along with a voice recording of BJP Tumakuru president Suresh Gowda, reportedly luring voters “with large amounts of money to each voter.” JD(S) social media incharge Prathap Kanagal tweeted the video, questioning the delay by the Election Commission in registering a complaint regarding the incident. “Election Commission officials, who should act against it, are not uttering (a single word). What happened to them? Are they in a slumber or are they in isolation due to Covid-19?” he said. In a letter to the Election Commission, party legal cell general secretary Pradeep Kumar alleged that BJP was misusing its power and was distributing money, apart from other election code violations. People who are not residents of the constituency are camping there and are visiting voters’ houses at night to “bribe” them, the complaint said.  When contacted, Gowda alleged that the Congress was behind the video and was trying to defame him. “Congress workers may have made the speech to show me in poor light,” he said. On whether he would file a complaint if the video was fake, he said such allegations by the Opposition were common in politics and that he would not pursue the matter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/oppn-releases-video-of-bjp-men-promising-cash-to-sira-voters-908005.html

28-10-2020||Karnataka Politics||Karnataka govt drags its feet on quota for economically weaker sections||Draft guidelines to implement reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society are ready, but the government is seemingly dragging its feet.  The delay has irked the opposition who sought to know why the government was not keen on implementing reservation for EWS, even though several neighbouring states had done so already. Sources, meanwhile, also hint at ‘political reasons’ for the government’s reluctance to announce reservation till date. H S Sachidananda Murthy, Chairman, Karnataka State Brahmin Development Board told DH that draft guidelines for reservation were ready and will be implemented after discussion in the state Cabinet. Along with a report submitted by the chief secretary, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has discussed it with the departments of Backward Classes Welfare and Social Welfare. Modalities of reservation have been scrutinised by the Backward Classes Commission, too, Murthy said, adding that the report will be implemented soon. “This will help students, especially those pursuing professional courses, in the coming academic year,” he said. At least eight states have offered reservation for EWS already. While the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition was ready to implement the NDA government decision, senior Congress leader R V Deshpande alleged that the state was dragging its feet over the issue. “The chief secretary has submitted his report on reservation a few months ago and is lying at the Chief Minister’s Office. Why is the state government shy to implement the reservation?” Deshpande asked. Sources said that while the government was keen on implementing reservation to EWS, it was delayed due to ‘political reasons’. “Reservation provided should be proportional to the population of these communities in the state. In Karnataka, around 1.5 to 2% reservation can be provided under EWS,” sources said. There is opposition from within the government over implementing the decision which will benefit only a handful of communities, especially when movements of Other Backward Classes seeking an increase in reservation was gaining steam, sources added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/karnataka-govt-drags-its-feet-on-quota-for-economically-weaker-sections-908010.html

28-10-2020||Main Article||A Covid-19 death: When it strikes closer home||"Wife died today." The terse message was from my close cousin. After struggling with ventilator support for nearly a month in a Bengaluru hospital, the coronavirus got the better of her. It was devastating news.  New Coronavirus. First, it was a mysterious disease. In distant lands. Eerie feelings of unease crept in, reminding one of SARS and H1N1, the earlier viruses which came out of the blue, with visitations of death. Deaths were first reported in China from the new virus, and then Italy and Spain where it raged suddenly like forest fires. And like forest fires, it leapt over distances -- only this time across vast spaces and oceans -- and started devouring America. And now, it has engulfed and is ravaging India. Like a ghost, it stalks. It is nowhere but everywhere.  The daily infections and hospital admissions transcribed these macabre illnesses and deaths onto ticker tapes on television and converted them into mere numbers and figures. Then statisticians morphed them into graphs for analysts. It was all dry and bald statistics -- of deaths of nameless, faceless thousands. And stories in papers and media and occasional anecdotes of people from our country who may have got infected with this illness or stranded on foreign shores were carried and conveyed to us on our social media groups. Then you saw here and there, around the world, news of celebrities whom you had heard of getting infected and succumbing to the virus. For us, they were all TV deaths. Even when the nation hunkered down in a forced lockdown and millions of migrants were on an exodus, dying of hunger, suffering from thirst and exhaustion on their long march and many mowed down by trucks and trains as they trudged home with their belongings and infants in their arms, the virus was still a faraway thing -- an imagined disease. It was wished away by gloating, complacent politicians, sadhus and saints and charlatans with chants and gongs, and quacks and godmen dispensed native voodoo medicines made of bones and antlers, of dung and cow urine, and pranic healing through Yoga as a cure all. In a curious twist, when the godmen, the politician or a celebrity coughed and went breathless and their body temperatures soared, they rushed to modern hospitals in search of the best available allopathic care. And some did not make it. All these stories were still something you watched on raucous television shows, anchored by gladiators on steroids. You would watch it as you would a Bollywood masala movie.  But when news hits you, yes when it shatters you like a stone flung on your living room glass window, that one of your close friends, a relative or an office colleague has been rushed to a hospital and put on ventilator, and when you learn that his grief stricken family can't visit him/her in the hospital and you can't even go and offer sympathies because the virus is hovering about -- it is invisible but menacing, like the ghost of Banquo in Macbeth, haunting men who have a foreboding that this is retribution for all the sins and crimes committed by man not only against his fellow beings but against the planet -- then a strange fear grips you. You feel impotent against the microcosm. And when news arrives that the patient, whom you knew so well, whom you had met only recently, passed away and that the doctors, overwhelmed by the mysterious disease, couldn't save your dear ones, then the reality hits you like a grenade exploding next to you.   It is not a statistic anymore. It's not a conspiracy of Left politicians out to destabilise the government. It's not an American right-wing delusion of a Chinese virus that escaped or was released wilfully from a Chinese lab. It's not a virus weaponised by Muslims to kill Hindus by infiltrating Hindu society as the ‘IT cell’ of some political party would want us to believe. It is, as all the reputed doctors and epidemiologists have said, a virus that is most virulent and lethal. It is a bizarre deviant new virus about which little is known, and which is taking scientists by surprise with its inscrutable behaviour, wreaking havoc, impacting the lives and livelihoods of every living being. Chest-beating and bravado, instead of respect for science, is the courage of ignorance that can be fatal to king and commoner.  The death of a close relative, a friend or a colleague by this virus is no longer mere data but is now very personal and touching. It is a double tragedy with Coronavirus -- most Covid-19 patients not only suffer, but they suffer and die alone. And it's unbearably tragic because the loved ones can't be near them when they take their last breath. They can't even see the body or cremate it with time-honoured rituals. What terrible loneliness for the dying! What horrors for those who wait helplessly with unspeakable anxiety!   Yet, despite such overwhelming odds stacked against us, pessimism, a dispirited outlook of futility, cannot be a choice. It's slow suicide. Science, and scientific temperament which is true to its core principles of tireless and honest pursuit of knowledge without cant, has solved and will continue to solve the problems of the human race if humans stop seeing themselves as a race superior, distinct and apart from Nature and the Universe. And to even think that one religion, one ethnic race or caste is superior to others is grossly vile and profane. It can only lead to disintegration. This harks back to the core of Indian philosophy -- tat tvam asi (thou art that). All life, all matter, all beings are One. This must unite us to fight the virus. Such an outlook of solidarity will awaken infinite hope. But that optimism has to be grounded in faith in science, and not jingoism. Nor is such optimism an option. As Karl Popper said, “Optimism is a duty today.”  (The writer is a soldier, farmer and entrepreneur)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/a-covid-19-death-when-it-strikes-closer-home-908412.html

Major farmer federations with over 500 constituent organisations, including the entire working group and state chapter representatives of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) and the federations led by farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal of BKU (Rajewal) and Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh, met at Delhi, where various decisions were taken, according to a statement issued by the AIKSCC. According to the statement, it was announced at the meeting that "an all-India road blockade shall be organised on November 5". Also, a "Delhi Chalo" protest shall be held on November 26-27. "The demand shall be focussed on the withdrawal of the three recently-passed farm Acts and the Electricity Bill 2020. The protests will include huge state-wise/region-wise buildup of mass mobilisation and movements focussing on these demands," the statement said. A newly-launched programme coordination body will lead the protests. A committee of the coordination body shall include V M Singh, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Gurnam Singh, Raju Shetty and Yogendra Yadav. It will coordinate the two initial programmes on November 5 and another one on November 26-27. It was decided at the meeting that farmers all over the country will protest before government offices, including those of the central government, offices of the leaders of the ruling BJP and its allies as well as big corporates. "The meeting condemned the central government's decision to stop the operation of goods trains to Punjab...this is blackmail of the people and farmers of Punjab and is most unbecoming of a democratic government," the statement said. Amid protests by farmers on railway tracks against the new farm laws, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal sought the Punjab government's assurance on Monday on the safety of trains and their crew members to restore freight services, hours after Chief Minister Amarinder Singh asked him to intervene in the matter. Goods train services resumed in Punjab after the farmer unions, on October 21, announced exempting them from their weeks-old "rail roko" agitation over the farm laws. However, the railways decided to extend its suspension of goods train operations in the state, saying the protesting farmers are still blocking the tracks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-bodies-announce-nationwide-road-blockade-on-nov-5-against-new-agri-laws-908041.html

28-10-2020||National||As Bihar goes to polls, what is at stake for Modi?||By Bibhudatta Pradhan Bihar goes to polls Wednesday in an exercise spread across two weeks. The election is the first test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. A strict nationwide lockdown has resulted in the country’s worst economic downturn in decades and both unemployment and virus infections have soared. India trails only the US as the nation with the most highest case tally. 1. Why does Bihar matter so much? The state is one of the country’s poorest and lags on most development indicators, but its massive population makes it politically significant. With some 104 million people -- the entire population of Egypt -- it accounts for 40 seats in the 545-member lower house of federal parliament giving it outsize national influence. Bihar is currently ruled by a coalition that includes Modi’s BJP and the election will be the first political test of how voters view his handling of the pandemic and the economic crisis and joblessness it has spawned. A substantial win would also help Modi’s administration to wrest more seats in the upper house of parliament where it lacks a majority, making it easier to push through legislation for its economic reforms. A straight defeat or even a significant reduction in seats would dent Modi’s larger-than-life image and may also have implications for other state elections that will follow.  2. What’s the campaign focusing on? The promise of creating millions of new jobs is the top campaign plank of every major player in the election. A lack of employment has been a perennial problem in the state -- its unemployment rate was 10.2%, almost twice that of the entire country, according to the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey. This has pushed a large part of its workforce to migrate to other states. The strict lockdown forced some 1.5 million of the state’s migrant workers to return to their villages as jobs vanished overnight. Visuals of the poorest workers trekking thousands of miles on foot and on bicycles were some of the most harrowing images of the pandemic in India. While some migrants have returned to their jobs in big cities, many are still looking for employment in their towns and villages. 3. How are they dealing with the pandemic? India’s public health infrastructure is bare-bones even in some of its wealthiest states and Bihar is one of its poorest, with growing virus numbers hitting its government-run hospitals hard. Bihar accounts for 212,355 of India’s 7.94 million confirmed cases, making it the 11th worst hit out of the country’s 28 states. Even though a successful coronavirus vaccine is yet to emerge, Modi’s party has already made free immunizations for the people of Bihar a campaign promise, kicking up a political row with opposition parties asking why the state was singled out for special attention ahead of other provinces. Still, the pandemic appeared to have made no visible difference to campaigning itself. Most people in the thousands-strong crowds that gathered at major rallies appeared to not be masked and there was no social distancing. Guidelines issued by the independent Election Commission -- from capping the number of people involved in door-to-door campaigning and warning politicians against flouting Covid-19 protocols -- had little impact. 4. Who are main players? Bihar’s incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, leader of the Janata Dal (United) party, is seeking a fourth straight term and his first after he partnered with the BJP. A junior partner in the ruling alliance, the BJP is banking on Modi’s appeal and hoping to emerge as the single largest party in the state. The two main challengers are young leaders with serious political lineages. Tejashwi Yadav, 30, of the Rashtriya Janata Dal is the main face of a coalition that includes the Congress party. Yadav is the son of former longtime Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad and draws support from a loyal bank of voters. The other important player is Chirag Paswan, the actor-turned-politician, who heads the Lok Janashakti Party after the death of his father, federal lawmaker Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan, 37, once part of ruling alliance, snapped ties with the Janata Dal (United) just ahead of elections. He may acquire more importance should the BJP emerge stronger and want to shake off its old alliance with Kumar. 5. How’s Modi doing in Bihar? Modi is the main face of the ruling coalition in Bihar and a great deal depends on his enduring popularity among voters. The prime minister pledged billion of rupees of development projects from bridges to rail lines to sewage treatment plants for the state just ahead of election. Modi’s flagship federal programs providing toilets, cooking gas and houses to the poor have also caught the attention of voters. Still, the anti-incumbency of Kumar’s 15-year-long rule is expected to play a significant role. 6. What could be the result? Indian opinion and exit polls have a reputation for inaccuracy when it comes to predicting voter behavior. A recent poll gives the ruling coalition a winning edge and results will be out on Nov. 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/as-bihar-goes-to-polls-what-is-at-stake-for-modi-908082.html

These entities were receiving money from undisclosed donors which was then being used to fund terror activities, according to an NIA release. Besides Srinagar, the raids were carried in Bandipora in north Kashmir and one location in Bengaluru. The premises that were searched include the residence and office of Khurram Parvez (coordinator of J&K Coalition of Civil Society), his associates Parvez Bukhari, Parvez Matta and Bengaluru-based associate Swati Sheshadri, Parveena Ahanger (Chairperson of Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons) and offices of NGO Athrout and the Greater Kashmir Trust, the statement said. “Several incriminating documents and electronic devices have been seized and further investigation in the case is continued,” it added. The raids are being conducted as part of a case registered in early October by the NIA related to certain NGOs allegedly raising funds for separatist activities. Since early 2017, the NIA has been continuously carrying out raids in Kashmir in connection with alleged terror funding, fidayeen (suicide) attack cases and the agency has arrested and questioned dozens of people in the last more than three years. PDP President and former Chief Minister of J&K Mehbooba Mufti Mehbooba Mufti alleged that the NIA has emerged as a “pet agency” of the ruling BJP “to intimidate and browbeat those who refuse to fall in line”. “NIA raids on human rights activist Khurram Parvez & Greater Kashmir office in Srinagar is yet another example of GOIs vicious crackdown on freedom of expression & dissent. Sadly, NIA has become BJPs pet agency to intimidate & browbeat those who refuse to fall in line (sic),” she tweeted. NIA raids on human rights activist Khurram Parvez & Greater Kashmir office in Srinagar is yet another example of GOIs vicious crackdown on freedom of expression & dissent. Sadly, NIA has become BJPs pet agency to intimidate & browbeat those who refuse to fall in line In another tweet, Mehbooba said, “At a time when J&K’s land & resources are being plundered, GOI wants media publications to write op-eds about diabetes & yoga. In BJP’s ‘all is well’ charade, truth is the biggest casualty. Any journalist unwilling to become a part of Godi media is targeted.” At a time when J&K’s land & resources are being plundered, GOI wants media publications to write op-eds about diabetes & yoga.

Any journalist unwilling to become a part of Godi media is targeted The former CM was referring to new land laws issued by the central government, allowing outsiders to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Earlier, only residents of J&K were allowed to purchase land in the erstwhile state. The scrapping of the J&K’s special powers under Article 370 of the Constitution last August paved the way for this change in land law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nia-raids-multiple-locations-in-kashmir-to-probe-terror-funding-908122.html

The Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) is among the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Award. GHE is one of the world’s first organisations using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities. The recipients of the 2020 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards, announced Tuesday, bring focus to the best examples of what people across the globe are doing “to combat climate change in a year that has cast darkness upon so many.” According to a statement on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website, GHE is the one of the world’s first outfit using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities as recognised by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). In the Hindu Kush Region, there are more than 16 million people without access to basic energy mainly due to their geographic remoteness. GHE conducts “Impact Expeditions” to remote Himalayan villages and uses a portion of the expedition fee to fund the capital cost of the hardware, transportation, installation and training of village-scale solar micro-grids. The micro-grid infrastructure set up by GHE is owned and operated by the community. To date, the GHE has solar electrified more than 131 villages in three regions of India, directly impacting the lives of more than 60,000 villagers. More than 1,300 travellers from 60 different countries have been a part of these expeditions. Enabling livelihood through homestay tourism has generated over $114,000 in income for the villages, which represents a 45 per cent increase in the annual household income, the statement said. UNFCCC said this year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil societies as a whole. They range from the Caribbean's only carbon-neutral hotel to the world's first platform fully dedicated to green bonds to the first all-women solar team in Lebanon. Congratulating the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Awards, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the winners provide tangible proof that climate action is underway around the world. “It is exciting to see these climate solutions, which reinforce my call for decisive leadership on climate change by governments, businesses and cities, and for a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us keep pressing ahead to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all,” he said. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the last eight months have been a nightmare for many throughout the world. “Covid-19 has altered lives, economies and the nature of business on every continent -- from the largest cities to the smallest villages. It is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term,” said Espinosa. Espinosa said the convergence of these two crises has opened a window of opportunity to build forward, to build cities and communities that are safe, healthy, green and sustainable. “Nothing exemplifies this better than the efforts of our 2020 award-winning activities to address climate change.” The award announcement is part of the wider effort to mobilise action and ambition as national governments work toward implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Global Climate Action Awards are spearheaded by the Momentum for Change initiative at UN Climate Change. The projects are recognised as innovative solutions that not only address climate change but also help drive progress on many other sustainable development goals. The 2020 winning activities were selected by an international advisory panel as part of the UN Climate Change’s Momentum for Change initiative. "It is crucial we celebrate all actors who are leading the way,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the Advisory Panel. “The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards send a strong political signal to all nations, and through their leadership and creativity, we see essential change.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-outfit-wins-un-award-for-efforts-to-combat-climate-change-amid-covid-19-908137.html
28-10-2020||National||Why was national flag hoisting prevented in Srinagar, asks Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Wednesday asked why some youths were prevented by police from hoisting the national flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar despite the abrogation of Article 370. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also asked what has changed in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370, and said "Hindutva means nationalism". Three people, claiming to be BJP workers from Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir, were on Monday detained while trying to hoist the tricolour at Lal Chowk in Srinagar. "The 'duplicate mardani' who calls Mumbai PoK is given security by the central government, while the youth who hoist the tricolour in Kashmir are taken away by police," the Sena mouthpiece said without naming actress Kangana Ranaut. "The nation wants to know why the youth could not hoist the tricolour at Lal Chowk? This means Kashmir's situation hasn't improved," the editorial said. In Mumbai, the tricolour is hoisted and this means "it is not Pakistan", it said, adding that "the triclour is insulted where there is Pakistani interference". The actress should vent her anger at the tricolour not been allowed in Kashmir, it said without naming Ranaut. Ranaut's remark equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Pok) had led to a furore, drawing the battle-lines between the Shiv Sena and her. The editorial claimed former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah said help of China will be sought to restore Article 370 in the Union Territory, and it also criticised PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti over her comments on the national flag. "This is sedition," it said. The National Conference on Monday denied that its president Farooq Abdullah had made such a remark. Mufti last week said she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back. The Sena editorial claimed that over a year after the abrogation of Article 370, not a single rupee investment has come to Kashmir,unemployed youth are taking up arms again and local leaders are misleading them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-was-national-flag-hoisting-prevented-in-srinagar-asks-shiv-sena-908138.html

Parents are not in favour of reopening schools either, Sisodia said at an online press conference. The Delhi government had earlier announced that schools will remain closed till October 31. "We keep getting feedback from parents that they are really concerned about whether it is safe to reopen schools. It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, COVID-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders," Sisodia said. Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shut down as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. While several restrictions have been eased in different 'unlock' phases, educational institutions continue to remain closed. According to ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases. Several states have also begun the process of reopening schools. Earlier, schools were allowed to call students from Class 9 to 12 to school on a voluntary basis from September 21.

"However, the international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis," the Indian aviation regulator said in a circular. The scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under the bilateral 'air bubble' arrangements with selected countries since July. India has formed air bubble pacts with around 18 countries, including the US, the UK, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories.

Justice Jayant Nath said it is a settled legal position that normally, it would be wise and safe for the courts to leave the decisions of academic matters to experts who are more familiar with the problems they face than the courts generally. The high court dismissed a petition by an IIT aspirant, who had obtained a rank in the top 96,187 general category candidates in the JEE (Mains) examination held in September this year but could not sit for the JEE (Advanced) examination on September 27 as he tested Covid-19 positive on September 22. The results were declared on October 5. He said he wrote to the Organising Chairman of IIT-Delhi, explaining his position and seeking accommodation/relaxation to another date for taking this examination. He also contacted the examination centre in Jaipur where he was informed that there were no arrangements for a Covid-19 positive student to appear in the examination. The plea said the eligibility criteria for JEE (Advanced) is that a candidate can appear only two times in two consecutive years. Hence, he will lose a chance of getting admission into prestigious institutions like IITs. He pleaded that separate arrangements in the form of isolation centres for candidates who tested positive for Covid-19 should have been made and implemented at centres, as it was done in other examinations like CLAT 2020. Pursuant to the court’s earlier order, the Joint Admission Board, comprising 46 eminent professors from different IITs, held a meeting to consider if another examination or re-examination could be held for aspirants who could not attempt the test due to their coronavirus positive status. The minutes of the meeting conducted by the Board noted that there were numerous hurdles in conducting a re-examination and it was decided not to go for it. However, it was agreed in the meeting that all the candidates who had successfully registered for JEE (Advanced) Examination 2020 but were absent in the exam, can appear in JEE (Advanced) 2021 as a one-time measure. Those candidates will not have to qualify JEE (Mains) 2021 and will be allowed to directly appear in JEE (Advanced) 2021 and there would also be proportionate relaxation of age bar, the minutes noted. After noting the Board’s decision, the high court said, “there are no cogent reasons for this court to interfere in the decision of the Joint Admission Board dated October 13. There is no merit in the present petition and the same is dismissed.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-for-jee-advanced-re-exam-for-left-out-candidates-908180.html

While the global figure for Covid-19 cases per million is 5,552, India is reporting 5,790 cases per million population. USA, Brazil, France, UK, Russia and South Africa are witnessing much higher numbers. The Covid-19 deaths per million population in India is 87, substantially lower than the world average of 148. India's targeted strategies in Covid-19 management and the proactive as well as calibrated public health response over the last several months have resulted in such encouraging outcomes, the ministry underlined. "In the matter of total tests conducted, India is one of the topmost countries. With 10,66,786 tests in a span of 24 hours, the cumulative number of tests conducted has crossed 10.5 crore," the ministry said. Widespread and comprehensive testing on a sustained basis have aided the early identification and timely effective treatment which has resulted in higher recoveries and lower fatality rate, it said. The country's Case Fatality Rate at present is 1.50 per cent. India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases. Presently, the active cases (6,10,803) comprise merely 7.64 per cent of the total cases in the country. The total number of recovered cases are 72,59,509.   A total of 43,893 new cases have been registered in a span 24 hours in the country, whereas 58,439 recoveries were reported during the same period, with 77 per cent of the recovered cases reported from 10 states and Union territories (UTs), the ministry said. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala have contributed more than 7,000 cases to the single-day recoveries. "Seventy-nine per cent of the new infections are from 10 states and UTs. Kerala has overtaken Maharashtra with the highest number of fresh cases. Both states, however, are still contributing more than 5,000 new cases," the ministry said. The states which are reporting a spurt in cases are Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. A total of 508 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country. Of these, nearly 79 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and UTs, it said. Maharashtra has contributed the maximum to the latest fatalities with 115 deaths.  India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 79,90,322, with 43,893   new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,20,010 with 508 new fatalities, the ministry data updated at 8 am on Wednesday showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-continues-to-be-among-countries-with-lowest-per-million-covid-19-cases-deaths-908185.html

The Twitter India representatives "begged apology" but were told that affidavit must be submitted by Twitter Inc, not by its 'marketing arm' Twitter India, sources said after the over two-hour-long deliberations of the committee, which included questioning on Ladakh being shown as part of China on the Twitter app. "The committee was of the unanimous opinion that Twitter's explanation on showing Ladakh as part of China was inadequate," Lekhi said. While Twitter India officials said the social media company respects the sensitivities of India, Lekhi said that it was not only a matter of sensitivity of India or Indians but a question about national integrity and sovereignty of the country, and not respecting that is a criminal offence. Displaying Indian maps improperly and incorrectly is an offence of treason and attracts imprisonment of seven years, she reminded. Questions about Twitter's banning policy were also raised during the meeting. MPs were of the view that Twitter's banning policy was not clear and it has become a law unto themselves. Twitter India was represented by its Senior Manager (Public Policy) Shagufta Kamran, Legal Counsel Ayushi Kapoor, Pallavi Walia (policy communications) and Manvinder Bali (corporate security). In a statement, Twitter said it remains committed to openness and transparency, and will stay in regular touch with the government to share timely updates. The company's statement comes in the backdrop of its appearance in front of the joint committee of parliament on Data Protection Bill, 2019, on Wednesday. Representatives of the social media company were also questioned by the members on showing Ladakh as part of China. "The recent geo-tagging issue was swiftly resolved by our teams. We are committed to openness, transparency around our work and will remain in regular touch with the government to share timely updates," a Twitter spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/showing-ladakh-in-china-amounts-to-criminal-offence-parliamentary-panel-to-twitter-908198.html

The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 provides for maintaining the "religious character" of holy structures as it existed on August 15, 1947. A plea filed by a Hindu organisation in June had challenged Section 4 of the law in a bid to open the litigation route to reclaim disputed religious sites other than the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. The Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh’s plea assumes significance in the case of Kashi and Mathura where two disputed mosques stand. Talking to PTI, chairman of Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Farooqui, said, "The Places of Worship Act clearly prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and maintain its religious character as it existed on 15 August 1947.” “The Supreme Court’s verdict which had cleared the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya where the demolished Babri Masjid once stood has also reiterated the places of worship act," he added. "The board will be dealing with the court cases but since the places of worship act in place, it must be implemented to stop such attacks on mosques in India," he said. After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. Farooqui, who is also the president of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), a trust, for the construction of the mosque in Ayodhya, said the new structure will be bigger than the Babri masjid. A museum, hospital and research centre which will also be built inside the complex. "We are working on war footing to kick start the construction of the mosque and other facilities in Ayodhya. We are taking the advice of International experts to construct a world-class facility,” he said. “The hospital of course will hold centre stage as it will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the prophet. It will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed speciality unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing," he added. The master plan will be designed to house an archive, museum and community kitchen in the mosque complex. The archive and museum will exhibit contribution of Muslims to nation-building, Indian culture and freedom struggle and of course Sufi saints who spread love and harmony, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sunni-waqf-board-seeks-implementation-of-place-of-worship-act-amid-calls-to-reclaim-kashi-mathura-908202.html

This is the fourth time that Air India flights from India have been banned by the Hong Kong government for bringing passengers who tested positive for the infection after arrival. Previous bans were on the airline's Delhi-Hong Kong flights during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31 and October 17-October 30. Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a Covid-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July. Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight Covid-19 test at the Hong Kong airport. Besides India, a pre-flight Covid-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, France, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, the UK, and the US, according to the Hong Kong government's rules. An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from these countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers onboard have Covid-19 negative certificates. "A few passengers who travelled on Air India's Mumbai-Hong Kong flight earlier this week tested positive for Covid-19 post-arrival at Hong Kong," the senior government official said. "Subsequently, the Mumbai-Hong Kong flights have been barred from October 28 to November 10 by the Hong Kong government," the official added. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the pandemic. However, the Indian airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat Mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July this year. Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. India has formed such pacts with approximately 18 countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hong-kong-bars-air-india-flights-for-fourth-time-as-passengers-test-positive-for-covid-19-908215.html

Rohit Datta, who was diagnosed with the infection on March 1, made an appeal to the masses to "not lower our guard" by getting into a casual festive mode. "I was diagnosed with Covid-19 at a time when the virus had already wreaked havoc in China and a few other countries. I was the first patient in Delhi. So much fear and uncertainty was there at that time. Despite all the research, the virus is still unpredictable," the 46-year-old told PTI over the phone. Datta cautioned that though the economy has been reopened people must realise that the situation in Delhi is "not back to normal". He referred to many residents going out without wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, giving the example of youths who are putting up pictures on social media of parties and events "as if it's all ok now". "It is still not ok and work is on for the elusive vaccine. In the festive season, the chances of infection being spread through symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers is huge," he said. Days before the festival of Diwali, he urged people to step out only for urgent matters and to take full precautions. "If you love your family, stay home this Diwali," he said in his appeal to people. Asked about his plan for Diwali, Datta, a resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi who lives with his wife, two children and mother, said, "It will be a celebration of family bonds and nature". "For two years, our family has not burst crackers on Diwali. This time, we will not step out at all. We will light 'diyas' to feel the power of nature and share sweets and laughter and warm moments with family members," he said. "As they say, 'Jaan hai to jehan hai ' (if you have life, you have the world), and I guess the adage applies aptly right now," said the businessman. Datta, who underwent treatment for the novel coronavirus infection at Safdarjung Hospital here, said he became quite spiritual after completing his 14-day isolation and often thanks the Almighty now. "My life is a blessing from God and the doctors who treated me," he said. Dutta also said he would often fight the feeling of fear and guilt as upon his return from Italy he was informed that he was the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Delhi. "Today, I want to tell people to not take things casually. We hope that a vaccine is underway, but take all safety precautions especially in this festive season. Otherwise, we will have to face a tough situation again," he said. His cautionary words come at a time when Delhi has once again seen a big surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few days. In the highest single-day spike here till date, 4,853 fresh cases were recorded on Tuesday and the infection tally in the city mounted to over 3.64 lakh. The previous highest single-day spike of 4,473 cases was recorded on September 16. The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday stood at 2,832, and 4,136 on Sunday, while the figures were 4,116 on Saturday and 4,086 on Friday. The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. Meanwhile, the Union health ministry on Wednesday said the new coronavirus cases reported in India in a span of 24 hours remained below 45,000, even as the total Covid-19 caseload inched closer to 80 lakh. Datta, who was diagnosed with the infection much before the nationwide lockdown was implemented from March 25, lamented that "humans mostly don't learn lessons from such circumstances". "We all know that during the lockdown everyone was posting pictures of nature, of clear blue skies seen from their balconies, and listening to the chirping of sparrows, and thoughts about being humble to nature and not giving in to human greed in the name of development. All that philosophy remained a philosophy," he said. "Now, the skies are grey, the air is poisonous, and sparrows have again disappeared. This virus taught us, humans, such valuable lessons too, but guess the wisdom we gained came with an expiry date. With the easing of lockdown norms, we are again tending to slip into our old inertia," said Datta, with a hint of disappointment in his voice. But hope springs eternal, and the leather businessman who is no stranger to "risky environment", says "hope is all we have in this battle, where the enemy is faceless and knows no boundaries".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/situation-not-normal-dont-lower-guard-delhis-1st-covid-19-patient-908237.html

The Indian government has decided to allow its overseas citizens to add their local address in their country of residence mainly to aid those who do not have permanent or valid addresses in India, Siddhartha Kumar Baraily, consul, Passport and Attestation, at the Indian Consulate in Dubai told the Gulf News. “We understand that many people who have been staying for a long time in the UAE don’t have a valid address in India. They may add their local UAE address in their passports,” he said. Change in address cannot be made in existing passports, the official clarified. Indian passport holders have to apply for a new passport in which the change in address can be made. The facility can be availed by Indian expats living in both rented or self-owned accommodations, the report said. Those wishing to give their UAE address should provide certain documents as proof of residence at the time of applying for a new passport for changing the address from India to overseas. Baraily said either the electricity and water bill or rent agreement/title deed/tenancy contract will be accepted as proof of residence in the UAE. Changing their address may help applicants to get quick police verification from India at the time of passport renewal. Police verification is now mandatory for the passport renewal of all Indian expats as per a change in the policy of India’s Ministry of External Affairs implemented since September. However, the diplomat clarified that police verification of Indians abroad does not require verification of the address of the applicant. “This [police verification] is just to verify the identity of the applicants as Indian citizens and that there are no criminal cases registered against them since the time of the last police verification done on them,” he explained. The mission is, however, encouraging Indians without a valid address to change their address, whether in India or locally, the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-expats-can-now-provide-local-address-in-passport-908249.html

The minister said only 'green' firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in Delhi this Diwali as per a Supreme Court order issued in 2018. The minister said that smoke from firecrackers and stubble burning make Delhi’s air “hazardous” every year. “The government will launch an anti-cracker campaign from November 3. Under it, 11 special squads of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and city police will inspect firecracker manufacturing units to ensure that there is no old stock left,” he said. “In fact, I appeal to the people of Delhi to launch a ‘no-crackers’ campaign. They should try and avoid burning firecrackers completely considering the seriousness of the situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Rai said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/anti-firecracker-campaign-to-be-launched-in-delhi-from-nov-3-environment-minister-908256.html

The finding is part of the joint survey conducted by government think-tank NITI Aayog and the US-based philanthropic organisation Rockefeller Foundation on 'Electricity Access and Benchmarking of Distribution Utilities.' "Overall 87 per cent respondents said they have access to grid-based electricity. The remaining 13 per cent either use non-grid sources for electricity and lighting or don't use any electricity at all," the survey said. The study further showed that of all customers using non-grid sources, the majority 62 per cent of them are agricultural customers. Only four per cent of households today do not have access to grid-based electricity. The survey was released by Smart Power India (SPI), a subsidiary of Rockefeller Foundation, on Wednesday. It was conducted across 10 states with a sample size of over 25,000 respondents consisting of different consumer categories such as households, agriculture, commercial enterprises and institutions both from rural and urban areas. It mainly focused on key areas such as grid connectivity, electricity access, customer satisfaction, utilities' capacity to delivery and drivers of sustainability for utilities. The survey also showed that a total of 66 per cent of surveyed customers are satisfied with the overall services from their utility. However, there were differences in satisfaction levels between urban customers (75 per cent) and rural customers (63 per cent). According to the survey, utilities across Uttar Pradesh have performed far below the other utilities. SPI Chief Executive Officer Jaideep Mukherji said, "India has emerged as one of the leaders in providing electricity access, almost doubling the access rate in the past 20 years from 59.4 per cent to extending grid connections to 100 per cent households in the country." He added that this has been made possible through a multitude of efforts, including enhancing power generation to reduce supply deficits, strengthening the backbone of the electricity supply infrastructure, and ensuring last-mile connectivity for different customer segments. However, despite achieving 100 per cent household electrification, access to reliable and affordable electricity supply continues to remain a major challenge. It is now time to focus on the sustainability of electricity access and craft an action plan to resolve the barriers, he noted. Deepali Khanna, managing director (Asia Regional Office) of The Rockefeller Foundation, said, "As the power sector seeks to achieve greater self-reliance and sound financial health, delivery effectiveness and customer satisfaction will play a crucial role in strengthening the overall performance of the sector."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/87-households-have-access-to-grid-connected-power-some-still-dont-use-electricity-survey-908273.html

Here are the top stories of October 28, 2020: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday blamed the central government's policies for the spiralling prices of onion and said he would speak to the Centre about the stock limit imposed on the commodity traders. Speaking to onion growers and traders in Nashik district of Maharashtra, Pawar said a comprehensive policy is needed regarding the lifting of the export ban and stock limit of onion, and it should cover interests of all stakeholders. The Congress launched a sharp attack on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the BJP over reports of police cane charging of devotees participating in the Durga Puja procession in Munger, going all out to paint the BJP and the JD(U) as “anti-Hindu”. “Merciless crushing in the month of October… when Dusshera and Diwali are upon us. People doing puja-reverence of Maa Durga are being fired upon, chased around with lathis,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about other countries in his speeches but not about the problems facing India such as unemployment. Rahul, who arrived in West Champaran district for his second round of campaigning in the ongoing state elections, also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over unemployment and the issue of migration.  The suspension of scheduled international passenger flights has been extended till November 30 amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said "However, the international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis," the Indian aviation regulator said in a circular. Rampant flouting of mask wearing and social distancing regulations have prompted the special officer in Bengaluru’s South zone to increase the number of violators that each BBMP marshal must catch. In a notice issued on October 25, Munish Moudgil, Special Officer for South zone wrote that: “BBMP marshals have been allotted a target of booking a minimum of twenty offenders in each assembly constituency per day in the South Zone.” President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, one of the world's most fossil-fuel reliant economies, said on Wednesday the country will go carbon neutral by 2050. The announcement comes after Japan earlier this week said will cut greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and become a carbon-neutral society, a major shift in position on climate change.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-international-flights-suspended-till-november-30-congress-attacks-nitish-kumar-over-munger-firing-908286.html

The fresh development on Wednesday night will be a major embarrassment to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as Sivasankar was serving as secretary at CMO over the last four years and was involved in many key decision-making processes. Opposition parties Congress and BJP stepped up attack against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan demanding his resignation. The High Court on Wednesday rejected his anticipatory bail applications in connection with probes by ED and Customs against him and Enforcement Directorate officials swiftly took him to Kochi from an Ayurveda hospital in Thiruvananthapuram where he was under treatment. Sivasankar was quizzed at ED office in Kochi till night and subsequently, his arrest was recorded. He is likely to be produced before a magistrate by tomorrow. The ED had earlier registered a case against the accused in the gold smuggling case. Sivasankar's nexus with the gold smuggling racket was mainly through the former employee of the UAE consulate in Kerala, Swapna Suresh, who is a key accused of smuggling gold using diplomatic baggage. The Customs and Enforcement directorate were learnt to have received solid evidence for Sivasankar's nexus with Swapna in managing illegal wealth by introducing a chartered accountant for her, pressurising a bank manager to give US dollars to Swapna in exchange of Indian rupees. Sivasankar being a Man Friday of Vijayan for over four years and handling all crucial files at the CMO, Opposition parties alleged that any actions like arrest against Sivasankar were as good as acting against the Chief Minister itself. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the investigations would lead to the Chief Minister and hence Vijayan should quit the post immediately. Opposition parties staged violent demonstrations at various parts of the state. The Chief Minister was yet to comment on the matter, while CPM leaders maintained that Sivasankar was placed under suspension as soon as the allegations against him surfaced. Sivasankar, an IAS officer of 1995 batch, was handpicked by Vijayan as his secretary as soon as he took over as the Chief Minister in 2016. He was also holding the Information Technology department principal secretary post. He was suspended from service in July after the allegations surfaced. Sivasankar sought anticipatory bail after ED and Customs quizzed him for several hours and he failed to give convincing replies to many queries. The investigation agencies even told the court, while opposing his bail plea, that he misused official position to help gold smuggling accused and his direct involvement in the illegal activities could be even suspected. Considering these the court rejected the anticipatory bail plea. Though Customs reportedly made steps to arrest Sivasankar on October 16 after summoning him, he complained of discomfort on the way and was hence hospitalised. The central agencies had expressed doubts over his illness, though hospital authorities maintained that he was having disc ailments. Sivasankar was placed under suspension after a panel headed by chief secretary Vishwas Mehta reported that Sivasankar violated service rules. He allegedly facilitated the appointment of Swapna in Space Park under the Information Technology department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-arrests-kerala-cms-former-secretary-m-sivasankar-908314.html

The national transporter aimed at doing away with 16,238 conventional coaches by 2025 and another 23,090 coaches by 2030. Railways has a fleet of 60,000 coaches, out of which a majority are conventional coaches. The conventional coaches were introduced more than four decades back when the maximum train speed was about 60 kmph, while express trains are running at 110 kmph easily.  "Railways already improved its infrastructure to increase the train speed in many routes, it is keen on the introduction of LHB coaches, which have more safety features," said an official in the railways.  The railway is preparing to upgrade the speed of trains up to 130 kilometers per hour begin with two routes, from Delhi to Mumbai and from Delhi to Howrah in this fiscal. In the coming years, railways is planning to introduce more semi-high speed trains on major routes in different parts of the country. "Introducing LHB coaches for most of the trains will help to improve travel comfort and to increase the speed at 120-130 km per hour", said an official.  Unlike Integral Coach Factory (ICF)- designed conventional train coaches, the LHB coaches carrying capacity is more and has higher speed potential.  The LHB train coaches are lighter in weight and have anti-climbing features. These anti-climbing features, prevents coaches from getting piled up during rail accidents||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-replace-conventional-coaches-with-lhb-coaches-908329.html

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the petitioner, submitted before a bench presided over by Justice A M Khanwilkar that governments will come and go. However, conformity with democratic norms was needed, especially if it was related to parliamentary heritage work. Heightened judicial scrutiny is called for in this case, he submitted. "A case of this type demands a higher level of judicial scrutiny. Rights and privileges of the general public are at stake," he said, adding no empirical study has been undertaken to justify the huge cost that was being incurred to the exchequer. The authorities have acted arbitrarily and thus constitutional checks and balances will have to be used here, he said. Divan also pointed out no expert study has been conducted to show the present Parliament building was no longer usable. "A hands-off approach by the court is not permissible in this case. Centuries of history cannot be undone at the will of the government. The authorities have to show that decision is based upon relevant consideration and documents," he said. "When you deal with Parliament, there needs to be checks and balances. How can it be left to CPWS?" Divan asked. He cited Justice J Chelameshwar's opinion in the K S Puttuswamy case, "Constitution cannot be seen as an ink which can be erased from one regime to another." He said if the government wanted to supplant the parliamentary building, it required a statute. Parliament needs to be involved in this. There needs to be the highest degree of transparency in this process. He also referred to a series of judgements to buttress his point that public participation was important in administrative affairs. The arguments in the matter remained inconclusive and would continue on Thursday. The Union government has earlier defended before the court its Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista Project, saying there would be no destruction or dismantling of any heritage structure or cutting of existing trees for the construction of new Parliament and central secretariat buildings. In an affidavit to a plea by Rajeev Suri against the project, the government said construction of the new building to suit the present-day requirement with latest facilities and to accommodate more members is the most prudent proposal. The new Parliament building would allow Lok Sabha to accommodate 876 members and Rajya Sabha with 400 members.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-parliament-proposal-needs-higher-level-of-judicial-review-sc-told-908334.html
28-10-2020||National||Bihar Assembly Election: Direct contest between NDA, Mahagathbandhan||With the first phase of polling over, the contest seems to be a direct one in Bihar between NDA and Mahagathbandhan with BJP and RJD being the main contenders. Despite LJP leader Chirag Paswan sharpening his attack on Nitish Kumar, the Bihar Chief Minister refrained from replying in the same tone. However, he kept the RJD at the centre of its attack. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his election rally on Wednesday sought to revive the memory of alleged 'jungle raj' (rule of lawlessness) during Lalu Prasad's time when he called Tejashwi Yadav the 'Yuvraj of Jungle Raj'. Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who was wooed back by Nitish Kumar as a Dalit alternative to Chirag, slammed Tejashwi Yadav as "childish" and "inexperienced". Now the indications are that the contest may remain bipolar despite new alliances and parties contesting the polls. Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP is contesting in alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM and BSP, while Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav has formed Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) in alliance with Chandrasekhar Azad Ravan's Azad Samaj Party, the Bahujan Mukti Party (BMP) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). Experience of other elections shows that small party alliances have not worked well in Bihar. The bigger parties like RJD, BJP and JD(U) in the state, however, may have to put up with not so big a show of their allies.  The RJD is contesting in 144 seats, the maximum number of seats being contested by any political party. Congress, which had won 27 of 41 seats it contested in 2015 (when JD(U), RJD and Congress were together) is this time contesting a whopping 70 seats and its performance will have a bearing on the overall performance of the grand alliance. Indications are that the RJD could have a much better strike rate. Of the 29 seats given to Left in the grand alliance, CPI-ML has got 19, which could be a problem area for the grand alliance as well. In 2015, CPI-ML had won three seats while CPI and CPI-M had scored zero. In the last assembly polls, BJP got 24.4% votes and won, though it won only 53 (33% strike rate) of 157 seats it contested. The RJD won 80 of 101 seats it contested and got 18.4% votes. JD(U) won 71 of 101 (71%) seats and got 16.8 % votes while Congress which had got only 6.7 % votes won 27 seats at a strike rate of nearly 70%. Upendra Kuhwaha's RLSP and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP which had contested as part of NDA had won only two seats out of 23 and 40 seats that they contested respectively out while another NDA ally Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM could win only one of 21 it contested then. With LJP and RLSP out of NDA's fold, their share has largely gone to BJP and JD(U), which could work to NDA's advantage. In the NDA bandwagon, many feel that 11 seats to Vikassheel Insan Party of Mukesh Sahani and six to Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM may create some difficulties and JD(U)'s strike rate this time may not match the past performance. LJP, which had fought the February 2005 election alone on 178 seats, won only 29 seats when Ram Vilas Paswan was at the peak of his political career. That was LJP's best show.  The BJP is now singing "Nitish only" tune and repeatedly slamming Chirag Paswan. It remains to be seen whether Chirag Paswan has read the political mood of the state properly or not.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bihar-assembly-election-direct-contest-between-nda-mahagathbandhan-908337.html

After inaugurating radiodiagnostic facilities and an MBBS student hostel in Bhatinda through a video link, he expressed deep gratitude to the dedicated efforts by all corona warriors and expressed grief over the death of those who sacrificed their lives saving others, according to a health ministry statement. "For the last 10 months, India has been persistently fighting the infectious disease and now the Covid-19 parameters are showing encouraging progress. The continuously rising recovery rate and progressively falling active cases have proven the success of the Covid-19 containment strategy. "We have successfully ramped up our testing capacity. From a few thousand tests in a day, we now conduct more than a million tests on a daily basis," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement. The AIIMS, Bathinda, shall have a capacity of 750 beds which will include emergency and trauma beds, AYUSH beds, private beds as well as ICU speciality and super speciality beds, according to the health ministry statement. As of now, OPD services in dentistry, dermatology, ENT, general medicine, general surgery, Obst and Gynae, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, paediatric surgery, psychiatry, surgical oncology, telemedicine, and urology are operational, it said. Inaugurating the super-speciality block of the hospital, Vardhan said, "Since the foundation stone was laid in 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the institution has rapidly progressed. It's very heartening to see the state-of-the-art facility and equipment that will be available to the people of Bathinda and Punjab." Reiterating the government's commitment towards ensuring primary healthcare to all, he said, "With the successful implementation of schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the dream of 'new India' will be fulfilled by 2022."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rising-recovery-rate-falling-active-covid-19-cases-prove-success-of-containment-strategy-harsh-vardhan-908347.html

This is the first launch by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) since the Covid-19 induced lockdown came into force in March. ISRO Chairman K Sivan had said in June that ten space missions being prepared for launch this year have been 'disturbed' due to the lockdown. EOS-01 is intended for applications in agriculture, forestry and disaster management support, the city- headquartered ISRO said. "The launch is tentatively scheduled at 3.02 pm on November 7 subject to weather conditions" from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, it said in a statement. The customer satellites are being launched under commercial agreement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space, the space agency said, without giving further details. This will be the 51st mission of ISRO's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. In view of the strict Covid-19 pandemic norms in place at the launch centre, gathering of media personnel there was not planned and the viewing gallery will be closed, ISRO said. However, the live telecast of the launch will be available on ISRO website, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter channels, it added. Speaking to PTI in June, Sivan had said ISRO will make an assessment of the impact of the lockdown on its missions. Because of this (pandemic), everything got disturbed.

In an address to the top commanders of the Army, the defence minister described the Army as one of the "most trusted and inspiring" organisations in the country and said it is the government's national priority to provide the best weapons, equipment and clothing to the troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend India's territorial integrity. Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions. In a tweet after his address to the commanders, Singh said the government will leave no stone unturned to strengthen the "arms of our Armed forces" and that it is committed to facilitate reforms in the Army and help it achieve advantages in all areas. "Addressed the Army Commanders' Conference in New Delhi today. I'm extremely proud of the initiatives undertaken by the Indian Army in the current security environment," he said. The Army said the defence minister complimented the force for its high standard of operational preparedness and capabilities, which he experienced first-hand during his visits to forward areas. In his address, Singh also paid tributes to the "bravehearts" of Galwan, Kashmir and the Northeast for making the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of the motherland, the Army said in a statement. The defence minister, while commenting on the current situation along the northern borders, expressed confidence that while troops are standing firm, the ongoing talks for peaceful resolution of crisis will continue, the Army said. “It is our national responsibility to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity,” the Army quoted Singh as saying. The minister also asserted that there will be no budgetary constraints for capability development and meeting other requirements of the Army. The defence minister also reaffirmed the faith of the billion-plus citizens in the Indian Army as one of the "most trusted and inspiring" organisations in the country, the Army said in the statement. In his address, Singh mentioned the stellar role played by the Army in guarding the country's borders and fighting terrorism, apart from providing assistance to the civil administration whenever called for. “Actions of Indian Army truly ensure the integrity and sovereignty of our great nation,” he said. Referring to the situation along the border with Pakistan, the defence minister complimented the Army’s response to cross border terrorism and ceasefire violations and its excellent synergy with Central Armed Police Forces and police in tackling terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. "It is due to the synergised operations in the Valley that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is moving to a stable and peaceful environment conducive for overall growth and development,” he remarked. The top Army commanders are carrying out a comprehensive review of India's combat readiness along the Line of Actual Control with China as well as the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the four-day conference that began on Monday. The Army said its apex leadership is comprehensively deliberating upon all aspects of existing security scenarios, the situation along the borders and in the hinterland and challenges for the present security apparatus. Also, the conference is focussing on issues of organisational restructuring, logistics, administration and human resource management. In his remarks, Singh also described the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and establishment of Department of Military Affairs as a "momentous decision" on the path of rolling out Integrated Battle Groups, Integrated Theatre Commands and Integrated Air Defence Commands. He said the concept will be game-changers in the way Indian armed forces fight future wars”. “These were a result of the decision by the Prime Minister to undertake decisive reforms for transformational change to improve operational capability,” Singh said. He also alluded to the establishment of the Defence Cyber and Space Agencies which will enhance the kinetic potential of the forces, he said. The government had appointed Gen Bipin Rawat as Chief of Defence Staff on December 31 to bring in convergence among the three services and restructure military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges. The CDS is now planning to create theatre commands to help the armed forces prepare for future wars. As per the plan, each of the theatre commands will have units of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force and all of them will work as a single entity looking after security challenges in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander. At present, the Army, Navy and the Air Force have separate commands. The defence minister also said that the government is focused on enhancing combat capability and ensuring the welfare of soldiers. He said that the Delegation of Financial Powers, Defence Procurement Manual and the Army headquarters restructuring proposals are currently under review and will be finalised soon. “The announcement of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and notification of negative list of imports are big steps towards self-reliance in defence which offer a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to meet the future requirements of the Armed Forces,” he said. The defence minister remarked that the decision to grant permanent commission to women in the Army is another significant step that will ensure equal opportunities for professional growth to all officers irrespective of their gender.   Singh also said that the government is committed to corporatise the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to enhance its efficiency and accountability. He also assured the veteran community that all issues related to the ex-servicemen contributory health scheme (ECHS) will be addressed expeditiously. "The recent decisions to enhance monetary assistance to next of kin of all categories of battle casualties from existing Rs 2 lakhs to Rs 8 lakhs granted under Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund (ABCWF) and removal of minimum service clause for enhanced ordinary family pension are some of the major decisions taken to alleviate problems of our families," he said. Singh also complimented the efforts of the Border Roads Organisation for working under difficult conditions to connect far-flung areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-most-trusted-and-inspiring-organisation-in-india-rajnath-singh-908385.html

How credible are the Covid-19 numbers of Bihar – a state with nearly 10 crore population? Why does every district in Bihar follow exactly the same pattern in its epidemic curve? These are some of the questions being asked by the public health researchers who describe the eastern state as a miracle province because of such low Covid-19 numbers despite people's rampant Covid-inappropriate behaviour such as not to wear a mask, not to care for social distancing and thronging the crowded places, and the state's poor health infrastructure. “Bihar alone has done more than one crore Covid-19 tests so far (10% of India's total tests) and still kept its test positive rate of less than 5% for over two months. It's 2% now. The decline seems to be sustaining. It's remarkable indeed for a resource-poor state! But is this for real?” said health economist Rijo John, a visiting faculty at the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode and a consultant to the World Health Organisation. Surprisingly each of the 38 districts in Bihar without any exception shows a declining trend in the pandemic after a spike in August following the return of thousands of migrant labourers. Even though the people's mobility in Bihar is as good as the pre-lockdown days in February, there are no corresponding reflections in Covid-19 numbers. “The numbers are too good to be true even though they look really nice on papers. I fail to understand why there is no spike in Bihar despite such high mobility and epidemic unfriendly behaviour of people,” John told DH. The state's average test positivity rate is about 2% as it varies from 10% in Patna to 1% in many districts. But surprisingly, the districts with the positivity rate of less than 3% carried out 92% of total tests so far. Patna, Samastipur and East Champaran with a positivity rate of more than 5% did only 7% of all tests. Also, Patna contributes to 16% of total cases so far and yet contributes to only 4.4% tests in Bihar, whereas, Gaya which contributes only 3% cases has done more than 5% of tests with a positivity rate of 1%. “There are many unanswered questions on Bihar, considering the state's demography, economy and public health infrastructure,” he said. Meanwhile, the downward slide in India's Covid-19 numbers stopped on Wednesday with the recording of more than 500 deaths and nearly 44,000 new cases in the last 24 hours. Cumulatively India's Covid-19 caseload numbers crossed the 80 lakh mark Wednesday on even though the epidemic slowed down since September third week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/the-curious-case-of-coronavirus-numbers-in-bihar-908386.html

He said like, in countries around the world, the tourism sector here too was facing a number of challenges due to the pandemic. "The tourism industry contributes significantly to the economy of the country, both in GDP and employment apart from being a key sector for foreign exchange earnings. This sector has been hit the hardest by the pandemic," a statement from the ministry quoted Patel as saying. The Central government has announced several economic stimulus packages and many other fiscal and relief measures for the survival of businesses, employee retention, and sectoral revival. The state governments too have taken similar measures to support the businesses," he said. The minister further stated that the Indian tourism, travel, and hospitality industry is highly diverse and there are micro, small, medium, and large enterprises across the whole spectrum. The government has laid out a vision for a self-reliant India whereby collateral-free automatic loans have been made available for MSMEs to enable them to deal with the crisis, he said. "The Ministry of Tourism has been in a continuous dialogue with the representatives of tourism and hospitality industry stakeholders to discuss solutions and the way forward to revive the tourism economy by reviving demand, especially through the promotion of domestic tourism to build the confidence and trust of tourists," he said. Patel informed the meeting that India is gradually opening up to receive visitors and has made bubble arrangements with 18 countries. "India has also restored existing visas for business, conference, employment, studies, research, and medical purposes. I look forward to the early revival of the global tourism sector," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tourism-sector-hit-hardest-by-pandemic-prahlad-patel-at-brics-tourism-ministers-meet-908390.html

He also alleged that there was no arrangement of beds in hospitals for COVID-19 treatment in Maharashtra and bodies of patients who die due to the infection lie on footpaths unattended. The Congress is part of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra with NCP as the other partner. Addressing a rally at Limbdi in Surendranagar district where by-elections will be held on November 3 along with seven other assembly seats in Gujarat, Rupani said his government has done a good job in controlling the pandemic, unlike the Congress government in Maharashtra. "We have done a good job during coronavirus. The Congress has a government in neighbouring Maharashtra, where more than 45,000 people have died (due to coronavirus). There is no arrangement of beds in hospitals. People wander on footpaths and bodies of patients who have died due to coronavirus lie on footpaths (in that state)," he alleged. "The Congress government has left it to 'bhagwan bharose' to control coronavirus (in Maharashtra)," he said. "In Gujarat, we have surplus beds...there is no shortage of beds. We have achieved 90 per cent recovery rate and the death rate is 2.25 per cent death rate, which is further going down. We have provided costly injections and medicines free of cost, and supplied ventilators to private hospitals," he said. "The BJP government has done all this in Gujarat...The people of Gujarat are fortunate, because had there been a Congress government in the state, there would have been chaos during the pandemic," Rupani added. The BJP and Congress are in direct contest on all the eight seats in the by-elections. While campaigning for party candidate Kiritsinh Rana from Limbdi assembly seat, Rupani also accused the Congress of creating a culture of "Aaya Ram, Gaya Ram", referring to the practice of MLAs defecting to other parties. He cited some instances in Gujarat as well as last year's development in Maharashtra, wherein Shiv Sena joined hands with Congress and NCP to form the government. "What did you (Congress) do in Maharashtra? People's mandate was with the BJP. But you made a coalition government with NCP and Shiv Sena. There is no moral value left in Congress. This is Rahul Gandhi's Congress and not Mahatma Gandhi's...without any values," he said. The chief minister claimed that eight former Congress MLAs, whose resignation has necessitated the bypolls in the state, had met him and expressed their desire to help the BJP win a seat in the Rajya Sabha elections held earlier this year. "The BJP has a majority in Lok Sabha, but not in Rajya Sabha. In order to help the party increase its tally in the Rajya Sabha, eight Congress MLAs met and told me they are tired of Congress's politics and leadership. "They said they cannot remain in that party and want to help Narendra Modi in Delhi, so that one additional (RS) member (of BJP) goes from Gujarat. This is why the elections are being held here," Rupani said. He expressed confidence that the BJP will win all the eight seats and added that while this makes no difference to the state government, it will prove to be the "final nail in the coffin of the Congress party". "We have to win all the eight seats, but this makes no difference to the government. The government is strong, stable, will complete five years...The difference is for the Congress. People of Limbdi have got a chance to drive the last nail in the Congress coffin," he said. Rupani said that Congress sheds crocodile tears in the name of farmers and alleged that it did nothing for them when it was in power in the state. He said when Narendra Modi became Gujarat's chief minister, he ensured that farmers get eight hours electricity, and now under Kisan Suryodaya Yojana (launched recently by PM Modi), they will even get electricity during the day. He also asked whether Congress's affiliation lies with "gundas" (anti-social elements) and land grabbers as it recently opposed the two bills against them in the Assembly. Rupani also recalled past Congress prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and accused them of making "false promises" of providing employment and eradicating poverty and corruption. He said the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state are working by keeping the interest of the poor in mind.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/maharashtra-govt-is-bhagwan-bharose-in-tackling-covid-19-gujarat-cm-rupani-908395.html

The kidnappers, demanded Rs 10 crore as a ransom to be paid in bitcoins for the release of the 56-year-old dentist, the police said. The prime accused is a close relative of the doctor's wife, they said. After learning about the dentists financial status, the accused hatched a plan along with other gang members from Maharashtra, Karnataka and from Hyderabad to abduct him to extort money by threatening him and his family, the police said. The accused formed two separate gangs to carry out his plan -- one for abducting the dentist and handing him over to the other gang which was to shift the abducted victim to a location in Karnataka till the ransom was received, Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanarsaid. As part of the plan, five burqa-clad persons forcibly took the dentist away in a car after injuring him with toy pistols and kept him in a room at Kukatpally area here till late Tuesday. The kidnappers then sent a voice message to the dentist's family demanding the ransom within 48 hours, police said. Subsequently, the doctor was handed over to the other gang which proceeded towards Bengaluru. Meanwhile, the dentist's relatives complained to the police. Twelve police teams were formed and they moved into Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana and started apprehending the accused. Finally, at Anantapur, the dentist was safely rescued, the police said. The dentist had been constructing a building with the clinic on the ground floor and the floors above were kept open for lease. Learning about this, the prime accused decided to abduct the doctor for money, they added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/abducted-dentist-from-hyderabad-rescued-in-andhra-pradesh-7-held-908398.html

In an address to the top commanders of the Army, the defence minister described the Army as one of the "most trusted and inspiring" organisations in the country and said it is a national responsibility to provide the best weapons, equipment and clothing to the troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend India's territorial integrity. Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between India and China have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the row. The defence minister also clearly asserted that there will be no budgetary constraints to enhance the capability of the Army and meeting its other requirements. In a tweet after his address to the commanders, Singh said the government will leave no stone unturned to strengthen the "arms of our Armed forces" and that it is committed to facilitate reforms in the Army and help it achieve advantages in all areas. "Addressed the Army Commanders' Conference in New Delhi today. I'm extremely proud of the initiatives undertaken by the Indian Army in the current security environment," he said. The Army said the defence minister complimented the force for its high standard of operational preparedness and capabilities, which he experienced first-hand during his visits to forward areas. Talking about reform initiatives to strengthen combat capabilities of the armed forces, Singh mentioned plans to roll out integrated battle groups, integrated theatre commands and integrated air defence commands, and called them "game-changers" in the way Indian armed forces will fight future wars. In his address, Singh also paid tributes to the "bravehearts" of Galwan, Kashmir and the Northeast for making the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of the motherland, the Army said in a statement. The defence minister, while commenting on the current situation along the northern borders, expressed confidence that while troops are standing firm, the ongoing talks for peaceful resolution of the crisis will continue, the Army said. His comments came ahead of the eighth round of military talks between the two armies. The fresh round of talks is expected to take place in the next few days. "It is our national responsibility to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity," the Army quoted Singh as saying. The defence minister also reaffirmed the faith of the billion-plus citizens in the Indian Army as one of the "most trusted and inspiring" organisations in the country, the Army said in the statement. In his address, Singh mentioned the stellar role played by the Army in guarding the country's borders and fighting terrorism, apart from providing assistance to the civil administration whenever called for. "Actions of Indian Army truly ensure the integrity and sovereignty of our great nation," he said. Referring to the situation along the border with Pakistan, the defence minister lauded the Army's response to cross border terrorism and ceasefire violations and its excellent synergy with Central Armed Police Forces and police in tackling terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. "It is due to the synergised operations in the Valley that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is moving to a stable and peaceful environment conducive for overall growth and development," he remarked. The top Army commanders are carrying out a comprehensive review of India's combat readiness along the Line of Actual Control with China as well as the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the four-day conference that began on Monday. The Army said its apex leadership is comprehensively deliberating upon all aspects of existing security scenarios, the situation along the borders and in the hinterland and challenges for the present security apparatus. Also, the conference is focussing on issues of organisational restructuring, logistics, administration and human resource management. In his remarks, Singh also described the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and establishment of Department of Military Affairs as a "momentous decision" on the path of rolling out Integrated Battle Groups, Integrated Theatre Commands and Integrated Air Defence Commands. He said the concept will be game-changers in the way Indian armed forces fight future wars "These were a result of the decision by the prime minister to undertake decisive reforms for transformational change to improve operational capability," Singh said. He also alluded to the establishment of the Defence Cyber and Space Agencies which will enhance the kinetic potential of the forces, he said. The government had appointed Gen Bipin Rawat as Chief of Defence Staff on December 31 to bring in convergence among the three services and restructure military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges. The CDS is now planning to create theatre commands to help the armed forces prepare for future wars. As per the plan, each of the theatre commands will have units of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force which will work as a single entity looking after security challenges in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander. At present, the Army, Navy and the Air Force have separate commands. The defence minister also said that the government is focused on enhancing combat capability and ensuring the welfare of soldiers. He said that the Delegation of Financial Powers, Defence Procurement Manual and the Army headquarters restructuring proposals are currently under review and will be finalised soon. "The announcement of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and notification of negative list of imports are big steps towards self-reliance in defence which offer a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to meet the future requirements of the Armed Forces," he said. On August 9, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that India will stop the import of 101 weapons and military platforms like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024. Subsequently, the defence ministry released the first list of items, with a detailed timeline, which will not be allowed to import. The decision was aimed at promoting the domestic defence industry. The defence minister remarked that the decision to grant permanent commission to women in the Army is another significant step that will ensure equal opportunities for professional growth to all officers irrespective of their gender. Singh also said that the government is committed to corporatise the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to enhance its efficiency and accountability. He also assured the veteran community that all issues related to the ex-servicemen contributory health scheme (ECHS) will be addressed expeditiously. "The recent decisions to enhance monetary assistance to next of kin of all categories of battle casualties from existing Rs 2 lakhs to Rs 8 lakhs granted under Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund (ABCWF) and removal of minimum service clause for enhanced ordinary family pension are some of the major decisions taken to alleviate problems of our families," he said. Singh also complimented the efforts of the Border Roads Organisation for working under difficult conditions to connect far-flung areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-troops-standing-firm-talks-with-china-to-continue-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-908415.html
28-10-2020||National Politics||PM Narendra Modi does not talk about unemployment in his speeches: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he talks about other countries in his speeches but not about the problems facing India such as unemployment. Gandhi, who arrived in West Champaran district for his second round of campaigning in the ongoing state elections, also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over unemployment and the issue of migration. Addressing his rally at Valmiki Nagar, the former Congress president said he was pained to see that Prime Minister Modi's effigy was burnt in Punjab on the occasion of Dusshera, and added that it reflected the "anger" of youths and farmers. "Youths and farmers of Punjab and Bihar and youths of Uttar Pradesh are angry that our PM keeps making speeches with Bihar Chief Minister and talks about other countries, but not the problems confronting our country such as unemployment," he said. He said the Prime Minister and the Bihar Chief Minister used to raise the issue of unemployment earlier but no longer now.    "Now, the PM does not say in his speeches that he would give two crore jobs. Because the people of Bihar have realised that he had lied. I can guarantee that if the PM comes today and promises two crore jobs to youths, perhaps the crowd would shoo him off, telling him that he had lied," Gandhi said. The Congress knows how to run a country, how to stand with farmers and give employment, but "we don't know how to lie", he said.  Criticising the Centre over the three recently passed farm laws, he said its "pilot project" was implemented in Bihar in 2006 when the mandi system was abolished in the state. "What Nitish Kumar did in Bihar in 2006, Narendra Modi is doing in Punjab, Haryana and across the country," Gandhi said.     The Congress has fielded Pravesh Kumar Mishra for the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha bye-election, while Rajesh Singh has been nominated for the assembly poll from there. The by-poll to Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha constituency has been necessitated due to death of JD(U) MP Baidyanath Mahto. The Lok Sabha by-poll will be held on November 7 and the results will be announced on November 10 alongside the results of Bihar assembly elections. Later in the day, Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to address a rally at Kusheswar Asthan in Darbhanga.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-narendra-modi-does-not-talk-about-unemployment-in-his-speeches-rahul-gandhi-908205.html
28-10-2020||National Politics||Kerala opposition steps up pressure on CM Pinarayi Vijayan to quit over gold smuggling case||The opposition parties in Kerala on Wednesday mounted pressure on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to quit after suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar was taken into ED custody, soon after a court rejected his anticipatory bail pleas in the gold smuggling case. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded the resignation of the chief minister after the officials of Enforcement Directorate (ED) took Sivasankar into custody from a hospital here.  "Without further justifying Sivasankar, the CM should step down from the post. It was the Chief Minister's Office that made all the moves to protect the accused in the gold smuggling case," he alleged. Earlier in the day, the Kerala High Court passed an order on two separate anticipatory bail pleas filed by Sivasankar apprehending arrest by Customs investigating the smuggling angle and ED probing the money trail in the case, dismissing them. After the high court passed the order on the matter, BJP state chief K Surendran told reporters that it has now become clear that the CMO intervened in the gold smuggling case. "When the agencies question Sivasankar, more details will come out. The court order has cornered the Left government in the state. As the investigation progresses, the involvement of the chief minister and his office will become clear," Surendran said. Central agencies---National Investigation Agency, Customs and the Enforcement Directorate, are conducting separate inquiries into the seizure of gold worth nearly Rs 15 crore from a "diplomatic baggage" at Thiruvananthapuram International airport on July 5. Several people, including two former employees of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S, have been arrested by the central agencies in connection with the case. Meanwhile, Law Minister A K Balan said the government wanted all the culprits in the gold smuggling case to be brought to book and extended support to the central agencies in the probe. "The chief minister has sought a comprehensive probe by the central agencies on July 8.. We just want the law to take its course. Also, the agencies have not complained against the state government as we have provided necessary assistance to them for the investigation," Balan told the media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/kerala-opposition-steps-up-pressure-on-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-to-quit-over-gold-smuggling-case-908222.html
28-10-2020||National Politics||Congress rejects new land laws in Jammu and Kashmir||The Congress treads a cautious line on issues related to Jammu and Kashmir as it rejected the changes to the law that allowed outsiders to purchase urban and non-agriculture land in the newly carved out Union Territory. The party appears to have accepted the reading down of Article 370 and 35A, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, as fait-accompli and focused its energies on opposing the Union Territory status to J&K. “There are three compartments – the revocation of Article 370, the statehood versus UT issue and the land issue. The Congress has opposed the last two categorically,” Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said here. Rejecting the new land laws for the union territory of J&K, Singhvi said it does not have the minimal safeguards on ownership of land found in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and northeastern states. “We are opposed to it because it does not follow elementary canons of participatory democracy. What is the degree of dialogue, exchange of views, meetings of mind or attempts… the answer is zero,” the Rajya Sabha member said. Singhvi said the government has made an exception for ownership of agricultural land but has left the option open, indicating that there was a possibility of relaxing the provision in the future. The Congress Working Committee adopted a resolution at a meeting on August 6 last year stating that Article 370 deserved to be honoured until it was amended, after consultation with all sections of the people, and strictly in accordance with the Constitution of India. The Congress had also stayed away from the Gupkar Alliance, a conglomeration of political parties of J&K, which pledged to fight for the protection of special status for J&K and its statehood. The party leaders believe that any misstep on Article 370 could prove disastrous for the party nationally, particularly in the ongoing Bihar elections, where the Opposition is trying to focus the campaign on local issues.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-rejects-new-land-laws-in-jammu-and-kashmir-908245.html

Speaking to onion growers and traders in Nashik district of Maharashtra, Pawar said a comprehensive policy is needed regarding the lifting of the export ban and stock limit of onion, and it should cover interests of all stakeholders. Onion is being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg at retail markets in Mumbai. To contain onion prices, the Centre last week imposed stock holding limit on retail and wholesale traders till December 31 to improve the domestic availability of the key kitchen staple and provide relief to consumers. Retailers can stock up onion up to 2 tonnes, whereas wholesale traders are allowed to keep up to 25 tonnes, it said. To register their protest against the Centre's move, traders kept off onion auctions for the last two days in all 15 Agriculture Produce Market Committees in Nashik, including at Lasalgaon APMC, Asia's biggest onion market. Pawar on Wednesday urged traders to reopen the markets for auction, and said banning export and promoting import was contradictory and the stock limit condition should also be removed. He further said the Centre had excluded onion from the list of essential commodities and at the same time, there were raids against traders. "I don't think the instructions came from the state government," the former Union agriculture minister said. "The state government is not responsible for action against traders. The decision on import and export of onion takes place at the central government level," said Pawar, whose party is an alliance partner in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government. Nashik has always been known for growing quality onion and rise and fall in market prices affect onion the most, he added. Maharashtra is one of the top producers of onion and Nashik is a major hub of the commodity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sharad-pawar-blames-centres-policies-for-soaring-onion-prices-908257.html
28-10-2020||National Politics||Madhya Pradesh bypolls: BJP promises free Covid-19 vaccine||After Bihar, the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh has promised free coronavirus vaccine to every resident of the state in its manifesto for the November 3 Assembly byelections. The party came out with a separate `Sankalp Patra' or manifesto for each of the 28 poll-bound constituencies on Wednesday. "Mostly, local issues have been included in each manifesto," said MP BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal. But free Covid-19 vaccine and restart of the schemes closed by the previous Congress government are common promises, he said. "As far as free vaccination is concerned, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has already announced it," he said. The BJP's promise of the free vaccine in Bihar had drawn flak from opposition parties. The Congress scoffed at the promise of the free vaccine in Madhya Pradesh. "The BJP should vaccinate people before the polling on November 3. Where is the vaccine for Covid-19? The BJP is selling dreams to people and trying to mislead them," said state Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta. Chouhan's announcement of direct benefit transfer (DBT) of Rs 4,000 to the beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi also finds mention in the BJP's list of promises. Twenty-two Congress MLAs, mostly loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia, resigned in March which led to the collapse of the Congress government in MP. Three legislators resigned and joined the BJP later, while three other seats fell vacant due to the death of incumbent legislators.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-bjp-promises-free-covid-19-vaccine-908323.html
28-10-2020||National Politics||Bihar polls: Rahul Gandhi throws 'chai, pakoda' jibes at PM Narendra Modi at rallies, raises job issue||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Wednesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, throwing at him "chai and pakoda" jibes and accusing him of "not talking about" issues confronting India such as unemployment but speaking only about other countries. On his second round of campaign in the ongoing state elections, Gandhi addressed two back to back rallies -- one at Valmiki Nagar in West Champaran and the other at Kusheswar Asthan in Darbhanga -- and also assailed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the issues of unemployment, migration and poverty. At his first rally at Valmiki Nagar, the former Congress president once again criticised the three farm laws, the governments handling of the migrant crisis and demonetisation, and alleged Modi and Nitish "control the media". Gandhi said angry farmers in Punjab burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Modi on the occasion of Dusshera which "pained" him. "If I tell you the truth, I did not like it. Because after all Narendra Modiji is our prime minister, the country prime minister. "Usually effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Meghanada are burnt on Dusshera. But, it is for the first time that the effigies of Narendra Modi, Ambani and Adani were burnt," he said. "I saw it for the first time (that a prime ministers effigy was being burnt on the occasion of Dusshera). You did not get to see it may be because Nitishji and Modiji control the media," he told the crowd at the Darbhanga rally. He said small shopkeepers, youths, farmers and labourers are today "angry" with Modi at the national level and Kumar in Bihar. He also alleged the reason the prime ministers effigy was burnt was that "what Nitishji did in Bihar in 2006, Modiji is doing in Punjab, Haryana and across the country. He said the "pilot project" for the three farm laws -- the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation), the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act was run in Bihar. The Congress has been vehemently opposing the farm laws, alleging it will destroy the mandi system, end the MSP regime and leave farmers at the mercy of big corporates. All the charges have been rejected by the Centre "In 2006, it started much earlier in Bihar. Your backbone, your farming system, MSP and procurement system were abolished. Today, the youth of the nation cannot get employment," Gandhi told the gathering. As he was in the middle of his speech, talking about migration and unemployment, a person from among the crowd shouted "he (Modi) asks us to fry pakodas". "Did you fry pakodas? Rahul Gandhi responded jovially, drawing applause and cheers from the crowd. Next time they come, fry pakodas and offer some to Nitishji and Modiji," Gandhi mockingly said. In January 2018, Modi had said in a TV interview that people earning Rs 200 a day by selling 'pakodas' cannot be considered unemployed, a remark often ridiculed by the Congress.     At his rally in West Champaran, Gandhi said, "The Prime Minister had come here a few years ago. He is again coming in the next two days. He had said its a sugar belt, will operationalise sugar mill and have tea prepared with local sugar on my next visit. Do you remember? Did he have tea with you? No." He said the prime minister and the Bihar chief minister used to raise the issue of unemployment earlier but no longer now. "Youths and farmers of Punjab and Bihar and youths of Uttar Pradesh are angry that our PM keeps making speeches with Bihar Chief Minister and talks about sugar, tea and other countries, but not about the problems confronting our country such as unemployment," he said. "Now, the PM does not say in his speeches that he would give two crore jobs. Because the people of Bihar have realized that he had lied. "I can guarantee that if the PM comes today and promises two crore jobs to youths, perhaps the crowd would shoo him away, telling him that he had lied," Gandhi said. He said the people of Bihar gave 15 years to Nitish Kumar as chief minister and six years to Modi as Prime Minister yet "Bihar is the poorest state". "I want to see the day when youth from other states come to Patna to find employment," he said. He said India today cannot create jobs and the "neighboring countries have marched ahead of us. He said the ongoing elections in Bihar was about the states future and not about "Lalu ji's family, Nitish jis or my family." If the Congress comes to power it will be a government of all castes and religions, he added. "We know how to run the country, we know how to stand with the farmers, we know how to give employment to the youth. But there is definitely a shortcoming in us that we do not know to lie, we cannot compete with them in lying," he said. He also praised RJD leader and Mahagathbandhans chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, saying he wants to give a new perspective and talks about employment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bihar-polls-rahul-gandhi-throws-chai-pakoda-jibes-at-pm-narendra-modi-at-rallies-raises-job-issue-908336.html

State BJP legal cell head S D Sanjay shot off the written complaint to the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar requesting "legal action" against Gandhi who also addressed a couple of rallies in the state earlier in the day. As per the complaint, Gandhi had "issued a statement on Twitter asking for votes... today. The time for making an appeal for the first phase of polls was over 28 hours earlier". According to Sanjay, who is a former Additional Solicitor General of India, such an appeal made on the day of polling was "in utter violation of Model Code of Conduct, warranting action against him". Polling took place for 71 constituencies of the 243- member Assembly in the first of the three-phase election on Wednesday. The complainant also appended printouts of the three-line tweet of Gandhi, in Hindi, which said, "This time for justice, employment, farmers and labourers, may your votes be for the Grand Alliance. Best wishes for all of your for the first phase of polls in Bihar", ending with the hashtag #aajbadlegaBihar (today Bihar will undergo a change).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-accuses-rahul-gandhi-of-violating-model-code-of-conduct-shoots-off-complaint-to-ec-908343.html
28-10-2020||North and Central||MCDs not releasing salaries of doctors shameful, Centre must grant funds to civic bodies: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said it is shameful that doctors of MCD-run hospitals are forced to protest over salary dues and requested the Centre to grant funds to municipal corporations so that their paychecks can be issued. Several doctors in hospitals run by the North MCD have claimed they have not been paid in three months and have been protesting for the last two weeks. Kejriwal also alleged gross mismanagement and corruption in the functioning of the MCDs and said it was time things were set right. The municipal corporations, being ruled by the BJP for the third consecutive term, will go to elections in 2022. There was no immediate reaction available from the North MCD. “It pains me that our doctors have to protest for their salaries. These doctors risked their lives to serve us during the pandemic. They should have got medals, but MCDs have not even given them their salaries. This is shameful,” the CM said while inaugurating a waste-to-energy plant at the Ghazipur poultry and fish market. “We have been witnessing that civic bodies have not been able to pay salaries of teachers, sanitation workers and doctors over the years. Why is there such an acute shortage of funds in MCDs?” he asked. Kejriwal said the Delhi government has released more funds to the MCDs as compared to previous governments. “MCDs are allocated Rs 12,000 in the budget. The salaries of their employees amount to Rs 6,000 crore, then why the employees have not been paid. We have given them more than their due. Our doctors should be taking care of patients in hospital… they have been forced to protest instead,” he said. The Delhi government allocates funds to the civic bodies in its annual budget under plan and non-plan heads, according to a senior MCD official. Kejriwal said there should be no politics over the issue of doctors’ salaries and everybody should make efforts to ensure they get their paychecks. He said the central government gives Rs 488 per person as grants to all municipal corporations in the country. “But it has not been releasing funds to MCDs in Delhi for some years,” Kejriwal claimed. According to Delhi’s population, this is around Rs 1,200 crore per year, and for the last 10 years, the Centre owes around Rs 12,000 crore to Delhi’s MCDs, he said. “I request the Centre to give funds to MCDs so that they release salaries of doctors,” the CM said. Kejriwal said the pandemic has hit the tax collection of the Delhi government but it has been managing affairs properly and releasing salaries of its doctors and teachers. “If we had the funds, I would have given the salaries of doctors of MCD-run hospitals today itself… doesn’t matter if it was as per the Constitution or not,” he said. The chief minister also claimed that the MCDs were yet to repay Rs 3,800 the Delhi government loaned to them. “Also, the MCDs owe Rs 3,000 to the Delhi Jal Board for the services rendered by it,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mcds-not-releasing-salaries-of-doctors-shameful-centre-must-grant-funds-to-civic-bodies-kejriwal-908037.html
28-10-2020||North and Central||Chhattisgarh House passes agri Bill to counter Centre's farm laws||Amid the Congress opposition to the Centre's new farm laws, the party-led government in Chhattisgarh brought its own agriculture amendment bill, seeking to protect farmers from fluctuating market prices, which was passed in the state Assembly on Tuesday. The Chhattisgarh Krishi Upaj Mandi (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was passed in the Assembly after which Speaker Charandas Mahant adjourned the two-day special session of the House on its first day only. Introducing the amendment bill in the House, state Agriculture Minister Ravindra Choubey said it is aimed at protecting farmers from fluctuating market prices and payment risks. The special session was convened amid apprehensions among farmers across the country that the Centre's new laws would harm them, including a fear that their land and produce could be handed over to corporates, he said. Choubey said amendments were made in the state's Mandi Act to help farmers get better price for their produce, adding the Bill did not violate any central laws, thereby avoiding confrontation with the Union government. Speaking on the Bill's objectives, Choubey said, "80 per cent of the farmers in the state are small and marginal cultivators. "Since they neither have the capacity to store grains nor bargain for fair prices, it was necessary to establish 'deemed mandi' and an electronic trading platform for their benefit." "These moves will help them get the right price for their produce without being impacted by market fluctuations," he said. The Bill allows the state government to establish deemed mandis or declare private markets as deemed mandis for regulation of marketing of notified agricultural produce, the Congress minister said. The Bill also has the provision to ensure power to the secretary or any employee of the market committee or board, who is empowered by the competent authority or notified officers, to order production of accounts relating to the purchase and sale of the notified agricultural produce from any person. These officials will also have the right to inspect storage facilities (godowns) and vehicles and if required and can seize them. The Bill allows the state government to establish an electronic trading platform sale of notified agricultural produce. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, while taking part in the discussion in the House, said the Centre's new farm laws were meant to help "capitalists" and not cultivators. Meanwhile, former CM and BJP leader Raman Singh dubbed the amendment bill as "anti-Constitutional" and said it was part of the Congress' political agenda. He accused the Congress of spreading fear among people about the farm laws enacted by the Modi government recently. The Bill was passed by voice vote after the discussion. BJP MLAs demanded that the Baghel government start paddy procurement drive from November 1. Last week, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre's new farm laws and passed four bills it said will counter the contentious legislation enacted by Parliament.

The encounter erupted after security forces launched a cordon-and-search-operation (CASO) at Moachwah in Chadoora area of Budgam around 7 pm on Tuesday following ‘specific’ information about the presence of militants there, a police official said. Inspector General Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said that during the search operation militants fired at the forces triggering a gun battle yesterday evening. “Today, morning two militants including a Pakistani Ilyas were killed. The second slain militant has been identified as Javaid Ahmed from Pulwama,” he said. The IGP said that the role of Illyas in recent highway attacks can’t be ruled out and that police were investigating their involvement. “We gave full opportunity to militants who were trapped at Mouchwa to surrender,” he said. In relentless anti-insurgency operations, security forces have killed 200 militants, including 30 foreigners, in 87 operations across Jammu and Kashmir this year. As many as 157 militants were killed in Kashmir in 2019 while the number was 257 in 2018 which was the highest in a decade. In 2019, out of 157 slain militants, 33 were Pakistanis and the majority of them belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammad. In 2019, local militants accounted for 79% of deaths in encounters while the number has grown to 88% this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-militants-killed-in-encounter-in-kashmir-s-budgam-908127.html

28-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality improves, but relief may be short-lived||Pollution levels dipped in the national capital on Wednesday morning, primarily due to increased wind speed, but the relief could be short-lived. At 10 am, the city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 281, which falls in the “poor” category. Prior to this, the air quality remained “very poor” for five days on the trot. The 24-hour average AQI was 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. An AQI between 0and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said favourable wind speed helped in dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday evening. However, the wind speed has reduced again which will allow pollutants to accumulate, he said. The air quality may slip into the “very poor” category by Thursday, the scientist said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose to 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far. It was 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday. The wind direction and wind speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions on Tuesday. The number of farm fires in neighbouring states was 1,943 on Monday – the highest so far this season, SAFAR said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.8 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve slightly on Wednesday but pollution levels will rise again on Thursday, SAFAR said. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the national capital's air quality was likely to remain “very poor” till October 31. The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be around 4,000 metre square per second on Wednesday – unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-improves-but-relief-may-be-short-lived-908191.html

The five Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs have given in writing that their signatures on the senior leader’s nomination papers were forged, Vidhan Sabha secretariat sources said. But the dramatic development, a day after Gautam had filed nomination for next month’s Rajya Sabha elections, triggered speculation that the five Uttar Pradesh MLAs are planning to switch sides. The five MLAs are Aslam Raini, Aslam Chaudhary, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind and Hargovind Bhargava. The scrutiny of nominations is being undertaken Wednesday for the election on November 9. The returning officer will look into the complaint about the forged signatures and take a decision, sources said. On Monday, Mayawati’s party had fielded its national coordinator and Bihar in-charge Ramji Gautam for the Rajya Sabha elections even though it did not have the number to ensure his victory. BSP leaders had indicated that they expected the other non-BJP parties to support his candidature, Altogether, 11 candidates, including eight from the BJP, have filed their papers for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh going to the polls in the biennial elections. Given the overwhelming strength of the BJP in the UP Assembly, all eight candidates – including Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri – fielded by the ruling party are expected to be elected. Of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant, three were earlier held by the BJP, four by the Samajwadi Party, two by the BSP and one by the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/5-bsp-mlas-withdraw-support-to-partys-rajya-sabha-nominee-trigger-speculation-over-switching-sides-908196.html
28-10-2020||North and Central||SC to consider plea by Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan's son against disqualification on November 6||The Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to consider on November 6 the petitions challenging an Allahabad High Court order on the disqualification of Mohammad Abdullah Azam Khan and holding of bypoll in Uttar Pradesh's Suar Assembly constituency. Khan, son of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, was disqualified as an MLA after the HC declared his election void on December 16, 2019 over irregularity in the declaration of his date of birth. His petition challenging the HC order is pending before the top court. The SC bench, presided by Chief Justice S A Bobde and comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, has posted the matter for consideration next week. Last week, acting on a writ petition, the HC had directed the Election Commission to start the process for holding bypoll in the constituency as no interim order was passed by the top court on Khan's plea. Both Khan and the EC have moved the top court against the HC's order. Khan contended that despite the pendency of his petition before the Supreme Court, the Allahabad High Court has shown "an unusual haste" and directed the Election Commission to hold the bypoll. Notably, the HC had taken a very serious view of the failure of the EC to hold bypoll in the Assembly constituency as the seat has remained vacant since December 2019. "Will of the people is supreme in a democracy and it cannot be lightly interfered with. The EC, under no circumstance, can frustrate the will of the people. This court, which is a custodian of the Constitution, cannot be a silent spectator in a case of this nature where the EC has failed to exercise its powers in a manner which has the effect of destroying or making erosion into the democratic setup, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution," the HC had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-to-consider-plea-by-samajwadi-party-mp-azam-khans-son-against-disqualification-on-november-6-908217.html
28-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi suspended||Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi was on Wednesday placed under suspension pending an inquiry against him over allegations of dereliction of duty and amid a row over key appointments in the varsity. President Ram Nath Kovind, who is the Visitor of the University, also approved a proposal of the Education Ministry to launch an inquiry into the allegations of dereliction of duties and lack of commitment and devotion to duty levelled against Tyagi. Tyagi, who has been on leave from the university since July, was involved in a row over appointments to the post of Registrar and Pro-vice Chancellor and certain other posts in the varsity. In a detailed order, the Education Ministry listed out instances delay in submission of the strategic vision plan for the varsity for selection as Institution of Eminence, backlog in vacancies in SC/ST category, delay in action over certain vigilance complaints and sexual harassment cases, absenting from official duties without informing the Executive Council as charges against Tyagi. “… the Vice Chancellor is not administering the university in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, Statutes, ordinance of University of Delhi, which has caused mis-governance and malfunctioning of University of Delhi. This is not conducive for appropriate academic as well as administrative environment of the University,” the Education Ministry order said. Last week, a controversy erupted after Tyagi appointed P C Jha as interim registrar even as the Executive Council of the university was in a meeting to decide on key appointments. The Education Ministry stepped in as the power tussle at the varsity took an ugly turn with Tyagi’s appointees and those of the Executive Council assumed charge as Registrar and Pro-Vice Chancellor of the university. The ministry had also issued orders to declare the appointments made by Tyagi earlier this month as null and void and appoint Pro-Vice Chancellor P C Joshi as the acting Vice Chancellor of the university.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-university-vice-chancellor-yogesh-tyagi-suspended-908247.html
28-10-2020||North and Central||Rajya Sabha polls: Six BSP MLAs rebel in UP, hint they may leave Mayawati's party||In a jolt to the BSP on Wednesday, four of the 10 MLAs who had proposed the name of the party’s lone candidate in next month’s Rajya Sabha polls withdrew support amid hints that they may switch sides. The four MLAs were reportedly accompanied by two others when they met the Returning Officer, submitting in writing that their signatures on senior party leader Ramji Gautam’s nomination papers were “forged”. One of the rebels admitted that she met Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, while some others in the group of six – a third of BSP’s total strength in the assembly -- expressed dissatisfaction over the way their own party treated them. They, however, did not specifically target Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati. Without taking names, a BSP leader indirectly laid the blame for the dramatic development on the SP, with which Mayawati’s party was in alliance during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The RO is yet to take a decision but if the forgery claim by four of Gautam’s 10 proposers is accepted, it could lead to his disqualification. The BSP had on Monday fielded Gautam, its national coordinator and Bihar in-charge for the November 9 biennial elections for the 10 Uttar Pradesh seats that are falling vacant in the Rajya Sabha. The BSP doesn’t have the numbers in the assembly to win an RS seat on its own but party leaders had indicated that it may get the support of other non-BJP parties in the state. The four MLAs who submitted an affidavit saying their signatures were forged are Aslam Raini, Aslam Chaudhary, Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hakim Lal Bind. Along with them, two others, Hargovind Bhargava and Sushma Patel, also met the Returning Officer, Raini told reporters. The scrutiny of nominations is being undertaken Wednesday, according to the election schedule. Raini and Mujtaba Siddiqui told reporters that they were unhappy with the “interference” of BSP coordinators. “There is no respect in the party for us. I complained about a personal problem recently to our leader Lalji Verma, but to no avail,” Allahabad MLA Siddiqui said, while making clear that he had no complaints against Mayawati. Mujtaba said he has been with the party for 25 years and is a three-term MLA. Shravasti MLA Aslam Raini said when he recently contracted coronavirus and posted a video clip from the hospital, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to his help and this was disliked by his own party men. “I was in hospital and the BSP coordinators were moving about in my constituency telling people not to meet their MLA,” he claimed. “It’s the same problem with all six of us. Behenji (Mayawati) is not to be blamed, but the coordinators have acted in a manner which has depressed us and we thought what is the use of remaining with such a party,” the MLA said. When asked about the future course of action, Raini said there is a general impression that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav gives respect to his party men. There were also reports that after meeting the Returning Officer, the BSP MLAs drove to the Samajwadi Party office to meet Yadav. Later, two of them told reporters that there was no such meeting. Sushma Patel, however, admitted having met the SP chief who she claimed had called them. But she refused to elaborate. Meanwhile, senior BSP leader and MLA Uma Shankar Singh indirectly blamed the SP for Wednesday’s developments. Singh claimed that nomination of industrialist Prakash Bajaj for the Rajya Sabha, filled just “two minutes” before the deadline Tuesday, was part of a “conspiracy”. Bajaj is contesting as an independent. “They are out to buy MLAs and felt why not get the nomination of the BSP candidate rejected,” Singh said. He said the rebels were with party workers till the morning and wondered what could have happened in a short while for them to change their minds. “They were with us all through the nomination process. We have sent the pictures of the nomination to the Returning Officer,” he said, asserting that the MLAs were present when the Gautam’s papers were filed. “If they had any objection, they should have given it to the RO by yesterday. Why now?” Singh questioned. “Everyone knows how this has happened. They cannot take such a big step without any allurement. They should tell how much they got,” Singh added, insinuating horse-trading of the MLAs. Altogether, 11 candidates, including eight from the BJP, have filed their papers for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh going to the polls in the biennial elections. Given the overwhelming strength of the BJP in the UP Assembly, all eight candidates including Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, fielded by the ruling party are expected to be elected. Of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant, three were earlier held by the BJP, four by the SP, two by the BSP and one by the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajya-sabha-polls-six-bsp-mlas-rebel-in-up-hint-they-may-leave-mayawatis-party-908248.html

The Bari Brahmana Industries Association (BBIA), Jammu, welcomed amendment in land laws of J&K for the setting up of industrial units by outsiders. "The members of the association thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha for bringing a ray of hope for Industrialisation in Jammu and Kashmir by the prospective entrepreneurs from outside," its President Lalit Mahajan said. Mahajan, who chaired a meeting of the association, said the new land laws would open doors for huge investment in the industrial sector, health and medical education, tourism Industry, real estate and other sectors which will provide job opportunities to the local youth in the private sector. Drawing the attention of the prime minister, home minister and lieutenant governor, Mahajan said, "It is the need of the hour to provide fiscal incentives to existing units, units under substantial expansion and new units for rapid industrialisation keeping in mind the factors like location disadvantage, shallow market due to hostile neighbours like China and Pakistan." The BBIA president demanded road freight reimbursement on bringing raw materials from outside J&K, and supply of finished goods to other parts of country. He also sought turnover incentives for micro and small units selling their goods within the UT of J&K, budgetary support of 2 per cent turnover on inter-state sale to all the units, state CGST and SGST reimbursement benefits to new units and units under expansion. "We request the lieutenant governor to notify the proposed new industrial policy 2020 with the inclusion of such incentives to attract new investment in the Industrial sector in near future," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-industrialists-welcome-new-land-laws-say-will-boost-industrial-growth-in-jk-908259.html

"A chief minister, who does not tire of flaunting the state government's policy of zero tolerance to corruption, has no right to continue in office for a minute after an order like this," state Congress chief Pritam Singh said at a joint press conference, held along with All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and former chief minister Harish Rawat and the newly-appointed party in-charge for Uttarakhand, Devendra Yadav. Singh said the party is waiting for an appointment with Governor Baby Rani Maurya to seek her intervention in the matter. Harish Rawat described the court's order as "serious" and asked the chief minister to quit in order to facilitate an impartial probe into the case.  "After the high court's order, the chief minister should quit immediately to pave the way for an impartial probe into the charges against him," he said. The Congress leader said that the party will take up the matter with the governor and continue to fight for justice in the case, using its democratic rights. Yadav, who is on his first visit to Uttarakhand after assuming the party's charge of the state, said the court order for a CBI probe into the allegations against the chief Minister shows the gap between what the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says and what it does. "It is shocking to see what the BJP government has come to in Uttarakhand after coming to power in 2017 promising clean governance," he said. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Indira Hridayesh and former state Congress chief Kishore Upadhyay were also present at the press conference.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cong-demands-uttarakhand-cms-resignation-after-hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-graft-charges-908264.html

Thirty other cows, who were also taken ill at the Mata Mansa Devi Gaudham, are responding to treatment, an official of Haryana's Animal Husbandry and Dairying Department told reporters in Panchkula. “We have collected water and feed samples and we can only arrive at any conclusion when we receive the test report... but prima facie, it looks like a case of food poisoning,” he said. The General Manager (honorary) of the cow shelter, Ravinder Chihgal, said that vets were called on Tuesday evening when he came to know that some cows had fallen ill. “The reports I have got is that the cows died due to food poisoning. But one thing which is clear that food poisoning was not due to the fodder we gave them. "We suspect that some devotee who visited the temple was carrying some foodstuff which he gave to the cows causing food poisoning,” Chihgal told PTI over the phone. Chihgal, who is currently out of the station, said the cows which died were from two particular sheds. “We have a total of seven sheds in which nearly 1,400 cows are kept. Fatalities have been reported only in two sheds. "Had there been food poisoning due to fodder, deaths would have been much higher,” he said. Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who is an MLA of the ruling BJP from Panchkula, visited the cow shelter and said he was deeply saddened by the incident. “We will get an inquiry done to find out if there were any lapses which led to this incident… and taking a lesson from this, we will ensure that such incidents do not happen in future. "Whatever precautions are needed, we will ensure they are taken in other gaushalas (cow shelter) also,” Gupta told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-70-cows-die-in-haryanas-panchkula-shelter-due-to-suspected-food-poisoning-908268.html

From bringing in the arbitrary ‘domicile law’ to opening up residency rights to J&K to non-permanent residents…., and now by brazenly repealing the land law has been done in order to ease the settling of outsiders here,” the statement alleged. Besides, it said, the new land laws which allow the government to declare any local area as a 'strategic area’ on the army’s request, is ‘alarming.’ While strongly opposing new land laws, the Hurriyat said, “People of J&K are not some dumb driven cattle who will yield to these imperial laws. People have proved by the strength of their unfailing will and their immense sacrifices, that they are not a dead but alive and determined nation who will not withstand such assaults upon them and their motherland.” The Hurriyat appealed local media to print their statement which they claimed reflects the sentiments of the people of J&K on these “grave assaults.” Before August 5 last year, most of the separatist organizations would issue statements almost daily in which they used to bash the government of India and its policies in Kashmir. The statements would get prominent space in local newspapers. However, post abrogation of Article 370 last August local media has almost not carried any news related to the separatists.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hurriyat-calls-for-shutdown-on-oct-31-against-new-land-laws-in-jk-908295.html

The JNU students union has been on an indefinite sit-in at the university's gate since October 17, demanding time extension to research scholars for submission and a provision to conduct the end-semester examination for graduate and post-graduate students who couldn't attend their last semester due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. The notice alleged that the "illegal occupation" of the space, the main road meant for vehicular and human movement, has been causing grave inconvenience to the residents, visitors and other commuters of the university. Ghosh said that the JNUSU will "continue its protest and intensify its struggle". She also slammed the JNU administration for serving the notice to JNUSU member Mohammed Danish who has been hospitalised after suffering from dengue. "The office of the Chief Proctor has taken cognizance of the illegal occupation of the road immediately inside the University North Gate as reported by the JNU Security Department on 17/10/2020... Md. Danish along with a group of students, have blocked the road, erected a tent, and drawn electric connection from the control room of JNU security to the tent," read the notice issued to Danish. The notice also alleged that the act is in clear violation of the Supreme Court judgement against the illegal occupation of public space and also flouts several clauses "governing the rules of the discipline and proper conduct of the schools of the University". The Supreme Court, in its recent order passed on a batch of petitions against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, has ruled that public places cannot be occupied indefinitely for protests, which must be carried out in designated areas alone. In a Facebook post, Ghosh said, "See the shameless attitude of the JNU Administration. Comrade Danish is suffering from Dengue, and due to deteriorating health, he has been admitted today to Safdargunj Hospital. "The JNU administration did not even bother to care about a student but sent security to the Hospital to serve notice to Comrade Danish while he is on hospital bed to withdraw the protest happening at North Gate!," The varsity recently announced the reopening of campus in a phased manner from November 2, for the scholars requiring laboratory access and project staff members.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/clear-blockade-immediately-jnu-administration-warns-students-908383.html

28-10-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality improves, relief may be short-lived||Pollution levels dipped in the national capital on Wednesday, primarily due to increased wind speed, but the relief could be short-lived. The city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 297, which falls in the "poor" category. Prior to this, the air quality remained "very poor" for five days on the trot. The 24-hour average AQI was 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said favourable wind speed helped in the dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday evening. However, the wind speed has reduced again which will allow pollutants to accumulate, he said. The air quality may slip into the 'very poor' category by Thursday, the scientist said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the farm fire count was 1,830 on Tuesday. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 18 per cent on Wednesday. It was 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday. SAFAR said the accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble is burnt will be major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels in the next two days. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 4 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.8 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city's ventilation index - a product of mixing depth and average wind speed - was around 4,000 meter square per second on Wednesday - unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. Earlier in the day, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that only "green" firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital. He also said the Delhi government will launch an anti-firecracker campaign from November 3 and requested people not to burn crackers at all considering the seriousness of the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) also granted an exemption to IT and processing industries and some residential complexes in Haryana from the ban on electricity generators. The pollution watchdog had earlier banned the use of electricity generators, barring for essential services such as hospitals and railways, in Delhi and the vicinity towns of Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon from October 15 as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-improves-relief-may-be-short-lived-908405.html
28-10-2020||Opinion||Trump no good for comedy but comedians flourish||Was Donald Trump good for comedy? Comic Lewis Black recently answered this persistent question with an understandable tone of exhaustion, saying the president is “good for comedy in the way a stroke is good for a nap.” Poking fun at Trump is both difficult (how do you parody someone who already seems like one?) and way too easy, since any joke about “the orange man in the White House” gets cheap laughs, if not an applause break. Too many stand-ups these days pander to their base. And yet, some comics have flourished during the Trump era, none more so than Sarah Cooper, a breakout star whose online videos reinvigorated the tradition of presidential impression. Responding to the latest events with the metabolism of cable news, she lip-syncs snippets of the president’s speeches or interviews from her apartment, in her own clothes, with no attempt to mimic his look. She doesn’t try to imitate him so much as capture a buffoonish essence, zeroing in on moments in which the juxtaposition between cluelessness and confidence was most stark. Her fans range from kids to grandparents, and her success has now led to a glossy Netflix production, “Everything’s Fine,” a celebrity-rich, intermittently funny sketch show that hangs on a narrative of apocalyptic doom. Cooper plays a chipper morning talk show host struggling to maintain her smile as the world around her unravels. It’s history that starts as comedy and ends as horror. Directed with slow-burn dread by Natasha Lyonne, this paranoid production has the feel of a comic update of “Network,” and there’s even a nod to that classic movie. But instead of enraged citizens yelling that they are mad as hell, Cooper plays a character whose anger is repressed and who just keeps taking it until she hides underneath her desk. “Everything’s Fine” is at times a conventional spoof of daytime television, poking fun at the mandatory cheer of cooking segments and cheesy transitions, as when Cooper introduces a segment with rapper Megan Thee Stallion by saying: “A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home.” Cooper has an actor’s gift for saying one thing while indicating another; she gets a lot out of a down-turned lip or a darting eye. And this special shows she can do much more than lip-sync; she has a promising future as an actor in television or movies. She’s currently developing a series for CBS. She is a perfect foil to the disasters around her, both inside the show (the Wi-Fi goes out, racist white guests ask for her identification) and in the outside world (a meteor is heading toward Earth). A production guy played by Fred Armisen keeps calm, but his constantly shifting costume, from masks to helmets to a beekeeper suit, tells another story. A staggering number of celebrity cameos (Winona Ryder, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, Connie Chung) surround the new star, whom everyone keeps calling “Sarah Cooper” as if she’s not yet on a first-name basis with anyone. The comic ideas vary wildly in quality and tone, with a few too many decent but undeveloped ideas, like Cooper struggling to do close-up magic at a drive-in. “Everything’s Fine” often feels like an episode of “Saturday Night Live,” but at its best, it coheres in stranger, more nightmarish territory. In the final 10 minutes, amid a darkening colour palette that evokes a Dario Argento scare sequence, she seems not just frightened by world events, but paralyzed, trapped. Many will relate. Like the recent “South Park” special and the new “Borat,” this show invents a backstory for the chaos of the pandemic, finding a comic conspiracy that escalates the stakes. But this broader story still has some connective tissue with Cooper’s more streamlined videos, and not just because she lip-syncs the president along with his wife and daughter. Seen from a certain angle, becoming famous for performing in the voice of Donald Trump is its own kind of trap. Cooper draws attention to this body-snatching aspect in one subplot in which she responds to producers in the control booth who say they were looking for a non-threatening Black anchor. “When my parents named me Sarah,” she says, “I feel like a white lady moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality.” There’s another short, amusing sketch that imagines a version of “Get Out” set at Mar-a-Lago that plays on similar themes. But Jordan Peele made a horror movie whose scares were goosed by comedy; Cooper’s show is a comedy that gets so dark that it can’t go anywhere but horror. Part of the success of her videos is because of their topicality, but this special isn’t riffing on the latest ridiculous speech so much as trying to create a fictional world. In the process, some of the small pleasures of Cooper’s videos have been lost: her ear for the absurdities of language, the comedy of subtext. Whereas her comedy once cut up her subject with a scalpel, now, on a bigger stage, it resorts to a battering ram. The comedy of the past four years has generally mirrored politics, becoming blunter, more polarized, fragmented. Compared to comics on social media and hosts on late-night television, the stand-ups on Netflix specials over the past four years have avoided Trump. The most acclaimed such show last year, Dave Chappelle’s “Sticks and Stones,” took aim not at the president but at his favourite targets: political correctness and cancel culture. Cooper actually seems to reflect the zeitgeist more than most of the specials on the streaming service. Even though its jokes are hit and miss, “Everything’s Fine,” the final Netflix comedy release before the election, nicely channels the cultural mood. You only need look at the bestseller list to see an endless appetite for material about Trump. Cooper takes advantage of that again, while also suggesting this steady diet is driving us insane.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/trump-no-good-for-comedy-but-comedians-flourish-908096.html
28-10-2020||Opinion||Understanding Indian ties with Horn of Africa countries||On October 24, the Indian Naval Ship (INS) Airavat left the port of Mumbai carrying much-needed food assistance for four countries (Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti, and Eritrea) located in the Horn of Africa. INS Airavat is carrying a total of 270 Metric Tonnes of food including 155 MT of wheat flour, 65 MT of rice and 50 MT of sugar. During the visit, INS Airavat will also make port calls at Djibouti, Massawa (in Eritrea), Port Sudan (in Sudan) and Mombasa (in Kenya). This is the second such humanitarian mission launched by the Indian Navy in 2020. Earlier this year, in April-May, at the peak of the crisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, Indian Navy had also deployed INS Kesari as part of the Covid-19 relief mission. Dubbed as ‘Mission Sagar’, it included providing 580 tonnes of food and medical supplies to the Indian Ocean island nations of the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles. Building on previous disaster relief efforts, launched to assist Mozambique (in 2019) and Madagascar (in 2020), both these latest missions underline India’s growing capability and willingness to undertake naval missions and support regional countries in the greater Indian Ocean region. They also demonstrate the growing role of Indian Navy as a key player in achieving broader foreign and strategic policy objectives. It is interesting to note that INS Airavat will not only provide food supplies to the drought-prone region of the Horn of Africa but also will engage in naval diplomacy through the port calls. It will further consolidate India’s outreach to the greater Western Indian Ocean region. Over the years, Indian Navy has been a proactive player in regional security efforts through participation in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia and the latest instance of assistance will only strengthen India’s role as a foremost responder to the crises in the Indian Ocean region. Growing strategic significance of the greater Horn of Africa In the last decade, the region lying between Suez Canal and the Seychelles has emerged as a new geopolitical hotspot with factors like impressive economic growth of regional countries, emergence of new security threats, and the ensuing major power rivalry driving the strategic trajectory of the region. The straits of Bab el-Mandeb, which lies at the heart of this region, connects the energy-rich Middle East to Europe and, along with the Suez Canal, is considered a jugular vein for global trade. Annually, goods worth about $ 700 billion, 25,000 ships and nearly two billion barrels of oil pass through the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The region has also witnessed growing interest of major global and regional players. US, China, France and Japan maintain a military base in Djibouti whereas the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Turkey are also acquiring military outposts in this part of the world. Rivalries between these Middle Eastern powers are being played out in the region with states like Sudan and Eritrea drawing practical benefits from this power play. The civil war in Yemen has provided additional leverage for these regional powers to further entrench their presence. Russia has also demonstrated interest in opening a base, like it had during the Cold War, in the Red Sea region (preferably in Sudan) whereas European powers like Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy have been deploying their military units in and around Djibouti for anti-piracy as well as counter-terror operations. Latest developments such as Sudan’s recognition of Israel and growing tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over the issue of sharing Nile waters has further contributed to the making of a fluid, and uncertain geopolitical environment. However, amidst this regional volatility, China’s steadily growing presence is a challenging development for India. The Chinese challenge Since 2008, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has been present in the region under the pretext of conducting anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia. In fact, it has even sent nuclear submarines to the region and has also conducted naval exercises with the navies of Russia and Iran. In 2017, China opened its first overseas military base in the region at Djibouti and is now firmly consolidating itself as a major player in regional affairs. China enjoys strong relationships with states like Sudan and South Sudan, built over the last two decades, due to its massive investments in their oil industry. It is likely to continue to be a major diplomatic and economic partner for Sudan despite the ongoing political transition in that country. Furthermore, China has built a spate of large infrastructure projects in the Horn of Africa, including the modern railway line connecting land-locked Ethiopia with the port of Djibouti and is emerging as a major economic partner for other Red Sea states like Egypt. In this context, India’s food as well as medical assistance to the states in this region is significant not only to avert disasters like droughts and floods but also acquires a sharp geopolitical angle. The steadily growing military and economic footprint of China makes this region increasingly more important from India’s geostrategic calculations. Lately, India has been paying greater attention to the region. Since 2017, India has opened embassies in Djibouti and Eritrea and Indian President Ramnath Kovind has also made a state visit to Djibouti and Ethiopia. India has bolstered defence cooperation with Oman and France (which holds territories in the Southwestern Indian Ocean) and has signed logistics support agreements with these countries to ensure greater naval access in the region. Reportedly, India was in talks with Japan to grant access to Indian naval vessels at the Japanese base in Djibouti. India has also sought to open a military base in the Seychelles and plans to further enhance its naval presence in the Western Indian Ocean. These efforts are directed to increase Indian leverage and limit Chinese influence in the region. Greater economic muscle and focused diplomatic outreach will go a long way in taking this regional engagement forward. Sending timely food aid to the Horn of Africa is a good beginning. India would do well to sustain this momentum. (Sankalp Gurjar is a Research Fellow with the Indian Council of World Affairs, New Delhi.

28-10-2020||Panorama||‘Impossible Trinity’ pushing RBI toward stronger Indian Rupee||One of the toughest challenges central bankers face is how to navigate the “Impossible Trinity” -- maintaining monetary policy independence while allowing a steady flow of foreign capital and keeping a stable currency. Also known as the “Trilemma,” it’s the bane of emerging markets from Argentina to Turkey. Cut interest rates too far and risk scaring off foreign capital, sending the currency tumbling. Raise borrowing costs too much to fight inflation and funds rush in, sending the currency higher and strangling exports. In India, with supply chain disruptions and food prices pushing inflation stubbornly above target, handling the trinity is looking tougher for the central bank and its leader, Shaktikanta Das, who tested positive over the weekend for Covid-19. The Reserve Bank of India has signalled that letting the rupee strengthen is the least bad option as the economy shifts from being a global growth hotspot to a coronavirus hotbed. The inflation spike prevented the RBI from cutting interest rates at its past two meetings, despite the economy forecast to shrink 10.3% in the year to March 2021 -- the biggest contraction among major emerging markets, according to the International Monetary Fund. With investors looking for riskier assets as the Federal Reserve expands its balance sheet, the RBI has let the rupee appreciate, adding a headwind for its struggling export sector. Rahul Bajoria, senior India economist at Barclays Plc in Mumbai, notes the RBI has eased its grip over the currency as it grapples with the trilemma, a concept based on the work of economists Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming. The rupee has risen 4% since slumping to a record 76.9088 per dollar in April, with most gains in July and August. “Within the trinity, we believe the RBI has clearly chosen to let the currency appreciate,” he said. “This would mean that in order to support economic revival, RBI may need to keep large amounts of liquidity, even if it raises latent inflation risks down the road. That also keeps alive the spectre of rapid reversal of policies in the future.” Balancing Act The RBI’s challenge differs from most peers as it’s also tasked with managing the government’s mammoth borrowing and overseeing the nation’s bad-debt-ridden banks. In order to keep bond sales successful, it’s snapping up debt in the secondary market and nudging banks to do the same. This month the Monetary Policy Committee retained its main repurchase rate at 4% and the RBI turned to non-interest rate tools such as bond purchases to keep yields under control. In a post-decision press briefing, Das told market participants they have a shared duty to control the yield curve. “Financial market stability and the orderly evolution of the yield curve are public goods and both market participants and the RBI have a shared responsibility in this regard,” Das said. Read: India’s Truce With Bond Traders Tested as Borrowing Jumps If the yield curve is to be “orderly,” the market needs assurances that inflation is under control, as the vast amounts of incoming foreign capital and generous doses of liquidity from the RBI risk spurring more price gains. At some point, the central bank must address these imbalances. “The only way RBI can manage the trilemma is by sterilizing its intervention in the spot foreign exchange market,” said Rajeswari Sengupta, assistant professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai. Sterilization refers to mopping up excess liquidity injected through swapping foreign inflows, usually via bond sales. But it isn’t so straightforward. The RBI’s bond purchases via open market operations to control yields is creating more liquidity with banks. That can be a problem as banks are already grappling with excess liquidity from RBI’s forex market intervention at a time when demand for credit is subdued. That excess cash can lead to double-digit inflation, similar to the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Or, in the absence of demand for new loans, it can force banks to funnel some of it into short-term sovereign debt, steepening the yield curve, which unfolded earlier this year. “This is problematic at a time when liquidity levels are already exceptionally high, inflation has crossed the upper limit of 6% for more than three quarters, core inflation remains high and sticky and inflation expectations remain elevated,” Sengupta said. Currency intervention The central bank, which has piled up record foreign exchange reserves, signalled it’s not averse to a firmer currency if it helps cool inflation. In a rare departure from its usual reticence to discuss the rupee, the central bank in late August pointed to how a stronger currency can lower inflation. But with domestic consumption that makes nearly 60% of India’s gross domestic product in the doldrums, a sharply higher rupee would make it harder for exports to power a recovery. That makes preventing a sharp and sustained currency appreciation crucial, said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at JPMorgan Chase Bank, in Mumbai. “The case becomes more compelling in the throes of the pandemic, when monetary policy was otherwise being eased,” Chinoy said. “Letting the rupee strengthen constitutes a defacto tightening of monetary conditions and militates against domestic rate cuts and liquidity injections.” Nevertheless, there are examples for India. Colombia ditched its exchange rate band regime in the late 1990s seeking to control double-digit inflation. Since then, the nation adopted an inflation-targeting approach with a floating exchange rate. The peso has been highly volatile over the past two decades, but authorities have managed low and stable inflation with a target of 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. “It is clear that from the impossible trinity Colombia has already released the exchange rate,” said Juan Pablo Zarate, deputy finance minister and former central bank board member. “That floating worked fine.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/impossible-trinity-pushing-rbi-toward-stronger-indian-rupee-908416.html
28-10-2020||Panorama||Skill development is backbone of Atmanirbharta||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan was launched to support the Indian economy in fighting against Covid-19. But, the structural reforms in society can only be witnessed when skill development becomes the backbone of this ambitious programme. Skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling of India’s youth, who is the workforce of the future, will play a crucial role in the success of the government’s vision. Though skilling is the most important, it doesn’t get the attention it deserves.  The current part of the flagship skill training scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 2016-2020) is about to conclude and has so far trained close to 73 lakh youth in the country and is hoping that it will open some new ventures for them. In the next phase of PMKVY, the government should shift its focus more to demand-driven skill development, digital technology and skills pertaining to Industry 4.0 so that the unemployment rate can be brought down.   India is the second-most populous country in the world with the highest rate of unemployment at the moment. According to a survey conducted by the NSSO, in India, there is a lack of training facilities in as many as 20 high-growth industries such as logistics, healthcare, construction, hospitality and automobiles. India has roughly close to 5,500 public (ITI) and private (ITC) institutes as against 500,000 similar institutes in China. As against India’s 4% formally trained vocational workers, a country like Korea has 96% of a vocationally trained workforce. Even relatively under-developed countries like Botswana had a surprisingly decent score of 22%. Re-skilling the youth  The current pandemic has presented a grave situation. It shows how unskilled the Indian workforce is. We aren’t prepared for the jobs of tomorrow. And, for the jobs of tomorrow, we need to upskill our workforce. Big industries need to expand their operations from big cities to small districts and villages and invest in upskilling and re-skilling the youth across rural India. This would be a giant leap towards the success of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. People working in the private sector should come forward and impart training and focus on being vocal for local products and services, empowering youth to drive local economic growth.  The government has already taken the first step through the National Education Policy and it will be implemented by 2022. Implementing this in itself is very challenging. However, it can bring many changes in the current education system. The effect of this policy can actually be reaped decades from now. Meanwhile, the government needs to go ahead with the PPP model by investing in rudimentary, primary and advanced level of skill development training and by mapping industry needs. The government should also work on skill management information system, which will bring the entire skill ecosystem under a common web portal and work as an aggregator for demand and supply of skilled workforce Identifying skill is pivotal  Lots of ground needs to be covered in educating people in using different software and coding language. Education should simplify apprenticeship, which is the on-the-job model of skill training, so that industries do not hesitate in absorbing apprentices and they do so enthusiastically. The person needs to identify an area of interest and seek guidance in areas that he or she might need improvement. A person might be inclined towards computer programming. He or she should seek programmes that will help him to achieve these dreams. If a person is interested in entrepreneurship, there are many schools available. Companies need to specify their preferences to students who are skilled over people who aren’t and identify skills needed to excel.

28-10-2020||Right in the Middle||How dare you insult our Idli?||"Idlis are the most boring things in the world," Edward Anderson, history lecturer in Northumbria University in Newcastle tweeted on Oct 6, without knowing how hygienic and tasty it is when steaming hot and made with well-fermented batter, paired with coconut chutney, sambar and the famous 'mulaga podi' (spicy powder, called gunpowder by the ignorant). He had to eat a humble pie, when the very next day, he tweeted, " having...enraged the entirety of South India and its omnipresent diaspora, it was right to order idlis for lunch" with a photograph of him holding a bitten idli and a plate of chutney and sambar Idli can be eaten for breakfast, dinner or in its mini avatar, at cocktails. Food writer Vir Sanghvi calls it the best known South Indian dish in India and perhaps, the world. I am sure, Kamala Harris, the US VP-nominee and Indira Nooyi in the US are fond of it. There are 185 varieties of idli as shown by Tarla Dalal in her book, to name a few: plain idli; rava idli (as a wag says: idli that is dressed for a fancy dress); coin idli or cocktail idli; thatte idli, a version from Karnataka (almost the size of a dosa but much fatter); paneer-vegetable idli and so on. Have you ever wondered how idli, a daily staple came to be in its current avatar? There's a lot of history---cultural, political, economic--behind its creation.  Modifying a Twitterati's words, "Idli has an interesting origin. As alcohol was taboo from wasted Dosa batter some cooks thought fermented rice batter could give them a high, like the Japanese 'sake, which is a fermented rice-based wine'. The experiment failed. To salvage it, one of them made steamed dumplings from it." There are other quotes such as, "Idli is nothing but the batter, post a steam bath" Anand Mahindra recently tweeted about an 80-year-old lady near Coimbatore, who still sold idli at Rs one. He doesn't know that in our childhood, idli was sold for 3/4 anna or 5 nP everywhere. One old-widowed lady in my home town, Trichy, used to sell it for 1/4 anna with a tasty chutney and no sambhar. In Salem, BJP workers serve cheap idli named 'Modi Idli' to the poor, as a rival to, the ruling AIADMK's amma idli, after their late leader Jayalalithaa. If someone says their 'hard work' of idly making wasn't appreciated, they usually mean their idlis turned out very hard!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/how-dare-you-insult-our-idli-908414.html
28-10-2020||Second Edit||Covid-19 reinfection: Heed ICMR’s warning||The warning issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the possibility of reinfection for those who have recovered from Covid-19 should be taken seriously by individuals and families. The ICMR has said that those who were infected and have recovered from the virus attack may contract it again if the antibodies created by the body in the fight against the virus start depleting and weakening. There is a possibility of this because these antibodies do not give permanent immunity as in the case of some other virus infections. Since the nature and behaviour of the coronavirus is still largely unknown, there is no clear understanding of the problem of reinfection. There are different views on what should be called a reinfection and how long it should take for a second coming of the infection to be called a reinfection. There is also the problem of distinguishing between the viral debris left over from the first infection and a new infection. The RT-PCR tests cannot do that. The ICMR has said it will regard a second coming of the virus in an individual as a case of reinfection if it happens after 90 days from the first infection. Some experts think that is arbitrary and that cases of reinfection may be missed out because of the fixed criterion. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not spelt out the criterion so clearly. There are differences in individuals with respect to the emergence of anti-bodies and their presence in the body. There are cases of reinfection that happened within a wide range of 19 to 100 days of recovery. If the ICMR criterion is adopted, only three cases have been reported from India and 24 cases globally. Even so, it must be noted that an ever larger number of people who have recovered from Covid-19 cross the 90-day period every day, and must be seen as susceptible to reinfection. That is why the ICMR has said that there should be no complacency and those who have recovered from the disease should continue to take precautionary measures like wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining social distance. They should not think that they are safe after recovery. Some experts have held that the immunity acquired from fighting the virus might lessen the gravity of the disease in case there is reinfection. But there is also the view that reinfection might pose a greater danger to many who suffer post-Covid-19 complications. Questions about reinfection become more important in areas which experience a resurgence or a second wave of the pandemic. The ICMR’s warning should therefore be heeded even though there are not many cases of reinfection currently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/covid-19-reinfection-heed-icmr-s-warning-908408.html
28-10-2020||South||Gold-smuggling case: Anticipatory bail plea of Kerala CM's former secretary Sivasankar rejected||Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar's anticipatory bail plea in connection with the gold smuggling case with Customs and Enforcement Directorate was rejected by Kerala High Court on Wednesday. Soon after the HC denied anticipatory bail to the former secretary, ED officials reached a private ayurveda hospital in Thiruvananthapuram where Sivasankar was under treatment and took him. It was learnt that ED served a summons to him and took him to its Kochi office for recording his arrest. The fresh developments come as a major embarrassment to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan as Sivasankar had been serving as his secretary over the last four years and was involved in key decision making processes. He was suspended from service in July after the allegations against him surfaced. Opposition parties are stepping up attack against the government in view of the actions by investigation agencies against Sivasankar. ED and Customs had strongly objected Sivasankar's anticipatory bail plea. The central agencies maintained that Sivasankar had even misused his official position to help the gold smuggling accused, especially former employee of UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, Swapna Suresh. Sources said that though Sivasankar's direct involvement in gold smuggling was yet to be unearthed, there was strong evidence for Sivasankar helping Swapna hide the illegally earned money in bank lockers. He was also alleged to have pressurised a private bank to exchange about Rs 1.4 crore to US dollars for Swapna. Though the Customs made steps to arrest him earlier this month, he complained of discomfort on the way and was hence hospitalised.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gold-smuggling-case-anticipatory-bail-plea-of-kerala-cms-former-secretary-sivasankar-rejected-908128.html
28-10-2020||South||Kerala farmers take MSP for vegetables and fruits with a pinch of salt||Even as Kerala government announced a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 16 vegetables and fruits, the much-hyped decision has been taken only with a pinch of salt by farmers. Delay in getting payments, red-tapism and issues over pricing involved are the general concerns of the farmers. Agriculture department officials are also concerned over the practical issues involved in the mass procurement of perishable items. The state government maintained that the MSPs, which will come into effect from Nov 1, fixed by adding 20 per cent margin to the minimum production cost of each commodity. Procurement will be mainly through government agencies Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam. The farmers will have to register in the state's agriculture information management system (aims.kerala.gov.in) and should also avail crop insurance. While Vasudevan, a banana farmer at Wayanad district, told DH that the MSP fixed for banana (Rs 30 per kg for banana and Rs 24 for Wayanad banana) were reasonable, on the other hand, Pineapple Growers Association of Keralam president Baby John said that the price of Rs 15 fixed for pineapple was not at all reasonable as the government itself earlier estimated that the cost of production of banana was Rs 15.70 per kilogram. Vasudevan's major concern was with regard to the approach of government agencies. "Earlier the government announced procurement of vegetables through Horticorp. Once the Horticorp procured from us. Later they did not respond to our repeated pleas to procure," he said. Jayaprakash, a vegetable farmer of Idukki district's Vattavada, which is known for vegetable cultivation, said that even as government agencies offered a better price that the private middlemen, the delay in getting payments from government agencies was prompting most of the farmers of the locality to give their produce to middlemen who make immediate payment. He also said that most of the farmers were not availing the crop insurance schemes mainly due to the cumbersome procedures involved in getting compensations, especially in case of events like loss due to animal attack. Spending time at government offices cause mandis loss to farmers, he said. A major concern of agriculture department officials is that if the farmers enhance their production to avail the MSP benefit, the procurement agencies would be facing a major infrastructure crisis. As per the MSP scheme, a farmer can avail the benefit only for cultivation of 15 acres in a season. But no limit on the quantum of produce is prescribed. Another issue being anticipated is the inflow of commodities at low rates from neighbouring states in case of any over-production. In such a scenario, procurement agencies would face a major crisis in selling the commodities procured. Baby said that instead of initiating measures like MSP, which sounds like an election stunt, the government should have focused on promoting vegetables and fruits processing and value addition projects so that the farmers would obviously get a decent price. "Generally governments are more pro-consumers than pro-farmers and hence government would only prefer keeping price of commodities low than addressing the concerns of farmers," he lamented. MSP announced by Kerala Government (Rs. per kg) Tapioca 12; Banana 30 / Wayanad Banana 24, Pineapple 15; Ash gourd 9, Cucumber 8, Bitter gourd 30, Snake gourd 16, string beans 34, Tomato 8, Ladies finger 20, Cabbage 11, Carrot 21, Potato 20, Beans 28, Beetroot 21, Garlic 139.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-farmers-take-msp-for-vegetables-and-fruits-with-a-pinch-of-salt-908224.html
28-10-2020||South||Tamil Nadu CM launches scheme to provide stipend to young advocates||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami on Wednesday launched a scheme to provide monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 to young advocates in the state. He announced the initiative in July this year with a view to helping junior lawyers from poor background, as it would take about four years for them to start practising after completing various formalities, including enrolling in the Bar Council, an official release here said. Eligible advocates will get the sum for a two year period. The chief minister handed over the stipend orders to nine advocates at the Secretariat here to mark the rollout of the scheme, it added. Palaniswami had in July announced that the monthly stipend will be paid to newly enrolled junior lawyers for two years to help them overcome financial difficulties in pursuit of their profession. Many young advocates could not realise their ambition due to lack of income during their initial years of practice and many of them, mostly with rural or poor background, find it difficult to sustain and as a result change profession, he had then said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-cm-launches-scheme-to-provide-stipend-to-young-advocates-908252.html

The pandemic, however, was under control in the state due to a multi-pronged approach of the government, he said, reviewing the COVID-19 situation at a meeting with bureaucrats and district collectors. "In Tamil Nadu, over 35 per cent of the people don't wear mask. Therefore the (respective) district administration should take steps to ensure compliance by all," he said. Lack of awareness prompted people to throw caution to wind, he said Ahead of the Deepavali season, many people here did not comply with the mask rule, he said, urging the authorities, especially the police, to step in and create awareness. Spraying disinfectants in regular intervals in affected areas was among the key to prevent the spread of the contagion, he added. Detailing his government's efforts in handling the pandemic, he said so far Rs 7,372.25 crore had been spent on prevention, treatment and relief activities Holding fever camps in all districts, conducting door-to-door checks for symptomatic persons, doing RT-PCR tests and isolating the infected people and treating them had resulted in a dip in fresh and active cases, he added. As many as 6,75,518 people have been cured of the disease and the recovery rate was 94.57 per cent while the fatality rate was 1.53 per cent. "Due to the exemplary work of our doctors, positivity rate has been brought to 7.39 per cent," Palaniswami added. The daily infections have been less than 5,000 for the past 17 days and dipped below 3,000 in the past four days. Active cases were less than 30,000, he added. Tamil Nadu's total coronavirus cases, as of Tuesday, stood at 7,14,235 with 10,983 deaths while the active cases were 27,734. Even during this pandemic, the government signed 55 new investment proposals for Tamil Nadu worth Rs 40,718 crore which will create over 74,000 jobs, Palaniswami said. Without naming anyone, he hit out at the opposition for its criticism of the government's handling of the pandemic and said due to its various efforts, there was a "situation of return to normalcy".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/over-one-third-people-in-tamil-nadu-dont-wear-masks-says-cm-908285.html

It is not just a birthday celebration for the forest officials, but the celebration of their efforts in helping the elephant survive. The elephant was hardly one month old when it was spotted in a weak condition at an estate close to the forest areas of Thenmala in Kollam district in November last year. It was suspected to be washed away from its parents in the forest owing to the heavy flow of water in the river. There were several wounds and bruises all over its body and serious injuries on legs. Since the chances of survival of the elephant outside the forest and away from its parents seemed to be remote, the forest authorities kept it where they found her for a couple of days with hopes of its parents coming in search and taking her back to the forest. With parents nowhere in sight even after a few days, Sreekutty was brought to the Elephant Rehabilitation Centre at Kotoor, about 30 kilometres from Thiruvananthapuram city. Deputy Warden Satishan M V said that chances of survival of the elephant were only around 40 per cent, especially since it was away from parents and was weak. Hence the day on which the elephant reached the rehabilitation centre is being celebrated as its birthday. A cake made of rice and ragi, which is the usual diet of an elephant, would be made and all the 15 odd elephants at the rehabilitation centre from three and a half-year-old Kannan to 78-year-old Soman will be paraded. Deputy range officer Renjith Kumar V S said that a special forest like enclave was set up for Sreekutty and it was initially fed with glucose and lactogen under the care of veterinary doctors of the forest department. Later it was given B-Protein and ragi and now it is in normal condition.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/female-elephant-sreekutty-to-cut-cake-celebrate-first-birthday-in-kerala-908293.html

Besides handling a Covid-19 patient, the doctors also encountered complications during the caesarean surgery as the woman started bleeding. A few months back, the childless woman consulted doctors who got her pregnant through artificial insemination and IVF method. Later, she contracted coronavirus and was admitted to the Perundurai IRT Government Medical College hospital here. On October 25, the woman went into labour and a team of doctors conducted the C-section. She was delivered of twins and both the mother and babies are in good condition, and healthy, hospital authorities said. The woman was affected with various gynaecological problems for 15 years and a surgery was performed for removal of fibroid from her uterus, they said.

Kumar had mixed sleeping tablets in their dinner. And then dragged the deep asleep men, women and a toddler, one by one, to a well in the industrial unit compound they were working, residing and threw them in the water. The ghastly act was to cover his earlier crime of killing a woman of the family he was in a relationship with. The revelation of nine bodies in the huge, dilapidated well in the gunny bag company's premises at Gorrekunta village near Warangal town had shocked the Telangana public. The deaths of migrants during the Covid-19 lockdown and the workers’ travel travails nationwide led to initial beliefs that it might be a case of suicides driven by economic distress. Six of the dead are of Md Maqsood family, who settled in Telangana over two decades back, migrating from West Bengal. The deceased are Maqsood (50), his wife Nisha (45), two sons – Shabaz (21), Sohail (18), daughter Bushra (22) and her three-year-old son. Two others – Sriram (21) and Shyam (22) – are from Bihar, also working and living in the same compound, while Shakeel (30) said to be a family friend of Maqsood, lives nearby. Several special teams were constituted and the case was cracked within three days, with the help of call records and CCTV footage. The charge sheet was filed within a month of the chilling murders. On Wednesday, the death sentence was awarded by a district court in Warangal. Police teams involved in the probe and trial of the case celebrated the outcome by sharing sweets. The details of the murders, as revealed by the police in May, are that “Sanjay was living together with Rafiqa (36), who is the daughter of Nisha’s elder sister.” “Rafiqa, promised by Sanjay to marry her, confronted him when she noticed him being close with her teenage daughter. As she even warned him to file a police complaint, Sanjay decided to eliminate her. On pretext of talking to their elders back home regarding their wedding, Sanjay took her in the Garib Rath train towards Vizag on March 6.” “Sanjay mixed sleeping tablets in buttermilk Rafiqa consumed and when she was unconscious pushed her out of the running train near Nidavadolu in Andhra Pradesh, killing her and returned to Warrangal. A case was registered by the railway police then.” “Later, Nisha enquired about Rafiqa and suspecting of some wrongdoing by Sanjay threatened to file a police complaint. That is when Sanjay decided to kill the Maqsood family. He went on recce at the unit for five days and chose the birthday of Maqsood’s son Shabaz on May 20 to execute his plan. He mixed sleeping tablets in their dinner. And when they were deep asleep, from 12:30 AM to 5 AM, he dragged each of them on a gunny bag to the well and threw them in the water,” police officials said. “Fearing that the Bihari youth might reveal his deed, Sanjay also killed them.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/warangal-well-horror-accused-migrant-worker-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-nine-908330.html

The RGIA operated by the GMR Group went live for its domestic e-boarding facility in December 2015. "The GMR Group led Hyderabad airport has the credit to be the first and only airport in India to offer truly end-to-end paperless e-boarding to all its domestic passengers across all flights. Extending this facility, the airport has now started rolling out the indigenously developed digital solution to international flights, becoming the first airport in India to do so. This marks a significant milestone in the history of Indian aviation," GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited said in a press statement. IndiGo Airlines was the first carrier to commence the facility when their Sharjah-bound passengers e-boarded themselves from Hyderabad on October 2. Other scheduled international carriers operating out of Hyderabad are in the process of integration with the airport’s e-boarding system, GHIAL said. “In the present pandemic scenario, automating the passenger journey provides more pleasant airport experience,” Pradeep Panicker, CEO, GHIAL, said Panicker said that they have launched the e-boarding solution for international operations, “after about five years of successfully operating e-boarding for domestic flights.” "Passengers can choose between conventional paper boarding or electronic boarding passes on their mobile phones to use the system. Benefits of e-boarding include reduced queue waiting time, removal of redundancies at checkpoints. It also helps airlines optimize their resource utilization, and the airport to continuously enhance operational efficiency, overall safety and security," GHIAL said. Passengers boarding an international flight using e-boarding service have to book the ticket online and web check-in. At the airport: Departures Entrance Gate: Display the digital/printed boarding card at the e-boarding scanner; CISF validates the documents and allows passenger entry Check in Counter: Check in agent scans the boarding card/s; Passenger drops luggage at the counter Immigration: Passenger completes passport verification by officials of Bureau of Immigration Security Screening Zone: Puts hand baggage on Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS), moves for security check. Scans the boarding card on an e-boarding scanner and moves on. Boarding Gate: At the announcement of boarding, scans the boarding card on e-boarding scanner and moves towards the gates for boarding the aircraft.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-airport-first-in-india-to-offer-e-boarding-for-domestic-and-international-flights-908338.html

An order issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on October 15 says Subbiah Shanmugam, Professor and HOD, Department of Surgical Oncology, Kilpauk Medical College and Government Royapettah Hospital in Chennai, is a member of AIIMS, Madurai. The 17-member Board is headed by Dr V M Katoch, President of JIPMER, Puducherry and members include Dr Sudha Seshayyan, Vice-Chancellor of Dr MGR Medical University, officials from the Ministry, and doctors from AIIMS and other premier government institutes. Three members are yet to be appointed, but the notification says the slots are reserved for members of Parliament. Subbiah's appointment led to a major row with MPs from DMK, Congress, and Left parties condemning the move citing the harassment case against the ABVP President. In July, a 62-year-old woman had filed a complaint against Subbiah Shanmugam for harassing her following an argument over a parking slot. DMK President M K Stalin demanded the revoking of Subbiah Shanmugam's appointment and asked Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to ensure that MPs from the state get into the Board. “Is this an endorsement of his indecent behaviour and also an incentive for other BJP cadres to follow suit?” DMK MP Kanimozhi asked. “I am shocked the appointment of Dr Subbiah Shanmugam, who stands accused of harassing his elderly woman neighbour, as a Board member of AIIMS,” she added. Virudhunagar Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore, in whose constituency the AIIMS will come up, sought to know whether Subbiah Shanmugam is being “rewarded” because of his affiliation to RSS or for “insulting women.” “Is this the way of running a government according to Manu Shastra?” he asked and demanded that Subbiah Shanmugam's appointment to the AIIMS board be revoked. Madurai MP and writer Su. Venkatesan also questioned the Union Government's move. A case under Sections 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 427 (mischief causing damage) under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Tamil Nadu Women Harassment Prevention Act was filed against Subbiah Shanmugam. But the case was dropped after the woman withdrew her complaint. CCTV footage showed Subbiah Shanmugam urinating in front of the woman's apartment. She had also alleged that the ABVP functionary had harassed her by throwing “pieces of chicken” outside her apartment despite knowing she is a vegetarian.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/abvp-president-accused-of-harassing-woman-gets-aiims-madurai-directorship-908350.html

On Tuesday, when the US goes to polls, people from Harris' maternal grandfather's native village will seek divine intervention for her "grand victory". Painganadu, a nondescript village 350 km from here in Tiruvarur district in the fertile Cauvery Delta region, takes pride in calling Harris as their own as her grandfather P V Gopalan was born and raised in the hamlet. Special pooja and abhishekam will be conducted at 11 am on Tuesday at the Dharmasastha Temple, for whose consecration the Gopalan family had donated money in the past, in the village near Mannargudi. Cut-outs and hoardings adorn the village already wishing a "grand success" for Harris, US Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden's running mate.  "We have arranged for an abhishekam and a special pooja at the temple on Tuesday to pray for Kamala Harris' success in the US elections. Since her ancestors hailed from our village, we wanted to do our bit by praying for her victory. Already her family is a pride of the village," Kalidass Vandaiyar, President of the Thanjavur District Cricket Association, told Deccan Herald. Divine interventions have helped Harris in the past. When Harris contested the California Attorney General Democratic primary election in 2010, her aunt, Dr Sarala Gopalan, an obstetrician and gynecologist by profession, broke 108 coconuts at a temple in Chennai. Vandaiyar, who also hails from Painganadu village, said his grandfather had enjoyed "good relations" with Gopalan, who worked as a bureaucrat under the British regime and later in independent India. "My grandfather knew Gopalan and his family very well. The special pooja is just a goodwill gesture from our side. After all, Harris herself said it was her grandfather who had inspired her. Harris's victory will make all of us proud," he added. Ramani of the village told DH that though the Gopalan family moved out of the village decades back, his children had been donating money for the temple's development. "Gopalan's family pitched in to help develop the temple and conduct its consecration by donating money. Mr Gopalan's name still finds mention in the list of donors," said Ramani. Gopalan's daughter Dr Shyamala Gopalan married a Jamaican Donald Harris and the couple had two daughters Kamala Harris and Maya Harris, a lawyer by profession. Harris and her sister had accompanied Dr Shyamala to Chennai often to meet their grandparents at their home in upscale Besant Nagar. Gopalan had taken them for a walk on Elliot’s Beach in Besant Nagar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-special-pooja-for-kamala-harriss-victory-in-her-ancestors-village-908354.html

Beckoning tourists, the department had published about the commencement of safari activities in the Nugu range in HD Kote of Mysuru District a few days ago by listing out the timings and fees for Safari activities. The BTR officials had submitted a proposal to the Forest department a few months ago about launching a safari in the Nugu range. However, with just three days left for the launch of tourism activities, which drew flak from conservationists and officials, the Forest department decided to put the plan on hold in the last minute. Confirming the decision T Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, told DH that the plan had been put on hold. “The department wanted certain clarification and there was confusion whether we need NTCA approval or not. They had even sought a copy of the approved management plan for allowing tourism activities in the range. We have sent all the details and for the time being, the proposal has been put on hold,” he said. A former PCCF (Wildlife) of Forest department said, “Nugu range is part of the notified buffer zone and eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of BTR since 2010 and 2012. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had also submitted the same to the Supreme Court which had ordered a blanket ban on tiger tourism across the country. How can the department turn a blind eye to these developments?” Yet another officer of Indian Forest Service, who had previously served at Bandipur, said “Opening one more area for tourism in Bandipur goes against a decision by the district minister who’s against scaling up tourism around Bandipur. Also, this would only pave way for more tourism activities that are prohibited in ESZ area.” However, defending the decision, a forest official said, “As per the Supreme Court order, tourism activities are limited to 10% of the Tiger Reserve area. Going by the directions, at Bandipur, we can operate safari in 102 sqkm area. But currently, we are operating only in 80 sqkm area and there is scope to scale this up in another 20 sqkm area.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/forest-dept-puts-on-hold-safari-plan-at-nugu-sanctuary-908014.html

According to the Karnataka Common Entrance Test (K-CET) draft seat matrix, several colleges have already fixed the number of seats for BE in AI and ML for about 40-60 seats for the first-year undergraduate program. This comes after VTU’s expert committee had in 2019 said that since AI and ML was applicable to all the streams, students should have an understanding about the said subjects. Nithin Mohan, CEO, Cambridge Group of Institutions, told DH, “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are not an option in today’s world but a necessity. To go back, 2016 marks an important milestone in the age of technology. Oil companies ruled the global market until then. But since 2016, tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon among others entered into the elite group of wealthiest companies in the world. One of the reasons is that all these tech companies not only used AI and ML as a fuel to the technology.”  “Intercultural engagement between technology, business and human engineering is a reality nowadays. Data is required for every organisation to take right decisions. With the advent of IoT, AI and other technology-enabled processes, organisations have access to huge data in the present environment. As much as 90% of the data on the internet has been created since 2016, according to an IBM Marketing Cloud study,” added Mohan. Until now, a lot of supplementary and complementary programmes in AI and ML were available for students. However, to drive the innovation through research and live projects, an in-depth programme and focused dedication is required which is not possible without a four-year BE/BTech in AI and ML, say experts. Mohan said, “At Cambridge Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, we are starting our exciting journey in the field AI and ML from the academic year 2020-21, with a sanctioned student strength of 60. CiTech has active faculty with specialisation in machine learning and deep learning. In addition, we have senior industry experts and AI/ML scientists from across the globe who are guiding our students and faculties for innovation and research relevant for the world today.” Professor Nataraj A G, principal of AMC Engineering College said, “AI has emerged as an innovative approach for many technology-based solutions.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/new-age-courses-ai-and-ml-in-the-offing-at-bengaluru-colleges-908015.html

The IBPS has issued a notification, announcing the next common recruitment exam for selection for probationary officer/management trainee posts. However, the notification has fixed only English and Hindi as medium of exam. The demand for making Kannada medium available has gained prominence in recent months, with many pointing out that the exam needs to be held in all official languages as per the Constitution. The tentative list of candidates qualifying in the preliminary exam will be out soon. The final exam is set to be held on November 28, following which candidates who make the cut will be selected by the participating banks through interview in January. However, qualified candidates who hoped to crack the exam in Kannada have been disappointed. Last year, after protests by language rights organisations, the government had conducted the exam for rural banks in 13 languages. In the days that followed, the organisations had stressed the need to conduct exam for other banks in regional languages, a demand that was echoed by MPs during the Parliament session. "Those who know Hindi will ace through the exam, while well-qualified candidates suffer because they can't write the exam in regional language," Arun Javagal of Banavasi Balaga said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ibps-exam-only-in-hindi-english-kannada-activists-cry-foul-908018.html

While it could determine the tariff for inpatient stay such as for treatment in a general ward, high dependency units, ICU etc, it must now decide the rates for outpatient procedures, mostly individual diagnostic tests, to regulate post-Covid care in private hospitals.  Until now, only one government hospital is offering post-Covid care: Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD).  Forty-year-old Vasudev Kolar has visited the post-Covid recovery clinic at MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital twice. “I spent Rs 11,000 on blood test, urine test and consultations. I had no symptoms during my recovery from Covid but came to the clinic to make sure all my parameters are fine. The doctors provided mental support in moving ahead,” Kolar said.  Sixty-Four-year-old Dr Ravindra Subbanna, a physiotherapist, also said he spent Rs 10,000 on his post-Covid treatment. He suffered post-Covid symptoms such as fatigue and breathlessness three months after recovery from Covid. “I was in the hospital only for three days from July 22 to July 24. I was later quarantined at home. I came to the clinic because I feel tired and experience breathlessness. I spent around Rs. 29,000 on Covid treatment and Rs. 10,000 on post-Covid care,” he said.  Dr Tharanath S, physician at the post-Covid care clinic at MS Ramaiah hospital, said: “While Covid treatment cost is being regulated by the government, post-Covid treatment is not. This is something experts have to suggest to the government. Persistent cough and headache would require only symptomatic treatment and perhaps an X-ray or a CT scan while treating serious symptoms like pulmonary thrombosis or fibrosis would cost Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000.” Dr Naresh Shetty, President of MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, said post-Covid care treatment at a minimum should cost Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 7,000.  Davison P K, Chief Executive Officer, Apollo Hospitals Group, Karnataka Region, said: “All post-Covid patients don’t need the same level care. But I’m sure treatment at Apollo clinics will be affordable.” The hospital group opened clinics at Jayanagar, Seshadripuram and Bannerghatta Road branches recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/doctors-urge-karnataka-government-to-fix-rates-for-post-covid-19-care-908019.html

However, he hasn’t yet walked free as his bail petition in the main case is pending before a special CBI court.  In the money-laundering case, the High Court of Karnataka recently gave him conditional bail considering his “heart ailment and unstable angina coronary artery disease with 100% blockage”. The trial court had refused him bail in the case on August 18, 2020.  Khan was the managing director of I Monetary Advisory (IMA), a so-called ‘Halal’ investment company that went bust in June 2019 after duping thousands of investors, mostly Muslims. IMA is alleged to have collected Rs 4,000 crore from investors by promising them lucrative returns through bullion trading.  Khan had fled to Dubai after the scam surfaced but returned to India on July 19, 2019. He was questioned in police custody for about two weeks and has been in prison since August 1, 2019.  The case was probed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) before the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over. The ED is probing a case pertaining to money laundering.  In the high court, Khan’s counsel stated that police investigation has been completed and sought bail for him, saying he’s been diagnosed with unstable angina coronary artery disease with 100% blockage and spine degenerative spondylosis. The counsel also submitted a letter written by the chief medical officer of the Bengaluru Central Prison to the chief superintendent of the prison in thisregard.  Madhukar Deshpande, the special prosecutor for the ED, said that though Khan had returned Rs 1,323 crore out of the Rs 4,000 crore that the company collected from investors, he had purchased properties worth about Rs 209 crore from that money. The prosecutor said Khan was likely to alienate the properties, affecting the interests of the investors. In legal parlance, alienation means to transfer the ownership of a property or title to another person.  Approving the bail petition, Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar noted that though the chief medical officer had stated that Khan’s health was “stable”, it does not mean that he can continue to manage the ailments inside the prison. “Certainly the ailments that he has require constant monitoring; the treatment that he may take outside the jail may be of (a) different standard. It is pertinent to note that the chief medical officer has clearly made an observation about the chronic disease conditions of the petitioner. Therefore, certainly, this aspect can be considered for granting bail.”  The court directed Khan to furnish a Rs 5 lakh bond and sureties of the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial court. The high court directed Khan not to alienate any of his properties until the conclusion of the trial. In case there is a need to do so, he must disclose to the trial court the purpose of alienating the property and obtain the permission of the trial court. The court said the trial court may impose conditions if it decides to permitalienation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ima-chief-gets-bail-in-money-laundering-case-but-wont-walk-free-as-yet-908368.html

Initially, there was a poor turnout with an average polling percentage of 8.5 till 10 am. However, it picked up later in the afternoon. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Election Commission had directed the returning officers to ensure that face masks and social distancing should be maintained by the staff as well as the voters. The direction was strictly followed, an officer said. According to the data shared by the CEO, the polling percentage in the North East Teachers (Kalaburagi) was 73.32, Bangalore Teachers (Bangalore) -- 66 per cent, South East Graduate(Bangalore) -- 75 per cent and West Graduate (Belgaum) --70.11 per cent. The MLC polls are taking place following the retirement of R Chowda Reddy Thoopalli, S V Sankanur, Sharanappa Mattur and Puttanna respectively. This election is crucial for the BJP as it lacks a majority in the upper house to pass the crucial bills. The BJP government could not pass the farm bills and labour reforms amendment bills in the recently held legislature session as it could not get through the upper house despite getting them passed in the assembly. In the council with a strength of 75 members, Congress has 28 members, BJP -- 27 members, Janata Dal (Secular) -- 14 members, one independent, one chairman and four vacant seats. According to the CEO, polling began at 8 am and concluded at 5 pm. The counting of votes will be held on November 2. Forty candidates are trying their luck in the elections. Among them are the four whose retirement on June 30 warranted the elections. The four constituencies have 2.35 lakh voters in these four constituencies of which 71.10 per cent had cast their votes. In the wake of elections, security was beefed up at the polling stations and prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC were imposed in and around the booths which will remain in effect till Thursday morning. Arrangements for hand sanitisers and thermal screening at all the booths were made. Medical teams were also deployed around the polling centres as well.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/711-polling-for-four-legislative-council-seats-in-karnataka-908391.html

Addressing a programme on Tuesday at the secretariat at Porvorim in North Goa district as part of the vigilance awareness week, he said the harassment of the common man has to stop in the state. "Even after 60 years of liberation, Goans are still deprived of basic necessities like toilets, electricity and water," Sawant said. "This is due to the inefficiency of bureaucracy in implementing schemes commissioned by the governments (state and Centre)," he said. The chief minister said some government officers do not even turn up at their offices and their department heads do not question them. He further said 70 to 80 websites out of 150 government departments are inactive, and it the duty of the respective department heads to ensure their functioning. "It is not for the chief secretary or the chief minister to get these websites active," Sawant said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bureaucracy-deprived-goans-of-basic-amenities-says-cm-sawant-908103.html

28-10-2020||West||Gujarat Riots: Ex-SIT chief Raghavan's book describes Setalvad, Bhatt as detractors||Former chairman of the Supreme Court appointed-Special Investigation Team (SIT), which probed nine major rioting cases of 2002 post-Godhra riots, R K Raghavan in his autobiography has termed Mumbai-based activist Teesta Setalvad, Gujarat cadre IPS officer R B Sreekumar, retired, and sacked and jailed IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt his "detractors" who allegedly targeted him during the probe into riots. Setalvad and her NGO "Citizen for Justice and Peace" had provided legal assistance to riot survivors, including Zakia Jafri, wife of ex-Congress MP Ehsan Jafri. Ehsan Jafri was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre and Zakia had approached the Supreme Court seeking investigation against the then Gujarat Chief Minister and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the entire state machinery for allegedly orchestrating the riots as part of "larger conspiracy." Setalvad is facing several cases including a case of alleged misappropriation of funds meant for Gulberg Society riot survivors. The two ex IPS officers - R B Sreekumar and Sanjeev Bhatt - were witnesses in the complaint filed by Jafri but the SIT had not believed their testimonies and called them "liars." The SIT report had given a clean chit to Modi which was accepted by magisterial as well as Gujarat High Court. The ex-CBI director Raghavan, who was appointed as chairman of SIT in 2008 by the Supreme Court, has defended another two Gujarat IPS officers Shivanand Jha and controversial officer Geetha Johri who were removed from the SIT by the apex court on allegations that they were "partisan." Both the officers retired as director general of police. "Johri and Jha were eased out during the early days of the SIT by the apex court on some flimsy charges levelled by some vested interests, backed by a political party which was bent on defaming the then Gujarat government," Raghavan mentions in his book, A Road Well Travelled. The former IPS officer claims that there were efforts to "dislodge" him from the SIT because he was "politically inconvenient to those who were in great danger of being permanently eliminated from the Indian polity."  He goes on to write, "I held my ground much to the annoyance of those who were opposed to the chief minister (Modi)." The book contains less than 50 pages on his about nine-year stint as chairman of the SIT. It doesn't mention why the SIT was constituted in the first place and ignores the fact put on record before the court by several litigants, including the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), NGOs, and several prominent citizens, that had sought a probe into the violence. The NHRC had filed the petition in 2003 to transfer cases outside Gujarat over faulty probe by the local police and the government's apathy to take action against the erring policemen. It was following a prolonged hearing that in 2008, the apex court had ordered an SIT probe into eight major cases including Naroda Patiya, Naroda Gam, Gulberg Society, among others. Questioning of then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi In his book, Raghavan also recalls the day when the SIT had grilled Modi at their office in Gandhinagar for nine hours. He describes the occasion as a "significant event" during the SIT probe. He claims that the SIT had conveyed to Modi's staff that he had "to come in person to the SIT office" for the questioning and that "meeting elsewhere would be misconstrued as a favour." The book claims that Modi "understood the spirit" of their stand and "readily agreed to come to the SIT office". Raghavan has written that he took the "unusual step" by asking Ashok Kumar Malhotra, a member of the SIT, to question Modi. He writes -- "A lot of people were intrigued by my action to stay away." "My decision was mainly to avoid any mischievous allegation later that Modi and I had struck a deal," he clarifies. However, his claim has not gone down well with some active members of the SIT DH spoke to. "On that day, March 27, 2010, when Modi arrived, we were a bit angry with our chairman since he didn't show up even to introduce us. In high profile cases, the supervisory officer should remain present to complete such formality. We were a bit surprised at his behavior. He didn't come to SIT office even for a second and remained stationed at IPS Mess in Ahmedabad," said one of the members on the condition of anonymity. The book mentions how Modi turned down Malhotra's, who is now leading the SIT, offer to take a lunch break. An SIT member told DH, "The claim is a bit exaggerated. Modi and Malhotra both were on fast on that day. I remember correctly, it was Chaitra Navratri. Malhotraji used to have tea even during fasting but Modi didn't have anything except water. This is true that he had brought his own water bottle. It was perhaps of the Himalayan brand." He also recalled that the questioning started at 11 am. Modi took a break at 6 pm and came back in a different attire at around 9 pm which lasted for three hours. "Modi took the break at 6 pm as he had to do perform pooja," the member claimed. "He (Raghavan) tried to keep himself away from the SIT and its probe. He always played safe and that's why he didn't come for the questioning," said an old SIT member who also spoke on condition of anonymity.   Raghavan describes the break in the book as -- "It required tremendous persuasion to make him (Modi) agree to a short recess. This was possibly Modi's concession to the need for a respite for Malhotra rather than for himself."  "Such was the energy of the man," the book adds. When contacted, Malhotra refused to comment. Raghavan has brought these "details" of his SIT days in the chapter "Life After Retirement" which is followed by a chapter titled, "A Mediterranean Saga" that begins with his appointment as India's high commissioner to Cyprus in August 2017, five months after he was relieved from the SIT on his request.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-riots-ex-sit-chief-raghavans-book-describes-setalvad-bhatt-as-detractors-908119.html

The accused, Yogesh Mahipal Singh, was on Tuesday night traced to a hospital at Vasai in neighbouring Palghar district, located about 50 km from here, he said. According to the actress, Singh allegedly stabbed her in the abdomen and both hands in Versova area of Mumbai on Monday night as she had refused his marriage proposal. After attacking her, the accused fled in his car. The actress is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Mumbai, the police said. On Tuesday, the accused was found at a Vasai-based hospital where a Versova police team went and enquired with him about the incident, the official said. "He has not yet been arrested as he his hospitalised for some treatment," the official said.

Speaking to reporters after chairing a weekly cabinet meeting, Sawant also said that casinos would be allowed to run with 50 per cent capacity and would need to follow all the SOPs put in place by the state and central governments. "Casinos will start from November 1. We have given them permission," the Chief Minister said. Sawant said that the reasons why casinos were allowed to restart operations in the state was to facilitate the resurgence of tourist activity in the coastal state, which attracted nearly eight million tourists last year, but saw footfalls drop drastically, due to the pandemic. "They will have to follow all the SOPs as issued to them by the Home Department. They will have to operate with 50 per cent capacity. We need to promote tourism activity," Sawant said. Sawant also announced a financial concession made to the influential industry, saying they would be allowed to pay their licence fee on a monthly basis, instead of annually. There are currently six offshore and nine onshore casinos operating in Goa. While the offshore casinos function from glitzy boats anchored in the Mandovi river off Panaji, the onshore casinos function from the many five star hotels in the coastal tourism savvy state. The first onshore casinos were licenced in the early 1990s, while the first offshore casino was licenced later in the same decade.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-casinos-to-reopen-from-november-1-908189.html

Ranaut in her tweet had also urged Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar to probe the environmental damage caused by the incident. "Movie industry is not a virus just for the moral fibre n culture of this nation but it has become very destructive and harmful for the environment also, @PrakashJavdekar ji @moefcc see this disgusting, filthy, irresponsible behaviour by so-called big production houses, pls help Folded hands," Ranaut said in her tweet. Dilip Borkar, a Goa-based line producer hired by Dharma Productions, has however said that the accusations of indiscriminate garbage disposal were baseless. "No one knows the ground reality. Kangana Ranaut does not know anything about what is happening here. This is wrong. She is spoiling Goa's name," Borkar said at a press conference held in Panaji on Wednesday. "...there are efforts to defame us. We do not know why, maybe because Dharma Productions is involved or Karan Johar's name is involved," Borkar said. The line producer said that the incident was related to a Dharma Productions shoot, for a film starring Deepika Padukone.  "The film shoot was at a villa in Nerul village. The garbage was collected every day and we had engaged a contractor appointed by the local village panchayat to dispose of the garbage. It was only on Sunday (last week) that he failed to turn up, so the garbage collection was delayed by a day," Borkar said. The line producer has already been issued a show-cause notice by the Entertainment Society of Goa, a Goa government body which facilitates and regulates film-shoots permissions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/war-of-words-erupts-over-garbage-dumped-in-goa-beach-908221.html

This corruption runs into Rs 300 crore to Rs 400 crore, the leader of opposition in Maharashtra Assembly claimed in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Fadnavis in the letter said some state ministers earlier assured of making contractual workers under the National Health Mission (NHM) permanent. "After such comments, there have been some audio clips where some people are demanding Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.50 lakh to make the employee permanent. It is a corruption of Rs 300 crore to Rs 400 crore," he alleged. There are nearly 20,000 contractual workers in the state under the National Health Mission, he said. The NHM is a Centre-sponsored scheme, but state government is the implementing authority. "Many people have taken loan to pay the bribe so that they can get a permanent job. I am sending three audio clips along with my letter where the alleged conversations of bribe are recorded," the former state chief minister said. The government should take strict action and spare no officer if found involved, Fadnavis said. "If one such mission is mired in such corrupt practices, one can imagine how much corruption is going on in various sectors of the state health department," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bribes-being-sought-to-make-national-health-mission-employees-permanent-bjp-leader-devendra-fadnavis-908232.html

A delegation led by BJP spiritual coordination committee head, Acharya Tushar Bhosale submitted a memorandum to the state governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. In the past, the BJP’s spiritual wing had held two protests demanding that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government re-open the temples. According to a press statement, the party had twice sought an appointment with Thackeray and demanded that temples be opened by 27 October. Earlier this month, Koshyari had shot off a letter to Thackeray on the issue that snowballed into a major controversy. In the letter to Thackeray, the Governor said: “In a letter to Uddhav, the Governor said: “….You have been a strong votary of Hindutva.  You have publicly espoused your devotion for Lord Rama by visiting Ayodhya after taking charge as Chief Minister. You visited Vitthal Rukmini Mandir in Pandharpur and performed the puja on Ashadi Ekadashi. I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turn ‘secular’ yourself, the term you hated.” The Chief Minister, however, shot back at him saying: "You have taken oath as a Governor…and secularism is a part of the Constitution. However, I don’t need a certificate on Hindutva from anybody, nor do I have to learn it from anyone. Those giving a warm welcome to people who compare my state and its capital (Mumbai) with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir don’t fit in my Hindutva."

28-10-2020||West||TV channel Colors apologises over 'Bigg Boss' contestant's remark||The TV channel airing Bigg Boss on Wednesday issued an apology over a contestant's remark related to the Marathi language in the latest season of the reality show, an action which came after the ruling Shiv Sena threatened to stage a protest at the programme's set. The show, which is now in its 14th season, is telecast on Colors channel, owned by Viacom Media Pvt Ltd. In a letter addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Viacom Media apologised for inadvertently hurting the sentiments of the people of the state. The apology from Viacom Media came after Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, who is also a party spokesperson, took objection to tone and tenor of Jan Kumar Sanu, one of the contestants on the show, asking a fellow contestant not to speak in Marathi. "The manner in which he spoke was insulting to the Marathi language. We demand that Sanu be removed as a contestant otherwise Shiv Sena activists would come on the show's sets and protest." "Bigg Boss gets TRPs from Marathi audience and is shot in Maharashtra. Such an attitude of a contestant will not be tolerated," Sarnaik had warned after the controversial episode was telecast. Sarnaik said the show's host, superstar Salman Khan, should also reprimand the contestant. Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had also disapproved of Sanu's comment and promised action against the contestant. In the letter to Thackeray, the channel said, "We have received objections regarding reference to the Marathi language during the episode broadcast on October 27. "We have taken note of the objections and have taken corrective measures of removing the part from all future broadcasts of the episode. "We apologise if we have inadvertently hurt the feelings of the people of Maharashtra due to the broadcast of the said comment in relation to the Marathi language. "We value the audience and the patronage of the Marathi-speaking audience and respect all languages of India in the same manner," the channel said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/tv-channel-colors-apologises-over-bigg-boss-contestants-remark-908255.html

Such speculation cannot be the basis of an FIR, the Central agency said in response to Rajput's sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh's petition seeking to quash the case lodged against them by Mumbai Police. Chakraborty, Rajput's girlfriend, has alleged that a fabricated prescription was used to help him procure medicines banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act only a few days before his suicide in June 2020. "The allegations in the present FIR are mostly presumptive and speculative in nature," the CBI said. The Central Bureau of Investigation also pointed out that it is probing the complaint filed by Rajput's father K K Singh against Chakraborty and her family members for allegedly abetting the 34-year-old actor's suicide. Rajput's sisters filed the petition through advocate Madhav Thorat on October 6 seeking that the FIR filed against them by Bandra Police here be quashed. TheCBI said the police should have conducted preliminary enquiry before registering the First Information Report. "It is settled law that two FIRs cannot be registered on the same cause of action....the CBI is already investigating the causes relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and all aspects surrounding the same. "In view of this, it was expected from the Mumbai police to forward the complaint received from Rhea Chakraborty to the CBI instead of registering FIR itself," the CBI said. "Therefore, registration of FIR on the same facts and cause of action is both unwarranted and not allowed under law. Thus, this FIR is vitiated and bad in law," the agency said. If Rhea Chakraborty was aware of the mobile phone chat between Rajput and his sister Priyanka in June 2020 during which Priyanka allegedly sent him a medical prescription, then Rhea should not have kept silent till September, the CBI said. It was conducting probe without being hindered by any external factors in an impartial manner, it said. The police's FIR names Rajput's two sisters and a doctor of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, Tarun Kumar, who allegedly signed the medical prescription. The HC will hear the petition on November 4.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rhea-chakrabortys-accusations-against-sushant-singh-rajputs-sisters-speculative-cbi-908276.html

To take it forward, the Maharashtra government has written letters to General Managers of Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) and Commissioner of Police, Railways, Mumbai. "The state is looking to open up the local train services to the general public while enduring adherence to Covid-19 protocols,” Kishore Raje Nimbalkar, Secretary, Disaster Management, Relief, and Rehabilitation, wrote to CR and WR chiefs. The state government has also prepared a schedule and mentioned the timings – according to which people who are not part of essential services will not be allowed to travel during peak hours. As per the schedule, one ladies' special train has been planned every hour. Any person with a valid ticket/pass would be able to travel from the first local to 7.30 am, 11 am to 4.30 pm, and 8 pm till the last local of the day. People in essential services and valid QR-code will be allowed to travel between 8 am to 10.30 am and 5 pm to 7.30 pm. According to Nimbalkar, the proposal will need additional train services that need to be planned out. “It is requested that the Railways may kindly give their inputs on the above proposed time schedule at the earliest,” he said. The CR-WR suburban train services are considered the lifeline of Mumbai, the financial capital of India – and the network collectively runs over 3,200 services daily but now scaled down services are being run. The total services on both the railway networks – spread across five lines are 1,500 and as of now only people working in essential services, State and Central governments, press, lawyers are allowed to use the services based on QR-code. The CR-WR administration will consult the Railway Board and decide on the future course.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-maharashtra-government-plans-to-re-open-local-trains-for-all-908291.html
28-10-2020||West||Man held for shoe attack on Gujarat deputy CM Nitin Patel; Congress, BJP spar||Police in Gujarat on Wednesday arrested a man who they claimed was a "Congress worker" who hurled a shoe in the direction of Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel in Vadodara district two days ago. The shoe "attack" took place on Monday evening at Kurali village under Karjan taluka of Vadodara district when Nitin Patel was addressing the media after a bypoll rally. Luckily, the footwear missed the target and landed just a few inches away from Nitin Patel, a senior BJP leader. According to the Vadodara district police, the accused, Rashmin Patel, is a resident of Shinor taluka of the district and is a Congress worker. However, Congress has rejected the police claim and said Rashmin Patel is in fact a BJP worker. "Based on a specific tip-off, we have arrested one Rashmin Patel, a Congress worker, for his involvement in throwing a shoe towards Nitin Patel. "In an audio clip found in his mobile phone, he can be heard saying his 'plan remains successful'. "We are investigating if some others were also involved in the incident," Superintendent of Police Sudhir Desai told reporters in Vadodara. Refuting the police claim, state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi shared some documents with the media to claim that Rashmin Patel is actually a BJP worker and belongs to a dissident group. "As per this official document of the Gujarat State Election Commission, Rashmin Patel won the Shinor Taluka Panchayat election on a BJP ticket in 2010. "He was also appointed as the chairman of the executive committee of Shinor Taluka Panchayat by the BJP and he served in the post between 2010 and 2013," Doshi told reporters here. "Police must remain neutral and refrain from functioning as BJP workers. Rashmin Patel is a BJP worker and belongs to a dissident group. The shoe was hurled because of BJP's internal groupism," added Doshi. The ruling BJP, however, refuted the Congress claim, saying Rashmin Patel was with the Congress and even took part in canvassing for the opposition party's candidate from the Karjan assembly seat, Akshay Patel. "Rashmin Patel is not with the BJP. He was a Congress worker and worked for Akshay Patel ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls when he contested as the Congress candidate. Even Akshay Patel knows him," said BJP leader Satish Patel. Karjan is one of the eight Assembly seats going to bypolls on November 3. The by-elections were necessitated following the resignations of Congress MLAs, including Akshay Patel. Akshay Patel had won from Karjan in 2017 on a Congress ticket. The BJP has fielded him from the same seat after he switched sides.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/man-held-for-shoe-attack-on-gujarat-deputy-cm-nitin-patel-congress-bjp-spar-908294.html
28-10-2020||West||Left, Congress begin alliance discussion in West Bengal||Initiating the process for finalising their alliance for the 2021 Assembly elections, the Left Front and Congress have decided to focus on holding more joint movements based on a common program. Both sides are keen on deciding the final seat-sharing agreement based on the public response to the joint movement. According to sources in the Left Front the decision was taken at a recent meeting in Kolkata between the Left Front and State Congress leadership including State Congress president and Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Chowdhury said that both sides would start working on a common program and preparation of its draft would begin soon. “The meeting took place on a very positive note. Our joint movements will continue and I am hopeful of making rapid progress on preparing the draft common program,” said Chowdhury. However, he did not specify when the discussion for seat-sharing would begin. CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said that the key objective of the joint movements by the Left Front and the Congress would be to provide a “third alternative” to the people outside the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and BJP. According to sources in Congress it was decided in the meeting that the final decision regarding joint movements would be taken directly by the Left Front Chairperson Biman Basu and Chowdhury. Both leaders would have a telephonic conversation before hitting the streets and inform their respective parties. Congress sources further revealed that during the meeting, Basu said that even though the Left-Congress alliance did not materialise in the last Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front did not field any candidates against Chowdhury and Congress candidate Abu Hasem as a “good will gesture.” The Left Front and the Congress failed to strike a deal in the last Lok Sabha elections as they could not reach an agreement over seat-sharing and decided to contests on their own strength. Sources in both sides said that for the 2021 Assembly elections they wanted to start seat-sharing discussion well ahead to avoid any confusion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/left-congress-begin-alliance-discussion-in-west-bengal-908309.html

The multiple-choice question was asked in the online paper on Defence Budgeting, one of the optional courses offered by the varsity. The question sought to know "main causes of Jihadi terrorism" and the multiple choices offered included `globalization', `armament proliferation' and `use of violence in the name of Islamic radicalism'. Vice-chancellor Dr Nitin Karmalkar said on Wednesday that some people took offence over the question and raised the issue on social media. "To avoid further complications, we issued an apology as there is a possibility of an error on the part of paper-setters," he said. An explanation has been sought from the concerned authorities, he added. The varsity also said that some people were circulating fake questions, which were never part of any examination, on social media to defame it, and action will be taken against such mischief.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pune-varsity-apologizes-over-question-about-jihadi-terrorism-in-examination-908422.html
