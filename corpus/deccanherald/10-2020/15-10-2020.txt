15-10-2020||First Edit||Sack Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari||The recent exchange of letters between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over the reopening of temples in the state is not just political tit-for-tat but has a bearing on the constitutional position and responsibilities of the Governor. Koshyari’s taunting of Thackeray on the latter having ‘turned secular’ was not only wrong and inappropriate but was violative of the oath of office he took as Governor of the state. The use of the word ‘secular’ in Koshyari’s question is in a pejorative sense, and clearly conveyed the impression that it was wrong to be secular. It also brought out tellingly the Governor’s surprise over and disapproval of the Chief Minister ‘turning’ secular. It cannot be defended as innocent sarcasm, as has been sought to be made out. The sarcasm actually gave a sharper touch to the disapproval of the Chief Minister being secular.  Koshyari is sworn to protect and uphold the Constitution, under which the country is a secular republic. Indeed, secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution. If a Governor makes public criticism of a Chief Minister for being secular, and even, in a sense, calls for an explanation from him for being so, he is not fit to hold that position. Governors and other constitutional functionaries have through words and actions given rise to doubts about their commitment to secularism. But no one has till now so blatantly criticised it and deprecated it like Koshyari did in his letter. Since he does not seem to have any regrets over the remarks he made, he should be dismissed as the Governor of the state. The responsibility for this rests with the central government and the President, whose representative the Governor is. If they don’t do that, they will be considered to be endorsing and supporting Koshyari’s views. The Governor was questioning the state government’s decision to keep the temples in the state shut as the Covid situation is still very grave. The Governor, in fact, has no right to question the Chief Minister about it as it is entirely within the government’s power to take a decision on it. Governors have acted as the political agents of the central government in states. Koshyari has himself acted so, as he did when he swore in BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister in November last year without ascertaining his majority in the Assembly. But with this letter, he has gone beyond political partisanship and challenged the Constitution and has even mocked it. He makes it clear that Hindutva and secularism are contradictory ideas. A Governor, true to his oath, cannot support the former against the latter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/sack-maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-902073.html
15-10-2020||In Perspective||Covid-19: Is Vietnam the next ‘Asian Miracle’?||Within days of China’s announcing the first case of Covid-19, Vietnam was mobilising to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Using mass texts, TV ads, billboards, posters and loudspeakers, the government exhorted the nation’s 100 million citizens to identify carriers and trace contacts, contacts of contacts, even contacts of contacts. Rapid isolation of outbreaks has kept Vietnam’s death rate among the four lowest in the world — well under one death per million people. Containing the pandemic allowed Vietnam to quickly reopen businesses, and it is now expected to be the world’s fastest-growing economy this year. While many nations are suffering enormous economic contractions and running to the International Monetary Fund for financial rescues, Vietnam is growing at a 3% annual pace. Even more impressive, its growth is driven by a record trade surplus, despite the collapse in global trade. This breakout moment for Vietnam has been a long time in the making. After World War II, the “Asian miracles” — first Japan, then Taiwan and South Korea, most recently China — grew their way out of poverty by opening to trade and investment and becoming manufacturing export powerhouses. Now, Vietnam is following the same path, but in an entirely new age. The conditions that made the original miracles possible are gone. The post-war baby boom is over. The era of rapid globalisation, with growing trade and investment flows, is over. Economic growth is slowing worldwide. In this environment, the superpowers no longer ignore the tactics that the earlier miracles used to get an edge. Last week, the US formally accused Vietnam of currency manipulation and initiated the same type of investigation that triggered the tariff war with China. An even bigger threat to Vietnam’s continuing growth is that the country has been ruled for nearly half a century by the same authoritarian party. With no opposition, autocrats can force very rapid growth, but often their unchecked policy whims and obsessions generate erratic boom-and-bust cycles, which stall development. These hurdles make what Vietnam’s unusually competent autocracy has achieved so far all the more impressive — but also much more difficult to sustain. During their boom years, the original Asian miracles produced annual export growth close to 20% — nearly double the average for low- or middle-income nations at the time. Vietnam has sustained a similar pace for three decades. Even as global trade slumped in the 2010s, Vietnam’s exports grew 16% a year, by far the fastest rate in the world, and three times the emerging-world average. While other emerging countries spend heavily on social welfare in an effort to appease voters, Vietnam devotes its resources to its exports, building roads and ports to get goods overseas and building schools to educate workers. The government invests about 8% of GDP each year on new building projects, and now gets higher grades for the quality of its infrastructure than any nation at a similar stage of development. It also steers foreigners’ money in the same direction. Over the last five years, FDI has averaged more than 6% of Vietnam’s GDP, the highest rate of any emerging country. Most of it goes to building manufacturing plants and related infrastructure, and most of it now comes from fellow Asian countries, including South Korea, Japan and China. The old miracles are helping to build the new one. Vietnam has become a favourite destination for export manufacturers, leaving China in search of cheaper wages. Average annual per capita income in Vietnam has quintupled since the late 1980s to nearly $3,000 per person, but the cost of labour is still one half that of China, and the work force is unusually well educated for its income class. That skilled labour is helping Vietnam move “up the ladder,” perhaps faster than any rival, to manufacture increasingly sophisticated goods. Tech surpassed clothing and textiles as Vietnam’s leading export in 2015, and accounts for most of its record trade surplus this year. In a protectionist era, Vietnam is also a trend-bending, Communist champion of open borders, a signatory to more than a dozen free trade agreements — including a landmark deal recently signed with the European Union. Can Vietnam continue its success, despite potential obstacles such as shrinking populations, declining trade and an autocratic government’s tenacious grip on power? Probably. While its own working-age population growth is slowing, most Vietnamese still live in the countryside, so the economy can continue to grow by shifting workers from rural areas to urban factory jobs. Over the last five years, no large country has increased its share of global exports more than Vietnam has. And so far, its government has not made the kind of egregious policy mistake that typically retards economic development in autocratic nations. It is making autocratic capitalism work unusually well, through open economic policies and sound financial management. The overwhelming majority of post-war economies that grew super-fast, or went bust, were run by authoritarian governments. Vietnam has sustained strong growth so far, largely free of the classic excesses, like large government deficits or public debts. One possible problem: After multiple rounds of privatisation, the government owns fewer companies, but those it still owns are huge and account for nearly a third of economic output — the same as a decade ago. If trouble comes, these bloated state companies, which account for many of the bad loans in the banking system, are one place it could start. It’s worth noting that rising debts also led to financial crises that marked the end of sustained growth in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and now hang over China as well. So, there are perils on any development path. For now, Vietnam looks like a miracle from a bygone era, exporting its way to prosperity.

The elephant, Rajendra (56), succumbed to its injuries after being found severely injured on Wednesday morning. The tamed elephants were left to graze in the forest on Tuesday night. The mahouts and kavaids spotted a severely injured Rajendra the next morning when they left for the forest to get the elephants back. The male elephant, which was brought back to the camp, was being treated but succumbed to its injuries on Thursday, said RFO Y K Kiran Kumar. Rajendra was caught at the Yadavanadu forest in Somwarpet back in 1990. “The elephant was like a leader in the camp,” said the mahouts. Veterinary doctor Mujeeb Rehman conducted the post mortem in the presence of Rajiv Gandhi National Park Director D Mahesh Kumar, Hunsur wildlife division ACF A V Sathish and others. Wildlife activists alleged that there is no protection for the elephants and mahouts at the Mathigodu Elephant Camp which is situated beside the Hunsur-Virajpet state highway. Two years ago, a tamed elephant, Ranga, died after a private bus rammed into it. Six months ago, a mahout had died when a vehicle knocked him down while he was accompanying the elephants to the forest. The camp had 42 elephants two years ago. The number has now dwindled to 17.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/tamed-elephant-dies-after-being-attacked-by-wild-elephant-in-kodagus-mathigodu-elephant-camp-902275.html

Though the showers subsided, the floods are ravaging. As all rivers, streams and rivulets are in full spate, several villages were submerged and some are facing an imminent threat of submergence in the district. Crops on vast tracts of agriculture fields have been damaged. A few bridges are washed away in the rain fury and some are still under the flood waters.  The body of Baburao Kamble (30), a resident of Dongaragoan village, who washed in a stream in Jawalaga(B) village in Kamalapur taluk on Tuesday night, was found on Thursday afternoon. He came to the village to see his wife and newly twins. Heavy discharge from Veer and Ujani dams in the neighbouring Maharashtra has triggered flood-like situation along the Bhima basin. Deputy Commissioner Vasireddi Vijaya Jyothsna has directed for shifting a total of 148 villages in four taluks of the district as about 7.5 lakh cusecs water is expected to be released from two reservoirs in neighbouring state. The district administration is monitoring the situation in Jewargi, Chittapur, Afzalpur and Sedam taluks of the district. A total of 5.11 lakh cusecs water is being released from Sonna barrage from Thursday evening cutting off road connectivity between several towns. This is the highest discharge from Sonna barrage in the recent past as about 3.6 lakh cusecs was discharged in 2018. The deputy commissioner has sounded a red alert for two days in the district. Two NDRF teams with the help of local police have rescued about 150 stranded people so for. Over 50 relief centres have been set up in the district and additional centres will be opened if need be, she told.

Citing a Karnataka Minorities Commission report prepared by its the then chairman Anwar Manippady, BJP spokesperson Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that people who do "fear-mongering" among Muslims and are their "self-professed" protectors have exploited them. He also said that the commission has pointed out in its report that over 29,000 acres of waqf land in Karnataka was "surreptitiously and illegally" transferred for commercial use. He also mentioned that while the report was prepared in 2012 but it was tabled in state assembly in September this year. For eight years, two "secular governments ruled the state, and why they did not table it", he questioned. Chandrasekhar said that an investigation should be done into such waqf land irregularities in other states too. When asked what present Karnataka Government ruled BJP took action on the report, he said "I am confident that a probe will be undertaken in Karnataka." The waqf board in the state holds 54,000 acres of land of which 29,000 acres were "illegally" used for commercial purposes, Chandrasekhar said, citing the report. BJP leader Manippady in his report named several Congress leaders including Mallikarjun Kharge C M Ibrahim, Rehman Khan, N A Haris, and Iqbal Saradagi, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-targets-oppn-accuses-them-of-looting-waqf-board-meant-for-muslims-902381.html
15-10-2020||Main Article||India’s Nobel Prize drought||We are happy, and justifiably so, to learn that physicist Roger Penrose, has won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics (jointly with  Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez) for the discovery related to Black Holes that stands on the shoulders of Indian physicist Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri. Since the Raychaudhuri Equation in General Relativity, derived by Raychaudhuri, has come into the spotlight, the India connection to the Nobel Prize cheered us, though it occasions an unavoidable question: Why can’t India produce a Noble-class scientist? In view of the fact that there have only been a handful of Nobel laureates in a country of over 1.3 billion, it calls for a time-worn self-introspection. C V Raman is the only Indian to have been awarded the Nobel Prize for work he did in India, and that was in 1930. There are others of Indian origin like Venkataraman Ramakrishnan, Har Gobind Khorana and Subrahmanyan Chandrashekar (Raman’s nephew), who occasioned India’s pride but all of them did their prize-winning work outside India or were naturalised citizens of America at the time of winning the prize. Raman once said that although scientists "are claimed as nationals by one or another of many different countries, yet in the truest sense, they belong to the whole world.” It is true that since the Second World War, there has been a steady migration of scientists responding to the pull of better research and economic opportunities offered primarily in the United States and Western Europe which might also account for the migrations of scientists, mostly Jewish, from Germany and other countries in Central Europe, to Great Britain and the US. But what accounts for the abysmally low count of Indian Nobel laureates in science? Leon Lederman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, asked the question, “How many Amazon kids, how many African kids, how many children in some remote village in China and India get lost and could be a Newton or an Einstein?” Indeed, lack of opportunities is a major reason why brilliant students go abroad or are waylaid.  Chandra K Mittal observed that Indian scientists lack political, cultural, and social capital in the Western world, as a result of which they lack visibility and peer recognition and thus the ownership and credit for the discoveries made by them are denied them. Scientists like E C G Sudarshan and Homi Bhabha, nominated more than once for Nobel recognition, did not receive the honour. The discovery of the synthesis of the nitric oxide signalling system, based on the work done by two scientists, Chandra K Mittal and Ferid Murad, brought a Nobel Prize for Medicine for Murad and two others in 1998; Mittal’s name did not figure in the list.   Mittal is not alone. In an illuminating book titled The Road to Stockholm: Nobel Prizes, Science, and Scientists by István Hargittai (Oxford University Press, 2002), there are clear instances of oversight. Hargittai describes two groups in this chapter – people who did work that was clearly "Nobel class" but never received the award, and people who could reasonably have shared an award but did not. A sulphuric debate ensued as the second category cited Raman, who in 1930 was the first ‘non-white’, Asian and Indian to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the scattering of light and discovery of the Raman Effect. Several questions have been asked about Raman not sharing the prize with his student and main researcher Krishnan. When Hauptmann got Nobel for X-ray crystallography in the 1960s, he said the work  that fetched him the Nobel was first begun by Kedareswar Banerjee, formerly director of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and a pupil of Raman. Satyen Bose did not get a Nobel for Bose-Einstein Statistics, but quite a few got the Nobel based on his work. Saha's Thermal Ionisation was the stepping-stone for several Nobel prizes, though not for himself. Biresh Guha was a pioneer in Vitamin C breakthrough (the Nobel was bagged by a Hungarian). Guha was imprisoned for his participation in the freedom struggle in India. But politics does not alone explain the fundamental crisis of India’s inability to produce Nobel-class scientists. Our nationalistic government that makes a mockery of Indian science by passing off myths as scientific facts must remember that the best universities with inspiring teachers seem to be a prerequisite for winning a Nobel in the science categories. Proof that we can’t produce world-class scientists and lack innovation lies in the fact that six months into the pandemic, millions of children studying in vernacular medium schools in India remain deprived of education in the public education system, with no low-cost technology solution or scientific intervention emerging to facilitate distance learning for them. Why so? A joint study of industry body Assocham and Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences five years ago took the IITs to task for having failed to produce a single Nobel laureate. It noted rightly that since Indian universities have little money for research and innovation, India ranks low when it comes to new patents and start-ups in technology and innovation. Our scientists note that in countries like the US, with a consistent Nobel-winning streak, universities which support basic research, collaborative work, inter-disciplinary thinking and innovation have flourished. In India, too, our universities have to be nurtured as centres of research and open learning, and scientific research has to be revived in universities. Serious fund crunch, or if granted, slow delivery of funds from funding agencies, and a below-par research infrastructure, combined with confinement of quality research in a few top institutes (like Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Defence Research and Development Organisation labs and the Department of Atomic Energy) might account for the crisis. The systemic rot has to be soul-searched and addressed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/main-article/india-s-nobel-prize-drought-902074.html

15-10-2020||National||India lampoons Pak at Commonwealth foreign ministers' meet for raising Kashmir issue||A day after being elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Pakistan drew flak from India on Wednesday – not only for exporting terrorism to other countries, but also for carrying out a genocide in 1971 and continuing for persecuting its indigenous minorities. New Delhi sharply responded to a move by Pakistan to use a virtual meeting of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers to tacitly criticise India – for allegedly “targeting its religious minorities groups” as well as for illegally engineering “demographic change” in Jammu and Kashmir. “It was unfortunate that today’s Commonwealth (Foreign Ministers’) Meeting was misused by one of our South Asian member state to pursue its own bigoted, ill-conceived, narrow and unilateral agenda on a multilateral platform,” Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) at the Ministry of External Affairs, said, delivering the national statement of India. Swarup took part in the meeting on behalf of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. His comment came after Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government in New Delhi of transgressing the rights and freedoms of millions. Qureshi’s sought to use the meeting to attack New Delhi even as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said in Islamabad that election of his nation to the United Nations Human Rights Council was a diplomatic achievement and Pakistan would expose the alleged violation of human rights by India in Jammu and Kashmir. “While the world remains preoccupied with (Covid-19) pandemic, a state in South Asia is targeting its religious minorities groups in order to foment division and hatred amongst community groups,” Pakistan’s Foreign Minister said, without directly referring to India. “It has transgressed rights and freedoms of millions and fanned hyper-nationalism to engineer illegal demographic change in a disputed territory and sowed racial tensions. We ignore its transgressions only at our own peril.” Swarup responded by wondering if Pakistan’s Foreign Minister was describing his own country. “And not surprisingly it came from a globally acknowledged promoter of state-sponsored terrorism masquerading as an alleged victim of the same. We heard it from a country that brought genocide to South Asia 49 years back when it killed its own people,” he said, referring to Pakistan Army’s killing spree after losing the 1971 war, which liberated East Pakistan and gave birth to a new nation, Bangladesh. “This is also the same country that has the dubious distinction of becoming synonymous with the phrase ‘epicentre of terrorism’ and hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations.” He also underlined that the only dispute between New Delhi and Islamabad left unresolved in what Qureshi described as a "disputed territory” was  Pakistan own illegal occupation of certain parts of the territory of India. He said that Pakistan would have to “sooner or later” vacate the area it occupied in Jammu and Kashmir of India. He, however, did not directly name Pakistan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-lampoons-pak-at-commonwealth-foreign-ministers-meet-for-raising-kashmir-issue-902012.html

Till now, India had formed such arrangements with 16 countries -- Afghanistan, Bahrain, Oman, Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, the Maldives, Nigeria, Qatar, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan, the UK and the USA. Under an air bubble pact between the two countries, special international passenger flights can be operated by their airlines into each other's territories under restrictive conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "To further widen the scope of international air connectivity, an air bubble arrangement is now in place for flights between India & Ukraine, taking the number of such arrangements to 17," Puri said on Twitter. "Carriers of India & Ukraine will operate between the two countries," he added. Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ukraine-becomes-17th-country-to-have-air-bubble-arrangement-with-india-902054.html
15-10-2020||National||India, France re-elected as president, co-president of ISA||India and France were re-elected as president and co-president of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) for a term of two years at its third assembly on Wednesday, an official statement said. The Third Assembly of the ISA was attended by 34 members' ministers. As many as 53 member countries and five signatory and prospective member countries participated in the assembly, the ministry of new and renewable energy said. India and France were re-elected as the president and co-president of the ISA for a term of two years at the virtual meeting of the third ISA assembly. Four new vice-presidents were also chosen to represent the four regions of the ISA. The representatives of Fiji and Nauru for Asia Pacific Region; Mauritius and Niger for Africa Region; UK and the Netherlands for Europe and Others Region; and Cuba and Guyana for Latin America and Caribbean Region assumed the vice presidency. The assembly also approved the initiatives of the ISA Secretariat in institutionalising ISA's engagement with the private and public corporate sector through the Coalition for Sustainable Climate Action (CSCA), it said. Ten public sector organisations in India presented a cheque for USD 1 million each at the assembly. Speaking in the plenary, the President of the ISA assembly and India's Power and New and Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh said solar energy has come a long way in the last five years and is now the fastest growing energy source globally. "Solar energy is already contributing around 2.8 per cent of global electricity, and if trends were to continue, by 2030, solar will become most important source of energy for electricity production in large part of the world," he added. He said six programmes and two projects are now underway covering various aspects of solar energy. A robust pipeline of more than USD 5 billion has been developed for solar energy applications to meet lighting, irrigation, drinking water and productive energy requirements of the ISA member countries, which have so far been largely deprived of modern energy services. The ISA has aggregated a demand for more than 270,000 solar pumps across 22 countries, more than 1 GW of solar rooftop across 11 countries, and more than 10 GW of solar mini-grids across nine countries under its respective programmes. The Co-President of the Assembly Barbara Pompili, France's Minister for Ecological Transition, reiterated France's involvement -- pointing out that of the 1.5 billion euros of financing the country has committed for solar projects in ISA member states up until 2022, 1.15 billion euros has been committed to concrete projects. France has also supported the collaboration with the World Bank to mobilise financing. A facility 'Sustainable Renewables Risk Mitigation Initiative' (SRMI) should help mobilize 18 billion euros in private investment to finance more than 10 gigawatts of solar projects. The first project is being launched in Mozambique with the support of France and the European Union. She further announced that under the framework of the ISA Star-C programme, the French National Institute for Solar Energy (INES) will very soon launch a specific program for the small island states of the Pacific. The ISA assembly was also presented with the report prepared by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The report identifies the sources of funds, opportunities and constraints, in scaling up solar investments and the contribution of ISA in assisting member countries. The assembly welcomed the move of the ISA to work with WRI to develop a roadmap for mobilisation of USD 1 trillion by 2030. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and Climate Works Foundation providing the required financial and technical assistance for preparation of the roadmap. The roadmap will also analyse the potential for mobilising further investments in solar energy going beyond solar power projects to solar energy applications in transportation and cooling and heating and for implementing the vision of 'One Sun, One World, One Grid'. In the wake of the global pandemic, ISA responded by setting up ISA CARES, an initiative dedicated to deployment of solar energy in the healthcare sector. The initiative aims to solarise one primary health sector in each district of target member countries. Australia has provided AUD 92,000 for the ISA CARES initiative in the Pacific to provide ongoing reliable solar energy for health centres in the region, helping remote island communities reduce reliance on costly and uncertain diesel fuel imports. Other initiatives presented to the assembly were the demand aggregation initiative for 47 million solar home systems and 250 million LED lamps in ISA member countries launched in August 2020. The membership of the ISA has continued to grow since the Second Assembly in 2019. The ISA is now supported by 68 member countries, and a further 20 countries are in the process of becoming members. The ISA is an initiative that was launched by the Prime Minister of India and the President of France on November 30, 2015 in Paris on the side-lines of the COP-21. The overarching objective of the ISA is to collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in ISA member countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-france-re-elected-as-president-co-president-of-isa-902061.html

The NHRC's recommendation came in its 'Advisory on Rights of Women' issued recently as part of a series of advisories issued by the rights body in the wake of Covid-19. The advisory acknowledged that lockdown has led to a sudden loss of employment, particularly in the informal sector with no alternate sources of money, food or shelter and it has "disproportionately affected" women who comprise a substantial proportion of such workers. "The economic vulnerability of those involved in work that is already stigmatised, such as sex work, has increased exponentially as the nature of sex work demand physical contact, which is being avoided in Covid-19 times," the advisory said. HIV positive sex workers are unable to access antiretroviral therapy (ART), which are essential for their survival and many sex workers are outside the purview of government schemes as they lack identity documents, it said. In this context, the NHRC asked the authorities to recognise sex workers as informal workers and register them so that they are able to get worker benefits. Temporary documents should be issued to enable them to access welfare measures such as PDS as many do not possess ration cards or other citizenry documents. Citing the Maharashtra government's initiative, it also recommended that state governments could provide assistance and relief to sex workers, especially lactating mothers. Migrant sex workers should be included in schemes and benefits for migrant workers. There is a need to recognise that sex workers in non-traditional living arrangements are prone to domestic violence from partners and family members. Authorities should also ensure free testing and treatment of sex workers who contracted Covid-19 besides providing soaps, sanitisers and masks. They should also ensure healthcare services, especially the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and their treatment. Last month, Durbar Mahila Samanway Committee (DMSC), the country’s oldest collective of sex workers, had approached the Supreme Court seeking support on account of the pandemic. In a statement last month, DMSC had said that social stigma attached to sex work has frustrated attempts to secure alternative livelihoods. “In Mysuru, our community members tried to sell flowers and vegetables but were recognized by locals who refused to buy anything from ‘such women’," Lakshmi from Ashodaya Samithi had said. It also said that the impact on children of sex workers is dire as women have not been able to pay school fees or afford computers, laptops or smart-phones and data cards to enable children to attend online classes. Sex workers are mostly single parents and have to support their children’s’ education from their own earnings. DMSC points out that there is a grave danger that sex workers’ children will be forced to drop out of schools and join low-paying and exploitative work before they attain adulthood, it had added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/recognise-sex-workers-as-informal-workers-provide-welfare-measures-nhrc-902079.html

This indicates a substantial fall in the daily new cases and the consequent increase in time taken to double the total cases,” the ministry said on its official Twitter handle. The Ministry also shared a graph that shows the widening time gap that India's Covid-19 cases took to double. The doubling rate was 27.7 on August 18, 32 on August 30, 35.6 on September 17, 51.4 on October 2 and, finally, 70.4 on October 14. India's Doubling Time has sharply increased to 70.4 days (it was 25.5 days in mid August). The ministry attributed the result to the Centre-led strategies and the selfless dedication of doctors, paramedics, frontline workers and all other Covid-19 warriors. India's Covid-19 tally climbed to 73.07 lakh with 67,708 new cases on Thursday. At least 63,83,441 people have recuperated so far pushing the national recovery rate to 87.35 per cent on Thursday, according to the Union Health Ministry data. India's total coronavirus cases mounted to 73,07,097 and the death toll climbed to 1,11,266 with the disease claiming 680 lives in a span of 24 hours in the country, the data updated at 8 am showed.

15-10-2020||National||Theatres open after 7 months in Covid-19 shadow||Cinemas in several parts of the country opened after almost seven months on Thursday, ushering in a new era of ‘contactless’ movie watching in the shadow of a pandemic with alternate seating, 50 per cent capacity and packaged snacks. While theatres and multiplexes will remain closed in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Chhattisgarh, they will open in several places, including Delhi and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, with stringent dos and don’ts in keeping with the new COVID-19 normal. It was a quiet reopening with few people venturing warily to watch a mix of regional, English and Hindi reruns such as “Chhichhore”, “Thappad”, “Tanhaji” and “The Spy”. While PVR will resume commercial screenings on Friday, Cinepolis and INOX started showing films from Thursday with an emphasis on safety measures, including stringent sanitising and social distancing. “Yes, you heard that right! We are open now! See you at the big screen! Cinemas will not be functional in a few states until further notice,” Cinepolis India said in a tweet. “Sanitisation and deep cleaning with WHO recommended chemicals is done at regular intervals to keep your surroundings safe,” the tweet further read. PVR Cinemas, India’s largest film exhibitor with 845 screens in 176 properties across 71 cities, on Wednesday said 10 states and four union territories have given their go-ahead for the reopening of cinemas. Accordingly, PVR started operations in 487 screens. The hope is is that other states will soon give their green signal too. The Ministry of Home Affairs allowed theatres to reopen from Thursday with up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity. They have to strictly follow the central government’s Standard operating procedures (SOPs). The SOPs mandated by the Union government include one seat distance in halls, 50 per cent capacity, masks at all time, proper ventilation and air conditioner temperature settings at above 23 degrees Celsius. Besides mandatory temperature checks, masks, pedal-operated touch-free hand sanitisers, multiplexes have gone digital with e-tickets instead of traditional paper tickets, self-check in with QR codes, sharing of the auditorium's seat chart and location of the seat and online ordering of food and beverages. Though the MHA has given its go-ahead to resuming cinema and theatre activities under Unlock 5.0, it has left it to individual states to take a final call. With producers reluctant to release new films, cinemas have to deal with the double whammy of COVID fears and old content and have their fingers crossed as they rolled out a different kind of movie going experience. It will take a while before new content returns to theatres as the release of major Bollywood movies “83”, about India’s cricket world cup victory, and “Sooryavanshi”, the latest in Rohit Shetty’s cop drama starring Akshay Kumar have been pushed to Christmas and next year, respectively. Cinephiles who want to rewatch or catch up on movies they missed watching on the big screen can also enjoy Rajput's "Kedarnath", Ayushmann Khurrana-starrers “Shubh Mangal Zyaada Savdhan” and “Dream Girl”, crime drama “Malang” and Akshay Kumar-Vidya Balan-Pannu starrer space drama “Mission Mangal” besides Hollywood hits “Bloodshot”, “Lion King”, “Ford vs Ferrari” and “Knives Out”. An INOX spokesperson in Kolkata said two of its facilities opened today in accordance with all the directives issued by the Centre, including e-tickets and contactless QR-based entries. Those with fever symptoms were being turned away. Other facilities will gradually open too, she said but did not specify a timeframe. The show timing, intermissions and exits are staggered and guests encouraged to maintain a six-feet distance from other families and groups at all the times. SVF cinemas, which owns 13 multiplexes in Kolkata, will open its doors from Friday with all the standard protocols, contactless ticket purchase, making alternate seating arrangements and regular use of sanitisers and disinfectants before and after shows, a spokesperson said. Satadeep Saha, a prominent distributor of films said 22 single screens across the state started screening Rajput starrer “Kedarnath”. Rajput, 34, passed away in June this year. Many cinema halls were closed even before the lockdown period started. Several states, including Delhi, Kerala and Maharastra, had directed cinema halls to close between March 11 to 16 till March 31, 2020. The Central government later directed a nationwide lockdown from March 25. India has a total number of around 8,750 screens, in which 3,100 are in multiplexes and balance 5,650 are single screens operating mostly in small tier II, III and below cities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/theatres-open-after-7-months-in-covid-19-shadow-902159.html

The BARC Board has stated that its Technical Committee would review and augment the current standards of measuring and reporting the data of niche genres to improve their statistical robustness and significantly thwart the potential attempts of infiltrating panel homes. This exercise would cover all Hindi, Regional, English News and Business News channels, according to a press statement issued on Thursday.  Explaining the need for this move, Punit Goenka, Chairman of BARC India Board said, “Given the most recent developments, the BARC Board was of the opinion that a pause was necessitated to enable the industry and BARC to work closely to review its already stringent protocols and further augment them to enable the industry to focus on collaborating for growth and well-natured competitiveness”. Sunil Lulla, CEO, BARC India said, “We at BARC take our role in truthfully and faithfully reporting ‘What India Watches’ with the greatest sense of responsibility and work with integrity to ensure that our audience estimates (ratings) remain true to their purpose”.  He added that besides augmenting current protocols and benchmarking them with global standards, the BARC is actively exploring several options to discourage unlawful inducement of its panel home viewers and further strengthening its Code of Conduct to address viewership malpractice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/trp-scam-barc-suspends-ratings-of-tv-news-channels-902174.html

Speaking at the India-Virginia Business Roundtable organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry on Wednesday, Sandhu said the Indian government has opened every sector, barring a few, for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). “The pandemic has not stopped India from undertaking some bold economic reforms. Almost every sector, barring a few, have been opened for FDI under automatic route, and with limits above 51 per cent,” he said. Sandhu during his address also highlighted the National Education Policy and various path-breaking reforms taken in India. “We have brought in new National Education Policy and path-breaking reforms in labour, space, and agriculture sectors. Our aim is to create virtuous cycles of investment, growth and employment through these focused and people-centric reforms,” he said during the round table that was attended by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam. Sandhu said that during the pandemic there has also been expanded collaboration between the two countries in areas such as health, vaccine development, science, and technology and innovation. “We are learning from each other’s best practices. The free and open exchange of ideas and information has been one of the biggest strengths of our partnership,” he said. He said in Virginia in particular 14 Indian companies have invested around $80 million. These investments support over 1,300 jobs. With the majority of the investment in IT sector, Indian companies are adding to Virginia’s competitive edge, in tech innovation. Noting that Northam has been focused on developing an education system underlining innovation, he said technology and innovation after all hold the key to the future. Sandhu mentioned three Indian companies, among others, who have a significant presence in Virginia. Wipro – one of the leading IT companies of India – in 2019 selected Richmond in Virginia to establish their latest engineering and innovation centre. Apart from IT, Indian companies are moving to Virginia for opportunities in other sectors as well. Granules India - an Indian pharmaceutical manufacturing company based in Hyderabad – found its way to Fairfax County, Virginia. Similarly, Mumbai-based speciality packaging company, Essel Propack’s, has a manufacturing facility, in the city of Danville, he said. “It is indeed praiseworthy that besides bringing in the FDI our companies through their CSR initiatives, have been giving back to the local communities. They are supporting students particularly in STEM fields by collaborating with the US educational institutions and are focusing on upskilling and reskilling of workers,” he said. Indian companies have also been funding research and innovation activities in the US strengthening further the US knowledge economy, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-pandemic-did-not-stop-india-from-economic-reforms-taranjit-singh-sandhu-902201.html

15-10-2020||National||NBA hails BARC's temporary suspension of weekly ratings, calls for 'complete overhaul' of system||The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) on Thursday hailed as a "bold step" the decision of the Broadcast Audience Research Council to temporarily suspend weekly ratings of news channels, and urged the rating agency to completely overhaul its systems for restoring the credibility of the information it collects. Following the alleged fake Television Rating Points (TRP) scam, the BARC has stated that it intends to review and augment the current standards of measurement to improve on "statistical robustness", and the exercise will result in a "pause" in the weekly ratings for up to 12 weeks. The exercise would cover all Hindi, Regional, English News and Business News channels with immediate effect, BARC said. Reacting to the development, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) said it welcomes the decision of the BARC to suspend the measurement of television viewership ratings. In a statement, the NBA, which represents the news broadcasters, said it believes that the suspension is an "important step in the right direction". The NBA said BARC should use these 12 weeks to "completely overhaul" its systems and "restore the credibility" of the information it collects about "what India watches". NBA president Rajat Sharma said the recent revelations have brought "disrepute to the measurement agency and by extension the broadcast news media". "The corrupted, compromised, irrationally fluctuating data is creating a false narrative on 'what India watches' and has been putting pressure on our members to take editorial calls that run counter to the journalistic values and ideals of journalism," Sharma said. "The current atmosphere of toxicity, abuse and fake news is no longer tenable and NBA as the custodian and guardian of Indian broadcast media believes a bold step of putting ratings of news genre on hold will help in improving the content," he said. For many years, the NBA has been highlighting its concerns about the veracity of TV viewership data, which have been prone to irrational fluctuations, he said. Recent events have shown that there is much more at stake than just the measurement of news channels’ popularity, he said, adding that a healthy and vibrant TV news industry is vital to Indian democracy. "We expect that the period of suspension will be utilised to implement important reforms at BARC. To safeguard the integrity of viewership data, human intervention in its collection and processing must be totally eliminated," he said. Data security, including encryption and restricting access to key information, must be ensured, Sharma said. "Complaints, if any, should be dealt with in an independent and transparent manner. NBA also expects greater consultation and openness when important decisions are taken by BARC," he said. "We look forward to meaningful discussions and swift decisions which are in the interest of viewers, the industry and the public as a whole," Sharma said. NBA is the premier association of private news and current affairs broadcasters. At least five people have been arrested by the Mumbai Police which busted the scam earlier this month. Those arrested include news channel employees, while the police is also questioning executives of Arnab Goswami-led Republic Media Group with regard to the case. Republic Media Group has denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nba-hails-barcs-temporary-suspension-of-weekly-ratings-calls-for-complete-overhaul-of-system-902220.html
15-10-2020||National||SC notice to Centre on plea to regulate content on OTT platforms||The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice to the Centre on a plea for setting up an autonomous body or board to monitor and filter the "inappropriate and obscene" content and regulate the videos on various online platforms for viewers in the country. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian sought a response from the Union government's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, among others, in a PIL filed jointly by two advocates Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia. The petitioners pointed out that currently, there was no law or autonomous body governing the digital content made available to the public at large without any filter or screening resulting in abuse of artistic liberty. They claimed over 40 OTT (Over the Top) and video streaming platforms providing paid, ad-inclusive, and free content abused the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution. "No censoring allows exploitation of creative liberty and pushes for more ideas to get incorporated which in turn let writers, directors, and producers to experiment limitless due to which there has been more violence, sex scenes, obscene languages and even characters smoking on screen- that would normally be cut or displayed alongside health warnings," their plea stated. "Due to no monitoring body, the language of the contents has become more colloquial. Visuals and dialogues are crueler and more barbaric," they claimed. The petitioners further pointed out the Internet and Mobile Association of India had announced the formation of its Digital Content Complaints Council to address government and user complaints related to content on streaming platforms. However, several OTT and a streaming platform like Netflix, Amazon Prime, TVF Play, Yupp TV, Hungama Play, YouTube, and Facebook had given their dissent to sign the self-regulatory code. The petitioners said that the Defence Ministry had recently written to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) urging that production houses may be advised to obtain an NOC from it before the telecast of any film, documentary or web series on Army theme in the public domain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-to-regulate-content-on-ott-platforms-902238.html

He said that during the lockdown days he began getting in touch with friends and students and they started sharing various types of performances like music, poetry and mimicry on a WhatsApp group.

The Santosh Mitra Square Puja Committee, in a statement on Wednesday night, said it has decided to not allow any outsider to visit its marquee based on the Badrinath Temple to prevent the pandemic from assuming gigantic proportions after the puja. Only residents of adjacent wards, besides committee members, will be allowed to enter the puja compound after they exhibit identity proof, it said. "We are aware that this decision will be extremely painful for many people. But a festival cannot be bigger than human lives," the statement issued by the committee's president Pradip Ghosh and general secretary Sajal Ghosh said. The puja draws lakhs of visitors every year on all five days of the festival. Praising the state government for tackling the Covid- 19 crisis, the committee hoped other puja committees will also follow its lead, keeping in mind this year's pandemic situation and the threat of community transmission.

Javadekar flagged off 50 inspection teams of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for field visits in Delhi-NCR to keep a watch on pollution hot spots during the winter season even as a layer of smoky haze lingered over the region with the air quality hitting 'very poor' levels on Thursday. "Only 4 per cent pollution is due to stubble burning. Ninety-six per cent of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities, etc.," he told reporters at his residence in Delhi. Reacting to Javadekar's assertion, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal blamed him for "being in denial". Taking to Twitter, the chief minister sought to know why pollution has suddenly increased in Delhi-NCR in the last fortnight if stubble burning causes only 4 per cent pollution. "Staying in denial will not help. If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnite? Air was clean before that. Same story every yr. There’s no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike?," Kejriwal said in the tweet. Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha said the CPCB's own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44 per cent to the national capital's air pollution. "Central Pollution Control Board's own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44% to Delhi's air pollution. Ministry of Earth Sciences' SAFAR said at peak of stubble burning in Punjab & Haryana account for 44% of Delhi's pollution. What is Mr.Javadekar smoking?," Chadha said in a tweet. On Thursday, as the air quality in the region hit 'very poor' levels, stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). NASA's satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana. However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the capital's air quality was marginal. During the flagging off of 50 CPCB teams in the morning, Javadekar said his throat choked with the smoke from burning of crop residue during his visit to Ludhiana last year. "I appeal to the Punjab government to swing into action and curb stubble burning. I went to attend a programme in Ludhiana last year. On my way back, my throat choked due to the smoke from stubble burning even when I was in an air-conditioned car. It is harmful for everyone, including people living there. The Punjab government should ensure there is not much stubble burning this time," the minister said. Addressing the nodal officers of the CPCB teams, he said, "You will work for next two months and take note of all activities and complaints. You will inspect all factors. You have the right to file a report on your observations and strict action will be taken." The 50 CPCB teams will make extensive field visits from October 15 to February 28 next year and focus on hot spots where air pollution is aggravated, the environment ministry said. They will visit Delhi and NCR towns Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat in Haryana; and Bhiwadi, Alwar, Bharatpur in Rajasthan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/only-4-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-due-to-stubble-burning-says-javadekar-kejriwal-hits-back-902252.html

Initiating the blast through a virtual ceremony, Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Gadkari said it was a 'moment of pride' for India. Gadkari said the remodelling of the project will result in savings to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore to the public exchequer, without any compromise on safety, security and quality of the tunnel. He also expressed confidence that the work would be completed within the stipulated six-year period. The construction for the tunnel holds strategic importance as Zojila Pass, which is situated at an altitude of 11.578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway, is closed during winters owing to heavy snowfall, restricting movement. The project involves the construction of a 14.5 km-long tunnel at about 3,000 metres under the Pass on NH-1, conecting Srinagar through Drass and Kargil. Zojila Tunnel project shall bring to fruition 30 years of overwhelming public demand of Kargil, Drass and Ladakh regions, the statement said, adding that the project will make travel on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh section of NH-1 free from avalanches, enhance safety and reduce travel time significantly. The project was awarded to Megha Engineering & Infrastructure Ltf (MEIL), which had emerged as the lowest bidder, quoting Rs 4509.5 crore for the project. PM Narendra Modi had in May 2018 laid the foundation stone for the project, billed as Asia's longest bi-directional tunnel, in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-launches-1415-km-zojila-tunnel-construction-work-902271.html

To move from food security to nutrition security, the line ministries are expected to come together to form a common platform to determine common goals and strategy and synergise their actions accordingly, he said. "The different ministries can make critical interventions in primary production, food processing, their regulation with respect to wastage and issues of hygiene and end-consumption. Only then will 'Eat Right India' become a movement in its true sense,” he said. "A systems-based approach can ensure food safety along with their secure availability, promoting a healthy diet along with taking care of the environment through sustainable practices.” The other line ministries include the Women and Child Development Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry and the Ministries of Food, Fisheries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/eat-right-india-movement-harsh-vardhan-stresses-on-nutrition-security-902274.html

The move comes after the Lokpal witnessed an increasing number of complainants desirous of a "reconsideration" or "review" of the orders passed by it. A committee comprising three Lokpal members -- Justices Abhilasha Kumari, D K Jain and I P Gautam -- was constituted to look into the aspect of recommending a policy regarding requests for a review of an order passed by the bench. The committee, which was formed by Lokpal chairperson Pinaki Chandra Ghose, submitted its reports on October 6, 2020. "The committee has opined that in the absence of any express and substantive power of review in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, a request for review of an order passed by a bench of the Lokpal of India cannot be entertained,” said the order issued on Monday. Hence, it is notified that review petitions regarding an order passed by the bench of Lokpal of India will not be entertained, it said. The committee, in its report, said that the central government may be requested to consider the inclusion of power of review in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act. In view of the fact that a large number of complainants are filing applications for review of an order, the lack of an express power of review in the Act may act as a deterrent to the dispensation of justice, it said. "Therefore, in order to ensure that no injustice has occurred to the complainant and in the interest of justice, it may be in the fitness of things to request the government of India, at an appropriate stage, to consider the inclusion of the power of review on appropriate grounds, in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act 2013," the report said. The institution of Lokpal and Lokayuktas has been established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 to enquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries. The three-member committee, in its report, said that it is a settled position of law, that the power of review cannot be exercised by a statutory body unless the statute specifically confers such power. “The Act, as it stands, does not confer the power of review. In the absence of any statutory provision in the Act empowering the Lokpal of India to entertain an application for review, any such exercise under the garb of reconsideration/ clarification/ modification/correction of the order, would not be permissible in law,” it said. The jurisdiction of review can only be derived from the statute and thus, if any order of review is passed, in the absence of any statutory provision empowering the same, it would be a nullity, being without jurisdiction, said the panel, which had held its meeting on September 29, citing a Supreme Court order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lokpal-has-no-power-to-review-its-order-902281.html

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notices to the central government, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Internet and Mobile Association of India. “We will issue notice,” the apex court said while hearing the plea filed by advocates Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia seeking a proper board/institution /association for the monitoring and management of content on different OTT/Streaming and digital media platforms.  “With cinemas theatres unlikely to open anytime soon in the country, OTT/Streaming and different digital media platforms have surely given a way out for filmmakers and artists to release their content without being worried about getting clearance certificates for their films and series from the censor board,” the plea said. At present, however, there is no law or autonomous body governing the digital content to monitor and manage these digital contents and it is made available to the public at large without any filter or screening, it said. “Lack of legislation governing OTT/Streaming Platforms is becoming evident with each passing day and every new case that is filed on these grounds.  “The government is facing heat to fill this lacuna with regulations from the public and the Judiciary; still the relevant government departments have not done anything significant to regularise these OTT/Streaming Platforms,” the plea said. None of the OTT/Streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting since February 2020, it said. The ministry had earlier told the top court in a separate case that there is a need to regulate digital media and that the court may first appoint a committee of persons as amicus before laying down guidelines with respect to the regulation of hate speech in the media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-seeks-centres-response-on-pil-to-regulate-ott-platforms-902297.html

Raut said that he was shocked to know from a media report that Rajeshwari S, an elected president of Therku Thitthai Panchayat in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, was forced to sit on the floor during a meeting that she was presiding when the upper-caste panchayat members and vice president Mohan Rajan were sitting on chairs. “Rajan even didn't let her hoist the flag since she was elected as President of the Panchayat from a reserved seat last year,” Dr Raut said, adding that despite the laws banning social discrimination and untouchability, it was painful to learn that it was still practised in Tamil Nadu.  The senior Congressman from Vidarbha said he has learnt that the vice president allegedly didn't allow her to preside over the meeting as she belonged to the Adi Davidar community. “She belonged to SC and she was facing discrimination due to her being a Dalit. The viral video of her sitting on the floor despite being president has shocked the whole nation,” said Dr Raut.  He said that as a leader from the Dalit community and the national president of the SC Department of the AICC, he was pained to know the gross discrimination against Dalits in Tamil Nadu. The minister has written a letter to the Governor of Tamil Nadu in this regard and demanded action against the accused. Raut, who is Maharashtra's Energy Minister, stressed the need to immediately cancel the membership of the accused Panchayat members and to take immediate legal action against them. Writing to the Governor, he said that social discrimination was deeply entrenched in Tamil Nadu where scheduled caste people were discriminated against by the upper-caste people imposing severe restrictions on their lives and were deprived of their democratic rights. He has requested the Governor to ensure strict implementation of the SC/ ST Atrocities Act to prevent such events in the future and also launch social awareness campaigns to end discrimination against Dalits and women.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-demands-action-against-accused-who-made-dalit-sarpanch-in-tamil-nadu-sit-on-the-floor-didnt-let-her-hoist-flag-902299.html

The second batch of four Rafale jets is expected to arrive in India in the next four weeks. The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of these aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore. Several teams from the IAF have visited France since January to oversee the progress of the Rafale project including the integration of India-specific enhancements and weapons systems, the officials said. The IAF's Rafale project management team has an office in Paris headed by a Group Captain-rank officer. The team is tasked with overseeing the production timelines as well as coordinating training of the crew. A team of experts headed by assistant chief of air staff (projects) reached France earlier this week to coordinate logistical issues as well as training of pilots and technicians, said the officials. The first batch of Rafale jets was finally inducted into the IAF on September 10. Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on October 5 said the induction of all 36 Rafale jets will be completed by 2023. Ten Rafale jets have been delivered to India so far and five of them stayed back in France for imparting training to IAF pilots. Known for their air-superiority and precision strikes, the Rafale jets are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia. The newly inducted fleet has been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops are engaged in a bitter border row for over five months. A group of IAF pilots is currently undergoing training on Rafale jets at the Saint-Dizier airbase in eastern France.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/iaf-team-in-france-to-make-preparations-to-induct-more-rafale-jets-902301.html

He, however, said that Islamabad would be ready to hold talks with New Delhi only if the Government of India ended the military siege and stop human rights violations in Kashmir and release all political prisoners, who had been detained from the valley after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Government on August 5, 2019 moved to strip the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) of its special status and reorganise the state into two Union Territories. He also demanded that Kashmiris should be involved in the talks between India and Pakistan. New Delhi, however, dismissed any possibility of talks between India and Pakistan. Srivastava on Thursday accused Pakistan Prime Minister’s aide of commenting on internal matters of India. “As always, this is Pakistan’s effort to divert attention from domestic failures of the present government and mislead its domestic constituents by pulling India into headlines on a daily basis,” he said. “The official (Yusuf) is well advised to restrict his advice to his establishment and not to comment on India’s domestic policy. The statements made by him are contrary to facts on the ground, misleading and fictitious.” New Delhi once again alleged that Pakistan continued to support, aid and abet cross-border terrorism against India and had also been resorting to unprovoked ceasefire violations along the Line of Control to support infiltration of terrorists. Pakistan’s leadership continues to indulge in inappropriate, provocative and hate speech against India. “Such support to terrorism against India and use of derogatory and abusive language are not conducive to normal neighbourly relations,” said the MEA spokesperson. The formal talks between India and Pakistan to resolve outstanding disputes remained stalled since January 2013. The two sides had announced resumption of the bilateral dialogue a few days before Modi had visited Lahore on December 25, 2015 to greet the then Pakistan Prime Minister M Nawaz Sharif on his birthday and to take part in his granddaughter’s wedding ceremony. But the process had been derailed after a gang of terrorists sneaked into India from Pakistan and carried out an attack on the Indian Air Force base at Pathakot in Punjab on January 1, 2017. The troubled relations between New Delhi and Islamabad worsened further in 2019 – in the wake of the killing of 40 Central reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel in a terror attack at Pulwama in J&K on February 14 and then the Modi Government’s August 5 move.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-has-not-sent-any-message-to-pakistan-expressing-desire-for-talks-mea-902309.html

15-10-2020||National||DH Deciphers | What is Svamitva scheme and how will it help house owners in villages?||On October 11, Prime Minister Narendra Modi distributed property cards under the Svamitva scheme to villagers. The scheme was launched on April 24, and these property cards were prepared during the process that followed. The Svamitva cards have been dubbed the Aadhaar cards for properties in rural areas. Let's find out how they work:  What is Svamitva?  Svamitva is an acronym for Survey of Villages Abadi and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas. It's a Sanskrit word meaning ownership or possession. The initiative is fully funded by the central government. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj works with state departments of revenue and panchayati raj and the Survey of India to demarcate ‘abadi’ or inhabited areas in villages to create land records by using drone cameras. The process is spread over six stages: drone survey, inquiry process, property card preparation, chuna (lime powder) marking, data processing, generation of final maps and distribution of property cards.    Didn't such records exist earlier?  In British India, land records of cultivated land, including measurement maps, were prepared for the collection of revenue. But inhabited or residential lands in villages were not mapped, ostensibly because no revenue was expected from them. In the absence of legal documents, owners cannot leverage their properties to seek loans or financial assistance from banks. In most cases, the ownership of residential properties in villages (through sale or inheritance) is transferred with little legal documentation. More than paperwork, oral undertaking or possession is what matters the most.  How will Svamitva help? The scheme will create accurate land records for rural planning, give legal property rights to the household owner, support the preparation of better Gram Panchayat Development Plans by using GIS (Geographic Information System) maps and reduce property-related disputes and legal cases. It will also help determine property tax, which would go to the gram panchayat wherever allowed or to the state exchequer. The property card will also help villagers buy and sell property without getting into any dispute. It will also free villagers from the fear of their homes getting occupied or someone staking claim to a property by showing fake papers.  How many villages will be covered in this scheme? The government plans to cover all the 6.62 lakh villages in the country over the next four years. On October 11, 1.32 lakh house owners from 763 villages (346 from Uttar Pradesh, 221 from Haryana, 100 from Maharashtra, 50 from Uttarakhand, 44 from Madhya Pradesh and two from Karnataka) received the property cards. Around one lakh villages from these states will be covered over the next year.  How will a person access the property cards? State government officials (from the revenue or land records department) will physically hand over the Svamitva cards to owners. The cards can also be downloaded through a link sent via SMS to the household owner.  What details will be there in the card? Each card will carry details such as the unique property ID, ownership specifications, type of property, whether the residents are beneficiaries of government schemes such as old-age pension, widow pension or Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or Indira Awas Yojana. It would also have details such as whether any resident of the household has any disability, the BPL status of the household and the availability of drinking water. How will Svamitva help in the development of villages? With digital maps and accurate land records available, it would also help the village identify locations for setting up schools, hospitals, markets and other public facilities. It will also help in better management of gram panchayats with use of technology, much as the way municipalities and municipal corporations are managed.  Besides mapping individual rural property, the initiative will also survey and prepare GIS maps of community assets such as village roads, ponds, canals, open spaces, schools, anganwadi centres and health sub-centres. These maps would also help in the preparation of accurate work estimates for various development initiatives in villages.  What's the status in Karnataka?  In Karnataka, house owners from MG Palya and Basavapattana villages in Ramanagar district have received the property cards. The distribution of physical Svamitva cards has also begun in 83 villages in Ramanagar, Mysuru, Hassan, Belagavi and Tumakuru districts.  By March 2021, the government aims to distribute property cards in 16,600 villages in 16 districts: Belagavi, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Koppal, Dharwad, Gadag, Uttara Kannada, Davangere, Hassan, Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Mysuru, Ramanagar and Tumakuru. The remaining districts will be covered in the second phase that will begin in April 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-what-is-svamitva-scheme-and-how-will-it-help-house-owners-in-villages-902323.html

The worst affected state was Telangana, where excessive unseasonal rainfall on Wednesday and Thursday flooded its capital Hyderabad, home to major IT companies and startups such as Microsoft, Accenture, Amazon and TCS. In Telangana 30 people died, while in neighbouring western state of Maharashtra 10 people were killed because of wall collapses, electrocution and drowning in overflowing streams, officials from the two states said on Thursday. Authorities in Hyderabad declared a holiday on Thursday and asked residents to stay indoors. Daily life has been disrupted in Hyderabad as many parts of the city lost power in the flooding. Residents posted pictures on Twitter of floating cars, waterlogged homes, offices and streets. A few districts in Maharashtra state received more than 100 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours and the state, including its capital Mumbai, is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its daily forecast. The rains have damaged rice paddies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, while cotton, soybean and pulses were damaged in Maharashtra and Karnataka, traders said. "Soybean, pigeon peas and black matpe crops have been damaged just before harvesting. The quality of the harvested crop has also deteriorated," said Nitin Kalantri, a trader from Latur, in Maharashtra. Telangana and Maharashtra have so far in October received 143% and 78% more rainfall than normal respectively, according to data compiled by IMD.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/floods-kill-at-least-40-people-in-india-damage-crops-902324.html

I certainly do not want to prejudge it,” he said, in response to queries on the status of negotiation between the two nations to end the more-than-five-month-long stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. The senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA so far had seven rounds of talks, including the one they had on Monday. They had agreed during the sixth round of talks on September 21 to stop sending more troops to the scenes of the face-offs along the LAC – the de facto border between the two nations. They, however, could not yet reach an agreement on restarting the stalled process of mutually withdrawing the additional troops the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA already deployed along the LAC since the stand-off started in late April and early May. The diplomats of India and China also held five video conferences so far to discuss ways to resolve the stand-off. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart in the Chinese Government, Wei Fenghe, had a meeting on the side-line of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s summit in Moscow on September 4.

Some of the theatres that reopened held special screenings for Covid-19 warriors or staff members and their families. Sushant Singh Rajput's last theatrical release Chhichhore, Kedarnath, Tanhaji, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, Malang, War and Thappad are among films that have been re-released on the big screen since there are no new releases this week. PVR Naraina's first show was a special screening of Tapsee Pannu-starrer "Thappad" for 40 coronavirus warriors, including doctors and civil defence volunteers. The special screening was organised by the New Delhi District Magistrate's office. Similarly, at PVR Cinema at 3C's Mall in Lajpat Nagar, a special screening of "Tanhaji" was organised for the staff members and their families. The theatre will remain open for public from Friday onwards. "We have total three shows tomorrow onwards. Our first show will start at 12 pm for Dream Girl, followed by Tanhaji at 3.15 pm and at 6.30 pm we have a Punjabi movie (Sardarji). We are maintaining social distancing at every point here. We have demarcations at the ticket counters, inside the cinema halls, at entry as well as exit points," said Sandeep Singh, Cinema Manager of PVR Cinemas at 3C'S. "We are using the latest anti-microbial treatment to sanitise the halls. It was also used in sanitising all the touchpoints like door handles. Sanitiser dispensers have been placed at all major points inside and at the entry points of the cinema halls. We are also encouraging contact-less digital payments," he added. At Cinepolis cinema in Greater Kailash, only five tickets were sold for the 11.30 am show. Cinepolis Fun cinema at V3S mall in Nirman Vihar, PVR Cinema at EDM Mall in Kaushambi, Eros cinema in Jangpura, and Cinepolis Karkadooma were among the theatres that remained closed.  Owner of Milan Cinema Ravinder Gupta said that it was very difficult to reopen the hall. "My single screen hall has accumulated lakhs of rupees in dues due to pending fixed charges of electricity in the past eight months. Also, due to Covid-19, no new releases are there to attract the audience," he said. Ushering in a new era of movie watching, the Union government allowed multiplexes, cinema halls, and theatres to reopen from Thursday within the framework of a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs). The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) left it to states to take a final call on the matter. The SOPs mandated by the Union government include one seat distance in halls, 50 per cent capacity, masks at all times, proper ventilation, and air conditioner temperature settings at above 23 degrees Celsius. Many cinema halls shut down even before the nationwide lockdown came into effect from March 25 and managements are hoping desperately to get back to work. In Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called a meeting of theatre owners on Wednesday to discuss arrangements before they reopen their doors to the public.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/first-day-few-shows-majority-cinema-halls-in-delhi-remain-closed-902376.html

"It is our solemn duty that a correct picture is sent across to viewers who depend on these channels for the credibility of information not realising that these channels are indulging in corrupt and criminal malpractices to push partisan agenda as journalism. The freedom of speech cannot give protection to the commission of crime," she said. She emphasised the need to urgently devise methods to ensure transparency and seek opinions from various stakeholders so as to ensure applicability. The investigations by Mumbai Police has revealed an "insidious manipulation" of Television Rating Points (TRP) by certain channels and it raises serious questions on the credibility and independence of the media, she said. "The advertisement industry allocated their media budget on the basis of this information, which is seen in the direct correlation between TRP and advertising revenue estimated to be between Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 crore. If the TRP itself is found to be manipulated, it raises concerns on the authenticity of the entire system," Chaturvedi said. "As TRPs are manipulated and a toxic version of news presentation gains currency, it also affects the financial sustainability of other media houses which do not indulge in such practices," she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-should-ensure-transparency-in-tv-rating-system-sena-mp-902380.html

In a writ petition, Pendyala Hemalatha claimed that Rao's continued custody amounted to "cruel and inhuman treatment", violating his right to liberty and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. "Although the petitioner’s husband may have tested negative for Covid-19, after being admitted in Nanavati hospital, there is every possibility of reinfection as is now known to medical science," the petition filed by advocate Sunil Fernandes stated. She said that her husband was in an extreme state of ill health and is entitled to the love and solace of family members in Hyderabad, particularly of her. She pointed out that Rao was hospitalised on May 27 but he was hurriedly discharged on June 2, while his bail plea on the ground of his medical problems and Covid-19 was pending, despite the fact that he needed constant follow up. "What is being sought is only a temporary bail on health grounds and her earlier apprehension is that Rao may also get infected by Covid-19 turned out to be true, while he was admitted for the second time in J J Hospital and then shifted to St George Hospital and then to Nanavati Hospital," the petition said. Maintaining that the chance of commencement of trial in the immediate future is bleak and charges are yet to be framed, she pointed out there is no bar to grant bail on health grounds under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act or the National Investigation Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/varavara-raos-wife-moves-sc-seeking-bail-for-him-in-elgar-parishad-case-902382.html

It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous,” the CBI said in a brief statement. Over the last couple of days, there have been reports suggesting that the CBI was wrapping up the case and is set to file a closure report. The CBI has been investigating the case after it was handed over to the apex agency at the request of the Bihar government that had registered an FIR based on the complaint filed by Sushant’s father Krishna Kishore Singh, who had blamed the actor’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty for his death and swindling off Rs 14 crore from his account. Apart from the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have conducted separate probes into the case. On June 14, the day Sushant’s body was found in his duplex rented accommodation in Mumbai and an autopsy was conducted at the Dr RN Cooper Hospital, the Bandra police station had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR). The Supreme Court had later concurred and formally transferred the case to the CBI. It, however, had not doubted the investigations into the case by the Mumbai Police. After the CBI took over the case, Rhea had filed an FIR against Sushant’s sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, which the Maharashtra government forwarded to the CBI. The All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) has ruled out any foul play and concurred that Sushant died by hanging and was not strangulated or poisoned.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/reports-on-sushant-singh-rajput-case-conclusion-speculative-and-erroneous-probe-still-on-says-cbi-902383.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah interpreted the definition of the shared household to give wider meaning to it in the 2005 law for a woman who "resigns her fate to the never-ending cycle of enduring violence and discrimination as a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother, a partner or a single woman in her lifetime." Observing that the 2005 law was a "milestone for the protection of women" covering even those outside the marriage, the court said, "The definition of shared household given in Section 2(s) cannot be read to mean that it can only be that household which is of the joint family of which husband is a member or in which husband of the aggrieved person has a share." The top court declared that a previous decision in 'S R Batra and Another Vs Taruna Batra' case, (2007) did not lay down the correct law. The two-judge bench had then held that the wife is entitled only to claim a right to residence in a shared household, which would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or the house which belonged to the joint family of which the husband is a member. The court said the progress of any society depends on its ability to protect and promote the rights of its women. Guaranteeing equal rights and privileges to women by the Constitution had marked the step towards the transformation of the status of the women in this country," it said. Going through the provisions of 2005 law, the bench said the statute granted entitlement in favour of the woman of the right of residence under the shared household irrespective of her having any legal interest in the property or not. In a judgement on a petition filed by Satish Chander Ahuja, the court said the 2005 law was passed to give a higher right in favour of the woman.  "We, thus, are of the considered opinion that shared household is where the aggrieved woman was living at the time when the application was filed or in the recent past had been excluded from the use or she is temporarily absent," the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/woman-can-seek-residence-in-households-shared-by-husbands-relatives-sc-902384.html

Addressing an online question and answer session, WHO's Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said there would be at least one effective vaccine by 2021 but it would be available "only in limited quantities". "Most people agree, it's starting with healthcare workers, and frontline workers, but even there, you need to define which of them are at highest risk, and then the elderly, and so on," Swaminathan said on prioritising who gets the vaccine first. "There will be a lot of guidance coming out, but I think an average person, a healthy young person might have to wait until 2022 to get a vaccine," she said. She said no one has produced these vaccines in the volumes that are going to be needed. "So in 2021 we will have vaccines but they will be in limited quantities so we worked on a framework that how the countries will prioritise on whom to give those vaccines," she said. "People tend to think that on the first of January or the first of April, I'm going to get the vaccine, and then things will be back to normal. It's not going to work like that," Swaminathan added. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday said that India is expected to have a Covid-19 vaccine from more than one source by early next year and the government is formulating distribution strategies for the immunisation of people across the country. He had also said the Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, covering 20-25 crore people, by July next year. On Sunday, the minister said considering the large population size of India, one vaccine or vaccine manufacturer will not be able to fulfil the requirements of vaccinating the entire country and added that the government is open to assessing the feasibility of introducing several Covid-19 vaccines in the country in accordance with their availability.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/healthy-people-might-have-to-wait-till-2022-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-who-902393.html

Key accused in the case, Swapna Suresh and Sarith P S, both former employees of UAE consulate in Kochi, withdrew their bail plea as the Customs initiated a one year preventive detention steps against them using provisions of COFEPOSA on Wednesday. All those who got bail were either those who invested in the smuggling or those who were involved in selling the smuggled gold. In order to establish the terror links to the case registered under UAPA, NIA stated before the court that it suspected that 13th accused Sharafudeen K T was close with fifth accused Ramees and they travelled together to Tanzania from where Ramees smuggled gold. NIA suspected that Rameez might have some connection with Dawood as a person named Firoz Oasis, a south Indian, is known to be in his company. According to NIA's statement before the court opposing bail, fifth accused Ramees revealed that he had attempted to start diamond business in Tanzania and that later he had attempted to obtain gold mining licence in Tanzania and had also brought gold from Tanzania and sold in UAE. The narrative summary of Dawood issued by United Nations Security Council sanctions committee regarding Al-Qaeda and ISIS-associated individuals and entities besides the fact sheet published by US department of treasury on Dawood specifically mentioned abut his activities in Africa. Recent news reports also specifically mentioned about Dawood's diamond business in Tanzania, managed by his associate 'Feroz', considered as a south Indian by intelligence agencies. Thirteenth accused Sharafudheen had travelled to Africa with Ramees, said the NIA report. Considering this the NIA denied bail to Sharafuddin as well as 12th accused Muhammad Ali who was a member of the PFI and was earlier charge-sheeted in a case pertaining to chopping the palm of a professor in Kerala, but was later acquitted by court. Seven accused Mohammed Shafi was also denied bail. Around 30 persons were so far arraigned in the case, of which 21 were taken into custody by NIA, while six were in UAE.

It will be the first submarine of the Myanmarese Navy which has been ramping up cooperation with the Indian Navy in the last few years. "Cooperation in the maritime domain is a part of our diverse and enhanced engagement with Myanmar. In this context, India will be delivering a kilo class submarine INS Sindhuvir to the Myanmar Navy," Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing. The announcement came days after Chief of Army Staff General MM Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla travelled to Myanmar on a two-day visit during which they held talks with the top military and political brass of the country including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. "We understand that this will be the first submarine of the Myanmar Navy. This is in accordance with our vision of SAGAR – Security and Growth for All in the Region, and also in line with our commitment to building capacities and self-reliance in all our neighbouring countries," Srivastava said. Myanmar is one of India's strategic neighbours and shares a 1,640-kilometre-long border with a number of northeastern states including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur. In the last few years, both sides have been ramping up maritime security cooperation. Kilo-class refers to diesel-electric attack submarines that were designed and built in the erstwhile Soviet Union. The Indian Navy regularly interacts with the Myanmarese Navy through staff talks, joint working group meeting on maritime cooperation and other operational interactions which include port visits, coordinated patrols and bilateral exercises.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-deliver-kilo-class-submarine-to-myanmar-902404.html
15-10-2020||National||India is about to find out what happens when Covid-19 meets toxic air||As a thick quilt of smog wrapped itself around New Delhi on Thursday, signalling the start of the fall pollution season, doctors and scientists warned that the deteriorating air quality could make the city’s Covid-19 problems even worse. One of the most common symptoms of severe coronavirus cases is breathing difficulty. And doctors say that if the ambient air suddenly becomes more toxic, as it does every year around this time in northern India, then more people who become infected by the virus might end up in the hospital or die. “If two people are shooting at the lungs, then obviously the lungs will have more problems,” said Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon and founder of the Lung Care Foundation in New Delhi, a group that raises awareness about respiratory problems. India is now struggling with two major health challenges that are both assaulting the respiratory system and peaking at the same time. Coronavirus cases are spreading far and wide, putting the country on track to have the largest reported virus caseload in the coming weeks. With 7.3 million reported infections, it is just behind the United States’ 7.9 million. And each day, India outpaces the United States in new infections by around 10,000 more cases per day, even as India’s death rate remains much lower. In the background is India’s vexing air pollution, which shoots up in the fall and winter. The rapid economic growth of the past two decades — and along with it, increased urbanization and congestion — has left Indian cities horribly polluted. Last year, India was once again home to 14 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air globally, and health experts have detailed how such conditions can lead to brain damage, respiratory problems and early death. In the fall, air temperatures and wind speeds drop, condensing pollutants over India’s cities, especially in the north. And farmers in the surrounding rural areas burn the stalks and refuse from their crop, sending up huge clouds of black smoke that drift for miles. This year there have been five times the number of farm refuse fires in northern India as the same period last year, and experts say it is a bad sign of what’s to come. The agricultural sector has been a rare bright spot an Indian economy that has been shattered by the pandemic, and pollution experts fear that more farming will mean more burning. “My gut is it’s going to be a bumper, bumper harvest and a bumper, bumper combustion event, probably the biggest of our lifetime,” said Jai Dhar Gupta, an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur. “And now that you’ve got the combined impact of a respiratory virus and respiratory contaminants, every public health specialist is holding their breath to see what happens,” Gupta said. “We’re just sitting ducks.” Doctors say long-term exposure to severely polluted air can cause chronic lung inflammation, which can leave people who are exposed to the coronavirus more vulnerable. A recent study from Italy found a correlation between long-term exposure to dirty air and an increase in excess mortality — a measure of deaths above normal — from the coronavirus. “Pollution-afflicted areas will have a higher incidence of Covid,” said Kumar, the chest surgeon. “And once this population gets Covid, they then have a higher chance of mortality.” Up until now, people in New Delhi this year had been spoiled in terms of breathable air. When a coronavirus lockdown in the spring shut down many industries and kept cars off the road, Delhi’s skies turned a miraculous blue. It was the cleanest air in decades, and at night, residents felt as if they were being treated to a star show. Constellations that hadn’t been seen for years shone above the apartment blocks. But that has become a dim memory. The sky is back to its usual hazy brown, and the city now smells of smoke. The Delhi government is doing more this year to fight pollution, including setting up a war room to track pollution hot spots and turning to anti-smog guns that blast mist into the air to knock down the dust. On Thursday, officials in Delhi, which is controlled by a progressive opposition political party, got locked into a blame game with national politicians who are part of the right-leaning administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Delhi officials blamed the Modi government for not doing enough to stop crop burning in the states that ring the capital. Modi administration officials argued that crop burning contributed only a minuscule amount to overall air pollution, and they blamed the Delhi government for not doing enough to control dust. Many more people in India’s cities are donning masks these days because of the pandemic, but experts say this probably won’t help much. Most people wear cloth masks or surgical-type masks that don’t seal well and won’t stop someone from inhaling small pollution particles (or the virus, either). Pollution alerts whizzed around the city via WhatsApp messages Thursday. “Delhi pollution level reported hazardous. 335,” read one message, referring to an Air Quality Index reading of 335, about six times as bad as that of New York City. The message continued: “Be Careful. Seniors don’t go out. Wear mask.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-is-about-to-find-out-what-happens-when-covid-19-meets-toxic-air-902408.html
15-10-2020||National||Next one month challenging but cinemas will bounce back: PVR Ltd JMD Sanjeev Bijli||The next month will be a little challenging but the movie business will bounce back by Diwali as filmmakers start releasing new films, PVR Ltd Joint Managing Director Sanjeev Bijli said on Thursday as cinemas opened in several parts of the country after seven months. While theatres and multiplexes opened in several places, including Delhi, parts of Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat with stringent dos and don’ts in keeping with the new COVID-19 normal, they remain closed in states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Chhattisgarh.           The next two weeks will be a trial run, Bijli said as theatre establishments put in place standard operating procedures like alternate seating, 50 per cent capacity, packaged snacks, thermal checks, and deep sanitising. While some theatres began commercial operations from Thursday, Bijli said they dedicated the day to the PVR family that stood by them for the long months since March that cinemas were shut and to Covid-19 warriors such as doctors, nurses, and policemen. There are no new films being released for the moment and theatre chains are running old films. “There’s nothing like watching a new film when you come to the cinemas but at the same time, we are just happy that we have opened. I think the next two weeks will be a trial run for us,” Bijli told PTI. “We have some festivals lined up as well as a couple of new movies in English and regional languages. So it’s not like there is a dearth of new content but it’s not the blockbuster variety,” he added. Big releases like “83” and “Sooryavanshi” are now releasing by Christmas or New Year, but Bijli said they have new content lined up for November. “By the time we hit November, pre-Diwali, we hope to have some big films come out. Again not massive like ‘Sooryavanshi’ or ‘83’, which I believe are now going to come during the Christmas… but even now we have new releases like ‘Bunty Aur Babli’ and ‘Sandeep Aur Pinky Farrar’, ‘Tenet’, ‘David Copperfield”, lots of Tamil films, Bengali and Punjabi movies, so there is new content,” he said. Citing the unpredictable nature of the entertainment business, he said any of the new releases could become a surprise hit. “A small film on paper might actually resonate with audiences and become a mini hit... the next one month or so will be a little challenging but so be it. By then, other states will also open and we will start the machinery from then,” he added. With cinemas shut for seven months, many filmmakers chose to premiere their new films on OTT platforms. This led to some apprehension in the industry that people, already fearful of enclosed spaces in the time of a pandemic, might change their movie-watching habits. But Bijli is not concerned and said he believes it is hard to replace the experience of watching movies on the big screen. “Big screen is an experience. Things have not changed dramatically as far as air travel is concerned and restaurants and hotels are concerned. Every industry has now bounced back or is bouncing back or has gone to 60-70 per cent of pre-pandemic time… “The same is true for cinemas. They have a special place in the hearts of consumers. It is experiential and you cannot duplicate it at home.  We put so much effort and love in building those cinemas with the technology, screen, sound and service, and food. It is an industry that’s bound to bounce back,” he added. The challenges notwithstanding, Bijli said he is grateful that cinemas have finally been allowed to open. “First of all I would like to express my gratitude to MHA, the PMO office, and all the states, including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who has allowed us to open the cinemas in the city. It has been seven long months since the cinemas have been shut. This is the longest that we have been shut in our entire life… just grateful that we are finally allowed to open.”    Asked whether theatres had started release negotiations with producers, Bijli said nobody has announced release dates yet apart from one or two smaller movies.          “I think these are just conjectures... that when are the new films coming from Reliance, Yashraj, and T-Series. We know their line-up but I think everyone is waiting for Maharashtra to open up and then they will start discussing the dates and terms,” he added. The pandemic affected every walk of life and most businesses but Bijli said the takeaway has been to keep the faith, stay strong, connected with everyone, and keep the faith. “We never knew how long this pandemic was going to be, we still don’t know. Our cinemas were shut but we were still in touch with our PVR families, ensuring there was enough work and more for everybody even when the cinemas were shut.”   Bijli said PVR cinemas had taken all the precautions to ensure that its theatres are a safe place to come to. “All the SOPs have been followed and our consumers’ safety and security is very critical to us,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/next-one-month-challenging-but-cinemas-will-bounce-back-pvr-ltd-jmd-sanjeev-bijli-902409.html

Amid a row over an alleged TRP scam, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology was briefed on the issue and other related matters by Press Council of India (PCI) Chairman Justice C K Prasad, Information and Broadcasting Ministry Secretary Amit Khare and other senior officials. The panel, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, met "to hear the views of the representatives of News Broadcasters Association, Press Council of India and Prasar Bharati on the subject 'Ethical Standards in Media Coverage'", among other matters. Sources in the panel said an elaborate and comprehensive discussion was held on fake news, the alleged TRP scam and issues related to media regulation in the current era of convergent technology. To specific questions, officials told the panel members that the current system to ascertain TRP is "not very scientific and accurate", sources said. The officials suggested that the existing system is outdated and prone to manipulation. Also, it doesn't give an actual picture of viewership as the number of data collection points is very low. Sources said the panel members, however, didn't mention any specific channel during its proceedings. The Mumbai Police has recently claimed to have busted the TRP scam and arrested at least five people in this connection. Those arrested include news channel employees. The police is also questioning executives of Arnab Goswami-led Republic Media Group with regard to the case. Republic Media Group has denied any wrongdoing. As the controversy surrounding the alleged scam grew, the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), which provides TRP data, on Thursday announced a temporary suspension of weekly ratings of news channels across languages. The council intends to review and augment the current standards of measurement to improve on "statistical robustness", and the exercise will result in a "pause" in the weekly ratings for up to 12 weeks, an official statement said. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) has welcomed BARC's decision and urged it to completely overhaul its systems for restoring the credibility of the information it collects.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/existing-trp-system-not-very-scientific-and-is-prone-to-manipulation-parliamentary-panel-told-902416.html

She maintained that IAF gave her an opportunity to serve the nation, including in the Kargil War and she will forever remain grateful for the opportunities given to her by the force. Saxena made the submissions in her affidavit in a suit filed by the Centre seeking a decree of permanent injunction against the Netflix, Dharma Productions and others from broadcasting or releasing in theatres or any other digital platform the film Gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl, without grant of no-objection certificate (NOC) from it. According to the Centre, the film which was streaming on Netflix, depicts the IAF in poor light and dents its image as it shows that the force is gender-biased, which is not correct. Saxena, in her affidavit filed before Justice Rajiv Shakdher, clarified that the movie is not a documentary but is only inspired by her life and it is clear from the two disclaimers placed at the beginning of the film which gives a message to motivate young women to join IAF. “The Deponent (Saxena) does not claim that everything that is shown in the movie has happened with her in her real life. However, the deponent believes that the message sought to be conveyed through the movie is to motivate young women to join the Indian Air Force and, on a broader canvas, the aim is to inspire young women to pursue their dreams, not to doubt themselves and to work hard towards their goals,” she said in the affidavit filed through advocate Aditya Dewan. She added that while she has no control over the exercise of ‘creative liberties’ during the making of the movie, “It remains as fact that in so far as the deponent is concerned, at an institutional level, the deponent has not faced any discrimination on the basis of her gender. The IAF rather gave the deponent an opportunity to serve the nation, including in the Kargil War.” The retired officer said she has the utmost respect for IAF and cannot comment on the Centre of the force’s perception about the movie in question as everybody's perception is different. The high court had earlier issued notices and sought response of Dharma Productions Private Limited, which produced the film, its directors Karan Yash Johar and Hiroo Yash Johar, CEO Apporva Mehta, Zee Entertainment, director of the movie Sharan Sharma, Netflix Entertainment Services India LLP, M/s Netflix and Gunjan Saxena on the Centre's suit to remove the movie from all OTT platforms.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Facebook, submitted that there are already two petitions pending before the top court in connection with WhatsApp's payment service. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing WhatsApp, said that WhatsApp had previously submitted that payment services will not be rolled out before complying with the requirements. "There is apprehension that the regime of payments will commence before the regulatory framework is put in place," the bench said, adding concerns raised in this petition were different. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing Viswam, submitted before the bench that the RBI in April 2018 had issued an order asking these foreign entities to ensure data transacted on their platforms are secured in a server within India. Divan added that this direction was supposed to be complied by October 2018, but it was not done. "The RBI and the NPCI have permitted the three members of the Big Four tech giants, i.e., Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta Phase), to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and inspite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations," said the plea. Divan claimed WhatsApp stored data with its parent company Facebook, which had servers located outside India.  The plea sought direction from the top court to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that WhatsApp is not permitted to launch full-scale operations of "WhatsApp Pay" in India, without fulfilling all legal compliances to the satisfaction of the court regarding the requisite regulatory compliances. Viswam claimed WhatsApp had a grey history of compromised data and security breaches, making it as not a viable option for running payment services.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-facebook-google-on-protection-of-upi-transactions-902436.html
15-10-2020||National||SC seeks Centre's response on plea for use of 'plain English' in court matters for laymen||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought a response from Centre on a plea for use of plain English in legal documents to enable even laymen to understand the law and procedure for assertion of rights and redressal of grievances under the law. As petitioner Subhash Vijayran started saying, "May I please your lordships," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said "Speak correct English. You should say 'may it please'. We don't want anyone to please us." The Chief Justice also cited book by Bryan Garner on using plain language, saying "we have read this book too". Advocate Vijayran said the writing of most Lawyers is wordy, unclear, pompous and dull, as they use eight words, instead of two, to say something. "We use arcane phrases to express commonplace ideas. Seeking to be precise, we become redundant. Seeking to be cautious, we become verbose. Our writing is teemed with legal jargon and legalese. And the story goes on", the plea said. It pointed out as a consequence of this complexity, the common man neither understands the system nor the laws. "Everything is so complicated and confusing. The way laws are enacted, practiced and administered in our country violates the fundamental rights of the masses by denying them --access to justice," it added. In many countries, laws mandate that public agencies use plain language to increase access to programs and services. The PIL argues that the legislature should enact precise and unambiguous laws, and in plain language. "A guide in plain English and in vernacular of the laws of general public interest should be issued by the government, explaining the law and its application - in easy to understand language," it said. The petitioner also contended lawyers need to put in extra efforts to make their pleadings clear, crisp, concise and accurate. There should be a page limit for pleadings and time limit for oral arguments. He also sought a direction to Bar Council of India to introduce a mandatory subject of "Legal Writing in Plain English" in all law course.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-seeks-centres-response-on-plea-for-use-of-plain-english-in-court-matters-for-laymen-902438.html

New Delhi also not-so-subtly hinted that if Beijing wanted it to stick to the "One-China" policy of not recognising Taiwan as a separate nation and to refrain from commenting on the situation in Hong Kong or Xinjiang or Tibet autonomous regions of China, it should also respect India’s sovereignty on J&K, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. “The Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are, and would remain an integral part of India. China has no locus standi to comment on India's internal matters,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), said.  “Our position on Arunachal Pradesh has also been made clear several times. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India,” he added. His comment came two days after Beijing objected to New Delhi’s move to step up construction of infrastructure closer to the India-China border in J&K, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. Beijing on Tuesday stated that New Delhi’s move to step up construction of infrastructure and deployment of troops in India-China border areas was the “root cause” of tension between the two neighbouring nations. It also reiterated that China did not recognise Ladakh as a Union Territory and Arunachal Pradesh as a state of India. The statement by Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese Government, came a day after India officially unveiled 44 new bridges built closer to India’s borders with Pakistan and China. The bridges remotely inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh included eight each in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh –the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the McMahon Line, which serve as the de facto boundary between India and China in the western and eastern sectors respectively in the absence of a settled border. Ten more bridges were built closer to the India-China boundary in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.   The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are currently engaged in a military stand-off along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.  New Delhi on Thursday stated that it had conveyed its position on J&K, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh to Beijing “on several occasions, including at the highest level”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-has-no-locus-standi-to-comment-on-jk-ladakh-says-india-902446.html

Be prepared to be masked up for the entire duration in the auditorium. Fortunately, artistes on stage will be exempt from wearing masks but have been advised to maintain adequate physical distance during longer acts, musical, dance, or other cultural performances. The Centre on Thursday issued guidelines for cultural programs as India took further steps to emerge from the stringent lockdown imposed to fight Covid-19. Occupancy in auditoria or closed performance spaces will be 50% of the total capacity but subject to a ceiling of 200 persons “Strictly no entry without a mask. Visitors, patrons, and audience members must wear proper masks covering the nose and mouth at all times,” the guidelines said adding that the management should ask any person flouting the rules to leave the venue.  The guidelines “encourage” artists to prepare at least a part of their get-up, including costume, hairstyle, make-up, at their residence to ensure minimum support in the green rooms. They also advise all external artists and crew members, including those engaged in providing lighting, sound, make-up, costumes among others, to present a valid Covid-19 negative test result to relevant authorities at the host institution. “The test should have been conducted within seven days prior to the event. Management/creative agency may provide a mobile testing unit at the venue if feasible,” the guidelines said. For the stage, the guidelines state that the sets and properties in theatrical productions may be kept at a minimum with few changes, to avoid movement and crowding on stage. The guidelines state that all artists and staff should be encouraged to carry food from home if possible and to maintain physical distancing at eating points/cafeteria. It also stated that packaged food may be provided to crew and artists who require meals. For better management of the crowd, the guidelines suggest staggering of performance timings to ensure that the timing of commencement, intermission, and end do not overlap with other performance at any other auditorium at the same venue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/do-part-make-up-costumes-at-residence-guidelines-for-cultural-performances-902462.html

Five intern doctors are sitting on an indefinite hunger strike, while 40 others are on indefinite strike at the SMS medical college in Jaipur. President, All Rajasthan Intern Doctor Association, Dr. Vinay Prakash Sharma said an intern or junior resident is given a stipend of Rs 7,000 per month and there has been no increase in this amount for many years.   “The amount is lowest if compared to other states. Interns are getting up to Rs 30,000 stipend in other states but the amount is just 7,000 in Rajasthan which should be increased to 30,000 per month,” he said. Sharma said that there are 1,350 MBBS interns in 8 government medical colleges in Rajasthan and nearly 50 are participating in the dharna and the rest are on work. He said that interns should also get a hazardous work incentive for COVID-19 duty. “We do not want patients to suffer therefore a group representing all the junior residents is on dharna and other junior residents are on work. So far, there is no response from the government side and if the situation remains like this, our agitation will continue indefinitely,” Sharma said. He said the association has been raising the demand for several months but the government did not any action taken in this matter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jaipur-intern-doctors-stage-protest-over-stipend-902470.html
15-10-2020||National||TB notification falls sharply due to Covid-19 factors||Between April and August, India’s tuberculosis notification fell sharply every month due to Covid-19 related factors, compounding the worries for those who battle India’s number one killer disease. As per a government rule, every case of TB needs to be reported to the Union Health Ministry through a notification process for accurate estimation of the disease burden so that the government can arrange adequate diagnostic facilities and medicine. This process was hit hard by the pandemic. Compared to last year, there was 63% less notification in April and 47% in May. The situation improved a bit in June (25% shortfall) but declined again in July and August with a shortfall of 37% and 42% respectively. In September, the notification was still 27% less than that of 2019 according to a Central TB division dataset. However, because of the positive trends seen in January and February, an average over the past nine months shows a 28% shortfall masking the severity of the issue. This is what had been disclosed by the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in August when he admitted the 26% fall in the notification.  But if one leaves out January and February from the calculations the drop in the TB notification is a worrisome 37%. A study carried out by researchers at Yenepoya Medical College, Mangaluru had earlier estimated a 59% reduction in TB case detection between March and May and a 19.5% increase in TB deaths. In absolute terms, it would mean an additional 1.85 lakh TB cases and nearly 88,000 more TB deaths in 2020, they reported in a paper published inthe Indian Journal of Tuberculosis. The drop in TB notification due to Covid-19 factors came as a double whammy to the Indian public health system, which still had no clue on how to find out more than 200,000 missing TB patients who don’t show up in the government reporting system, public health officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tb-notification-falls-sharply-due-to-covid-19-factors-902473.html

Congress president Sonia Gandhi had constituted the CEA while carrying out an organisational reshuffle on September 11. At the meeting of the Congress Working Committee on August 24, Sonia had told the party to look for a new party chief as she had agreed to carry out the responsibility only for an interim period.  Sonia had returned as Congress president in August last year after Rahul Gandhi stepped down from the post owning responsibility for the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/central-election-authority-of-congress-discuss-logistics-for-internal-polls-902088.html

An editorial in the party mouthpiece Saamana launched a stinging attack on Koshyari (78) who recently wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on reopening places of worship and asked if the Sena leader had "suddenly turned secular." The editorial said the BJP has been "exposed" on this issue. Using the Governor's office to attack the state government has proved costly for the opposition party in Maharashtra, it added. Restaurants have opened with strict Covid-19 safety protocol, but reopening temples will see crowding, it said. If the BJP wants temples to reopen, then there should be a national policy, it said. Several important temples in the country are closed, it added. The editorial justified the chief minister's response to Koshyari's letter. "Even the gods must be ringing the temple bells in happiness," it said. If the sound of ringing bells has reached Modi and Shah, then they will recall the Governor to preserve the prestige of Raj Bhavan," the editorial said. Koshyari and Thackeray are locked in a bitter war of words after the former pushed for reopening of places of worship in the state closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the latter whether he has suddenly turned secular. Thackeray responded to Koshyari's letter saying he will consider the request but asserted he does not need the governor's certificate for "my Hindutva" even as BJP workers held protests outside temples in various cities in the state demanding reopening of places of worship. NCP president Sharad Pawar also waded into the row between the two constitutional functionaries and wrote to Modi expressing shock over the "intemperate language" used in the governor's missive to the chief minister. The spat erupted after Koshyari wrote a letter to Thackeray about representations received by his office demanding the reopening of places of religious worship, shut since March-end in view of the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. In his letter on Monday, Koshyari told Thackeray it is "ironical that while on one hand, the state government permitted the opening of bars, restaurants and beaches, our gods and goddesses have been condemned to stay in the lockdown." Responding to the letter, Thackeray on Tuesday wrote to the governor, saying the state government will consider his request to reopen these places. The chief minister said a decision on reopening places of worship, a demand being vociferously made by the opposition BJP, will be taken after careful consideration of the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra, which tops among states in the number of cases and deaths. In his letter, whose tone and contents evoked criticism from ruling allies the Congress and the NCP as well, Koshyari had mentioned that he has received three representations from delegations demanding that places of religious worship be reopened. In response, Thackeray pointed out the 'coincidence' that all the three letters Koshyari mentioned were from BJP office-bearers and supporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-asks-pm-narendra-modi-amit-shah-to-recall-maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-over-secular-remark-902273.html

After a meeting with representatives of the two parties, Congress state unit president Ripun Bora told reporters that all the Left parties have in-principle agreed to contest the polls together. The Congress also held a meeting with the CPI(M) on October 8, when the two parties announced that they would fight the elections together to defeat the BJP-led government. "The BJP is the biggest threat to Assam and Assamese people today. The need of the hour is to unite all anti-BJP forces to defeat their communal and corrupt governance," Bora said. The meeting was attended by Debabrata Saikia, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and Rakibul Hussain of the Congress, CPI state secretary Munin Mahanta, CPI (ML) Assam unit secretary Rubul Sarma and other leaders of the three parties. Another opposition party, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has already agreed to join the proposed 'Grand Alliance', A new regional entity 'Anchalik Gana Morcha' (AGM) floated by Rajya Sabha member Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, who was supported by the Congress and the AIUDF, has also consented to be in the opposition grouping. The election to the 126-member Assam Assembly is likely to be held in March-April next year. The 2016 elections gave a fractured mandate and no party has got absolute majority. In the current House, the BJP is the single largest party with 60 MLAs, while its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF) have 14 and 12 lawmakers respectively. The ruling coalition also has the support of an Independent MLA.

Now, after a month, we can’t provide it,” said chief medical superintendent of the hospital, Indra Veer Singh.  Singh added that the hospital would have saved the footage if someone had asked them to.  “Previous footage gets deleted every seven days and new footage gets recorded over it,” said Singh, according to the report. The CBI team had visited the hospital in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, to record doctors statements and examine the evidence. The CCTV footage of September 14 would have been crucial in the investigation, a police officer said.  A source told the publication that the CBI team wanted to go over the footage and ascertain key time points - when the victim was brought in, when she was moved out, who attended to her and who spoke to her when she was there. The police and administration were also questioned as to why the footage was not acquired earlier. A police officer told the news organisation that the hospital had “nothing to do” with the investigation. “Unless a crime took place in the hospital or negligence was reported, this has no bearing on the criminal investigation. These are unrelated things. That is why CCTV footage was not taken into account,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-rape-case-crucial-hospital-cctv-footage-not-available-902161.html
15-10-2020||North and Central||Smoky haze shrouds Delhi; air quality hits 'very poor'||A layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR on Thursday with air quality in the region hitting 'very poor' levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). NASA's satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Firozpur and Faridkot in Punjab and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana. However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the capital's air quality was marginal. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 11:10 am. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was in February. The 24-hour average AQI was 276 on Wednesday, which falls in the 'poor' category. It was 300 on Tuesday, 261 on Monday, 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday. ITO (AQI 372), Vivek Vihar (AQI 370), and Shadipur (AQI 359) recorded the highest pollution levels on Thursday morning. The air quality in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (317), Ghaziabad (326), Greater Noida (344) and Noida (314) was also in the red zone. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed the accumulation of pollutants. PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR rose to 300 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9:30 am -- the highest this season so far. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mould spores. The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 151 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe. GRAP -- a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity towns according to the severity of the situation -- comes into force on Thursday. It was notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.   The measures under GRAP include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor. When the situation turns "severe", GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, a sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas. The measures to be followed in the "emergency" situation include stopping entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme. EPCA, however, had earlier told Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that they "should try and avert the need to take other emergency measures for pollution control as the economy is already under stress post-lockdown. Therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption". With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic. Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution. According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 per cent -- to Delhi's air pollution. Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 percent).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/smoky-haze-shrouds-delhi-air-quality-hits-very-poor-902170.html

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian reserved order on a batch of petitions filed by Satyama Dubey and others.  During the hearing, the victim's family sought transfer of trial to Delhi, the accused sought a restraint order on discussing evidence in the matter and the Uttar Pradesh government agreed to provide security to the girl's family by central police. "Let the High Court deal with this and we are here as the ultimate supervisory body," the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, Mehta objected to the High Court naming the victim's family in its order in a suo motu matter, concerning alleged lapses by officials in cremating the victim's body on the night of September 29-30. He said this was not allowed under the Indian Penal Code. The bench said, "We can suo motu delete it." Mehta also sternly opposed intervention by Teesta Setalvad's NGO in the matter. "In the name of justice, this NGO has collected money in the past and misappropriated it," he added. "We don't need the assistance of the whole world. We have already heard enough. We heard the state, accused and victim," the bench said. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for DGP, Uttar Pradesh, said this court may depute any agency for protection of the family but it should not be a reflection on the state's fairness. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for the accused persons, contended that the investigation reports should not be made public by the victim's family or state. Four accused had been arrested in the case. His appearance was objected to by senior advocate Indira Jaising on behalf of intervenor, women advocates. Luthra, however, pointed her intervention was yet to be allowed by the court. Jaising sought protection for the family from the central police force. She also sought a direction for appointment of a special prosecutor. Advocate Seema Kushwaha, representing the victim's family sought a direction for shifting of trial to Delhi. The Uttar Pradesh government had on Wednesday asked the court to allow the CBI to continue the probe under its own supervision into the Hathras incident. In an affidavit, the state government listed out steps taken for security and protection provided to the family members of the girl, which included the deployment of armed constabulary, civil police and personal security, and installation of eight CCTV cameras.  The case, which drew country-wide outrage has been referred by the Uttar Pradesh government to the CBI, which has already started its probe.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-hints-at-referring-hathras-rape-case-pleas-to-allahabad-high-court-902216.html

The three accused, who also blackmailed the girl and threatened to upload her objectionable video online if she resisted their advances, have been arrested, they said. As per a police complaint filed by the girl's family, the accused, all residents of Rambha Nagar area and in the age group of 18 to 19, became friends with her online while playing PUBG game, police inspector Alok Srivastava said. Last month, they lured the victim to come to Rambha Nagar where they allegedly raped her and made an objectionable video of her, the official said. Thereafter, they allegedly blackmailed the girl, saying they would upload her video online if she spurned their advances, and raped her repeatedly, he said. Based on the complaint, the three accused were arrested on Wednesday night, the official said. A case has been registered against them under Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (2N) (raping repeatedly), 376 (DA) (gang-rape of a girl under 16 years of age) and 506 (criminal intimidation), and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/minor-raped-blackmailed-by-three-men-she-befriended-online-in-madhya-pradesh-902284.html
15-10-2020||North and Central||Opposition likely to make crimes against women key plank in UP bypolls||As crimes against women soar in the state, the forthcoming Assembly bypolls in Uttar Pradesh could not have come at a worse time for CM Yogi Adityanath. Billed as a precursor to the bigger battle which will take place in a little over a year, the bypolls are expected to serve as an acid test for Adityanath, who has recently come under fire from opposition parties, Dalit outfits and rights activists over his alleged failure to ensure the safety of women in the state. Be it the alleged gang rape and murder of a Dalit teen in Hathras, or suicides of sexually assaulted and molested victims in other parts of the state, UP has continued to hit headlines for all the wrong reasons. The fact that many of the victims of these crimes hailed from SC communities has only compounded the woes of the saffron party, which is finding itself targeted as 'anti-Dalit'. Another problem for the saffron party is to counter the opposition's charge that the state government is also 'anti-Brahmin'. In addition to the opposition, many Brahmin leaders have also accused the BJP of targeting members of the community, citing police encounters. Even BJP leaders here have admitted that it will be a big challenge for them to retain the seats that the party had won in the 2017 Assembly polls. A dismal showing in the bypolls could further weaken Adityanath's position, according to political analysts. While caste could also play an important role in the outcome of the bypolls, the opposition Congress, BSP and Samajwadi Party have decided to make law and order, 'atrocities on Dalits' and crimes against women their key planks. The bypolls are crucial for the Congress as their results will reflect upon the leadership of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who has invested a great deal of political capital in state party president Ajai Kumar Lallu. The bypolls will also test the SP and the BSP, which had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in an alliance, but are now on their own. Analysts opined that the results of the bypolls could reflect a 'broad trend' in this politically crucial state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/opposition-likely-to-make-crimes-against-women-key-plank-in-up-bypolls-902300.html

The meeting was held at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and attended by PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone, Peoples Movement leader Javaid Mir and CPI(M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami. Briefing reporters after the nearly two-hour meeting, Abdullah said the leaders decided to formalise the alliance, that has been named 'Peoples' Alliance for Gupkar Declaration'. The National Conference president said the alliance will strive for restoration of the constitutional position in respect of Jammu and Kashmir as it existed before August 5 last year. "We shall struggle for restoration of what was snatched from Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh. Ours is a constitutional battle ... we would strive for restoration of the constitution (with regard to Jammu and Kashmir) as it existed on August 5, 2019," he said. Abdullah said the alliance also seeks a dialogue between all stakeholders for resolution of the issue pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir. "We will be informing you about the future course of action in due course," he added. National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah and other senior leaders of the party were also present at the meeting. JKPCC chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir could not attend the meeting "due to medical reasons" A spokesperson of the party said Mir had conveyed his inability to attend the meeting to Farooq Abdullah as the Congress leader was advised by doctors to get himself medically examined including a Covid screening. Abdullah said the meeting congratulated the PDP president on her release from 14 months of detention which they said was "completely illegal and unjustified". On August 4 last year, all major political parties in Kashmir, except BJP, had met at the residence of Farooq Abdullah amidst uncertainty and tension in the erstwhile state as the Centre had rushed additional paramilitary forces there while asking all tourists including Amarnath pilgrims to leave the Valley as soon as possible. The joint statement issued by the political parties, expressing concern over the situation, came to be known as the Gupkar Declaration. The Centre revoked the special constitutional status of the state and also bifurcated it into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. In a follow up, the political parties had met again in August this year and vowed to fight for restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/political-alliance-formed-by-jammu-and-kashmirs-mainstream-parties-bats-for-restoration-of-special-status-902344.html
15-10-2020||North and Central||MP: 11 die after consuming suspected spurious liquor in Ujjain||Eleven persons died in the last 24 hours after allegedly consuming suspected spurious liquor at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, police said on Thursday. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan ordered a high-level probe into the incident. A statement by the government said the victims died after allegedly consuming "denatured spirit". "Eleven people, mostly beggars and poor labourers, died after drinking some poisonous liquid since Wednesday in areas falling under three police stations - Kharakuwa, Jeevajiganj and Mahakal," Ujjain Additional Superintendent of Police Rupesh Dwivedi said. "We are investigating what liquid they consumed and who sold it. We are carrying out raids," he said. Following the incident, Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar Singh has suspended Kharakuwa Inspector M S Meena, Sub Inspector Niranjan Sharma and two constables Nawaz Saeed and Sheikh Anwar, the ASP said. Ujjain Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Mahaveer Khandelwal said, "Eleven people were brought to a local hospital in a critical condition. None of them survived for more than 15 minutes after being brought." Asked what the victims had consumed, he said, "It could be spurious liquor, spirit or some other chemical. It will be known when the viscera report comes in." Ujjain Collector Ashish Singh said an order has been issued to crack a whip against the people selling poisonous substances and to charge them under stringent National Security Act (NSA). In the wake of the deaths in Ujjain, CM Chouhan called an urgent meeting of top officials at his residence in Bhopal on Thursday. He asked the officials to take stern action against people selling poisonous substances, the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said. Such networks should be busted, he added. Chouhan ordered a probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) Home (Rajesh Rajora) into the incident. "If such a thing is being sold elsewhere, police should find it out and prosecute the offenders severely," Chouhan said. He directed the ACS Home to submit the initial report. "People selling poisonous substances are enemies of the society. They should be punished severely. Efforts should be made to send such people to gallows," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mp-11-die-after-consuming-suspected-spurious-liquor-in-ujjain-902372.html

15-10-2020||North and Central||Punjab govt to pass state laws to nix Centre's farm reforms||Leading the push back against the Modi government, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh decided to convene a special session of the state assembly on Monday to pass legislation to negate the impact of three farm sector laws enacted by the Centre. Singh had said that the Punjab government would bring in necessary amendments to state laws to negate the “dangerous impact” of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and Essential Commodities Act 2020. The Punjab Cabinet on Wednesday recommended to Governor V P Singh Badnore to convene a 13th session of the assembly on October 19. However, even if the state assembly passes the legislation, it cannot become a law until it receives the assent of the Governor, which could not be forthcoming given the prevailing political climate. In the previous session in August, the Punjab Assembly had adopted a resolution to reject the three farm sector laws which were enforced through the promulgation of Ordinances, which were subsequently replaced by Acts of Parliament. Farmers in Punjab are up in arms against the three laws and have resorted to blocking trains in the state, hampering movement of coal for thermal power plants and food grains at a time when the procurement season is in full swing. Soon after the three laws were passed by Parliament, Congress President Sonia Gandhi had asked chief ministers of party-ruled states to explore options under the Constitution to negate the impact of the central laws. Representatives of 29 farmers’ unions met Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal on Wednesday but stormed out of the meeting accusing the Centre of failing to address their concerns about the three farm sector laws and demanding the presence of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. “Shocked by the humiliating treatment meted out to farmers by the BJP. the Government of India has added salt to the wounds of the farmers by sending an officer to meet them. Don’t our farmers deserve even the courtesy Agriculture Minister minister meeting them personally,” Singh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-govt-to-pass-state-laws-to-nix-centres-farm-reforms-902394.html

According to the police, 53 people were killed in the northeast Delhi riots in February. "I write to draw your attention to a serious inaccuracy in the police account of the number of those killed in the communal violence in February in north-east Delhi. In various affidavits before the court and in public statements made by the Delhi Police officials from time to time, the number of those killed has been put at 53. These include those registered earlier as 'unknown' but who were later identified by the police," Karat said. "However, one of those killed Sikander s/o Muhammed Mullak (illegible) has not been included in the list. He was killed on 27-2-2020. In his inquest papers (quoted in the post mortem report no 435/2020), it is stated 'alleged history of being found in unconscious state below flyover Khajuri chowk on 27/2 at 11.30 am following which the individual was brought to GTB (illegible) where he was declared brought dead...' "He was not identified till March 19 by his brother Md Ishfaque. After the identification, the original DD as unknown DD 39 A dated 27/2 was registered on 19/3 under the name of Sikander. In other words, in police records, Sikander has been identified as victim, by name on 19/3. The postmortem report shows that he died of serious head injuries," she added. Karat goes on to state that Sikander's brother, Ishfaque, has made numerous visits to the Khajuri Khas police station to ask for a copy of the FIR. She alleged that he was told that no FIR had been filed. "One of the police personnel reportedly said that 'the compensation will be managed' and his name 'adjusted' in the list. The family has been through terrible trauma. Ishfaque's shop in Bhajanpura was burnt and looted. His sister's home in Ghonda was attacked and looted. And the youngest sibling, Sikander, was killed. Instead of treating the family with sympathy, the Delhi police by not registering Sikander as a victim has worsened their plight," she wrote. "This is to request you to immediately intervene to (1) correct the list of numbers of those killed given to the High Court and include the name of Sikander, which makes it 54 killed, (2) to give a copy of the FIR to Sikander's family, (3) to take action against those police personnel responsible for the inaccuracy and harassment of the victim's family," Karat added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-death-count-inaccurate-claims-brinda-karat-in-letter-to-police-commissioner-902425.html
15-10-2020||North and Central||Punjab schools for classes 9-12 to reopen from October 19||The Punjab government on Thursday said it would reopen schools for students of Classes 9 to 12 in the areas outside containment zones in the state from October 19. Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla informed that as the home department has issued guidelines for the reopening of schools in areas outside containment zones, the school education department has also issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure the safety of the students. He further said the detailed guidelines on reopening of schools have also been sent to district education officers and school authorities for precise implementation while allowing students to attend physical classes. Singla said after reopening schools, the safety of the students will be the utmost priority of the government and a special team of officers of the education department will be formed to implement the SOPs in the schools. He pointed out that though the schools were being reopened, the online/distance learning classes shall continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and attendance of all students will not be mandatory. “As the schools are already conducting online classes, and some students prefer to attend online classes rather than physically attend school, they may be permitted to do so. The students will be able to attend the physical classes only with the written consent of parents,” the minister said in a statement here. Singla informed that the parents should also ensure that their ward will be wearing a face mask when they go to school and make them aware of not to exchange the masks with others. He added that the parents should also encourage their ward to wear full-sleeved clothes to minimise the interaction with any external surface. The education minister said the schools will open for three hours a day for students and only students of Classes 9 to 12 will be called in school. No student of any other class will be called to the school. He added, “If the strength of the students is large in the school and social distancing norms are not maintainable, in that case, the school head or management may take a decision on whether to hold the classes in two shifts or call the students at alternate days, at their own level.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-schools-for-classes-9-12-to-reopen-from-october-19-902460.html

In Delhi, the campaign will be run for a week by the Mahila Congress wing at all districts and blocks by using social media and actual postcards, asking the Prime Minister and the UP Chief Minister to safeguard the honour of the Hathras victim, Dhawan said. “The brutal incidence of September 14 would have passed silently, had not the Congress intervened with the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The UP Police tried to stop them, but they were quite determined and met the victim's family in Hathras,” she added.

15-10-2020||Opinion||3 Covid-19 vaccine trials have been paused for safety. That’s a good thing.||Clinical trials experts said these delays were comforting, in a way: They show that the researchers were following proper safety procedures. But for now, details about the nature of the volunteers’ illnesses are scant. And although pauses of vaccine trials are not unusual, some experts said that pausing treatment trials — like that of Eli Lilly’s antibody drug — is rarer and perhaps more worrisome. That trial was testing the treatment on hospitalized patients — a group that was already sick and in which declines in health would not be surprising. So for a trial like that one to be paused, the safety concerns must have been significant, they said. “I’ve done 50-plus monitoring committees, and it’s quite a rare thing to do,” said Tim Friede, a biostatistician at University Medical Center Göttingen in Germany, referring to his role as a safety monitor for drug trials. For now, the companies behind the trials aren’t saying much. In a statement in September, AstraZeneca said it paused its trial to investigate “a single event of an unexplained illness.” But two vaccinated volunteers reportedly developed the same condition, an inflammation of the spinal cord called transverse myelitis. Johnson & Johnson said that it was pausing its vaccine trial because of an “unexplained illness.” Eli Lilly’s trial of the antibody treatment was paused because of a — so far undisclosed — health difference between the group that received the drug and the group that received a placebo. When people volunteer for a late-stage trial, known as phase three, they randomly get a treatment or a placebo, and neither they nor their doctor knows which one they received. In the weeks that follow, they’re carefully monitored. People in a vaccine trial may get a checkup each month and record any symptoms they experience in a journal. People who get a drug while they’re hospitalized may be given blood tests and medical exams. Mild symptoms, like a minor rash or a headache, aren’t enough to pause a trial. But when investigators notice a serious problem — known as an “adverse event” — they have to report it to the sponsoring companies. And the sponsors then have to report to both the Food and Drug Administration and their independent advisers, known as data and safety monitoring boards. If the board or the company judges the adverse event to be particularly concerning, they may put the trial on pause — even without yet knowing if the event happened to someone who got the treatment or the placebo. Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel, said that pausing a trial is a huge logistical challenge — especially for one like Johnson & Johnson’s, with plans for 60,000 volunteers in 10 countries. “It’s this big warship that you just stop moving,” Offit said. Once a trial is paused, a safety board may ask for a volunteer who experienced an adverse event to be “unblinded” — in other words, to find out if the volunteer got the placebo or the treatment. If the volunteer received a placebo, then the treatment can’t be the cause of the event, and the trial can continue. If it turns out that the volunteer got the treatment, the board does a flurry of detective work. The members look over the medical records. They may ask for more information about volunteers’ health or even order new tests — not just for the people who experienced adverse events, but for everyone in the trial. The board uses this evidence to come to a conclusion about whether the treatment most likely had anything to do with the event. On very rare occasions, for example, some vaccines can cause a nerve disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome. But the condition takes weeks to develop. If a volunteer shows signs of Guillain-Barré syndrome on the day of a vaccine injection, it can’t be the cause. Regulators then review the decision of these boards and may accept it or ask for more information. For trials that are running in several countries at once, this review can make pausing a trial even more of a challenge. After AstraZeneca paused its global trials Sept. 6 for a review, regulators in Brazil, India, Japan, South Africa and the United Kingdom all gave the green light for the trial to resume. But American regulators are still keeping the U.S. trial on pause as they continue to look over the evidence. If a safety board rules that an adverse event most likely was not a result of the vaccine or treatment, it may allow the trial to start up again. If, on the other hand, there’s some urgent problem — a contaminated batch of drugs, for example — the trial may have to stop. When the evidence isn’t so clear, the board may let the trial resume with extra tests or exams. A second case of the same event might be more common than you would expect from chance, forcing the trial to end. But there are some important differences in the way pauses work in trials for vaccines — like Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca’s — and for drugs like Eli Lilly’s. Vaccines are designed to be given to millions or billions of healthy people, so they require extreme safety. If even one person in a vaccine trial gets sick, that warrants a closer look. “It is not at all uncommon for this to happen,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “In the vast majority of cases, the trial continues.” And in a trial as big as Johnson & Johnson’s, you expect some sort of adverse event to happen, regardless of the potential risks of the treatment being tested. It would be strange if investigators reported nothing. “Then you’re concerned that the surveillance system for adverse events isn’t working,” said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccine expert and professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, was not surprised that two vaccine trials were paused. After all, a huge number of vaccine candidates — 43 to date — are being tested in clinical trials. Many of them are based on cutting-edge designs that have never been licensed before. “It means a lot of new ground is being broken,” he said, “so people are being doubly careful.” But pauses of treatment trials are not as common. There’s a simple reason for the difference: The people getting drugs have a disease, sometimes a very serious one. For Eli Lilly’s trial, for example, researchers are only recruiting people who are already hospitalized with Covid-19. In such a group of seriously ill people, even a death would, sadly, not come as a great shock. As a result, the evidence for an adverse event often has to reach a higher bar to pause a drug trial. Indeed, that seems to be the case with the paused Covid-19 trials. One patient was enough to cause Johnson & Johnson to halt its trial. But a National Institutes of Health spokesperson said the Eli Lilly trial was paused because the safety board found that the patients who had received the antibodies showed a different “clinical status” than those who had received a placebo. Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, is still hopeful about the antibody treatment. He observed that both Eli Lilly and another company, Regeneron, have already given monoclonal antibodies to thousands of people with Covid-19 without any previous reports of problems (although some of the trials were on people with relatively mild cases). “I’m still fairly optimistic,” he said. Although pausing trials is a standard procedure, it’s not a familiar one. Before the pandemic focused the world’s attention on clinical trials, researchers would pause trials and investigate adverse events without much notice. If a paused trial has to be abandoned, that pause might get mentioned a year later in a scientific paper about the trial. But if a trial resumes and ends successfully, then the pause may just seem like an irrelevant detail. “You may very well never mention that,” said Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and former associate commissioner for public health strategy and analysis at the FDA. But in a pandemic — especially one in which the president of the United States claims without justification that a vaccine will be ready by Election Day and that monoclonal antibodies are a miraculous “cure” for Covid-19 — these pauses are drawing attention like never before. “That is something we are not used to at all,” Friede said. Nevertheless, Friede said, it is vital that researchers stick to their protocols, no matter the pressure they feel to speed things up. “That’s a very difficult situation to be in, but I think it’s very important that we keep up the standards,” he said. No matter what the outcome of the pauses, many experts found the caution heartening. “It shows me that people are taking safety very seriously,” Durbin said. “This is an example of how things are supposed to work.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/3-covid-19-vaccine-trials-have-been-paused-for-safety-that-s-a-good-thing-902094.html
15-10-2020||Opinion||Applying to colleges in the US amid Covid-19? Tips on the admission process||Choosing a college has long been a major decision. It can affect your career, your income, where you live, your friends and possibly your selection of a mate. The admissions process has always been time-consuming, complicated and frustrating. But today, during the Covid-19 pandemic, getting into college will be different and in some ways more difficult than ever. In hopes of providing some guidance to students and their parents, I asked college admissions officers to offer advice about the process in the year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Douglas Christiansen, vice provost for university enrollment affairs and dean of admissions and financial aid, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee: In these uncertain times, the context in the college admissions process matters more than ever. For those of us who practice a holistic admissions process, it is clear that we will have to read applications even more fully, understand better the nuances in high school transcripts and in family circumstances, and tweak our selection processes to allow for the test-optional applicants and many new bits of information we are likely to receive, both from the applicants and from those who support them. With regard to the SAT or ACT, ultimately, the decision to apply test-optional is the prospective student’s alone. If a university is test-optional, then the test truly is optional. And it isn’t necessary to sit for an exam at all. However, if a test result is in hand, then a good rule of thumb is to carefully research past entering score ranges for the universities you are considering before deciding whether to submit or not. But test-optional means test-optional. This is not a year to risk your health or the health of others to take an SAT or ACT exam for a test-optional process. My advice is the same as in a non-pandemic cycle: Fully engage with the application for admission. Take time to carefully complete and prepare your application before submitting it, and be sure that what you submit reflects you to the greatest extent possible. Seth Allen, vice president for strategy and dean of admissions and financial aid, Pomona College, Claremont, California: The number of students electing to defer their entrance for a year (i.e., taking a gap year) has increased significantly at many institutions, due in large part to the pandemic. A common concern is that because the numbers at some institutions are unusually large, that may impact the number of admissions offers an institution will make for those applying for the Class of 2025. Colleges understand this concern, and while each will pursue different ways to mitigate the potential impact of so many gap-year students, prospective students for the Class of 2025 should know that institutions will want to admit as close to normal a number of students as possible this year, perhaps modestly increasing the size of their entering class, or electing to admit a similar number of students as in the past in the assumption that the pandemic will create greater uncertainty about student enrollment choices. Tim Wolfe, associate vice president for enrollment and dean of admission, William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia: The application is a chance for us to hear a student’s story and listen to their voice — that hasn’t changed in 2020, and it is likely more important than ever that we continue to engage in this process from a holistic perspective. Some of the chapters in the story may appear a bit different this year, or in some cases may be nonexistent. Such is the case with standardized testing, where many, if not most, colleges across the nation have shifted to a test-optional process for at least this cycle. That is the case at William & Mary, and we stand by that flexibility. Ours is a holistic review process that considers many factors. If students do not send in standardized test scores, they will not be at a disadvantage. We will simply focus our review on the many other items in the application that highlight each student’s strengths and perspective. Elizabeth Johnson, provost of Post University, Waterbury, Connecticut: High school seniors should write the essay, even if it’s not required by their school of choice. The essay can highlight important aspects of their life that align with the preferred school’s mission or culture, offer a window into their plans for the future or provide context to borderline test scores or a semester with lower grades. And it goes without saying that prospective students should plan to write the essay themselves to ensure it is authentic. Institutions will often ask follow-up questions in an interview based on what was shared in the essay. If there is doubt about the submission’s authorship, admissions teams may run the essay through plagiarism software to assess if it represents original work. Erin Stine, assistant vice president for enrollment, The New School, New York: I encourage students to look at online content created both before the pandemic and during. How engaging are the online lectures and classes? What kinds of projects are the students creating? In virtual and hybrid environments, universities have been forced to capture the college experience in ways that are far more casual and less polished. In the best cases, universities are featuring the strengths of faculty and administration in a far more authentic way. Students should pair their research of virtual and hybrid environments with an understanding of what life on campus was like before March. While it’s true that many students chose to take a gap year, the number of college-age students is also in decline. Fall 2021 could prove to be a competitive year, but many universities are committed to being as flexible and fair as possible, considering the challenges of the graduating 2020 class. Zaire McCoy, vice president for enrollment management and dean of admission, Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida: I don’t think students who deferred their enrollment this year will prevent large numbers of graduating high school seniors from being admitted to top schools. Most schools should be able to absorb the gap-year enrollees while offering the same number of admissions spots this year. Keep in mind that schools that experienced large gap-year requests this year likely saw smaller enrollment, so there may be additional space in housing and classes next year, as a result. In some ways, this is a great time to be an applicant because admissions offices are having to critically evaluate everything they do in light of the pandemic. Traditional methods of outreach, recruiting and application review have quickly had to change, and this is an opportunity for students to shine who may not otherwise have been seen as a strong applicant. Eric Nichols, vice president for enrollment management, Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore: There are hundreds of schools that would love to have your application without test scores. However, if there are certain schools you are serious about, and you’re on the fence about submitting your scores, consider first how selective the school is. If your scores sit at or exceed the school’s midpoint, it may benefit you to submit because you’ll be up against students with similar profiles.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/applying-to-colleges-in-the-us-amid-covid-19-tips-on-the-admission-process-902109.html
15-10-2020||Panorama||The ‘Muslim Regiment’ post is false and dangerous. Do not believe it||14 October 2020   To: The President of India,Supreme Commander of Indian Armed Forces   Cc: Vice-President of India / Speaker of Rajya Sabha Prime Minister of India Chief Justice of India Speaker of Lok Sabha Union Minister of Defence Union Minister for Home Affairs Chief of Defence Staff Chief of the Army Staff Chief of the Naval Staff Chief of the Air Staff   Subject: FALSE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS on ‘MUSLIM REGIMENT’ Sir,   We, the signatories, are all Veterans of the Indian Armed Forces…We do not represent any group or political party, and each of us only has the best interest of our country and our Armed Forces at heart in making this Statement. …We wish to draw your attention to the outright falsehoods being spread by forces inimical to our country and our Armed Forces, which will adversely affect morale and national security. We specifically refer to a number of social media posts to the effect that a ‘Muslim Regiment’ of the Indian Army refused to fight against Pakistan in India’s 1965 war with Pakistan, and was therefore disbanded. When we refer to ‘soldiers’, we mean All Ranks of India’s Army, Navy and Air Force. These falsehoods began in 2013, when @120croreHindus - ‘World Hindus United’ posted the following on Twitter on 19 May 2013: “In 1965 there was a regiment in Indian Army called Muslim regiment which refused to fight against Pakistan after which it was dismantled.” [https://mobile.twitter.com/120crorehindus/status/335975010877464576?lang=en] The tweet was meant to show that Muslim soldiers had their loyalties to Pakistan rather than India. The ‘Muslim Regiment’ post has been re-tweeted many times thereafter, and its insidious surfacing during the on-going Chinese aggression, is certainly suspect. The hundreds of such tweets cannot be included in this letter, so examples mentioning social-media identity, date-time and social media channel are provided below, beginning with the most recent: (1) @Shwaami1 Swami Bijay Puri Maharaj on 20Sep2020;6.36AM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Shwaami1/status/1307486194377404416), (2) @gurjar436 vinod.gurjar on 18Sep2020;1:19PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/gurjar436/status/1306862884866023424), (3) @ComondoDhruv SuperCommondoDhruv on 16Sep2020;9:55AM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/ComondoDhruv/status/1306086906241802243), (4) @Alostinsane Abhishek Shukla on 16Sep2020 on BBC News <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9HFyDLPirg> at 0.10-min (5) @Thekhushbo Khushboo Mishra 16Sep2020;1:39PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Thekhushbo/status/1306143221068693505), (6) @FansYati Narsinghanand Saraswati ji Maharaj on 15Sep2020;12:54PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Thekhushbo/status/1306143221068693505), (7) @DK_Dube on 15Sep2020;11:29AM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/DK_Dube/status/1305748118030426112), (8) RK Dessai on 03Apr2020;09:04h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2984184964972200&id=100001421761005), (9) Ashish Bisht on 03Feb2020;14:43h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=535568030636952&id=100025512800441), (10) Yash Raghav on 21Dec2019;18:19h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=700170750506750&id=100015414943960), (11) @rambagree1970 Arnath Hiranyavarn on 16Oct2019;1:41PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/rambagree1970/status/1184381452336517121), (12) Bharamal Gadhavi on 31Aug2019;15:06h with Youtube on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1025583231124504&id=100010185107679), (13) Sanjay Bidani on 26Mar2019;20:43h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10214034927811841&id=1370731661), (14) Manjunath Khot on 26Apr2018;03:46h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1936201699747298&id=100000724616476), (15) Kamesh @kamesh_gadia on 01Feb2018;9:29PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/kamesh_gadia/status/959093852568104960?s=08), (16) ABP Live ‘Viral Sach’ on 02Nov2017;18:20h on Facebook (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2003440843007263&id=759078590776834), (17) @rbatra01 on 27Jul2017;5:37PM on Twitter (https://twitter.com/rbatra01/status/890544164357550082?s=08), (18) Pradhan Singh on 28Oct2017;03:17M on Twitter (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1976094619303714&id=100007095850063). These ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts are blatantly false, because the Indian Army did not have a Muslim Regiment in 1965 or since. Some senior-ranking Veterans have unequivocally pointed out the false nature of these posts. …We further wish to point out that Muslims fighting as part of multi-class regiments proved their absolute commitment to the cause of our nation. For example, Quartermaster Havildar Abdul Hamid was posthumously awarded Param Vir Chakra, for his courage and valiance in the Battle of Asal Uttar during the 1965 India-Pakistan War. Also in the 1965 war, Major (later Lt Gen) Mohammad Zaki and Major Abdul Rafey Khan were both awarded Vir Chakra, the latter posthumously, when he fought against the Pakistani division commanded by his own uncle, Maj Gen Sahibzada Yaqub Khan. Such are the legends of Muslim warriors. Even earlier, at Partition in 1947, when his Baluch Regiment went to Pakistan, Brigadier Mohammad Usman chose to remain in the Indian Army. He was approached personally by Jinnah to move to Pakistan, but he refused. He fought the Pakistani invasion in Kashmir, was the senior-most officer killed in action in July 1948, and was posthumously awarded Mahavir Chakra for his gallantry. He lies buried in the Jamia Milia Islamia campus in Delhi and remains an inspiration to students who throng the annual memorial service that India’s Parachute Regiment conducts to honour the gallant paratrooper. Saying that Muslim soldiers of this so-called ‘Muslim Regiment’ refused to fight the war against Pakistan in 1965 and hence the ‘Muslim Regiment’ was disbanded, denigrates and questions the loyalty of all serving and retired Muslim soldiers. Further, it helps the enemy by striking at the morale of India’s soldiers to degrade their operational capability. Our soldiers fight shoulder-to-shoulder as a Team at every level of all military functioning and operations from the Section and Platoon level up to the highest level, based upon mutual trust, respect, comradeship and fraternity, regardless of the religion, language, caste, etc. of other members of the Team. Social media posts like the ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts put in the public domain are an insidious attack on the morale of our Armed Forces. It generates doubt in the public mind that if Muslim soldiers cannot be trusted, then other Muslims too are no different. It exacerbates mistrust and hate between communities. The ill-motivated ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts on social media have far more reach among the public than a few denials by senior Veterans like Lt Gen Hasnain, and hence cause serious damage to the morale of soldiers and to the social fabric of our diverse nation. When falsehoods like the ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts are repeated often as they have been, starting perhaps in 2013, the public assumes that it is the truth, especially when there is no official action against the perpetrators. It may well be the cause at least in part, to the increasing anti-Muslim feeling among the Indian public since that time. It may show the success of the psychological warfare waged by enemies of the Republic of India, through agents like those who have tweeted about the ‘Muslim Regiment’. It needs no emphasis that social unrest adversely affects the morale of soldiers who are far away from their families, doing their duty to defend our borders, at daily risk to life and limb. The ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts are an attack on India’s Armed Forces. Remaining a-political and secular has been an article of faith for every soldier, sailor and airman, both at the institutional and individual levels. Every soldier swears to protect the Constitution of India even at peril to his/her life in the service of our nation, and serves in harsh and high-risk field service conditions. He/she also endorses the principle of civil control over India’s Armed Forces, which have loyally upheld Constitutional democratic principles. Today, our soldiers are facing the Chinese aggression in Aksai Chin and also elsewhere, while the threat from Pakistan remains, and our troops additionally remain deployed for internal security duties. While in any situation, the ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts would be condemnable, in the current situation on our borders it is especially so, calling for serious attention of Government and expeditious action to counter Pakistan’s propaganda. In light of the foregoing and in the national interest, we earnestly urge impartial, firm and immediate action as follows: # Investigate the antecedents of individuals who have made ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts. # Identify and charge individuals who have made ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts for anti-national activities. # Issue warning to the social media providers (Facebook & Twitter) who have enabled ‘Muslim Regiment’ posts. # Issue immediate instructions to all state governments that the generation of false and seditious messages in social media should be acted upon with alacrity so as to not jeopardize national security. We further appeal to you to ensure that the secular and a-political character of our Armed Forces is preserved, and to adhere unwaveringly to the vision and spirit of the Constitution of India, which spells out the framework for our nation and its people. As we have done during our active service in the past, we assure you of standing in solidarity with our nation, the Constitution of India, the Government of India and our gallant Armed Forces.   Yours Faithfully,   Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas, PVSM, AVSM, VrC, VSM Lt Gen Ramdas Mohan, PVSM, AVSM, VSM Lt Gen RK Nanavatty, PVSM, UYSM, AVSM Lt Gen Vijay Oberoi, PVSM, AVSM, VSM Lt Gen UK Ganguli Lt Gen Raman Dhawan, AVSM,VSM**, ADC Lt Gen Ashwini Kumar Bakshi AVSM, SM, VSM Lt Gen Oomman P Mathew, PVSM, AVSM, SM Lt Gen Kishen Bhatia, PVSM Lt Gen KS Rao, PVSM, SC, SM Vice Admiral Madanjit Singh, PVSM, AVSM Vice Admiral R P Suthan, PVSM, AVSM, VSM Vice Admiral Michael Morales, AVSM Maj Gen SG Vombatkere, VSM Maj Gen PK Joglekar, PVSM and more than a hundred other veterans.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/the-muslim-regiment-post-is-false-and-dangerous-do-not-believe-it-902070.html
15-10-2020||Panorama||Hand hygiene is important||Since its launch in 2008, the Global Handwashing Day (GHD), 15 October, is celebrated as a world event dedicated to increasing awareness on the importance of hand hygiene especially through handwashing with soap. The 2020 GHD theme – ‘Hand Hygiene for All’ – is a call to action led by WHO and UNICEF to make hand hygiene a reality for everyone everywhere. The current Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role hand hygiene plays in disease transmission. It reminds us of the importance of the simple yet most effective intervention to stop the spread of any disease – handwashing with soap – and the need to take immediate action on hand hygiene across all public and private settings to respond and control the Covid-19 pandemic. A global culture of hand hygiene must be fostered and made the mainstay in public health interventions beyond the pandemic.  Leave aside Covid-19, pneumonia (15%), diarrhoea (8%) and malaria (5%) account for almost a third of global under-five child deaths. Majority of these diseases can be prevented by basic water, sanitation and hygiene interventions. Handwash with soap alone can protect about one out of every three young children who get sick with diarrhoea and one out of five young children with respiratory infections like pneumonia.  Handwashing with soap works by interrupting the transmission of disease. Hands often act as vehicles that carry disease-causing germs from person to person, either through direct contact or indirectly via surfaces.  The guiding vision of Global Handwashing Day is to promote a local and global culture of handwashing with soap. Although people around the world wash their hands with water, few wash their hands with soap at the critical moments. In many countries, the lack of soap is not seen as a significant barrier to handwashing, with the vast majority of even poor households having soap. However, laundry, bathing and washing dishes are often seen as the priority for soap use, not washing hands. Hence, the challenge we face is to transform handwashing with soap from an abstract proven intervention into an automatic behaviour performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.  The global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also recommends hand hygiene as a priority component in schools, health care facilities and at the household level. In India, too, hand hygiene is an important component of the Swachh Bharath Mission initiated in 2014.  Unfortunately, two out of five people in the world do not have a handwashing facility on premises. And almost half of the schools in the world do not have handwashing facilities with soap and water for students.  The picture is similar in India, with only about one-third of all Indian households using soap to wash hands before a meal and only three-fourth using soap for washing hands after defecation. As per the WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme report on hygiene interventions, 542 million people in India live without a basic handwashing facility and around 41 per cent schools in India have no hygiene services. Added to this, there are major challenges in promoting hand hygiene behaviours, including lack of education and understanding of hand hygiene, poor infrastructure and lack of cost-effective technologies for institutions and public places. This could be a big challenge in containing Covid-19. Therefore, the ‘Hand Hygiene for All’ global initiative aims to implement WO’s global recommendations on hand hygiene to prevent and control the Covid-19 pandemic and work to ensure lasting infrastructure and behaviour. It is designed around three stages: responding to the immediate pandemic, rebuilding infrastructure and services, and reimagining hand hygiene in society. In India, in particular, the central and state governments need to implement focused action specifically on hand hygiene. This includes, first of all, improving the access to sustainable hand hygiene services (handwashing facilities, regular water supply, soap or alcohol-based handrub) at household level, institutions and public places. Secondly, initiating effective behaviour change interventions promoting handwash by developing targeted communication strategies. Thirdly, capacity building interventions across all levels to inculcate the habit of hand hygiene among all. And lastly, effective policies for coordination mechanism, financing through different line departments, central and state funds.  (The writer is Chief of Field Office, UNICEF Office for Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/hand-hygiene-is-important-902071.html
15-10-2020||Panorama||An unjust comparison||Man is believed to be the finest creation of God.  Our scriptural learning propels the idea that  Almighty has created us in his own image. The finest and greatest of the gifts which man has received from his heavenly father is cognitive abilities. Man is sane and rational whereas animals lack such a remarkable cognition. Endowed with the faculty of reasoning man can fairly distinguish between the right and wrong.  But the true reality of our present world is fully out of synchronization with the design of divinity. Although the animal world is disorderly and chaotic yet there prevails order amidst that chaos. Animals kill their prey with the sole intent of quenching their appetite. Like humans they don't harbour any malice neither do they burn in the fire of hatred, enmity and jealousy. These are the very traits of the human kingdom only. Chaos and disarray should be exclusively the monopoly of the animal kingdom as they are unable to decipher between good and evil due to the sheer absence of the faculty of reasoning but it is indeed a matter stupendous sorrow that human beings have even surpassed the wild beasts when it comes to cruelty and perversity.  The soaring crimes against innocent people have made this earth highly misfit for living. Our world is neither a paradise nor I would choose to compare it with the animal kingdom, as animals too have their own scruples and moral compunctions.  In India, some fringe groups and outfits are quite active these days with their undesirable provocations and mindless raving and ranting against the western culture. These custodians of morality and native cultural heritage brandish their naked swords in the air and raise staccato against the advent of foreign culture. Though these hoodlums have forgotten the fact that no culture is nasty in any form. It is the depravity of a man's mind that marauds a society of its real cultural mores and renders it a barren wasteland. Therefore, it is time for man to come out of his hibernation with a fresh look over reality. It is also unpalatable to liken humans with animals when the former perpetrate dastardly crimes and resort to sinister sins. By so doing we, the malevolent humans, hatch another conspiracy against the sin-free animal community and cast undue blemishes on them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/an-unjust-comparison-902077.html
15-10-2020||Right in the Middle||Live and let live||Scientists have continually looked at ageing as if it were a disease and have tried to cure it. From enhancing certain proteins which protect cells from ageing to extending telomeres – fragments of DNA which cap both ends of each chromosome and protect against the wear and tear of natural ageing, scientists have tried to halt the ageing process. But now, experts say they have conclusive proof there is no way to stop ageing and humans are born to die. The research suggests by solving one problem with ageing, other problems will become worse. For example, preventing ageing would require giving healthy cells a boost, but this could mean cancer cells would grow more violently. Covid-19 has opened the Pandora box of the human mind and revealed peculiar thought processes of few! People’s behaviour has never stooped to such a new low that they are willing to forego wellbeing of others without any guilt. One such incident happened recently in my colony and took me by surprise. Generally, my fellow residents have displayed responsible behaviour towards others on every occasion! After being locked up inside our campus for more than 70 days, we conducted a survey to know the preferences of residents towards relaxing lockdown and allowing external service providers in. One question that was asked was whether they would agree on letting lab technicians collect blood for medical tests. With people with chronic diseases and people who had undergone recent surgery, periodical tests were important and home service was the only option. Eighty-eight out of 115 respondents agreed with the proposition while 16 denied, and 11 were not sure for the same question. What must one infer from those 25% of people who replied in the negative in even such a critical condition? It appeared that these souls thought that allowing lab technicians may cause the spread of Covid and endanger their life. Nothing wrong in taking care of the self, provided such care is confined to self-regulation and does not cause practical difficulties and mental agony for others. Social distancing, wearing a mask, washing and taking care to boost immunity levels are measures that one can take without causing harm to someone else. Preventing service providers will deprive them of their livelihood, besides causing mental agony to residents who do not have the ability to step out. It's time to introspect and be more empathetic and helpful to others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/live-and-let-live-902076.html
15-10-2020||Second Edit||Turf war over, bring coronavirus under control||Karnataka minister B Sriramulu being abruptly divested of the health portfolio is not only seen as a reflection on his performance but is also a belated admission of the state government’s failure to effectively combat Covid-19, necessitating such a change at a time when the pandemic is raging. After the initial gains, the state has been faltering and now stands No 3 in the country with regard to cumulative cases. While the daily average of new cases has seen a declining trend nationally over the past five weeks, Karnataka has recorded a sharp increase and holds the second position, next only to Maharashtra. The current caseload in Karnataka is 17% of the total cases, as against the national average of 12.1%. One of the reasons why the state began to stumble was the total lack of cohesion in the decision-making process at the top. With Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar now being allotted the health portfolio, it is hoped that the fight against Covid-19 will finally see some unified action. Sriramulu and Sudhakar were engaged in a turf war, with their responsibilities overlapping as their portfolios were carved out of the health department. While teaching hospitals came under the domain of Sudhakar, the non-teaching ones were under the control of Sriramulu. With the ministers pulling the horse in different directions, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had attempted to bring in some semblance of order by relieving Sriramulu of all Covid-related responsibilities and handing them over to Sudhakar. But with the former sulking, Yediyurappa had to broker peace by allotting Bengaluru to Sudhakar and the rest of Karnataka to Sriramulu. Mid-way, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar was brought in as Covid-19 spokesman, bypassing the two in-charge ministers. At one point, there were about 10 ministers handling Covid-19, with one minister for each of Bengaluru’s eight divisions. While Sudhakar himself has no laurels to showcase, as the positive cases in Bengaluru shot up to 5,000-a-day level while he was partially in charge, he now has complete authority to set the house in order and bring the situation under control. His first task will be to increase the number of recoveries and reduce the case fatality rate, both of which require early detection and quality treatment. The alleged corruption in Covid-related activities will require his urgent attention. Now, that the multiple chains of command have been dismantled and the state has got a single minister in charge, there should be a concerted effort to fight the pandemic and ensure that Karnataka betters the national average on all counts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/turf-war-over-bring-coronavirus-under-control-902072.html
15-10-2020||South||Renowned Malayalam poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri passes away||Renowned Malayalam poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, who has been widely acknowledged as the one who introduced modern aspects to Malayalam literature, passed away on Thursday at Thrissur in Kerala. He was 94. A recipient of Jnanpith, Padma Shri and many other prestigious honours, Akkitham, as he is popularly known, penned around 45 poems, starting from the age of eight. A line from the poem, 'Velicham Dukhamanunni, Thamasalo Sugapradham', (Light is sorrow, Darkness is happiness) became much popular usage in Malayalam owing to its in-depth meaning and simplicity. His poems received attention from the 1950s with the poem 'Irupetham Nootandinte Ithihasam' (20th century's epic). A native of Palakkad district in central Kerala, Akkitham had also written many short stories and had also worked as a journalist with a couple of magazines and also served in All India Radio. Akkitham, who received the Jananpith award of 2019, was conferred the award at his house on September 24 considering his I'll health. Reflecting his simplicity, Akkitham's reaction to the Jnanpith award was that many eminent personalities of Malayalam literature deserved the award than him. But he was fortunate to get the honour owing to his longevity. He also said that he did not have the opinion that all that he had written could be right. Errors might have been there. Akkitham's funeral was performed at his residential premises in Pallakad district by evening with state honours. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other prominent persons condoled the death of the poet. His wife predeceased him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/renowned-malayalam-poet-akkitham-achuthan-namboothiri-passes-away-902154.html

15-10-2020||South||'Experience is a lesson': Rajinikanth settles issue with civic body; pays property tax||Tamil superstar Rajinikanth on Thursday admitted as “mistake” his knocking at the Madras High Court challenging civic body’s demand for Rs 6.5 lakh in property taxes with respect to a marriage hall owned by him. He also settled the row by paying Rs 6.50 lakh through a cheque, hours before the deadline was to end. Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) confirmed that Rajinikanth has made the payment towards property tax by sharing a copy of the receipt. “The issue of Raghavendra Mandapam property tax… We should have appealed to the Corporation…Could have avoided the mistake…Experience is lesson,” Rajinikanth wrote on his Twitter page on Thursday morning. His comments after the court had on Wednesday dismissed as withdrawn a writ petition filed by him challenging civic body’s demand for Rs 6.5 lakh in property taxes with respect to Raghavendra Mandapam owned by him.   Justice Anita Sumanth warned Rajinikanth’s counsel, Vijayan Subramanian, that she would impose costs for rushing to the court without waiting for a reply from the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) on the issue. She also pulled up the counsel for wasting the court’s time and suggested that the plea be withdrawn. A few hours later, Rajinikanth’s counsel submitted a memo seeking to withdraw the case after which Justice Anita Sumanth dismissed the petition. The actor had contented that since the marriage hall was vacant since March 24, the day Covid-19 lockdown came into force in Tamil Nadu, he was eligible for remission of property tax. And he approached the court since there was no response from the civic body to a representation, he sent seeking remission on September 23.

The court asked the ED, which had earlier interrogated Sivasankar, to file its report on his anticipatory bail plea, which came up for hearing today. Adjourning the matter to October 23, the court directed the central agency not to arrest Sivasankar till then. Apprehending arrest by the ED, Sivasankar who is facing probe in connection with the case, had moved the court on Wednesday seeking anticipatory bail. When his petition came up on Thursday, the ED said it has not taken a decision on arresting Sivasankar, a former secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister. The agency also sought time for filing a detailed reply on the matter. In his plea, Sivasankar had said as a responsible government servant, he had extended maximum cooperation in the investigation of the offence. He was summoned by the ED on multiple occasions to confront the statements given by different accused and witnesses, he said. He had expressed fears that media's "false propaganda" and frivolous news items" and constant demand for his arrest for creating news value has created a situation where the investigating agencies are forced to "save their skin" from allegations by arresting him, thereby playing to the fourth estate and avoiding criticism. Sivasankar was earlier interrogated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate probing separate cases related to the gold smuggling using diplomatic channels through the international airport at Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/gold-smuggling-case-dont-arrest-sivasankar-till-october-23-kerala-hc-tells-ed-902233.html

The boundary-marking would take place as per Supreme Court orders, said the officials. A team of experts from Survey of India would arrive in Ballari to take up the work, they said. The experts would be accompanied by a team of senior officials from the Revenue Departments of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the officials said. The inter-state boundary markers crossing the Ballari reserve forest are missing, they said. Many of the border markers in the villages of Tumati, Vithalapur, Malappanagudi and Siddapur villages have been destroyed. Justice N Santosh Hegde, former Lokayukta, who had investigated into the illegal mining, had confirmed the destruction of the boundary marking in his report on such mining. Many social and political activists had approached the Supreme Court to investigate into the destruction of the boundary mark. The petitioners had argued that the illegal mining probe at the border would not be completed without restoring the inter-state boundary markers. Following this, the Supreme Court had ordered the Survey of India to mark the inter-state boundary. For two years, the officials of the Survey of India, along with officials from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, had conducted surveys several times to ascertain the exact location of the border, sources said. According to the sources, a report would be submitted to the Supreme Court on Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/survey-to-ascertain-karnataka-andhra-pradesh-boundaries-begins-tomorrow-902288.html

It triggered a political row with the Congress alleging of deliberate cancellation of the event. Rahul was scheduled to inaugurate a building of a higher secondary school near Kalpetta on Thursday morning through online and the Kalpetta municipality made the arrangements for the function. But on Thursday morning, Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdullah directed that the function could not be allowed as it involved protocol violation. The school building was inaugurated using funds under the multi-sectoral development programme of minority affairs department and hence the ministry concerned needs to be informed, the collector cited. But the Congress alleged that it was a political ploy. Congress MLA from Wayanad I C Balakrishnan said that Kalpetta municipal chairperson Sanitha Jagadheesh, who represents the CPM, sought Rahul's convenient time and made arrangements for the inauguration. Sanitha, however, said that the municipality was ignorant of the protocol issues involved and hence the event was cancelled by the collector. With the local body and Assembly elections approaching in Kerala, the state is now witnessing an inauguration spree with chief ministers and ministers inaugurating a series of event on a daily basis.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/row-over-last-minute-cancellation-of-congress-leader-rahul-gandhis-virtual-programme-related-to-wayanad-school-902312.html

Muralitharan, whose forefathers hailed from Tamil Nadu, had supported the Sri Lankan Government in its war against the now defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), political leaders pointed out and asked Vijay Sethupathi not to endorse a man who had “let down his own race” at its “darkest period” in history. PMK founder S Ramadoss, Seeman, the chief of Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) which espouses the cause of Tamil nationalism, and celebrated filmmaker Bharathiraja issued separate statements on Thursday asking Vijay Sethupathi to call off the project “by any means.” Their statements came after the actor was trolled on Twitter using a hashtag #ShameonVijaySethupathi which trended for the whole of Wednesday. The biopic, to be bankrolled by Dar Motion Pictures and directed by M S Sripathy, will capture the captivating journey of the ace spinner who took a record 800 wickets in his test career. The movie primarily made in Tamil, the spinner’s mother tongue, will also be released in Hindi, Bengali, and Sinhalese. The producers came out with a statement clarifying that the film does not make any political statement favouring any community and that it is intended only to be an inspiration for the younger generation. Sri Lankan Tamils and the 30-year-old civil war in the island nation are emotive issues in Tamil Nadu with almost all political parties blaming the powerful Rajapaksas for “killing innocent Tamils.” “Muttiah Muralitharan was fiddling when Tamil children were dying, and he had fully endorsed the Sinhalese racist attitude. What is the use of achieving much in sports when you had laughed at the plight of your own race? Do you want your face to be associated forever with a man who had backstabbed his own race and be looked at with hatred by people?” Bharathiraja asked. Ramadoss termed Muralitharan as an “enemy of Tamil race” and said the spinner’s “full-time job” was to effuse praise on Rajapaksas “who killed lakhs of Tamils” in the name of war. “I am not going to appeal to Vijay Sethupathi not to act in the biopic. If he announces he is going to act in the movie, he will find place in good chapter of history. If he acts in this movie against the wishes of Tamil people, he will find place among those who committed treachery,” Ramadoss said. Muralitharan, who is married to Mathimalar from Chennai, and Sethupathi shared their thoughts on the upcoming movie in a recent show on Star Sports’ pre-show Cricket Live.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/politicians-filmmaker-urge-vijay-sethupathi-not-to-play-muttiah-muralitharan-in-biopic-902373.html

The incessant rains are a result of the depression from the Bay of Bengal that moved across the state on Tuesday. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rao has urged the central government to release Rs 1,350 crore immediately for rehabilitation and relief works. Rao held a review meeting on Thursday with ministers, officials and ordered relief measures on a war footing for the people. The government has announced Rs five lakh compensation for each of the deceased, to be handed to their families. The CM said that new houses would be built for those whose houses were completely destroyed, and for the partially damaged, financial assistance would be provided for repairs. People in the submerged areas would be provided rice, pulses and other essential commodities, food packets and three blankets per house. CM has sanctioned Rs five crore to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area for the relief works. deceased families. The CM clarified that in place of houses built on nalas (drains) and washed away in floodwaters, the new houses would be built on government land. CM instructed that water should be pumped out of the low-lying areas and apartment cellars. Even if it means inconvenience for the residents for a day or two, power supply should be restored only after water is drained out to prevent any mishaps, the CM said while urging people to cooperate. Meanwhile, it was a clear, sunny sky over Hyderabad on Thursday after over three days, as the flood waters started receding in many areas. However, normal life is not yet back. In view of the public miseries due to the rains and waterlogging, the Telangana government had declared holidays on Wednesday and Thursday for all the government offices and private institutions, including banks.  Municipal administration and urban development minister K T Ramarao and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar too reviewed the flood situation in Hyderabad. In the likelihood of outbreak of water borne diseases, they directed the setting up of medical camps. Officials were ordered to evacuate people from the dilapidated buildings and construction sites to prevent any loss of life.

The girl, supposedly still asleep in her bedroom when she was attacked, succumbed after taken to a hospital. The accused man who wounded himself on the neck and stomach with the same knife is in a serious condition in a government hospital in Guntur. While the girl’s side pointed it as a case of spurned love proposal followed by harassment, Babu’s brother told reporters that Tejaswini and Babu were secretly married for some time. Adding a twist, the Vijayawada police said they found a bedsheet like cloth tied to the fan inside the girl’s house which raised suspicion if there was a suicide attempt.   “It is too early to comment on anything. The probe is on,” a police official at the spot said. Nagendra Babu alias Chinna Swamy, who works as a carpenter/painter in the same Kristurajapuram locality where the girl lives is known to the girl’s family. The girl’s cousin is a friend of Swamy who said he had spoken to him in the morning like usual. “I am not aware of my friend’s interest in the girl. He entered the house when no one including her parents was inside,” said the cousin. Divya Tejaswini, the only girl child of her parents, is studying third-year B.Tech., in a residential college, and is at home because of the Covid-19 pandemic.   “I went downstairs for a brief while and when returned saw my girl lying on the bed brutally attacked,” her mother said, rubbishing the talk of a relationship between the two.    The episode occurring days after a similar incident in the city has shocked the residents. A 24-year-old nurse serving in a private Covid-19 care centre in Vijayawada died on Monday night as she was doused in petrol and set on fire by her estranged lover. The man, aged 27, who also suffered severe burns succumbed to a government hospital later. Locals and women organizations have condemned the attack, wanted swift justice while demanding the police to ensure the safety of women in the city. Vijayawada East MLA Gadde Ramamohan representing the opposition TDP has attributed such criminal incidents to the leniency of the YSRCP government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-girl-stabbed-by-alleged-lover-dies-accused-stabs-himself-too-902412.html
15-10-2020||South||Tamil Nadu: A green Diwali with less-emission crackers||Green crackers, aimed at reducing emissions by 30 to 35 per cent in line with a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, will make it to this year’s Diwali market in “good percentage.” Fireworks manufacturers in Sivakasi, 540 km from here, say 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the crackers that go out of their factories to the market this season will carry the green cracker tag. Only a handful of manufacturers brought out green products last year due to confusion with regard to the apex court order, but the number of firecrackers that meet the new standards aimed at reducing air pollution has grown substantially this year. Fireworks manufacturers, who were initially reluctant in producing less-emission crackers, have quickly adapted to the change. The new products come with a QR code that can be used to check whether they are original. Over 380 factories attached to the most-influential Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA) have tied-up with the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), one of the CSIR laboratories, for manufacturing less-emission crackers. “Nearly 80 per cent of the products that will go out of Sivakasi this year will carry the green crackers tag. A lot of hard work, investment, and time have been spent on bringing out green crackers from our factories. The new products will reduce the emission of 2.5 particulate material by 30 to 35 percent,” P Ganesan, President of TANFAMA, told DH. However, some manufacturers say the percentage may differ as many could have difficulties in producing the crackers with the new formula given by the NEERI due to the Covid-19 lockdown that affected production for over 45 days. Manufacturers affiliated with other associations have also signed MoUs with NEERI to manufacture green crackers. While the transition has been a bit easy for big players, small producers have had difficulty in getting the MoUs signed and launching production. The switch to green crackers has not resulted in any substantial increase in the price of the products, Ganesan said, adding that it should be “music to the ears” of the consumers.  Known as ‘Little Japan’ for its inimitable workforce, Sivakasi caters to 90 percent of the cracker needs of the country and makes business for over Rs 3,000 crores annually. Though illegal, smaller companies, who have not signed MoUs with NEERI, are also into manufacturing green crackers by getting required formulas from others. NEERI has successfully made atom bombs, flowerpots, and sparklers without the usage of Barium Nitrate, a chemical considered indispensable to the industry. Though the manufacturers have complied with the Supreme Court order, they are not too sure about how they will be received by the public as this is the first time green crackers will be used by millions. “We have done our bit, but we do feel the performance of some products do not match their pre-green cracker era which we produced using a certain chemical. It is for the people to decide whether the product is good or bad. The performance needs to be assessed by the consumer and we will come to know that only after Deepavali,” a leading fireworks’ manufacturer told DH on condition of anonymity. While some manufacturers still complain about green crackers, most of them have embraced the formula to stay in the business as the order came from the highest court of the land. Some are even enthusiastic as manufacturing of green crackers would them global with abundant opportunities for export.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-a-green-diwali-with-less-emission-crackers-902435.html

Many companies had scaled-down production due to the Covid-19 lockdown, but they are hoping that there should be no restrictions on celebrating the festival. “It is too early to say whether we will be able to sell all the goods. But goods are moving now as per the plans for me. A clear picture will emerge during the last week of October,” a fireworks’ manufacturer said. Another manufacturer said there has been no reduction in the number of orders from last year but the problem, according to him, will emerge if there are restrictions. “Dealers buy from us and if they are not able to use it now, they will keep it for next year. And orders for next year will reduce substantially for us. We just hope people are allowed to celebrate Deepavali by bursting crackers,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covid-19-effect-on-cracker-sales-manufacturers-keep-fingers-crossed-902440.html

Vetrivel, 59, was the treasurer of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) headed by AIADMK rebel T T V Dhinakaran. The former MLA breathed his last at 6.40 pm at the Sri Ramachandra Hospital here due to septic shock. He was receiving treatment after testing positive for Covid-19. Originally a Congressman, Vetrivel was a staunch loyalist of Moopanar, the party strongman in Tamil Nadu, and had his ears to the ground. From a corporator to a legislator and then to the trusted lieutenant of Dhinakaran, Vetrivel came a long way in politics. He joined AIADMK in the early 2000s. Vetrivel shot in political limelight in 2015 when he vacated his R K Nagar assembly constituency here to pave the way for J Jayalalithaa to get elected to the House. She had to quit as Chief Minister in September 2014 after a trial court in Bengaluru sentenced her to four years in prison in a disproportionate assets (DA) case. After the Karnataka High Court acquitted her, she was sworn-in as Chief Minister and got elected to the Assembly from R K Nagar subsequently.    In 2016, Vetrivel was elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly from Perambur constituency here. When Jayalalithaa died in 2016 and her aide V K Sasikala surrendered before the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bengaluru to serve a prison term in the DA case, Vetrivel sided with her nephew Dhinakaran. He was among the 18 MLAs who were disqualified for owing allegiance to Dhinakaran. Vetrivel contested the 2019 by-elections from Perambur as AMMK nominee but could not win.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/former-mla-and-dhinakaran-aide-vetrivel-dies-at-59-902447.html

After six months of closure due to the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, the Centre allowed cinema halls to open from Thursday as part of Unlock 5.0. However, the theatre owners were sceptical about the business prospects after six months of lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus scare. "We are starting only on Friday. So far as I know, all the cinema halls are going to open on Friday as per the decision taken by the cinema hall owners and managers at a meeting on Wednesday," Prakash, the manager of Veeresh Theatre on Magadi Road told P T I. According to him, only new movies are released on Thursday whereas on Friday or weekends, old movies are shown. "Since all are going to show old movies in the theatres, there is no point in opening theatres on Thursday," Prakash added. The manager of Nartaki Theatre too echoed the same views. He said his theatre will start only on October 23. However, most theatres have decided to start showing movies from Friday. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government issued Standard Operating Procedures on Thursday for cinema halls. It said theatres in containment zones will not open. There should be a mandatory distance of six feet between each person and people have to wear masks all the time. The theatre authorities will have to arrange hand sanitisers and thermal screening of movie-goers before letting them in. It asked people to follow the general protocol while sneezing and coughing. The theatre owners have been directed to maintain sufficient time gap between the screening of two movies in the same hall. Also, they have been instructed not to allow more than 50 per cent viewers of the total capacity. The government has asked the theatre owners to prefer payment through netbanking for selling tickets and eatables inside the theatre.P||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/theatres-in-bengaluru-to-resume-operations-from-friday-government-issues-guidelines-902272.html
15-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Holiday season may delay Karnataka’s Covid-19 peak||Increased people’s movement and socialisation during the festive season is projected to add 34,700 active cases to Karnataka’s Covid-19 caseload. This could further delay the peaking of Karnataka’s Covid-19 outbreak, experts said. These numbers will be above the normal caseload of 1.2 lakh new cases expected up to October 27, according to a mathematical modelling study. The assessment comes even as other states and metropolises nationwide have “peaked” and are now showing a reduction in numbers. Contrastingly, Karnataka’s active case numbers have been increasing, despite many discharges. “However, if people adhere to all social distancing regulations during the shopping season, it is likely that we will start to see the beginnings of the peak within three weeks,” said Subramanian Sivakumar of Pratian Technologies, which is using a math model to analyze Covid-19 data. The government expressed caution on the matter. Minister for Health Dr K Sudhakar told DH that he does not “want to speculate about peak or second wave.”  ‘Vaccine may break chain’ On the matter of when we can break the chain of infection, he said it will “only happen after a vaccine is developed. For a large country like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic option. It can be achieved only through mass vaccination. Any other way may prove to be costly and is not at all feasible.” It is expected that crowds will be smaller this festive season. Leela Shivakumar, ex-corporator of Chikpet, said already there is 20% less footfall in the market area when compared to last year. “There is no pickup in trade,” she said. Gajendra Singh Rathore, senior centre director, Phoenix Marketcity Bengaluru, said malls are currently seeing 36% footfall compared to last year, but expects this to rise to 40-50% as the holidays present the first real opportunity for people to celebrate this year. Sivakumar said the actions of Bengalureans will ultimately decide the question of statewide “peaking” as 45% of Karnataka’s daily cases are found in the city.  In districts Sanjeev Mysore, convenor of Jeevan Raksha project, a public-private partnership analyzing Covid-19 trends, said increased socialization during the festival season is common in all districts. Epidemiological analysis in other districts shows 15 districts have an upward moving growth rate. As per a 30-day moving growth rate (MGR) calculation by epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu, Chamarajanagar is the worst hit. It shows a 125% MGR increase. Next is Kodagu which shows 100% increase, followed by Chitradurga, Kolar and BengaluruRural. Ananya Vasudev, Kodagu’s disaster management officer, said the district had been seeing increased number of cases after the inflow of tourists since Unlock 2.0.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/holiday-season-may-delay-karnataka-s-covid-19-peak-902046.html
15-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Covid-19: RT-PCR test errors stump Karnataka||The rise in mysterious cases where patients test negative for RT-PCR but are found to have serious Covid-19 infection through high resolution CT (HRCT) scan has prompted the government to work on a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  This is being done to prevent "false" negative patients from transmitting the infection to others. So far, the state SOP had treatment protocol for four groups: asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, moderately and severely symptomatic. Officials have come across patients with lung-related issues who had tested negative for RT-PCR more than once but later turned positive. They estimate that such cases may be less than 5% of the total Covid cases. Recently, two staff nurses at Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research (SJICR), who had severe fatigue, tested negative for RT-PCR twice, but a CT scan of their lungs showed typical Covid features.  Dr C N Manjunath, state nodal officer for Covid-19 testing and director of SJICR, said, "The nurses responded to Remdesivir and steroid treatment. They tested positive for Covid later, when the RT-PCR test was conducted for the third time." Dr Trilok Chandra, member of the State Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU), said, "This scenario has been in clinical discussion since March. Infection could be in the transition zone. If on the first swab, patients have tested negative but are presenting as SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection) cases, we consider them as Covid suspects and treat them on similar lines as Covid patients are." An HRCT and X-ray is suggested in such cases. Along with HRCT, tests for inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, ferritin, CRP, LDH, IL-6) will also be done. These are tests doctors rely on to assess the severity of Covid. "A repeat RT-PCR test has to be done with a gap of 48 hours if biomarkers and HRCT are positive for Covid. To make it clear to hospitals, we are including it in the SOP by the end of this weekend. SARI cases by definition are serious enough to be hospitalised. So, they cannot be at home or asymptomatic," Chandra said.  Dr Anoop Amarnath, Head, Scientific Board and Chairman-Geriatric Medicine, Manipal Hospital, and another member of state CCSU, said, "Data from districts for SARI cases with CT positive and RT-PCR negative stands at less than 5% of total Covid cases. In such cases, although the preliminary RT-PCR is negative, the HRCT shows 'ground-glassing'. In all the cases that we have seen in this condition, invariably the RT-PCR will come positive after 48 hours." Ground-glass opacity (GGO) is a radiological finding in a CT scan consisting of a hazy opacity that does not obscure the underlying bronchial structures or pulmonary vessels. This in conjunction with positive biomarkers and clinical symptoms like breathlessness and oxygen requirement going up would make them candidates for Covid treatment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-rt-pcr-test-errors-stump-karnataka-902048.html

According to preliminary estimates, agricultural crop losses have occurred on 1,04,418.82 hectares and horticulture crop losses on 3,481.93 hectares.  “I have directed the deputy commissioners to quickly survey losses of human life, animals, homes, crops, roads, bridges and buildings so that compensation can be released immediately,” Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, who is in charge of Kalaburagi and Bagalkot districts, said in a statement.  Karjol, who was down with Covid-19 recently, said doctors had advised against him travelling. “I am constantly in touch with the DCs and I’m getting minute-by-minute updates on the situation. I have issued directions for relief camps to be set up for those displaced with food and water arrangements made for them,” Karjol said.  The Centre has deployed six additional National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and “the situation is under control,” KSDMA commissioner Manoj Rajan said in a note. "Incessant rainfall in Telangana resulted in heavy discharge from Kottur barrage to Karanja dam in Bhalki, Bidar," Rajan said.  Rescue personnel have already conducted operations that include: 19 farmers who were stranded in their field in Garampalli (Kalaburagi) due to the Mullamari river at spate, three people stranded in Mannali (Bidar) because of the spate in Manjira river and seven people stranded in Morarji Desai school in Malkhed (Kalaburagi).||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bs-yediyurappa-to-review-rain-situation-in-karnataka-902278.html
15-10-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Bengaluru riots: Karnataka Congress rejects internal rivalry as reason for attack on its MLA's house||The Congress in Karnataka on Thursday rejected police's attribution of internal party rivalry as the reason for attack on its MLA R Akhanda Srinivas Murthy's house during the violence in parts of the city in August. Blaming the government for the incident, KPCC President D K Shivakumar said allegations were part of the conspiracy against his party and accused the police of acting as agents of the ruling BJP. He also rejected Congress MLA Murthy's (whose house was vandalised) demand for suspension of leaders named in the chargesheet from the party, terming it as "his political agenda." "I'm telling you as far as the D J Halli incident is concerned Congress has nothing to do with it, unnecessarily with an intention to smear black mark on our party, our leaders are being named," Shivakumar said in response to a question. Speaking to reporters here, he alleged that police were functioning like puppets, and the Congress would take up the case politically. Shivakumar asserted that no congress leader was involved in any conspiracy. "BJP leaders and officials are doing it to smear a black mark on Congress party, we will fight it out separately both politically and legally," he added. The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police, which is probing the attack on Murthy's residence during the violence, has charged former mayor Sampath Raj and ex-Pulakeshinagar ward corporator Abdul Rakeeb Zakir, with planning the attack due to political rivalry. CCB has filed an interim charge sheet naming Sampath Raj, Zakir among 60 accused. Asked whether the party will stand with Sampath Raj, Shivakumar said "I will stand by all Congressmen, all of them are innocent." To a question about Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, whose house was attacked, seeking Sampath Raj's suspension from the party, he said, "it may be his political agenda, we are not going to suspend any one." Shivakumar said the party had got an internal inquiry done by three former Home Ministers of the state and senior leaders under the leadership of former Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and they had submitted their report. Asked whether he was accusing his own party MLA (Muthy) of doing politics in the issue, the KPCC chief merely said, "I don't want to comment much.. we will internally take whatever action that needs to be taken." The violence in D J Halli and adjoining areas on August 11 night was unleashed by hundreds of people over a social media post allegedly put out by P Naveen, a relative of Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy. The MLA's residence and a police station at D J Halli were torched by rioters who also set many police and private vehicles afire, and looted the belongings of the legislator and his sister. The National Investigation Agency probing cases relating to violence have questioned two Congress MLAs B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan and Rizwan Arshad to know about what led to the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bengaluru-riots-karnataka-congress-rejects-internal-rivalry-as-reason-for-attack-on-its-mlas-house-902280.html

15-10-2020||West||Kanjurmarg car shed idea was rejected by MVA panel: Fadnavis||The idea of setting up Mumbai Metro-3 car shed at Kanjurmarg as announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, had already been rejected by an expert committee set up by the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday. Thackeray had on Sunday announced relocation of metro car shed from Aarey Colony and said Kanjurmarg land will be available at zero rate for the project. In a series of tweets on the issue, Fadnavis alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has betrayed the citizens of Mumbai by shifting the car shed site and alleged that due to this, the metro rail project will be delayed by four-and-a-half years. "Mumbaikars' betrayal by the MVA govt!- The idea of Mumbai Metro 3 CarShed at Kanjurmarg proposed by Hon CM Uddhav Thackerayji by integrating line 3 & line 6 is already rejected by the expert Committee set up by Hon CM himself!," he said. The BJP leader said that the report by ACS Manoj Saunik-led committee, appointed by the MVA government, said the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) be allowed to proceed with the car shed construction at the present site in Aarey Colony. "Aarey land was the only feasible option to complete the Mumbai Metro project in time, at a reasonable cost & how the environmental impact mitigation made it sustainable," Fadnavis said on Twitter. "Aarey CarShed was planned as green facility with factors like reducing carbon footprints, solar panels, waste water treatment & recycling, LED lighting to reduce energy consumption," he added. The report also said that the project is much more environmentally beneficial than the impact caused due to felling of trees, the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly said. "Our earlier Government in 2015 considered the Kanjurmarg option but due to delays & multiple litigations it was finally decided to give up," he said on the micro-blogging site. "If Kanjurmarg land selected, complications like need for significant changes in MetroLine6 need to be understood. Ongoing works need to be suspended immediately, right from review to redesign to reconstruction need to be done. Moreover, question on possible operationalisation remains!" he said. "Worst suffering for Mumbaikars will be that Metro which was scheduled to be commissioned in December 2021, will be delayed by 4.5 long years! Additionally, looking at present conditions of Kanjurmarg land, ground improvements & filling works need 2 years, that too after award of contract," he added. Shifting of depot at Kanjurmarg would not fully address the requirements of line 3 and it will hamper the frequency of operations of both, line 3 and line 6, he said. He asked why the environment activists were not saying anything even if the car shed is proposed to be set up on "salt pan" land in Kanjurmarg. "I respect all the environmental activists and want to emphasise that CarShed at Aarey was decided when there was no choice left. But now, how would these activists justify CarShed at a salt pan land with mangroves & that too on a reserved forest," he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kanjurmarg-car-shed-idea-was-rejected-by-mva-panel-fadnavis-902019.html

The statement comes amid the backdrop of a raging controversy between the governor and chief minister of Maharashtra on the issue of opening of temples as well as upcoming bypolls to eight assembly polls in the state. Meanwhile, the state government also decided to roll back its decision prohibiting the distribution of prasad at temples during Navratri which was part of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) announced barely five days back. The government has cancelled all garba dances during the festival considered to be the biggest in the state. However, the government has allowed worshipping of goddess Durga during the nine days beginning October 17. The organisers have been asked to follow the SOP which had banned touching the feet of idols or images of the goddess and the distribution of offerings after the poojas. On Wednesday, Minister of State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja said that prasad wrapped in plastic can be distributed. The Congress termed the decision as a political gimmick. "The BJP has no plans at all to tackle any situation. It is simply playing games with people's lives. The ruling party only aims at winning elections by playing with sentiments of both the Hindus and Muslims. The same thing they did during Lord Jagannath Yatra earlier this year," said Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi. He said that the government is only "passing the buck to the trustees of the management but they can't fool peope. Everyone knows that most of the major temples in the state is directly or indirectly run by government or its representatives such as district collectors." As a matter of fact, the Gujarat high court had pulled up the Vijay Rupani-led BJP government for not taking a decision on the annual Lord Jagannath Rathyatra. The court had said that the government was only "appeasing" religious leaders instead of taking "bold and firm" decisions to cancel religious events in view of the coronavirus infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/claiming-temples-not-closed-gujarat-rolls-back-decision-prohibiting-prasad-distribution-during-navratri-902023.html

The top court, however, expressed concern over the trend of Commissioners of police giving interviews on cases. Mumbai police Commissioner Param Bir Singh was named as one of the parties in the plea. He had addressed a press conference on the scam. "Have faith in the Bombay High Court. It is better for you to approach the High Court," a bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud told senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the petitioner. The petitioner questioned the probe by the Mumbai police and sought a direction to the CBI to look into the matter. The bench also pointed out the channel has an office at Worli which is close to Flora Fountain, where the High Court is located. Before the hearing, the Mumbai Police filed its affidavit before the court, opposing the plea for a CBI probe, saying it was a gross abuse of the process of law and the channel can't decide the agency that would probe the case. The response also stated that investigation into a crime can't be a matter of free speech. "Article 19(1)(a) cannot be involved to sidestep, thwart and prevent any investigation. The right of freedom of speech and expression is not a shield which can be used against any crime under the extant criminal law of the land," it said. It also alleged Goswami was threatening and intimidating witnesses. The police also said none of the TV channels in the case have raised any grievance into the probe launched after lodging of FIR on October 6 registered with Kandivali police station and subsequently transferred to the Criminal Investigation Unit with regard to alleged fudging of data on Television Rating Points depicting popularity of a channel.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/trp-scam-supreme-court-asks-republic-media-group-to-approach-bombay-high-court-902181.html

State Tourism Minister Manohar Ajgaonkar told reporters that the Pramod Sawant-led cabinet on Wednesday approved the Tourism Policy-2020, which will give a "proper direction to the industry". "We want good tourists to arrive here. We should not be looked upon as a drug destination. Our attempt is to make Goa a drug-free state," he said. Under the new policy, tourists who arrive in groups and cook in the open spaces would be penalised, he said. The policy also envisages formation of Goa Tourism Board, with the inclusion of stakeholders from the industry to chalk out short and long-term goals for tourism in the state, the minister said. He said the tourism policy aims to promote Goa's beauty and nature, including the hinterland, taking away exclusive focus from the beaches. "The state is known for its heritage and natural beauty. Our focus would be to concentrate on these aspects to attract more tourists," the minister said. The policy would be adopted into a law during the next session of the state Assembly, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/new-tourism-policy-seeks-to-make-goa-free-of-drugs-902205.html

Koshyari is also the governor of Goa. The governor and Thackeray were on Tuesday locked in a bitter war of words after the former pushed for reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and asked the Shiv Sena president whether he has suddenly turned secular. NCP leader Awhad in a tweet on Wednesday said Koshyari is the governor of Goa, where there is a BJP government. "There (in Goa) also temples are shut. Will the governor show his love for temples and write a letter to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant?" he asked in the tweet. After receiving the governor's letter seeking to reopen places of worship, Thackeray had responded to him saying he will consider the request but asserted he does not need the governor's certificate for "my Hindutva". NCP president Sharad Pawar later wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing shock over the "intemperate language" used in the governor's missive to Thackeray. The CPI (M) on Wednesday demanded sacking of Koshyari for "mocking" secularism in his letter to Thackeray.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/will-koshyari-write-to-goa-cm-for-reopening-of-temples-asks-jitendra-awhad-902236.html

His statement comes a day after the state government announced a probe into the Jalyukt Shivar scheme launched by the earlier Devendra Fadnavis-led dispensation. "#CAG report has raised many questions on the quality, cost & results of the Jalyukt Shivar scheme launched by Ex-CM @Dev_Fadnavis Ji. Hence we have decided to hand it over to #SIT for the investigation of irregularities in this scheme & then take further actions accordingly," Deshmukh tweeted. The "Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan", a pet project of Fadnavis, was launched in 2014 with the objective of making Maharashtra drought-free by 2019. The project involved deepening and widening of streams, construction of cement and earthen stop dams, work on nullahs and digging of farm ponds. Shiv Sena, whose president Uddhav Thackeray is now the state Chief Minister, was also a part of the Fadnavis-led government during 2014-2019. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report submitted to the state legislature last month had observed that the scheme, under which Rs 9,633.75 crore were spent, was not much effective. It had little impact in achieving water neutrality and increasing the ground water level and its execution was characterized by lack of transparency, the CAG had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sit-to-probe-irregularities-in-jalyukt-scheme-deshmukh-902245.html

The BJP has escalated its attack on Thackeray following a war of words between him and Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari after the latter wrote to the CM seeking to reopen of places of worship in the state and asked the Shiv Sena chief whether he has suddenly turned secular. Thackeray on Tuesday responded to Koshyari's letter saying he will consider the request but asserted he does not need the governor's certificate for "my Hindutva". Bhatkhalkar in his letter said, "The Chief Minister of Maharashtra who says he does not need anyone's certificate to prove his Hindutva credentials should take a courageous step to shut down the state-funded madrasas that propagate radical religious teachings." "These institutions do not offer any modern education, and offer teachings of only one religion. It is wrong to run such institutions on taxpayers' money," he claimed. Bhatkhalkar also said students from the Muslim community should be offered a direct scholarship so that they can attend mainstream schools. "I congratulate the Assam government for taking a similar decision," said the BJP MLA from north Mumbai. He said Shia Waqf Board chief Wasim Rizvi has already made a similar demand to the Prime Minister to ban madrasas and offer scholarships to students and religious preachers.

Authorities of some libraries said that in view of the pandemic, they would implement measures like allowing only a limited number of people inside at a time and restricting the entry of senior citizens and children. As per the guidelines issued by the government, all the state-run and private libraries have been allowed to reopen. A librarian in suburban Mumbai said the reopening of libraries was long-pending. "We used to get phone calls from our members asking when the operations of the library would resume as most of the activities have already restarted in June," she said. Manjiri Vaidya of Shridhar Vasudev Phatak Library affiliated to the Vile Parle-based Lokmanya Seva Sangh told PTI that the library would start functioning from Monday. "We held a meeting today to discuss the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the government. Children and senior citizens will not be allowed inside the library and the list of SOPs will be displayed on the notice board," she said. "We will allow only five members inside at a time and request them to leave at the earliest so that other members can enter. We will also note down the names of these members at the time of their entry after carrying out their Covid-19 screening," she added. Visti Balaporia, president of the Asiatic Society library in south Mumbai said the managing committee will meet on Friday to discuss the process of reopening. "The reopening of the library after more than six months cannot be done overnight. Our staff is our priority since they come from different parts of the city and suburbs as well as Mumbai metropolitan region. We have to first think about the sanitization process and maintaining cleanliness, hygiene in the premises," she said. Balaporia said in the last six months, a few staffers would visit the library, especially during monsoon to ensure there is no leakage.

It said Niketa Baldevbhai Dave, director of Pentium Infotech Ltd and Hiram Biotech Ltd, has been arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and a local court in Ahmedabad sent her to ED custody till October 17. The central probe agency said in a statement that Dave, another director of these firms- Pratik R Shah- and others allegedly "committed fraud of Rs 25.25 crore with the Ahmedabad People's Cooperative Bank Ltd (APCBL)" and were first booked by the CID-crime branch of the Gujarat Police in May, 2009. The ED filed a criminal case of money laundering based on this FIR. The ED claimed it probe found that "Shah and Dave, being the directors of Pentium Infotech Ltd and Hirak Biotech Ltd, opened FDOD (overdraft accounts against fixed deposits) loan accounts in APCBL and these companies defaulted on payment causing loss of Rs 25.25 crore to the bank." "Twenty IBL accounts with Rs 50 lakh sanctioned to each account were also opened from APCBL by Shah in the name of his office staff, firms, associates, out of which Dave applied for loan for seven out of 20 firms namely S J Securities Ltd, Pioneer Mercantile Ltd, Vitale Bio Science Ltd, Satark Real Estate Ltd, Jupiter Business Ltd, Lakshya securities and Credit Holding Ltd and Arihant Jewellers," it said. Probe found that Shah and Dave had "passed a board resolution on February 25 authorising the latter to sign, deal, sell, transfer and dispose non-agricultural land held in the name of Hirak Biotech Ltd (located at Sachana)." "On the basis of the resolution Dave executed sale deeds in March transferring the properties of Hirak Biotech Ltd without receiving any consideration," the ED alleged.

The company said one of its "key sites" in Pune's Kalyani Nagar area got flooded because of the heavy showers resulting in the "partial disruption in services" for subscribers across the state. Unlike tower infrastructure, which serves subscribers in a local area, the site was serving people across the telecom circle which affected the subscribers in the state. “Our technical team is working dedicatedly to fully restore the services soon,” the company said in a social media post. A lot of users took to social media to vent their frustration as the services snapped. Maharashtra, one of the most industrialised states, is a key telecom market and the disruption comes at a time when the competition is very intense in the telcos space where Vodafone Idea is ceding subscribers to its two rivals.  Pune and other parts of Western  Maharashtra have been experiencing a heavy downpour since Wednesday evening and some low lying areas of the city have also reported water logging.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/vodafone-idea-services-in-maharashtra-partially-disrupted-as-key-site-in-pune-gets-flooded-902295.html

In the last couple of days, heavy rains lashed several parts of the state, including Pune, Solapur and Kolhapur. A few villages in Solapur's Mohol tehsil have been flooded and teams the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), district disaster management cell have been deployed to evacuate stranded people, an official from the district administration said. The NDRF also said it has deployed one team to evacuate people stranded in some remote areas of Mohol tehsil. "Around 50 people who were stranded in remote areas of Ghatni and Kharkhatne villages in the tehsil have so far been evacuated with the help of the NDRF team," the district administration official said. He said the NDRF, teams of the district disaster management cell and local administration are also moving to other flood-affected villages to shift the people stuck there to safer places. The district received 79 mm rainfall on Wednesday, the official added. The evacuation work is going on in several parts of the district since Wednesday night, Superintendent of Police Tejasvi Satpute said.

State Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday ordered a probe into it and instructed that an offence of culpable homicide be filed against those responsible for it. In Pune, four people were swept away by a swollen stream in Khanota village on Wednesday while they were trying to cross the water body on two motorcycles, an official from Daund police station said. "We recovered three bodies on Thursday morning and search is one for the fourth person," he said. Several low-lying areas in Pune experienced waterlogging on Wednesday night after heavy showers. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune city received 96 mm rainfall on Wednesday. The IMD has predicted moderate rainfall with isolated heavy showers coupled with thunderstorm in Pune and neighbouring areas in the next couple of days. A fire brigade official said they received 35 to 40 calls of water-logging and tree fall from different parts of Pune city. "Several societies in low-lying areas experienced water-logging," he said. Traffic on the Pune-Solapur Highway was disrupted for more than an hour on Wednesday evening after parts of the road were flooded due to incessant rains.

15-10-2020||West||Low pressure over Maharashtra to move over Arabian sea, intensify in next 48 hours: IMD||Low pressure over south-central Maharashtra and south Konkan is likely to move over the Arabian Sea and intensify into a depression in the next 48 hours, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. Under the influence of this cyclonic circulation, heavy rains are expected over the ghat areas of Maharashtra, Konkan and south Gujarat during the next two days, the IMD said. Western Maharashtra and coastal districts have been receiving heavy rains since Wednesday resulting in damage to property and lives. "Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at isolated places would occur over Konkan and Goa and adjoining ghat areas of Maharashtra. Extremely heavy falls (more than 20 cm per day) are also likely over south Konkan and adjoining ghat areas of Maharashtra," the IMD said on the expected rainfall on Thursday. For Friday, the IMD said light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at isolated places would occur over Konkan and Goa and heavy falls at isolated places over coastal districts of south Gujarat. "Well marked low pressure area persists over south Madhya Maharashtra and adjoining south Konkan. "It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and emerge into east-central Arabian Sea off Maharashtra coast and concentrate into a depression over east-central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea off Maharashtra – south Gujarat coasts during next 48 hours," the IMD said. A deep depression that had developed over the Bay of Bengal battered Andhra Pradesh and Telangana earlier this week. Its intensity reduced to depression and low pressure area before moving over Maharashtra. A low pressure area is the first stage of any cyclone. However, it is not necessary that every low pressure intensifies into a cyclone. The IMD said strong wind speed reaching 20-30 kilometres per hour, gusting to 40 kmph, is very likely to prevail around the system's centre over central Maharashtra during next 12 hours and gradually decrease thereafter. Strong winds with speed reaching 25-35 kmph, gusting to 45 kmph, are likely to prevail over east central and northeast Arabian Sea and along and off Maharashtra, Goa and south Gujarat coasts during next 12 hours. It would increase, becoming squally with wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph and gusting to 60 kmph east central and northeast Arabian Sea and along and off Maharashtra, Goa and south Gujarat coasts from the evening of October 15, the IMD said. It would further increase becoming 50-60 kmph and gusting to 70 kmph over east-central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea and along and off Maharashtra and Gujarat coasts from evening of October 16 and winds with speed 55–65 kmph, gusting to 75 kmph, over the same area from evening of October 17. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea as conditions will be "rough to very rough" over east-central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea and along and off Maharashtra & Gujarat coasts from Wednesday evening till October 18, the IMD said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/low-pressure-over-maharashtra-to-move-over-arabian-sea-intensify-in-next-48-hours-imd-902345.html

"Bollywood enjoys a following and popularity across the globe. In many respects, it’s on par with Hollywood. The film industry also generates huge employment. In the last few days, attempts have been made to malign the image of the film industry by certain quarters which are painful. Moves to finish off the industry or move it elsewhere will not be tolerated at any cost," he said without naming anyone. Thackeray described the attempts to defame Bollywood as “painful”. The statement of Thackeray, the Shiv Sena President, assumes significance in the wake of the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the series of events that followed. Thackeray, his son and state’s Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray and the Sena-NCP-Congress government too have been on the line of fire by certain groups and organizations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/won-t-tolerate-attempts-to-finish-off-bollywood-says-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-902347.html
