The content is of varied kinds, including news and current affairs, films and OTT platforms, and the fear is that the present move may lead to government control over all digital and online media. That fear is shared by those who are associated with the media and others who are its consumers. The government has in the past given indications of some regulation of online media. Questions have been raised as to why video streaming services cannot be subjected to some advance scrutiny and certification when films have to go through vetting by the Central Board of Film Certification. What is of greater public interest is the regulation sought to be imposed on other online and digital media, especially those that purvey news.  The order has brought the very popular and active new media sectors which deal with news and views under a government department’s supervisory authority. The constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and expression is involved here. The print and electronic media, which also handle news and views, self-regulate and the Press Council of India exercises oversight. But the dynamism and reach of the new media forums and the fact that they can be relatively easily set up by even a few people may have been the reasons for the government to think of regulating and exercising control over them. But normal laws like the IPC and the CrPC, with provisions relating to defamation, and a number of other laws are applicable to them, as in the case of conventional and electronic media. Online news sites and OTT platforms also exercise self-regulation. The need for a new regulatory initiative is thus not clear.  The government had made such a move in 2018 and withdrawn it in the face of protests. But the environment in the country is more conducive to controlling the media now because freedoms and citizens’ rights have been weakened and attacks on them have increased. Many journalists and critics of the government have been attacked and arrested and some of them have faced sedition charges. Internet and other communication facilities have been denied to the people of Kashmir for over a year. In view of all this, the government’s move to regulate digital and online media is an attempt to control the media and to curb free speech. It is not yet clear whether and how the new order is applicable to Facebook, Twitter, etc. In any case, it does not bode well for the future of free speech, which is essential for democracy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/bid-to-curb-media-free-speech-916932.html
18-11-2020||In Perspective||Tolstoy remains an enduring influence in India||Even today, 110 years after his death, Leo Tolstoy’s books continue to have a profound influence on thousands of people across the world. Most book lovers invariably have at least one or two masterpieces of the great Russian writer on their bookshelves – perhaps War and Peace or Anna Karenina. So, it was not surprising that Indian activist Vernon Gonsalves had a copy of War and Peace among his many books. But what astonished many was, when in August last year, the Pune police cited War and Peace as part of the “highly incriminating evidence” it has seized from the home of Gonsalves, accused of inciting violence in Koregaon Bhima in 2018. Also, the Bombay High Court asked Gonsalves why he kept “objectionable material such as books like War and Peace”. Then, barely a few days later, Prime Minister Modi, addressing an economic forum in Russia said that Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi had an “indelible effect” on each other and that India and Russia must take inspiration from them to strengthen bilateral ties. Howsoever one perceives Tolstoy and his books – objectionable or inspiring -- there is no doubt that he was a powerful writer, and his books have an enduring appeal. More so, in the time of the ongoing pandemic that has seen sales of his books soar. Curiously enough, just as much as Tolstoy’s books have had an influence on Indian readers, India also had a strong impact on Tolstoy. He became interested in Indian thought as a young man and started reading about it. Indian ideas had a part in Tolstoy’s philosophy, and he adapted Indian stories into Russian. Later, he also became interested in the thoughts of Vivekananda and Ramakrishna and had several contacts and admirers in India such as Tagore and Gandhi. A letter written by Tolstoy in 1908 to the Indian revolutionary Taraknath Das, following the latter’s request for support from Tolstoy for India’s independence, is indicative of the influence of Indian philosophy and religions on Tolstoy. In the letter, Tolstoy quotes from the Vedas and the Upanishads as well as excerpts from Lord Krishna’s teachings and stresses on the importance of love as the only source of freedom from every form of enslavement. The letter was later passed on to Gandhi, who translated it from Russian and published it in an Indian newspaper, Free Hindustan. The letter was then published in the form of a slim book titled Letter to a Hindu with a foreword by Gandhi. Thus, began a series of correspondence between the two. “I read your book with great interest,” Tolstoy later wrote of Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj (“Indian Home Rule”) “because I think that the question you treat in it – passive resistance – is a question of the greatest importance not only for India but for the whole of humanity.” In early 1909, Tolstoy had received the third volume of Vivekananda’s works and within a few months, he told an editor of a prominent Russian publishing house that Vivekananda was the most eminent of modern Indian thinkers and he should be published in Russian. Tolstoy and Gandhi exchanged seven letters in 1909-10. Tolstoy was one of the sources of inspiration for Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence. Gandhi was greatly influenced by Tolstoy’s book The Kingdom of God is Within You and his essay on Christianity and Patriotism. Tolstoy’s ideal of simplicity of life and purity of purpose influenced Gandhi deeply and no wonder, when he started an ashram on a 1,000-acre farm in Johannesburg in 1910 for his Satyagraha campaign to protest discrimination against Indians, he named it Tolstoy Farm. Meanwhile, Tolstoy’s literary output as well as the philosophy of his later years became popular reading in India, mainly through English translations as well as through Indian languages. Noted litterateur D Javare Gowda has translated at least three major works of Tolstoy into Kannada. What is so unique about Tolstoy’s books that continue to remain on people’s reading list? Is it War and Peace, frequently cited as the greatest novel ever written; long, unconventional and with over 500 characters that explores the French invasion of Russia and its impact on Russian society? Or is it Anna Karenina, the family drama that deals with love and betrayal? Or, perhaps Resurrection, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, A Confession, Hadji Murat or How Much Land Does a Man Need? Is it his search for truth and God, the moralistic voice of right and wrong, the non-resistance to evil?  The reasons may differ, but most readers will agree with the assessment of British poet Matthew Arnold that “a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.” To end, a memorable line from Tolstoy: “We can only know that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.” (The writer is a senior journalist)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/tolstoy-remains-an-enduring-influence-in-india-916934.html

"If the government fails to set up the Corporation, a protest will be staged across the state," former MLC Ivan D’Souza warned on Wednesday. The community members had been demanding setting up of the Corporation for the past five years. The previous coalition government, while presenting the budget in 2019-20, had announced the setting up of the Corporation and an amount of Rs 200 crore was also earmarked. The decision to scrap the Corporation, approved in the Cabinet and announced in the budget by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, is an injustice to the Christian community, D'Souza said The chief minister should elaborate on reasons for scrapping the Corporation. The Christian community has its presence in 27 districts in the state. The poor labourers from Kalaburagi, Raichur, Ballari and other North Karnataka districts hail from the community, he said. "Doesn't the government want any development in this community?'' he asked. He said corporations were set up for communities that have a population between 5 lakh to 10 lakh in state. When Veerashaiva Lingayat community with a population of 1.20 crore placed a demand, the CM announced a separate body for the community within 24 hours. "Why was Christian community neglected?" he asked. The former MLC said that scholarships for the students from the Christian community were also cancelled. The financial assistance given for Christian youth to purchase taxi was reduced to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 5 lakh. The financial assistance for self-employment was reduced while Ganga Kalyana Yojana for the community members too was abandoned. Funds have not been released for the development of the community in the past two years, he charged. Ivan said an action plan would be chalked out to stage a protest after discussing with community leaders against the move of the government. Corporators Lancelot Pinto, Naveen D’Souza among others were also present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/set-up-christian-development-corporation-immediately-say-leaders-from-the-community-in-karnataka-917227.html

Government schools registered 15% increase in admissions this academic year and five schools, which were closed due to lack of students, reopened this year. As many as 3,538 students have joined government schools from private institutions across the district. The district has a total of nine education blocks, Mysuru Rural, Mysuru North, Mysuru South, T Narasipur, HD Kote, Nanjangud, Periyapatna, Hunsur and KR Nagar.

All government schools have maintained the quality of education and the parents should understand it. Following the outbreak of Covid, school teachers took extra care for students and their studies. Now, parents are coming forward to send their children to government schools.   This academic year, admission to class I has increased by 10%, compared to last year. Each school has more than 20 students and the numbers are likely to be increased in coming years, said an officer.    According to a teacher, many parents are under financial crisis due to Covid. “Thus, they are admitting their children to government schools, as they do not want to pay donations to private schools. Our school gets 10 new admissions and a majority of the students were studying in private schools in cities and towns. Now, their parents have returned to villages and have admitted their children to government schools,” she said. While three schools reopened in HD Kote takuk, one school each opened in Nanjangud and KR Nagar taluk.

18-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Bandipur Tiger Project completes 47 years||The Bandipur Tiger Project, which was announced to protect tigers, completed 47 years, as on November 17. The then Chief Minister D Devaraj Urs announced Tiger Project on November 17, 1973, to safeguard the wild cats. Venugopalaswamy Wildlife Park and surrounding forests were declared as National Park on February 19, 1941. In 1973, there were 13 tigers, when Tiger Project was announced. According to the information of the Forest department officials, there are 126 to 167 tigers now in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The area was expanded and was renamed Bandipur National Park in 1985, when it measured 874.20 square km. Later, more forest area was included. The Bandipur Tiger Reserve is now 912.04 square km. Environmentalists and wildlife enthusiasts said, “The Union government, led by Indira Gandhi, took a decision in this regard, to protect tigers. The Tiger Project has been successful to save tigers as the forest cover was shrinking due to an increase in the population. The population of elephants is also on the rise, and it is estimated that there are more than 1,500 elephants here. The tiger population is also on the rise every year, and even spotted on the fringes of the forest in recent years. The new director of Bandipur Tiger Project S R Natesh said, “November 17, is an important day and there are plans to hold a programme in this regard.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/bandipur-tiger-project-completes-47-years-917249.html
18-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Decision on Karnataka cabinet expansion in two to three days: B S Yediyurappa||A decision on expansion of the Karnataka cabinet will be taken in the next two-three days, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said after meeting BJP national president J P Nadda here on Wednesday. Yediyurappa, along with Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, met Nadda in the national capital and explained to him the need to accommodate new faces in the cabinet. "I have informed (Nadda) about the need to undertake at the earliest the cabinet expansion to accommodate new faces. He (Nadda) said (he) will discuss the issue and get back in the next two-three days," Yediyurappa told reporters after the meeting. The chief minister further said he also discussed the isue of development of the state with the party chief. Nadda informed Yediyurappa that he would visit Karnataka next month as part of his countrywide tour. Asked if it would be cabinet expansion or reshuffle, Yediyurappa said, "It will depend on the direction given by Naddaji." Political activity has intensified within the ruling BJP camp in the state ever since Yediyurappa indicated on November 10 soon after the party's victory in bypolls to two assembly constituencies that cabinet reshuffle is on cards. The chief minister had said he would soon be proceeding to New Delhi to discuss with the party's central leadership and get their approval, as he hinted about reshuffle by dropping or inducting some ministers. The cabinet reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. While several of the old guards like eight-time MLA Umesh Katti are waiting for a chance to be inducted into the ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP return to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa would also have to keep space for Munirathna following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the bypoll, also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant. Several legislators have openly declared their aspirations, also political hobnobbing is taking place within the BJP circles.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/decision-on-karnataka-cabinet-expansion-in-two-to-three-days-b-s-yediyurappa-917209.html
18-11-2020||Main Article||Indo-US ties: Challenges on economic front||As President-elect Joe Biden makes his first moves toward the White House without garnering a concession from the incumbent, it is time to assess the real import of the choice that American voters have made. This choice, and the very nature of it, will have an impact on how the global order shapes up in the coming years. For all the talk of American decline, the way most of the world has been obsessed with the Trump versus Biden contest underscores the influence America continues to wield around the globe. In fact, China and Russia, two nations who never get tired of telling the world that the US is no longer the world’s superpower, waited and watched till the last votes were counted to officially congratulate the victor! The global economic order has undergone a significant transformation in the last few years. The Trump presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic have accentuated certain trends, with nations moving towards de-globalisation, greater protectionism and attempts toward economic decoupling from China.  Trump, in particular, used tariffs liberally to challenge what he considered unfair trade advantages. For the leader of a nation that laid the foundation of modern-day economic globalisation, he was unapologetic in talking about ‘American First.’ He was derisive of multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, covering 40% of the global economy, in 2017. By instinct, Biden is an internationalist who believes in the value of free trade and multilateralism. But the US of today is not the America of the 1990s, the high noon of liberal internationalism. While Trump may have lost, Trumpism is alive and well, with almost half of American voters continuing to repose their faith in Trump. The political import of this message would not be lost on Biden, especially as the US Senate may remain in Republican hands. And Biden was signaling even during his campaign that he was listening to the message delivered by American voters when they dashed Hillary Clinton’s chances for the presidency. As a result, he has been talking of “Buy American”, of penalising companies that move jobs offshore, and of taking a tough stand against China. A Biden presidency will certainly see the US rejoining multilateral frameworks. It will also entail reaching out to American allies and working closely with them to ensure that China is challenged wherever possible. But it’s very likely that in the end, it might all just be about style while substantively the challenges remain the same. This is especially true of a country like India, which has faced trade challenges vis-à-vis the US much before Trump was anywhere on the scene. Trump was more upfront about it and publicly challenged India by terminating India’s designation as a beneficiary developing nation under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) trade programme, arguing that New Delhi had not assured the US that it will provide “equitable and reasonable access” to its markets. The Trump administration also levied tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, to which India retaliated with its own set of tariffs. For Biden, these changes would be easy to make in order to revert to status quo ante, but it also now becomes almost impossible to conclude a mini trade deal, which the two nations had been negotiating for months and were reportedly close to finalising it. A Biden administration will reopen the negotiations and would like to make them much broader, which will certainly lead to them going nowhere for the foreseeable future. Where India would certainly benefit is by the US under Biden becoming a champion of economic globalisation once again. India has been a major beneficiary of the global economic order and if it gets frayed, then for an emerging economic power, challenges can only surmount. And if Biden can bring the US economy back on track, that’s certainly good news for India. The two major democracies of the world share a robust economic relationship, with the US being India’s top trading partner in goods and services as well as the fifth biggest source of FDI. More significantly, India enjoys a trade surplus with the US, albeit one that has been shrinking in recent years. India has been working towards this by increasing oil and gas imports from the US, thereby assuring Washington that New Delhi, too, sees value in a ‘balanced’ trade relationship. But while Biden will challenge China on trade in concert with other powers, India will have to factor in the challenge that will emerge once again if the US decides to rejoin the TPP. A Biden presidency, which is likely to be more predictable, works well for India in charting out a strategic response to the challenges posed by the US on trade and economic front. And given the economic complementarities, a US which can get its economic groove back helps India as well by stimulating global demand. But whether a Biden presidency heralds a long-term shift in American economic policy is an issue where caution is perhaps the best response at the moment. On trade and immigration, it is more likely that while stylistically, a Biden presidency will be much different from Trump’s, substantively there is likely to be more continuity than change, given the underlying shifts in the American political landscape. The message from the American voter to its political class is quite clear: American policymakers should first look at their domestic challenges and adopt policies to respond to them adequately before turning their attention at remaking the world in America’s image. The US is divided and the Democratic Party that Biden leads now is fractured as well. A Biden presidency will first have to heal American divisions before it can meaningfully hope to chart out an expansive global agenda.

18-11-2020||National||AAP says BJP falsely accusing Kejriwal govt of not allowing Chhath celebration||The AAP on Tuesday claimed that the BJP was doing politics and falsely accusing the Arvind Kejriwal government of not allowing Chhath Puja celebrations in the city. The AAP's reaction came after the Delhi BJP intensified its demand for lifting of ban on Chhath Puja at river banks, temples and other public places here, with its Purvanchal Morcha staging a protest near Kejriwal's residence. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has instructed officials to ensure that Chhath Puja this year is not performed at public places, river banks and temples in view of the Covid-19 pandemic   AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said the BJP should get permission from Home Minister Amit Shah to celebrate Chhath Puja and the Aam Aadmi Party will ensure the celebration. "The BJP at one side has issued guidelines to stop the celebration in public but the same BJP on the other side is defaming the Delhi government by saying that the Aam Aadmi Party government is not allowing Chhath celebration in Delhi. This kind of politics is utterly shameful," Pathak said. "Today, the Aam Aadmi Party demands that the BJP immediately get the permission to celebrate Chhath Puja from Home Minister Amit Shah and the Delhi government will coordinate in the following process to ensure the celebration. The state governments right now are completely following the guidelines issued by the central government," he added. Pathak said his party believes that BJP leaders should change the guidelines regarding performing the puja by Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning. He said party leaders will meet Kejriwal and ensure the celebration. "But the BJP should stop politicising the issue," he said. Delhi BJP Purvanchal Morcha president Kaushal Mishra said no Purvanchali had thought that the chief minister would ban Chhath Puja and their religious tradition, forcing them to protest.   Kumar said Kejriwal is "insulting" the religious faith and tradition of the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.   "How will the Purvanchalis in Delhi, who have a house of 25 yards or who live in a rented house, give Arghya to the Sun during Chhath Mahaparva?" he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aap-says-bjp-falsely-accusing-kejriwal-govt-of-not-allowing-chhath-celebration-916881.html
18-11-2020||National||PM Modi, US President-elect Biden discuss strategic partnership, Covid-19 and climate change||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday spoke to the United States President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday and discussed the ways to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to reaffirming commitment to India-US cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. This was the first interaction between the two leaders after Democrat Biden defeated incumbent president Donald Trump in the US presidential election. "Spoke to US President-elect Joe Biden on phone to congratulate him. We reiterated our firm commitment to the Indo-US strategic partnership and discussed our shared priorities and concerns -- COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific Region," Modi said in a tweet. The prime minister also conveyed his congratulations to US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. “I also conveyed warm congratulations for VP-elect @KamalaHarris. Her success is a matter of great pride and inspiration for members of the vibrant Indian-American community, who are a tremendous source of strength for Indo-US relations,” he added in another tweet. Modi was among the foreign leaders who were quick to congratulate Biden and his Indian-American running mate Harris on Twitter soon after the US media on November 7 declared the duo winners of the elections to the offices of the President and the Vice President. The Prime Minister did not wait for outgoing President Donald Trump to concede defeat, notwithstanding the bonhomie the two leaders often displayed in public and talked about. Modi congratulated Biden on his election, describing it as a testament to the strength and resilience of democratic traditions in the United States, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement. The prime minister warmly recalled his earlier interactions with Biden, including during his official visits to the US in 2014 and 2016, it said. Biden had chaired the Joint Session of the US Congress that was addressed by Modi during his 2016 visit to the United States, the PMO said. The two leaders agreed to work closely to further advance the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, built on shared values and common interests, it added. They also discussed their priorities, including containing the Covid-19 pandemic, promoting access to affordable vaccines, tackling climate change and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific Region, the PMO said. The interaction between the two leaders came on a day External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar exuded confidence that the ties between India and the US will expand further under Biden's administration, noting that the US president-elect was part of the period when the bilateral relations underwent a radical transformation. Biden is known to be a strong proponent of closer India-US ties since his days as a senator in the 1970s and played a key role in getting the approval of the Senate for the bilateral civil nuclear deal in 2008. In the midst of hectic negotiations between the two countries to conclude the civil nuclear deal, Biden was a critical ally of India in the Senate. The deal had laid a strong foundation for the deepening of ties between the two leading democracies of the world. The strategic and defence ties between India and the US witnessed major expansion during Barack Obama's presidency and Biden, as the vice president, had played a key role in it.

18-11-2020||National||Congress favours total lockdown of markets, public transport in Delhi to check Covid spike||The Congress on Tuesday sought immediate steps to check the spread of coronavirus in the national capital and favoured a complete lockdown of markets, public transport and government offices, instead of a partial one. Congress senior spokesperson Ajay Maken said the Covid situation in the national capital is "very bad" as "one in every five persons" infected by Covid-19 is from Delhi. He said there cannot be a worse decision than Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's proposal to impose partial lockdown in markets and hotspots in Delhi as it would lead to the virus spreading faster to other areas and markets. Terming it as a knee-jerk reaction, he said, "There should be a complete lockdown and not partial." "Kejriwal ji's idea to selectively close markets in Delhi is disastrous. By doing so, he will concentrate crowds to a select few markets," he said. "We urge the government to shut all offices in Delhi and promote 'work from home'. We also urge the government to shut public transport including metro and DTC buses to prevent the further spread of the virus," Maken said, adding that these steps should not be linked to the economy as lives are more important. He also alleged that both the Centre and the Delhi government were "playing games" instead of adding medical infrastructure in the capital. Addressing a virtual press conference, he accused the Delhi government of having "misplaced priorities" as it was spending crores of rupees on "self-promotional" advertisements. He accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of spending over Rs 32 crore on advertisements to promote himself during the festival and said the amount could have been utilised to add more ICU beds in Delhi. "It is unfortunate that one in every five coronavirus-infected persons is from Delhi. Delhi has by far the highest number of Covid cases and deaths in the country and we are even much ahead and worse than countries like the UK, France and Brazil," he told reporters. Maken said while the national average of Covid cases per million was 6,407, Delhi was five times more infected with 29,140 cases per million. "Instead of fighting the coronavirus, the Delhi and central governments are playing games and are not focussing on controlling the virus. "Neither are they adding more ICU beds in Delhi. The knee-jerk reaction of the Delhi government is responsible for the current state of affairs in the national capital," he alleged. The former Delhi Congress chief said while Delhi desperately needed more beds, ICUs and ventilators, "Kejriwal rather chose to blow off Rs 32 crore on Diwali publicity and stunts". Delhi has seen a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past week and it is expected to rise further after the festival season.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-favours-total-lockdown-of-markets-public-transport-in-delhi-to-check-covid-spike-916885.html

"India condemns all forms of anti-semitism and all forms of discrimination on religious grounds anywhere in the world. We now have countries taking advantage of the ongoing pandemic and spreading divisive hatred to other parts of the world on the basis of religion," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said. "Covid has not prevented them from supporting cross-border terrorism to kill innocent people and spread religious hatred,” he added, without naming any country. Tirumurti said India calls on those countries to stop spreading anti-semitism and hatred and stop dividing the world on the basis of religion. "We ask them to look inwards to promote harmony within their own societies, stop sectarian violence and ensure the protection of minorities. We believe it is important for the United Nations to speak decisively and not take sides with one group of religions vis-a-vis the others or justify terrorism in any way," he said. Tirumurti was addressing the virtual high-level event by World Jewish Congress on combating anti-semitism. India co-sponsored the online side event, which was held in partnership with the Permanent Mission of the Germany to the UN in collaboration with Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Romania, Slovakia and Uruguay. He said India is a country which is home to all major religions of the world and is a nation that has given birth to several religions -- the most prominent of them being Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. "I also come from a country which does not have any trace of anti-semitism,” Tirumurti said, highlighting India’s thriving Jewish community that goes back more than 2,000 years. He said the Jewish community is an integral part of the pluralistic fabric of India, and it has enriched this fabric as much as any other community. "In this river called Indian civilization, every faith and every denomination is embraced in the framework of our democratic structure, pluralism, harmony and mutual acceptance,” the Indian diplomat said. Tirumurti also highlighted the numerous milestones over the period of 2,000 years of Jewish community in India -- from the Jewish community being granted sanctuary by the Hindu Maharaja of Cochin Rama Varma in Kerala when it faced persecution from some European powers in the 16th century and the King of Jamnagar Maharaja Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja who in 1942 provided refuge and protection to more than 1,000 Polish children, including Jewish children when they were denied entry by other countries, bringing them up as his own. Tirumurti also spoke about the “dastardly" Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008 carried out by Pakistani terrorists. He said the whole of India prayed for baby Moshe Holtzberg, who was saved by his Indian caregiver, Sandra Samuel, when terrorists stormed Nariman House and killed the little baby’s father Rabbi Gavriel and mother Rivka, who was five months pregnant at the time. He added that there are many well known Jewish-Indians who have distinguished themselves in all walks of life, including General J F R Jacob, a national hero in India who led the Eastern Command of the Indian Army during India's victory in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. The World Jewish Congress held the high-level online event on the role of the UN in combating antisemitism as a side event to the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Antisemitism poses a threat to democratic values, peace and stability, and the World Jewish Congress has long worked with the United Nations to ensure that the fight against antisemitism is a priority of the UN's human rights agenda, a statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-has-not-prevented-some-countries-from-supporting-cross-border-terrorism-india-hits-out-at-pak-916888.html
18-11-2020||National||Pads for peace: Indian activists woo women fighters with period products||I ndian peace activists have come up with an unusual way to engage with leftist fighters waging a decades-long insurgency in one of the country's poorest states - send them sanitary napkins. Women make up a large proportion of the guerrillas fighting government forces in the jungles of central and eastern India, an intractable conflict that one former prime minister called the biggest internal security challenge since independence. Numbering in the tens of thousands, they say they are fighting for the rights of poor farmers and landless labourers. This month, a group of activists in the central state of Chhattisgarh called the New Peace Process began distributing reusable napkins and menstrual cups to about 2,500 women fighters in a bid to engage them in peace efforts. "Can we break violence and start talking? We are trying to create an environment against violence and violent politics and bring peace," organiser Shubhranshu Chowdhary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "The activists believe that once these women convince their male counterparts, the process of engaging with the peace process may become possible." Chowdhary said the idea, timed to coincide with the Diwali festival, was inspired by a scheme to engage rebels in Colombia by sending them Christmas presents. Indian police, often the targets of attacks by the guerrilla fighters known as Naxalites after the village in West Bengal state where the movement began, gave a guarded response. "From the state point of view, we would engage if someone totally discards violence and comes back to the national mainstream," said senior police officer Sunderraj P. "At the same time, if someone is still fighting inside the jungle against the state, we cannot afford to make their lives so comfortable." Many Indian women lack access to sanitary products - a government health survey in 2015/16 found only about one in three used napkins, while the rest made do with rags. Sneha Mishra, secretary of women's rights group Aaina, welcomed the initiative but said any such outreach programmes should include the government. "The initiative is good, and the women are much more disadvantaged, but civil society organisation must speak to the government," she said. (Reporting by Jatindra Dash, Editing by Claire Cozens.

18-11-2020||National||Child rights experts highlight need to understand full impact of coronavirus pandemic||Ahead of the World Children's Day on November 20, child rights experts on Monday highlighted the need to understand the full impact of coronavirus pandemic and invest more time, resources and efforts to protect the children from it impact. The call was made during an online media panel discussion, organized by UNICEF in partnership with the Foreign Correspondents Club of South Asia (FCC). The session titled 'Impact of COVID-19 Crisis on the Lives of Children in India', drew attention to children's health, their protection and on the learning crisis, to reimagine a more sustainable, safer world for children after the pandemic. While delivering her keynote address, Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative, said the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded as a child rights crisis. "Through rising poverty and inequality, the pandemic has upended essential services that protect health, education and safety of children and young people. We need to adopt a whole of society child-centric approach as the costs of the pandemic on children are immediate and can persist for years, if not addressed," she said. Referring to the health crisis, the UNICEF India Representative said, "We know that health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, however we must not allow our fight against one deadly disease to come at the expense of our fight against other preventable diseases. This means ensuring the continuity of immunization services to prevent all vaccine-preventable diseases even as we address the growing pandemic." UNICEF also shared the results of Wave-2, a Community Based Monitoring (CBM) mechanism on socio-economic impact of the pandemic on marginalized populations during the period August–September 2020. Drawing attention to the impact digital divide has had on children, particularly when only a quarter of households (24 per cent) in India have access to the Internet and there is a large rural-urban and gender divide, Dhir Jhingran, Founder Director, Language and Learning Foundation said beyond the Internet accessibility, the poorest students in remote areas and girls do not have access to smartphones. "Marginalized children are paying the heaviest price as millions of young people are not able to access remote learning during school shutdowns," he said. He called for "reimagining" for reopening of schools. "Safe re-opening of schools presents an opportunity to 'build back better' – by investing in equitable, quality education and skills development to ensure a whole generation of children and young people is not left behind," he said. Meanwhile, Enakshi Ganguly, founder and advisor, HAQ Centre for Child Rights, highlighted the spike in child marriage and child labour during the pandemic. "Children are at heightened risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, including online risks, when schools are closed, social services are interrupted, and movement is restricted," she said. Ganguly stressed on the need to strengthen child protection mechanisms at the local level for reporting of violence against children and making them accessible to all children, especially since schools and other educational institutions are not functional. In the ensuing discussion, the panellists said that for years to come, children and young people will be living with the longer term, secondary impacts of this pandemic on them and how the world chooses to respond to those will have a far-reaching impact on children's lives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/child-rights-experts-highlight-need-to-understand-full-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic-916954.html

Justice Navin Chawla also denied repeated requests of the petitioners' lawyer to adjourn the matter for eight weeks to await the decision of the apex court which is likely to hear the matter on Thursday. Thereafter, the counsel for the petitioners -- former and present students of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University -- said he will withdraw the plea to approach the apex court. "Petition is dismissed as withdrawn," the court said. The petition had challenged the nod given on September 9 by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to the broadcast of the 'Bindas Bol' programme whose promo claimed that the channel was all set to broadcast a "big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service". The petition by Syed Mujtaba Athar and Ritesh Siraj had claimed that the proposed show is full of hate speech and defamation against the petitioners and if the current petition is not adjudicated prior to its broadcast, irreparable harm will be caused to them and the plea will also become infructuous. The plea had said the ministry has refrained from exercising its powers under the Cable TV Act to prohibit the proposed show. It had claimed that the ministry passed a non-speaking order, which is quoted as, “Having regard to the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case, Sudarshan TV channel is hereby directed to ensure that the programme proposed to be telecast does not violate any of the programme codes. If any violation of the programme code is found, action as per law will be taken.” The High Court on August 28 had stayed the telecast of the programme which was scheduled the same evening. On August 29, the court disposed of the plea with a direction to the ministry to take a decision on the prohibition of the proposed show pursuant to its August 28 show-cause notice. The High Court had also directed the channel and its editor to not broadcast the proposed show till such time the ministry takes the decision. However, the subsequent September 9 order of the ministry was not stayed by the High Court. On October 26, the ministry told the apex court that it was ready with its order in relation to a show-cause notice issued to Sudarshan TV based on the recommendation of an inter-ministerial group which has viewed all the episodes of the channel's 'Bindas Bol' programme.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-says-sudarshan-tv-matter-pending-in-sc-refrains-from-entertaining-plea-917075.html

The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also said that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is going to add 250 additional ICU beds to the existing 250 ICU beds in addition to creating 35 BIPAP beds in the next 3 to 4 days at its Covid-19 hospital near the Delhi airport. The actions come in the wake of 12 decisions taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday. Delhi has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. Forty-five doctors and 160 paramedics from paramilitary forces have arrived in Delhi for deployment at DRDO hospital near Delhi airport and at a Covid care centre at Chhatarpur, a home ministry spokesperson said. Remaining doctors and medics will reach Delhi in the next few days, the official said. The home ministry has constituted 10 multi-disciplinary teams to visit more than 100 private hospitals in Delhi for assessing bed utilisation and testing capacity and to identify extra ICU beds. Visits by the teams are underway, the official said. The Indian Railways is making available coaches with 800 beds at Shakur Basti railway station while doctors and para-medics from paramilitary forces will man the coaches which will act as Covid care-cum-isolation facilities. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Delhi government are working together to enhance RT-PCR testing capacity to 60,000 tests by end of November, the official said. Testing capacity has already been enhanced by 10,000 tests per day on November 17, the spokesperson said. The planning for a house to house survey in Delhi is in the advanced stage. The survey is expected to begin by the end of the week and completed by November 25, the official said. According to the spokesperson, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has dispatched 250 ventilators from Bengaluru and they are expected to reach Delhi by the end of the week. The Union health ministry has delivered 35 BIPAP machines to DRDO Covid facility near the Delhi airport, the official said. To bring testing closer to Delhi residents, the ICMR will help Delhi government in deploying 10 mobile testing laboratories with a total capacity of 20,000 tests in a phased manner beginning next week, the spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-provide-coaches-with-800-beds-to-delhi-for-covid-19-treatment-917080.html

The study was conducted between October 1 and 16, 2020, among respondents in China (2,000), France (1,000), India (1,000), and the US (1,000). The India leg of the study conducted across six cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, was aimed at understanding the changing content consumption habits during the pandemic, Dolby Laboratories said. "Indian consumers are now prioritising and seeking better experiences possibly driven by long hours spent at home. Indian consumers are spending more on quality in order to better connect with content and to connect with each other," the survey said. “Despite all of the challenges of this past year, this study has illustrated the power of entertainment in bringing us together with those that are most important to us,” said Pankaj Kedia, Managing Director, Emerging Markets, Dolby Laboratories. The survey pointed out that Covid-19 has driven many Indians to use entertainment as a way of unwinding and 66 per cent of Indian respondents said they use it as an opportunity to relax. 95 per cent Indian respondents got into new types of content they didn't watch before, the survey added. The survey pointed out 97 per cent of Indian respondents have increased their monthly spends on content by 48 per cent on an average compared to the start of the year. Over 85 per cent of Indians respondents who participated in the survey have in the past six months already invested in upgrading their streaming services.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/most-indians-willing-to-pay-more-for-premium-content-study-917093.html

The Covid-19 caseload in India has mounted to over 89 lakh. In an "Evidence-Based Advisory to address Inappropriate Use of Convalescent Plasma in Covid-19 Patients", the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that a potential donor for convalescent plasma should have sufficient concentration of antibody working against Covid-19. Benefits of CPT in improving clinical outcomes, reducing severity of disease, duration of hospitalisation and mortality in Covid-19 patients are dependent on the concentration of specific antibodies in convalescent plasma that could neutralise the effects of SARS-CoV-2.    CPT or passive immunotherapy has been tried in the past for treatment of viral infections like H1N1, Ebola and SARS-CoV-1 etc.   The ICMR recently conducted an open label phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial in India across 39 public and private hospitals on use of convalescent plasma in the management of cases with moderate Covid-19 disease (PLACID Trial).  It was concluded that CPT did not lead to reduction in progression to severe Covid-19 or all-cause mortality in the group that received CPT as compared to the group that did not receive the therapy "PLACID is the world's largest pragmatic trial on CPT conducted in 464 moderately ill laboratory confirmed Covid-19 affected adults in real world setting wherein no benefit of use of CPT could be established," the ICMR said. Similar studies conducted in China and the Netherlands have also documented no significant benefit of CPT in improving the clinical outcomes of hospitalised Covid-19 patients, the advisory stated. "Indiscriminate use of CPT is not advisable. It is speculated that convalescent plasma having low concentration of specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may be less beneficial for treating Covid-19 patients as compared to plasma with high concentration of such antibodies. "This advisory, therefore, embraces the principle that a potential donor for convalescent plasma should have sufficient concentration of antibody working against Covid-19," the advisory stated. CPT should only be used, as advised by the ICMR for management of Covid-19 when specific criteria as mentioned are met, it stated. According to the advisory a potential donor of CPT can be a male or female, who has never been pregnant, in the age group of 18-65 years who after 14 days of symptom resolution (testing negative for Covid-19 is not necessary) can donate plasma.     Screening should be done to rule out ABO incompatibility and blood-borne pathogens such as - HIV, HBV and HCV etc and the required concentration - of IgG antibody against Covid-19 Titre of 1:640 (ELISA)  and Neutralising Antibody Titres of 1:80 should be checked. For the potential recipient, ICMR said that donor can be in the early stage of Covid-19 and the therapy should be administered between 3 and 7 days from onset of symptoms, but not later than 10 days.  There should be no IgG antibody against Covid-19 by appropriate test and informed consent has to be taken. The advisory highlighted that presence of antibody against Covid-19 in a potential recipient makes transfusing convalescent plasma a futile intervention.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indiscriminate-use-of-convalescent-plasma-therapy-in-covid-19-patients-not-advisable-icmr-917112.html

"India has continued the unbroken trend of the daily new recoveries outpacing the daily new additions for more than 1.5 months. The country also reported less than 50,000 new daily cases for the eleventh continuous day," the ministry said. "Apart from the successful dissemination of Covid appropriate behaviour among the varied population groups, this trend assumes wider significance as many countries in Europe and America continue to see a surge in their Covid-19 positive numbers," it said. The total recoveries surged to 83,35,109 on Wednesday, pushing the national recovery rate to 93.52 per cent. According to the ministry, 10 states and union territories (UT) contributed 74.98 per cent of the new recoveries. Kerala saw the highest number of recoveries at 6,620.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian told the counsel that the court would hear the final arguments on December 2. Senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Mistry, tried to point towards an affidavit. To this, the court said everything would be covered during the final hearing. On September 22, the court had restrained Shapoorji Pallonji group and Mistry from pledging or transferring Tata Sons' shares owned by them.  The court had ordered them not to take any further action on the shares they have already pledged for raising money. "The parties shall maintain status quo regarding transfer and pledging of shares and further action in regard to the transfer and pledging of shares already made," the court said in its order. The plea by Tata Sons came post Pallonji Group's agreement with Canada based Brookfield to raise Rs 3,750 crore by pledging Tata Sons shares. Tata Sons relied upon Articles of Association (AoA) to claim that it restricted Pallonji Group from transferring shares, without allowing Tata Sons the right of first refusal. The Shapoorji Pallonji Group, through its two investment firms, Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investments, held around 18 per cent in Tata Sons. The group opposed Tata Sons' plea, on the ground that pledging of shares was not the same as transferring ownership of shares. On January 10, the top court had stayed the NCLAT order restoring Mistry as executive chairman of the Tata Group, observing that there were 'lacunae' in the orders passed by the tribunal. NCLAT had on December 18 ordered reinstatement of Mistry as the head of Tata Sons, the holding company of USD 110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate, saying his 2016 sacking was wrong.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-puts-battle-between-tata-mistry-for-final-hearing-on-december-2-917140.html

In all, 139 people had applied for the post of Chief Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission but the Search Committee had shortlisted only two for the consideration of the three-member Selection Committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. No other names were included from outside the applications by the Search Committee during the selection process of the CIC but it had added one name in its shortlist for Information Commissioners, according to information accessed through RTI by DH. Among the applicants for the post of CIC were Vice Admiral (Retd) HCS Bisht, former Health Secretary Preeti Sudan, Press Information Bureau Director General Kuldeep Singh Dhatwalia, AIR Director General (News) Ira Joshi and former Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Kumar Patnaik, among others. Both Sinha and Gupta had filed applications with the Search Committee. Two applications reached the government after the deadline, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) said in the RTI response. Sinha, a 1981-batch IFS officer, and Gupta, a 1982-batch IAS officer, were appointed as Information Commissioners on 30 December, 2018, and had taken charge two days later. For the three posts of Information Commissioner, 355 applications were filed, out of which, the Search Committee had shortlisted seven, including that of journalist Uday Mahurkar who had not applied. Those shortlisted included Subhash Chandra, Meenakshi Gupta, Ira Joshi, Arun Kumar Panda, Saroj Punhani and Heera Lal Samariya, besides Mahurkar. Mahurkar, Samariya and Punhani were finally chosen by the Selection Panel though one of the three members, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, submitted a dissent note objecting to Mahurkar's appointment as his name was not among the applicants but had found space in the short list. Union Home Minister Amit Shah was another member of the panel. The government had issued notifications on the appointments of CIC and three Information Commissioners on November 7. At present, there are still three vacancies for Information Commissioners. A number of people who applied for the post of CIC also applied for the post of Information Commissioner, which included Ira Joshi, Sudan, Dhatwalia and others. Other applicants included Justice B K Shrivastava, Lt Gen (Retd) Dushyant Singh, former PIB Director General Frank Noronha and career diplomat Venu Rajamony.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/yashvardhan-kumar-sinha-pipped-fellow-information-commissioner-neeraj-kumar-gupta-to-the-cic-post-reveals-rti-917156.html

Covaxin is being developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Last month, the vaccine maker had said it had successfully completed the interim analysis of Phase 1 and 2 trials and is initiating Phase 3 trials. "Trial for the third phase of Covaxin, a coronavirus vaccine product of Bharat Biotech, to start in Haryana on 20th November. I have offered myself as the first volunteer to get vaccinated," Vij said in a tweet. Bharat Biotech had on Monday said the Phase 3 trial of Covaxin will involve 26,000 volunteers across 25 centres in India and is being conducted in partnership with the ICMR. It is the largest clinical trial conducted for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. This is India's first Phase 3 efficacy study for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the largest Phase 3 efficacy trial ever conducted.

The social media giant submitted an affidavit signed by its Chief Privacy Officer Damien Karien to the Joint Committee of Parliament, which is looking into the Data Protection Bill, for the erroneous geo-tagging of India's map Twitter's action came a fortnight after the panel headed by senior BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi came down heavily on the micro-blogging site for showing Ladakh as part of China. The panel had then said it was 'treason' while insisting that the US-based parent company, and not its Indian arm, submit an explanation in the form of an affidavit. Earlier, appearing before the panel, Twitter India officials had "begged apology" but the MPs were not moved and reminded them that it was a criminal offence that questioned the sovereignty of the country. "Twitter Inc has now given us a written apology on an affidavit for Ladakh being shown in China. They have apologised for hurting Indian sentiments and have sworn to correct the error by November 30," Lekhi said. Sources said Twitter claimed that a 'software error combined with imperfect data' resulted in an incorrect geo-tag. "In the last few weeks, we have worked towards resolving the geo-tag issue in a manner wherein Leh as well as other cities in the Union Territory of Ladakh will now accurately show with their respective city name, state and country. In addition to this, we are also reviewing the geo-tag for various other cities in Jammu and Kashmir. This work is already in progress and we are targeting November 30, 2020 to complete this exercise," Twitter is quoted as saying in its affidavit. It said India is a priority market and committed to partnering with the Government of India and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to serve the public conversation and communities on the micro-blogging site. Twitter also faced criticism for showing Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir while it is now part of the Union Territory of Ladakh. In its notice, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had said that showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir was a deliberate attempt to undermine the will of the sovereign Parliament of India which has declared Ladakh as a Union Territory with its headquarters in Leh. Last week, it temporarily blocked Home Minister Amit Shah's Twitter account citing copyright violations only to restore it soon, while claiming that an inadvertent error had led to it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/twitter-apologises-in-writing-for-ladakh-in-china-error-917166.html

The fine amount was paid by four of her extended family members in demand drafts drawn from various bank accounts. Sasikala, a close friend of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, is serving her four-year imprisonment in a disproportionate assets (DA) case and her jail term ends in February 2021. However, Sasikala's legal team has been pushing for her early release contending that she is entitled for ordinary remission by persuading the jail authorities to count all her non-availed leaves. The prison administration had also told an RTI applicant in September that Sasikala can walk out of the prison on January 27, 2021 if she pays the fine of Rs 10 crore Vedanta Group on Wednesday confirmed putting in a preliminary expression of interest (EoI) for buying government's stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL). Vedanta's interest in India's second-largest fuel retailer is because of synergies with its existing oil and gas business. The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL and the last date of putting EoI was November 16. T N Manoharan, the RBI-appointed administrator of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, on Wednesday said that depositors' money is safe and expressed confidence of completing the lender's merger with DBS Bank India within the deadline set by the regulator. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appointed former non-executive chairman of Canara Bank T N Manoharan as the administrator of Lakshmi Vilas Bank after superseding the board of the crippled private sector lender. A moratorium has been imposed on the bank and cash withdrawals have been capped at Rs 25,000 per account. Talking to reporters, Manoharan said that he is confident of the timely merger of the bank with DBS Bank India before the December 16 deadline. RBI will issue the final merger draft on November 20. The BSE Sensex jumped 227 points to finish above the 44,000-mark for the first time on Wednesday, tracking gains in financial stocks amid largely positive cues from Asian markets and persistent foreign fund inflows. After touching its lifetime intra-day high of 44,215.49, the 30-share BSE benchmark ended 227.34 points or 0.52 per cent higher at its record closing of 44,180.05. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 64.05 points or 0.50 per cent to end at its all-time high of 12,938.25. It had touched an intra-day record of 12,948.85. Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Wednesday said the third phase of the trial of Covaxin, a potential vaccine against Covid-19, will begin in the state on November 20 and offered to be the first volunteer to get vaccinated. Covaxin is being developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

"The government will not allow any bandh in Karnataka on the issue. I am requesting pro-Kannada organisations to withdraw the call for bandh," the CM told media. Karnataka is all set to get its 31st district as the Cabinet on Wednesday gave ‘in principle’ approval to carve out a new Vijayanagar district from Ballari. The decision was taken during an informal discussion on the subject, Law Minister J C Madhuswamy said.  Forest Minister Anand Singh, who is also the minister in charge of Ballari, called it a “historic decision” and thanked Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.

The habitats have been provided with proper heating facilities as the region receives up to 40 feet of snow after November every year while temperatures fall up to minus 40 degree Celsius in the winter months, they said. "In order to ensure operational efficiency of troops deployed in winters, the Indian Army has completed establishment of habitat facilities for all troops deployed in the sector," said a source. Nearly 50,000 troops of the Indian Army are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between India and China have not yielded any concrete outcome to resolve the military standoff that erupted in early May. China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. "Apart from the smart camps with integrated facilities which have been built over the years, additional state of the art habitats with integrated arrangements for electricity, water, heating facilities, health and hygiene have been recently created to accommodate the troops," the source said. The frontline troops are being accommodated in heated tents as per tactical considerations of their deployment, sources said. In addition, adequate civil infrastructure has also been identified to cater to any emergent requirements, they added. The armies of India and China have held eight rounds of Corps Commander-level talks so far but no breakthrough has been achieved yet to resolve the standoff. The last round of military talks was held on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points. A joint statement issued after the talks said both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and take forward the discussions for the settlement of outstanding issues. India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region. Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides had announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters. The sixth round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave. The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the Line of Actual Control(LAC).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-army-sets-up-upgraded-living-facilities-for-thousands-of-troops-in-eastern-ladakh-as-harsh-winter-sets-in-917193.html

18-11-2020||National||India pulled out of RCEP as concerns not addressed; joining it would have resulted negative consequences for economy: EAM||India pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) last year as joining it would have resulted in fairly negative consequences for the country's economy, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday. In an address at an online discussion organised by the Centre for European Policy Studies, Jaishankar also forcefully pressed for reform of the United Nations, saying one or two countries must not be allowed to halt the process for their "perpetual gain". On the proposed free trade agreement between India and the European Union, Jaishankar said New Delhi was looking for a "fair and balanced" pact. Asked about the RCEP, the external affairs minister said India withdrew from it as a number of key concerns flagged by it were not addressed. His comments came three days after 15 Asia-Pacific economies signed the RCEP agreement creating the world’s largest free trade area. "Essentially, we saw that a number of our key concerns were not addressed. We had to then take a call whether you enter a trade agreement if your major concerns are not addressed or do you take a call saying this is not in my interest," Jaishankar said during an online discussion organised by the Centre for European Policy Studies. "We took a call that given the way it is currently, it is not in our interest to enter this agreement because it would have fairly immediate negative consequences for our own economy," he said. The RCEP deal sealed on Sunday comprised 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and five of the bloc’s dialogue partners -- China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. "Because you are negotiating does not mean you have to suspend your ability to calculate at the end of the negotiation. I think we made those calculations. Very frankly, what we did with regard to RCEP is not a generic position vis-a-vis trade," said Jaishankar. India was part of the RCEP negotiations for nearly seven years. The unresolved issues included inadequate protection against import surge, lack of credible assurances to India on market access, non-tariff barriers and possible circumvention of rules of origin by certain countries. Referring to the long-pending India-EU free trade agreement (FTA), Jaishankar said: "We want a fair and balanced FTA", but added that what is fair and balanced is a subject of negotiation. "I recognise that an FTA with Europe is not an easy negotiation, probably in the world, it must be the most difficult negotiation. It is a very high standard FTA," he said. The FTA talks have been stalled since May 2013, when both sides failed to bridge substantial gaps on crucial issues, including data security status for the IT sector. Launched in June 2007, negotiations for the proposed agreement have witnessed many hurdles as both sides have major differences on crucial issues. In his observations, Jaishankar also talked about "economic multipolarity" as well and how it changes for different countries. "When I look at my trade accounts; my economic accounts, I actually have five big accounts which are the US, European Union, China, ASEAN and the Gulf. These five are the five economic poles around which much of my trade and my investment is organised," he said. "For me to get the best out of it, in a multipolar world, there is a very simple rule of negotiation which is if you advance on any account, you advance on all accounts. "So you constantly need to keep going forward, forward and forward, because the moment you fall back on an account, you fall back on all accounts," he said On the United Nations, he said it was set up 75 years back and needs urgent reforms to reflect the realities of the world at present. "Everything needs some kind of refreshing, updating, etc. We cannot let the interest of one or two countries which want to freeze one moment of the history for their perpetual gain to continue," he said. Jaishankar said allowing the "stalemate" to continue will harm the UN.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pulled-out-of-rcep-as-concerns-not-addressed-joining-it-would-have-resulted-negative-consequences-for-economy-eam-917261.html

The aircraft, equipped with the latest sensors, landed at INS Hansa, a key naval base in Goa, in the morning, they said. The Indian Navy already has a fleet of eight P-8I aircraft which are extensively deployed to keep track of the movement of Chinese ships and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region. The P-8I, based on the Boeing next-generation 737 commercial airplane, is a variant of the P-8A Poseidon used by the US Navy. India was Boeing's first international customer for this aircraft. The first P-8I aircraft was inducted into the Indian Navy in 2013. In 2016, the defence ministry had placed a follow-on order for four additional P-8I under the USD 1.1 billion deal. Last year, the government cleared the procurement of another batch of six P-8Is. The P-8Is were deployed to carry out surveillance on the movement of Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh in the last few months. The reconnaissance aircraft was deployed in Doklam along the Sikkim border too during the 73-day standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in 2017. The P-8Is were also deployed to keep an eye on the movement of Pakistani troops after the Pulwama terror attack last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-navy-gets-ninth-poseidon-8i-maritime-reconnaissance-aircraft-from-the-us-917263.html

Vardhan, who digitally addressed the 33rd Stop TB Partnership board meet, noted that from January to October, only 14.5 lakh tuberculosis cases were notified in the country, which is 29 per cent lower than the same period in 2019, with the decline being over 35-40 per cent in states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Goa, a statement issued by the health ministry said. The minister also highlighted the silver lining in states like Sikkim, Telangana, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Odisha, which witnessed a less than 20 per cent impact even during the lockdown period. "These states strategised to integrate their TB case-finding activities with the Covid-19 preventive measures," he was quoted as saying in the statement. Acknowledging that Covid-19 has turned the clock back by many years, if not decades, in the fight against infectious diseases, Vardhan said, "The deadly virus has derailed our painstaking efforts of many decades and diverted scientific attention from many infectious killer diseases like TB. "The lockdowns have raised insurmountable barriers for patients and people are still living in fear of the coronavirus. We all know that the last 10 months have seen treatment interruptions, hindrances in the availability of drugs, a shrinking supply of diagnostic tests, delayed diagnosis, interruptions in the supply chains, diversion of the manufacturing capacity and imposition of physical barriers for patients who must travel to distant clinics to pick up medications." Congratulating the Stop TB Partnership for proactively contacting countries regarding the implementation of their tuberculosis programmes during the pandemic, the minister highlighted India's "TB Harega, Desh Jeetega" campaign that targets to achieve the sustainable development goal target related to TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global target of 2030. The country has nearly trebled its efforts on increasing TB notifications and managed to close the gap in "missing million TB cases", the statement said. Elaborating on the steps taken to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Vardhan mentioned the health ministry's recommendation of bi-directional TB-Covid screening, screening among ILI and SARI cases, intensifying private sector engagement, re-deployment of the re-purposed HR and CBNAAT and TrueNaT machines back to the TB programme. He, thereafter gave an account of how TB services are gradually recovering with the measures undertaken. "Health facilities are opening up and more and more people are presenting themselves before government and private health clinics to get tested. Case finding through outreach activities in the community has also picked up. "With the gradual return of the staff, who were diverted for COVID activities, public health actions such as counselling, contact-tracing and disbursement of nutritional support are also picking up," Vardhan said. Speaking on India's strategy of turning the crisis into opportunity, he said, "COVID-19 has provided us with an opportunity to boost TB elimination activities through health system strengthening and infectious diseases control." Specifically, he highlighted that several dedicated infectious diseases hospitals have come up as a part of the pandemic response measures, which would contribute in a major way towards tuberculosis care and management. The molecular diagnostic capacity of the country has increased multi-fold. These multi-platform devices based on cartridge and chip-based technology can decentralise TB diagnosis, the minister said. Behavioural changes acquired during the pandemic such as cough hygiene, use of masks, physical distancing will further help reduce the transmission of tuberculosis, which is a respiratory illness. The increased uptake of telemedicines and teleconsultation during the pandemic will provide channels of consultation for tuberculosis, he said. Exhorting the health leadership of the world to drive government policy, raise investments in the healthcare sector and also raise the awareness of the general masses towards the loss of precious lives that is happening through uncontrolled infectious diseases like TB, Vardhan ended his address by noting: "TB elimination is not so difficult if we can create a mass movement against the disease. It needs strategised advocacy, thought leadership and disruptive social entrepreneurship. It needs mass mobilisation, aggressive campaigns, powerful partners and deep commitments. And most of all, it needs a powerful societal and political commitment."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-has-diverted-scientific-attention-from-killer-diseases-like-tb-vardhan-917296.html
18-11-2020||National Politics||Explained | What is Gupkar Alliance?||The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) is an alliance of seven parties in Jammu and Kashmir that is seeking the restoration of the erstwhile state's special status, which was revoked by the Centre in August last year. Attacking the alliance's move to seek support from other countries, Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday claimed the "unholy global gathbandhan" was against the country's national interest and termed the alliance 'Gupkar Gang,' sparking a political row. In a series of tweets, Shah questioned Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi on whether they support the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it. His statement evoked angry reactions from the Congress as well as the National Conference and PDP, which hit out at the minister saying his remarks reflected the BJP's frustration on finding a unified political group fighting elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Meanwhile, local Congress leaders in Jammu and Kashmir have maintained that they are not part of the Gupkar Alliance and are only going for a seat-sharing arrangement for the DDC polls, according to PTI. Which political parties are part of PAGD? The PAGD constitutes of seven political parties that are pressing for the restoration of Article 370 and statehood in Jammu and Kashmir. Besides the PDP and the NC, the alliance comprises the CPI-M, People's Conference, Awami National Conference, the CPI and the People's Movement. On August 4, 2019, a day before the central government announced the abrogation of Article 370, political parties in Kashmir, except the BJP, met at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah at Gupkar Road in Srinagar and adopted a declaration to defend Article 370. More than a year later, in October, the political leaders who had been detained for several months met again and resolved to fight legally and democratically for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's special status. In November, the seven-party amalgam announced they would contest the local body elections together. The Congress also expressed its willingness for seat-sharing arrangement in some districts, however, it has clarified that the party is not a part of the alliance. The PAGD, with Farooq Abdullah as president and Mehbooba Mufti as the vice president, has already announced the seat-sharing arrangement for the District Development Council (DDC) polls in Jammu and Kashmir scheduled to be held on December 4.

He also said the dates of their visits were yet to be finalised. “Amit Shah and J P Nadda will visit the state separately every month to take stalk of the party’s organisational preparedness ahead of the Assembly elections,” said Ghosh. Speaking to reporters, he said the visits would boost the morale of the BJP cadres. BJP insiders said Shah was likely to visit the state for two days a month and Nadda would visit Bengal three days a month. Ghosh scoffed at the Left-Congress alliance in Bengal said the CPM, Congress and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) were all given chances by the people of Bengal but they failed to fulfill their expectations. He also said people already rejected the CPM and Congress and the TMC would meet the same fate. “Now they (people) trust the BJP and we will not let them down,” said Ghosh. The development comes a day after the BJP deployed five of its top vote managers in the state to strengthen the organisation and prepare an area-specific electoral strategy and campaign issues. The five central leaders Sunil Deodhar, Vinod Sonkar, Harish Dwivedi, Dushyant Kumar Gautam, Vinod Taorey would each look after five organisational zones in the state. BJP’s national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh would also spend extra time in the state. The TMC leadership took potshots at the saffron party for bringing in scores of central leaders in for the Assembly elections next year. They said the move showed that the BJP’s top brass had no faith in their state leaders. “We have instructed our party workers to keep an eye on the actions of these BJP leaders and to ensure that they are not able to indulge in any divisive activities,” said TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shah-j-p-nadda-to-visit-bengal-every-month-till-end-of-assembly-polls-dilip-ghosh-917084.html

He also said "such senior leaders.. enjoy proximity to the Gandhi family" and are free to raise issues with them. In an interview with The Indian Express, Kapil Sibal had openly critiqued his party for not doing enough to mend the 'flaws' in its organisational structure. He had said that despite the Bihar debacle, the congress was going on with business as usual. He had also said that despite 23 leaders demanding a change in 'visible and transparent' leadership of the party president, Congress had failed to initiate a dialogue on the issue and instead turned its back on those who wrote the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/join-another-party-or-start-your-own-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-hits-out-at-kapil-sibal-917123.html

18-11-2020||National Politics||Challenges galore as BJP president Nadda plans to embark on 100-day nationwide yatra||With victory secured in Bihar Assembly polls, which has 40 Lok Sabha seats, and BJP-dominated alliance firmly in the saddle there, BJP chief J P Nadda has set his eyes on strengthening the party nationally with particular focus on Uttar Pradesh with 80 Lok Sabha seats and state polls due in 2022, and West Bengal with 42 Lok Sabha seats, where the state polls is due in 2021. Dates of the proposed yatra are yet to be finalised but Nadda, in whose tenure as party chief, the party won the only state election held in Bihar, will be embarking on a 100-day ‘Rashtriya Vistrit Pravas’ throughout the country, spending a maximum of eight days in UP, where it faces the challenge of repeating its 2017 electoral performance when it had won the state with more than a two-third majority decimating SP-Congress alliance and BSP in one go. BJP lost Delhi days after Nadda had taken over as the party chief from Amit Shah but the change of hands had happened in the middle of the poll campaign. Hence, truly speaking, the Assembly election of Bihar and the bypolls in 10 states, including in Madhya Pradesh, were the first electoral test for Nadda as party chief and he has come out with flying colours in both. Now with a new team of party office bearers and in-charges in states announced last week, Nadda has to surmount the challenges, and live up to the high expectations set by Shah's tenure. BJP has lost ally after ally since Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP came to power in 2014 with 29 coalitions. Allies which are now out of NDA are Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab, TDP in Andhra Pradesh, PDP in Jammu and Kashmir, Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party in Bihar, Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party in UP. On Tuesday, BJP announced that it will have no tie-up with Bodoland People's Front In Assam in 2021 state polls. There are also uncertainties about the fate of Lok Janshakti Party, which fought elections in Bihar against NDA. BJP's earlier attempt to forge an alliance with AIADMK in Tamil Nadu has also got into rough weather over the issue of 'Vetrivel Yatra'. The only state in South India where the BJP is in power in Karnataka. But the state's Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa's age factor could prove troublesome for the party in the future. In the Northeast, the BJP's influence grew since its 2016 victory in Assam but an apparent faulty implementation of NRC in the state has created much heart-burns for it and 2021 state polls could be a tough ball game. During Nadda's yatra, the BJP will seek to rope in new partners and work out a strategy in new areas of influence and take corrective measures to win those seats which it lost in 2019. Among the states, Odisha, where it was once the ally of the ruling BJD and now the main Opposition party, the BJP has high hopes to increase its tally in the Lok Sabha election 2024. Addressing party workers in Odisha on Tuesday while inaugurating six new district BJP offices in the state through video conferencing, a buoyant Nadda talked of BJP's victory show in Bihar polls and assembly bypolls in 59 seats in 10 states and particularly how BJP's "victory rate in Bihar was best". "In Odisha Assembly elections, BJP's vote share has gone up from 18 per cent to 32 per cent, which clearly indicates that BJP is very close to its goal of forming a government in Odisha," a beaming Nadda said. The 100-day yatra will be the first political tour of such a long tenure by any BJP president undertaken in the last few years. Yatra politics is not new to BJP. It was L K Advani's 'Rath Yatra' in the nineties that is credited for catapulting BJP into the prime political slot in the country. In 1992, Murali Manohar Joshi had taken 'Ekta Yatra' which had culminated in the hoisting of the national flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar amid tight security. Before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, Advani had taken a 33-day 'Bharat Uday Yatra' straddling 8000 kilometre across the nation connected through the Golden Quadrilateral Highways built by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Former BJP president Amit Shah had taken a two-week-long Jan Raksha Yatra in Kerala in October 2017 to highlight the political killing of party workers in the Left-ruled state. In 2018, Shah had launched a "save democracy" Rath Yatra in West Bengal. But Nadda's yatra has more long term objectives aimed at expanding through reach-out to new voters and new allies. He will be meeting party representatives and intellectuals, the local functionaries of RSS in the regions, discuss the possibilities of new coalitions for the BJP, improve communications between senior leaders of BJP and allies in the states and discuss a strategy to improve the BJP's state governments to blunt anti-incumbency. Nadda's duration in the states will depend on their categories-- A, B, C D categories---the states ruled by BJP alone or in an alliance, key states ruled by other parties, small states and the most important are those which are going to polls next year--Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/challenges-galore-as-bjp-president-nadda-plans-to-embark-on-100-day-nationwide-yatra-917229.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||BJP put Congress on defensive about being part of Gupkar alliance: Mehbooba||Stating that the BJP has put the Congress on the defensive about its participation in the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) through false propaganda, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday said in today's times, demanding constitutional rights is deemed anti-national. Her remarks came after the Congress on Tuesday said it is not a part of the PAGD, an alliance of several parties in Jammu and Kashmir that is seeking the restoration of the erstwhile state's special status, which was revoked by the Centre in August last year. In a statement, Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the party is not a part of the PAGD and will contest the upcoming maiden District Development Council (DDC) polls in Jammu and Kashmir to "expose" the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) through democratic means. The statement came after the BJP targeted the Congress, saying it should make it clear if it agrees with the "anti-national" views of the National Conference (NC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Referring to Surjewala's statement, Mufti said the country lacks a robust opposition as the BJP propagates falsehoods and sets the agenda, thereby forcing the Congress to toe the same line. "Today yet again through false propaganda, BJP has put Congress on defensive about its participation in PAGD. The pattern where BJP propagates falsehoods & sets the agenda thereby forcing Congress to toe the same line is why this country lacks a robust opposition," she wrote on Twitter. The PDP president said no national party will admit it publicly that the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave a special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was "illegal" due to the "lies" spread by the BJP. "It's a fact that abrogation of Article 370 was illegal & was a constitutional guarantee given to J&K. Yet no national party inc Congress will admit it publicly due to the lies spread by BJP. We are living in times where demanding constitutional rights itself is deemed anti national (sic)," she said in another tweet. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said some "pliable" television news channels are helping the BJP in peddling its propaganda. "BJPs propaganda is peddled day & night by pliable channels that dedicate their prime time debates to issues such as 'love jihad, tukde tukde gang & now Gupkar alliance (sic)," she wrote on the microblogging website.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-put-congress-on-defensive-about-being-part-of-gupkar-alliance-mehbooba-916880.html

Jails Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala on Tuesday said nearly 7,000 prisoners are out on parole or interim bail. Majority of these prisoners were released in April on interim or regular bail, parole or extended parole. Earlier, the state government had decided to release convicted prisoners with up to seven years of sentence and undertrials liable to get long jail terms on conviction. Foreign prisoners, however, are not included in this. Also, prisoners convicted in cases like drug smuggling, rape, acid attack are not among those released. "As their parole was ending, it has been decided that it be extended till December 31," Chautala told reporters. A high-powered committee under Justice Rajiv Sharma of the Punjab and Haryana High Court comprising Additional Chief Secretary (Home), and DGP (prisons) held a review meeting recently on the issue of prisoners who were earlier released on parole after which the state government took the decision to extend the duration of the parole, he said. Earlier, Chautala had said the decision to release the prisoners had been taken in accordance with the Supreme Court's directive to decongest crowded prisons to prevent them from becoming fertile ground for COVID-19 spread.       The committee was formed on the directive of the apex court, dated March 23, which had then passed the order for decongesting prisons in view of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-govt-extends-till-dec-31-duration-of-parole-for-prisoners-released-during-covid-19-916950.html

He also said that Haryana will study the laws made by other states in this regard. "A strict law will be enacted against 'love jihad' in the state. A committee will be constituted to draft this law," said Vij, who chaired the meeting with senior officials of the home department, according to an official statement issued here. The home minister, according to the statement, said that "with the enactment of this law, strict action will be taken against any person who is found indulging in religious conversion by pressuring, tempting someone or is involved in any kind of conspiracy or tries to do so in the name of love". Vij said officials of the home department, the advocate general, among others, will be part of this committee. Additional Chief Secretary (Home Department) Rajeev Arora, Director General of Police Manoj Yadava, Additional Director General of Police, CID, Alok Mittal, were among the officers present in the meeting. Earlier this month, Vij had told the Haryana assembly that the state government is considering a law against "love jihad" and has sought information from Himachal Pradesh, which had passed a bill on the issue. The Himachal Pradesh assembly had last year passed a bill against conversion by force, inducement or through marriages solemnised for the "sole purpose" of adopting a new religion. "We are mulling bringing a law against 'love jihad' in Haryana," Vij had said while replying to a calling attention notice drawing attention towards the Ballabhgarh Nikita Tomar murder case. "Anyone can marry anyone, anyone can fall in love with anyone. But if there is a conspiracy of changing religion by trapping someone in love, then it is very important to stop that conspiracy. We will take whatever steps required for it," he had said. If anyone is instigated for changing religion, it will not be tolerated, Vij had said, claiming that many cases of "love jihad" are surfacing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/committee-to-be-formed-to-draft-law-against-love-jihad-haryana-home-minister-916956.html

Hitting out at PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti for her remarks on the tricolour, Kumar said that she is being told by the people of the UT to "go away wherever she wishes to". Talking about the Gupkar alliance, the RSS leader claimed that nobody in Jammu and Kashmir felt sorry for the leaders of this group when they were put in jail. "Nobody expressed anger, took out protest rallies, held dharnas in their favour. Nobody observed Kashmir bandh and strike in mountainous belts. Instead a large number of people were happy that those who looted people and got them killed through batteries of terrorists, have gone to jail, he added. "India has become one nation after over 70 years. (It is) one nation, one flag, one Constitution, one citizenship, one slogan and one national anthem," he said. "Now, a voice will be raised for PoK, and Gilgit-Baltistan. They were part of Jammu and Kashmir and hence should be acceded to India. From today, a movement will be launched to get PoK, Baltistan-Gilgit vacated by Pakistan. Pakistan should withdraw its forces from these places," Kumar added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farooq-abdullah-should-leave-hindustan-and-go-to-china-rss-leader-indresh-kumar-916962.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh govt to table Bill against 'love jihad'||Cementing their position on what has a hotly-contested issue, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana signalled on Tuesday that they will enact laws to regulate interfaith marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men. If the laws are brought in, these two states would become the first to crack down on what is termed "love jihad" by Hindu activists. Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday said that the Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey (freedom of religion) Bill, 2020 will be passed in the upcoming state Assembly session, adding that the law would have a provision of a five-year prison sentence for those forcing Hindu women to convert for marriage. Mishra insisted that the BJP was not opposed to interfaith unions but was against cases of ‘love jihad’. “The forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognisable offence and non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring such marriages null and void,” said Mishra. The announcement from Mishra comes about two weeks after CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan indicated the govt’s commitment to end forced conversions for marriage. Madhya Pradesh is now the third state after Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to propose such a law. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, on October 31, welcomed Allahabad High Court’s ruling that declared conversion for the sole purpose of marriage as null and void. He said that the state government would deal with ‘love jihad’ sternly. "We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities, if they do not mend their ways, the Ram Naam Satya journey will start," said CM Adityanath. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij later said that the state would form a committee to draft a law against "love jihad". “We will first have a discussion with the chief minister, ML Khattar in this regard,” he said. Anil Vij told the state Assembly on November 6 that the government was mulling on enacting a law to counter forced conversion. Madhya Pradesh Assembly Protem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma reacted on "love jihad" and said that Pakistan and ISI agents conspire to convert Sita to Rubiya. “Pakistan and ISI agents conspire to convert Sita to Rubiya. How long will we let Sita become Rubiya, how long will we let Sita die? Show me true love like Nargis & Sunil Dutt. Tell me how many Nargis married Sunil Dutt?” he asked.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-govt-to-table-bill-against-love-jihad-917028.html

18-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'moderate', no sudden change likely||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “moderate” category on Wednesday morning, while government agencies said no significant change is likely in the next three to four days. The mercury is also predicted to dip to single digits by Saturday. On Wednesday morning, it was 10.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, according to the India Meteorological Department. The air quality index (AQI) stood at 414, in the “severe” category, on Diwali day. But rain and high-velocity winds under the influence of a Western Disturbance brought relief from high pollution levels. The city's 24-hour average AQI improved from 435 on Sunday to 221 on Monday. On Tuesday, it was 171. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” and the lower end of the “poor” category on Thursday and Friday. On Wednesday, the prominent surface wind direction will be northwesterly and the maximum wind speed will be 10 kmph, it said.  The wind speed will continue to be favourable for dispersion of pollutants over the next three to four days, according to IMD. Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – will be around 5,000 m2/s on Wednesday and 7,500 m2/s on Thursday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said very few farm fire were observed over Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday and “their impact on air quality of Delhi is likely to be negligible”. The IMD said the minimum temperature in Delhi is predicted to drop to 9 degrees Celsius by Saturday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-moderate-no-sudden-change-likely-917047.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||Govt can fix minimum qualifying marks after recruitment exam: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday declared that the government has the power to fix minimum qualifying marks in a public recruitment even after the examination is held, if such an exercise is undertaken without any malice to recruit the best talents. A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Mohan M Shantanagoudar upheld the Uttar Pradesh government's decision to fix cut-off marks of 60 to 65% for recruitment of primary school teachers after the examination was over.  "In our considered view, the government was well within its rights to fix such cut off," the bench said, adding such an exercise was not impermissible and was certainly consistent with the objectives under the Right to Education Act. The top court dismissed a batch of appeals filed by Shiksha Mitras (para teachers) against the Allahabad High Court's decision upholding the government's order to fix higher cut off marks. "If the government has the power to fix minimum qualifying marks ‘from time to time’, there is nothing in the Rules which can detract from the exercise of such power even after the examination is over, provided the exercise of such power is not actuated by any malice or ill will and is in furtherance of the object of finding the best available talent," the bench said. The court gave the Uttar Pradesh a go ahead to fill up about 38,000 remaining vacancies of teachers, saying the facts on record indicated that even with the higher cut off the number of qualified candidates was more than twice the number of vacancies available. It, however, said the Uttar Pradesh government should give one more opportunity to 'Shiksha Mitras' to compete in next selection process, giving it discretion to set out manner and modalities for it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/govt-can-fix-minimum-qualifying-marks-after-recruitment-exam-sc-917061.html

The random testing of inward coming people was announced by District Magistrate Suhas L Y on Tuesday after a meeting with senior administration and health officials amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Gautam Buddh Nagar Chief Medical Officer Deepak Ohri said teams of health officials are present at the borders at Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway and at Chilla – the two key entry points to Noida from the national capital. “We are conducting rapid antigen-based tests on people randomly so that traffic movement is not impacted. This is being done to check virus carriers and ensure that infection is contained in Gautam Buddh Nagar,” Ohri, who was himself present at DND, told reporters.   Several health officials wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) are at the border locations along with policemen where they have set up desks for the rapid antigen-based test, which gives results in 15 minutes. Further action is taken based on the test result. “If anyone is found positive, they are sent back to Delhi. Only those testing negative are allowed to enter Noida,” Ohri said, adding all facilities for test and logistics are available at the borders.   He said a similar campaign will be carried out on Wednesday at Ashok Nagar, adjoining Delhi, and at Botanical Garden Metro Station, in Noida on Thursday. Suhas had on Tuesday said only a few randomly selected commuters shall be tested. "This is being done in order to assess the spread of infection and would help in issuing advisories to employers and organisations, where a large number of people work and commute between Gautam Buddh Nagar and adjacent areas, so that the spread of infection is contained to a large extent,” he said. Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 20,566 cases of Covid-19 including 73 deaths, with 1,236 active cases, according to official data on Tuesday. However, Delhi has recorded over one lakh new coronavirus cases and around 1,200 deaths between November 1 and November 16 while nearly 94,000 patients recovered during the same period, according to official data. The national capital has witnessed a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-begins-random-covid-19-tests-at-borders-for-people-coming-from-delhi-917079.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||39% of Kashmir's population has Covid-19 antibodies revelas sero survey||A sero survey conducted in Kashmir has found that two out of every five people in the valley have developed antibodies against the coronavirus. The survey carried out in October found the highest prevalence of antibodies in Pulwama at 43.1 per cent and the lowest in Kulgam at 28.5 per cent. "We conducted a sero survey in all 10 districts of Kashmir which has revealed that nearly 39 per cent of the 6,200 persons tested negative but had developed antibodies," said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine at Government Medical College here. He said the survey was carried out in October on the heels of an exercise in Srinagar which had thrown up almost identical results. While nearly 2,400 people were randomly tested in Srinagar, 400 people each were tested in the rest of the nine districts as part of the survey, he added. Giving the district-wise break up of the results, Khan said Pulwama recorded the highest prevalence of antibodies in 43.1 per cent of the survey population, followed by 43 per cent in Budgam, 42.3 per cent in Kupwara, 40.7 per cent in Srinagar, 39.8 per cent in Bandipora and 39.0 per cent in Ganderbal. "Anantnag (35.2 per cent), Baramulla (34.6 per cent), Shopian (31.9 per cent) and Kulgam (28.5 per cent) recorded lower than average prevalence of antibodies among the surveyed population," he said. "The trend has been encouraging but it does not mean that (SARS-2) Covid will be defeated at a certain level of the population developing the antibodies. The scientific community is also wary of using the term herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine," Khan cautioned. The Kashmir valley has recorded 62,520 Covid-19 cases so far including 1,063 deaths. While 57,532 people have recovered, there are 3,925 active cases. Srinagar is the worst affected district in Jammu and Kashmir with nearly 20,000 people infected and 399 deaths due to the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/39-of-kashmirs-population-has-covid-19-antibodies-revelas-sero-survey-917087.html

The opposition party exuded confidence of winning the panchayat samiti and zila parishad elections schedule to be held later this month. Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and senior BJP leader Arjun Ram Meghwal alleged that the Congress government did not implement schemes like the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission, and PM housing scheme deliberately as they were named after Jan Sangh stalwarts. "Thinking that the popularity of the BJP government (at the Centre) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is increasing in rural areas, the state government did not implement them (central schemes),” Meghwal alleged in a press conference at the party office here. BJP national secretary Alka Gurjar said that the state government has failed to deliver due to financial mismanagement and infighting and people have lost faith. "People have faith in the BJP and the party is going to win the panchayat samiti and zila parishad elections,” she said.

18-11-2020||North and Central||SC reserves order on plea by sacked BSF constable against rejection of election petition against PM Modi||The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected repeated plea for adjournments and reserved its orders in an election matter against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "This is too important a matter to be adjourned so many times. The respondent occupies a unique office. He is the Prime Minister of India," a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde said. The court wrapped up hearing on a plea by Tej Bahadur, a sacked BSF constable, against the Allahabad High Court's order that had dismissed his election petition against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, did not agree to repeated requests by petitioner's counsel for adjournments. "We can't give you indefinite time to hear this case. You show us the evidence. Is it so important to take a pass over in the case? The adjournment has gone so long for three months in the case," the bench told advocate Pradeep Yadav, appearing for Tej Bahadur. The court said it was hearing the counsel as the respondent was the Prime Minister here. The bench also pointed out that the matter had earlier been adjourned four times. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Modi, that this gentleman (petitioner) filed two nomination papers, one as independent and another for Samajwadi Party. In one, he said, he was dismissed from a job, and in another, he denied it, Salve added.  Tej Bahadur's nomination papers were rejected as the Samajwadi Party candidate in Varanasi constituency in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He challenged the validity of the High Court's judgement of December 6, 2019. The High Court has dismissed his election petition as having no locus and further that he was neither a registered voter nor the resident of Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency. In a special leave petition, he contended that his nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer under "illegitimate pressure" from BJP.  "The officer acted in an arbitrary manner and the High Court also committed a grave error by ignoring the fact when any person filed nomination in a constituency and his candidature has been rejected, then he has locus to file election petition," his plea contended. The petitioner sought a direction to set aside the rejection of his nomination papers on May 1, 2019, and also action against the returning officer for misuse of his official powers.  The petitioner was sacked from the BSF after a video in which he showed the alleged poor quality of foods served to jawans went viral on social media networking sites.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-reserves-order-on-plea-by-sacked-bsf-constable-against-rejection-of-election-petition-against-pm-modi-917101.html

The Special Cell of Delhi Police had on Monday night held two suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) operatives near Sarai Kale Khan. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Ranvijay Singh said Noida shares its borders with Delhi and following such developments, the security is beefed up and checkings intensified. “We get information through the press as well as at the department level about such happenings in nearby places and, accordingly, step up security,” Singh said. “We usually have security posts at border points and intensify them upon getting alerts like these (terrorists' arrest in Delhi),” he said. The officer said the heightened alertness and security are resorted to as preventive measures because people linked with the developments in Delhi might try to seek shelter in Noida. “After the latest alert from Delhi, we have intensified our checkings at borders and are on alert mode. Border points have been over-sensitised for checkings,” he added. The suspected terrorists held in Delhi have been identified as Latif Mir, 22, and Mohammad Ashraf Khatana, both natives of Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. Two semi-automatic pistols along with some ammunition were recovered from their possession when they were trapped near Millennium Park in Sarai Kale Khan on Monday night, the officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-on-alert-police-checks-intensified-after-suspected-terrorists-held-in-delhi-917106.html

The apex court, which refused to accept the request of Yadav’s counsel to adjourn the hearing, observed that whether his nomination was rightly or wrongly rejected depends on his eligibility. “Why should we grant you liberty for adjournment. You are abusing the process of law. You argue,” a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Yadav’s counsel. The counsel argued that Bahadur had earlier filed his nomination as an independent candidate and later as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party. The Returning Officer on May 1 last year had rejected the nomination papers of Bahadur, a Samajwadi Party candidate, who was dismissed from BSF in 2017 after he posted a video online complaining about the quality of food served to the troops.

Under the Forest Rights Act-2006, rights of traditional forest dwellers stand protected against forced displacements, evictions from forest lands. However, the central Act was not applicable or implemented in J&K due to Article 370. J&K Chief Secretary, B V R Subrahmanyam, who chaired a meeting on Wednesday to review the implementation of the Act, was informed by the officers that the work has already begun by the departments of Tribal Affairs, and Forest, Ecology and Environment in October 2020 in this regard, an official spokesperson said. It was decided in the meeting that the ‘survey of claimants' by the Forest Rights Committees for assessing the nature and extent of rights being claimed at village level be completed by 15-01-2021, for their further submission to the respective sub-divisional committees. These committees shall complete the process of scrutiny of claims and preparation of ‘record of forest rights’ by or before 31-01-2021. Similarly, the district level committees shall consider and approve the record and grant forest rights by 01-03-2021. It was informed that under the Act, the forest-dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers will be provided with the rights over forest land for the purpose of habitation or self-cultivation/livelihood; ownership, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor forest produce, and entitlement to seasonal resources among others. However, the rights conferred under this Act shall be heritable but not alienable or transferrable, the spokesperson added. The Act further provides that on the recommendation of Gram Sabha, forest land up to one hectare can be diverted for the purpose of developing government facilities including schools, hospitals, minor water bodies, rainwater harvesting structures, minor irrigation canals, vocational training centres, non-conventional sources of energy, roads etc. In the recent days amid reports of “illegal eviction” of nomads from forest areas, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had said it was disconcerting to see nomads being “harassed and displaced” and sought Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha's intervention to ensure it stops. The PDP chief had warned the government against evicting members of the Gujjar-Bakerwal community from forest areas, saying the consequences would be dangerous if they were harassed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-revocation-of-article-370-forest-rights-act-to-be-implemented-in-jk-917179.html

A police official said the militants lobbed a grenade on a joint team of J&K police and paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Kakapora, Pulwama, 26 kms from Srinagar. However, the grenade missed the intended target and exploded on the road injuring 12 civilians, he said. The injured have been shifted to hospital and the area has been cordoned off to nab the militants. There has been a spurt in grenade attack cases in Kashmir in recent months and what is worrisome for the security forces is that these attacks are coming up at a time when they are already on a high alert. The latest attack comes at a time when J&K is gearing up for first-ever district development council polls scheduled to begin from November 28. Official sources said that the Union Home Ministry has ordered the deployment of 49 additional battalions of CRPF in J&K to ensure violence-free polls. They said the deployments are being moved from various states to J&K and concerned quarters have been asked to make the arrangements including the desired scale of arms and ammunition, special anti-riot equipment and winter clothing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/12-civilians-injured-in-pulwama-grenade-attack-917191.html

Lockdown was not a solution to the pandemic. It could be tackled through proper medical arrangements which the government was doing effectively, he said while interacting with reporters at the Delhi Secretariat. The national capital has been witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when daily cases breached the 5,000 mark for the first time. Single-day rise in cases crossed the 8,000 mark on November 11. "We have no intention of a lockdown. Let me clarify, we have made a general proposal to the Centre with regard to certain regulations like shutdown for some days in the markets where Covid-19-appropriate behaviour and social distancing violations pose threat of rapid infection," Sisodia said.  He asserted what the Delhi government has proposed are measures to prevent violations like not wearing face masks and crowding in the markets and it will not be a lockdown. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Centre and all agencies were making "double efforts" to control the Covid-19 situation in the national capital. He had said that massive crowds were witnessed in some of the popular markets of Delhi before Diwali and no social distancing was followed leading to a surge in Covid-19 cases.  "In view of the recent situation and considering the last order of the Central government, we have requested the Centre to permit shutting down market places if necessary," Kejriwal had said. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 6,396 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally to over 4.95 lakh, while 99 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 7,812. The city had recorded 104 deaths in a day on November 12, the highest in five months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-lockdown-plan-may-impose-restrictions-in-marketplaces-to-prevent-covid-19-spread-sisodia-917194.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi govt's cap on wedding guests leaves many families worried||With hardly a week remaining for his wedding, 30-year-old Krishna Kumar and his family are now a worried lot after the Delhi government announced it would restrict the guests' list in marriage ceremonies from 200 to only 50 amid a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. Kumar, whose wedding is scheduled for November 27, said invitations have been already sent to nearly 250 people. "Even though, 200 guests were earlier allowed, we had sent out invitations to around 250 people both verbally or through WhatsApp. The government should have taken this decision earlier as the marriage season has already started," he said. Kumar's family is extremely worried since it has already invested around Rs 15 lakh for the special occasion. He said all payments have been made already - from venue to catering. "What can we do now, we won't even get refund. We had booked a lavish farmhouse in Palla for the wedding since we were expecting around 200 people but now that only 50 are allowed, we would not need such a huge space for the wedding. But we have already paid them. I'm not sure if we would get any refund or can change the venue," he said. The only relief for most of the families is that amid Covid-19, they planned to organise rest of the wedding ceremonies from Sangeet to Mehendi at their homes with close family members and friends. After the Delhi government's announcement, Sneha Samaddar, whose wedding is scheduled for December 7, was flooded with messages from friends and family members. Fortunately, she and her family had already decided to limit their guest list to 70 people. "We have only invited very close relatives and family friends for the wedding. Not more than 70. But now that it is decided that only 50 members will be allowed at wedding ceremonies, we will only be prune the guest list further. All arrangements have been made already. But now it will be our families and few extremely close friends," she said. Since Covid-19 cases were on a surge here, her family had decided to organise wedding function in the same hotel where rooms were booked for the groom and his family since they would be coming from Maharashtra. A marketing executive, who did not wish to identify herself, said that her wedding is slated for December 10 and since there are a number of elderly people in the family, the guest list was already kept below 100. And now after the Delhi government's decision, there will be further cut in the guest list. Her sister Reva Sarna, who is personally monitoring all the wedding arrangements, said it would be awkward to request those who have been already invited to not attend the wedding now. "For Sangeet and Mehendi, only very close friends have been invited. It's a small function and we had already planned to do it on the rooftop of her Vasant Kunj residence. We have already sought permission from Residents Welfare Association. Family members who wouldn't be able to make it can join the celebrations online," she added. For Sangeeta Kohli, whose niece is getting married on December 2, their family is extremely stressed about how to do the last minute re-arrangements and changes in the guest list. "We had invited only 100 people but had booked a banquet hall which could accommodate nearly 200 people but now with this new norm, we are completely left with no choice. It is also awkward to inform people now after sending out invitations. We have also made payments accordingly but it is not refundable," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govts-cap-on-wedding-guests-leaves-many-families-worried-917196.html

A division bench of Justice Sanjeev Kumar and Justice Rajnesh Oswal issued the direction on Tuesday after noticing that the detention order against Bhat has outlived its life and the writ petition has become infructuous. Bhat, who is the chairman of the separatist outfit Muslim League, had challenged a judgment of a single bench which had dismissed his plea against his 36th preventive detention order dated November 14, 2017, issued by District Magistrate Kupwara. The single bench while pointing out that preventive detention is devised to afford protection to society had observed that the object was not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept before he does it and to prevent him from doing. In his petition before the single bench, Bhat had submitted that "the authorities were relentlessly passing detention orders on the grounds that run afoul of the Constitution and the safeguards inbuilt in the preventive detention statute on the routine basis in blatant violation of the court orders".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-hc-orders-release-of-separatist-leader-masarat-alam-bhat-917200.html

Kejriwal has also called an all-party meeting on Thursday to discuss Covid-19 situation in the capital even as the Chief Minister is pushing for permission from the Centre to shut down markets that may emerge as hotspots. A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesperson on Wednesday said Railways is also making available coaches with 800 beds at a station here to be used as health and isolation centres. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is adding 250 ICU beds to the existing 250 in addition to creating 35 BIPAP beds in the next 3-4 days at its Covid-19 hospital near the Delhi airport, the spokesperson said. These are part of the 12 decisions taken during a review meeting chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday with Kejriwal and others. Ten multi-disciplinary teams have started visiting over 100 private hospitals in Delhi to assess bed utilisation and testing capacity and to identify extra ICU beds. The spokesperson also said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Delhi government are working together to enhance RT-PCR testing capacity to 60,000 tests by November-end. Testing capacity has already been enhanced by 10,000 tests per day on November 17, the spokesperson said. The Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has dispatched 250 ventilators from Bengaluru and these are expected to reach Delhi by the end of the week. On his part, Kejriwal said the Delhi government will add 663 ICU beds in hospitals run by the state administration in view of the rising cases. "We had a meeting with doctors at GTB Hospital and they have agreed to add 238 ICU beds in the next two days. In all, 663 ICU beds shall be added in various Delhi hospitals in the next few days," he said. Even as cases were on the rise, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the Delhi government has no plan to impose a lockdown but may press some restrictions in market areas for some days to prevent the spread of Covid-19. "We have no intention of a lockdown. Let me clarify, we have made a general proposal to the Centre with regard to certain regulations like shutdown for some days in the markets where Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and social distancing violations pose a threat of rapid infection," Sisodia said. On Wednesday, Delhi government got the nod from Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to restrict the number of guests for marriage to 50 from the existing limit of 200. The Kejriwal government has also sent its proposal to allow the state administration to shut down certain markets but a call is yet to be taken by the Centre. Such decisions would need the permission of the Centre, which disallows states announcing lockdown of non-containment zones on its own.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-paramilitary-doctors-arrive-in-delhi-marriage-guests-restricted-to-50-917228.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||Over 150 school students in Haryana test Covid-19 positive||Over 150 school students from three districts in Haryana have tested positive for coronavirus, prompting authorities to order the closure of the educational institutions for a few days, officials said on Wednesday. The condition of the children, all students of classes 9 to 12, was stated to be stable and most of them were under home isolation, they said. While 91 students from 13 schools in Rewari district have tested positive for Covid-19, 30 students and 10 teachers of various schools in Jind district too have contracted the infection. Thirty-four students and two teachers from Jhajjar district were also found infected with the virus, the officials said. Health Department officials said the schools where the students tested positive have been shut for a few days as per government guidelines. The officials said they were keeping a close watch and regularly monitoring the health of the children. Besides, those who had come into contact with the children and the teachers were also being screened and tested. State Health Minister Anil Vij, in a statement, said the health department teams will conduct checkups of students and staffers of all schools. He also said that strict action will be taken against the schools which are found not properly following the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Nineteen of the 35 students of government senior secondary school in Kund village in Rewari district, whose samples were taken a few days ago, had tested positive for the infection, Deputy Commissioner Yashender Singh said on Wednesday. Later, random sampling was done in 12 other schools of Rewari district and samples of nearly 1,000 students were taken, Singh told PTI over the phone. "All the children are stable, they are under home isolation. Medical teams are at the job and regularly monitoring their health. The students are of classes 9 to 12," he said. Jind district's Chief Medical Officer Dr Manjeet Singh said nearly 4,800 random samplings was done in the schools during the past about two weeks. "So far, 30 students and 10 teachers have tested positive. Though they are doing fine, the health department teams are keeping a close watch and regularly monitoring their condition," he said. Jhajjar district's Chief Medical Officer Dr Sanjay said 34 students and two teachers have tested positive for the virus. "We had randomly collected 1,200 samples before Diwali and 34 students and two teachers were found Covid-19 positive," he said. Dr Sanjay said he has written a letter to the district education officer stating that all school students, teachers and other staff members who show influenza-like symptoms must immediately report to the health authorities. "The health department will start a drive in schools and get such people tested," he said. The schools in Haryana reopened from November 2, but only students of classes 9 to 12 were allowed to attend with the prior consent of their parents. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet in Hindi said, "In Haryana, 149 school students and 12 teachers have tested Covid-19 positive, which is a cause of serious concern." "Is the government ensuring distribution of masks and sanitisers and following of social distancing norms in schools? The chief minister should tell how the spread of infection will be checked and what is the policy being adopted in this regard," he added. Until Wednesday, Haryana has reported 2,07,039 coronavirus cases with 2,039 fatalities. Earlier in September, students studying in classes 9 to 12 were allowed to visit their institutions outside Covid-19 containment zones only to consult their teachers to clear any doubts. Schools have been asked by authorities to follow all SOPs issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-150-school-students-in-haryana-test-covid-19-positive-917233.html
18-11-2020||North and Central||You have to be alive to celebrate any festival: Delhi HC, says no Chhath puja at public places amid Covid||Observing that a person has to be alive to celebrate any festival and practice any religion, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday refused permission for celebrating Chhath puja at public places when a third wave of Covid-19 has hit the national capital. “While religious sentiments of all sections of the society must be respected, the right to life and health of the public at large cannot be sacrificed at the altar of a right to celebrate a festival, however, significant it may be for a particular community," said a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad. The observations by the court came even as chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar--Yogi Adityanath and Nitish Kumar--urged caution during the celebrations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adityanath urged people to try to celebrate the festival from the confines of their homes as they had done for the previous festivals. In Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has put restrictions on mass celebration of Chhath puja at beaches, river banks and other natural water bodies in the city and asked devotees to avoid crowding. Pronouncing its order, the Delhi High Court said the right to health of residents in the capital is supreme and granting any such permission to celebrate Chhath puja at public places like ponds, riverbanks and temples would necessarily result in the celebrations turning into a “super spreader” of the infection. "This is the time to scale down to contain the infection and not to escalate the same,” it said while dismissing a petition by Durga Jan Seva Trust, challenging the November 10 order of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) not to allow any gathering in public places for Chhath puja on November 20. The bench said the plea seeking permission to hold a gathering of 1,000 people for Chhath puja, is meritless. “Oh really! Today when the Delhi government is not allowing marriages with over 50 persons, you want only 1,000 persons. How come?,” it remarked. The high court said it sees no reason to interfere with the November 10 order of DDMA which has taken into consideration the spread of the COVID-19 infection in Delhi and decided not to allow any persons to gather in public places to celebrate Chhath puja. During the hearing, the bench observed that the right to health must be respected first and the person has to live to be able to practice any religion. “You have to be alive to celebrate any festival." The bench said it appeared that the petitioner trust has lost sight of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Delhi where even as per the city government, represented through additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Naman Jain, a third wave is under way. “The daily infection rate in the past one week is hovering between 7,800 to 8,593. The daily death rate has crossed double figures and has touched 104 just a few days ago. Even as on date, there are 42,004 active cases of COVID-19 infection in Delhi. “In such circumstances, the petitioner/Trust cannot expect the respondent/State to permit it to organise a Chhath puja for over 2 lakh persons at a public place in Delhi. Any such permission if granted, would necessarily result in the said celebration turning into a super spreader of the infection,” the bench said. “In today's day and time, the petitioner/Trust's desire to celebrate Chhath puja at such a large scale at public places, is belied by the existing ground reality prevalent in Delhi. The petitioner/Trust should have been alive to the said situation before approaching the court for such a relief.” Chhath puja is celebrated by thousands of people in the capital, especially those hailing from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Advocate Ranjan Chaudhary, representing the Trust, submitted that while passing the order, the authorities have not taken into consideration the fact that Chhath puja is a major religious festival that is celebrated by the people of Bihar and eastern UP on an annual basis. He said that for the past several years, the Trust has been organising the Chhath puja at the Kirari MCD ground which can accommodate over 2 lakh people and this time too, it may be permitted to organise the puja at the same place by adopting all safety measures. The Trust contended that the directions issued by the authorities not to organise such a puja during the COVID-19 pandemic overlooks the religious sentiments of the people and amounts to violating their right to conduct ceremonies at public places. In the national capital, a city-based organisation of 'Poorvanchalis' - people hailing from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh - plans to host Chhath puja online for devotees. The four-day Chhath festival began on Wednesday. Folk songs dedicated to the Sun God and aroma of traditional offerings filled the air at homes only as the ghats in Delhi, otherwise decked up for devotees every year, are not to be used this time. The organisation, Poorvanchal Gaurav, is hosting the festival online from November 18-20. The festival is celebrated to pay obeisance to the Sun as a cosmic energy. A member of the organisation said the festivities would be hosted on Facebook and YouTube so that devotees don't miss the sense of the community gathering that happens on ghats and other water bodies during the festival.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/you-have-to-be-alive-to-celebrate-any-festival-delhi-hc-says-no-chhath-puja-at-public-places-amid-covid-917253.html

The study aims to help improve governance and public service delivery in Delhi while making tax compliance easy, Sisodia, who is also the finance minister, said. "It is an important step in the Delhi government's resolve to bring in tax reforms. We have tied up with CEGIS, who will provide us with high-end analysis to move forward. They will provide us with comprehensive data analysis related to GST, vehicle tax, stamp duty, excise duty, along with comparative state analysis for benchmarking to further improve our tax revenue capacity," he said. The MoU was signed between CEGIS and the Planning department of the Delhi government in the presence of Sisodia and Jasmine Shah, vice chairperson of the Dialogue and Development Commission.

18-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi records 131 Covid-19 deaths, highest single-day fatality count till date; 7,486 new cases||As the national capital grapples with a spurt in Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government is working to add 660 ICU beds in its hospitals in the next few days and the Railways will be providing coaches with 800 beds, while an all-party meeting has been called by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday to discuss the situation. Delhi recorded 7,486 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the infection tally in the city to over five lakh, while 131 new fatalities, the highest single-day death count till date, pushed the toll to 7,943, authorities said. With medical facilities under strain, as many as 45 doctors and 160 paramedics of the paramilitary forces have also arrived in the capital to serve the people. A day after Kejriwal spoke of reimposing certain restrictions, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Wednesday reverted to the earlier cap of 50 guests at marriage functions instead of 200 allowed through its October 31 order. The national capital has been witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when daily cases breached the 5,000-mark for the first time. The single-day rise in cases crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. The city had recorded 104 deaths in a day on November 12, the highest in five months. On Thursday, Kejriwal will hold the all-party meeting to discuss the Covud-19 situation in the city, even as Opposition parties said that they would raise issues like "inadequate" testing and press for proper enforcement of precautionary measures. An AAP leader said discussions would be held on the rising cases of Covid-19 cases, and the chief minister would seek cooperation from all party leaders, MPs and MLAs in spreading awareness and advocating Covid-appropriate behaviour in their constituencies. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said he will attend the meeting, but added the move has come late. "I will suggest the AAP government strictly enforce Covid-19 safety measures like using face masks and social distancing in the markets instead of talking about lockdown. I will also ask the chief minister to improve facilities like ICU beds at its hospitals in Delhi so that more patients can be treated there," Gupta said. DPCC chief Anil Chaudhary will also attend the all-party meeting on Thursday. "We have been raising the issue of inadequate testing. Besides this, we will also raise the issue of ban on Chhath Puja at public places in the meeting," Chaudhary said. Meanwhile, the chief minister visited GTB Hospital and said that over 660 ICU beds will be added in various Delhi government hospitals in the next few days in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. He said, "We had a meeting with doctors at GTB Hospital and they have agreed to add 238 ICU beds in the next two days." "In all, 663 ICU beds shall be added in various Delhi hospitals in the next few days," he said. Also, the Union Home Ministry on Tuesday said that 45 doctors and 160 paramedics of the paramilitary forces have arrived in Delhi while the Railways is making available coaches with 800 beds at a station here to be used as health and isolation centres. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is going to add 250 ICU beds to the existing 250 in addition to creating 35 BIPAP beds in the next 3-4 days at its Covid-19 hospital near the Delhi airport, a home ministry spokesperson said. These developments come in the wake of 12 decisions taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday following concern over the spurt in Covid-19 cases. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, however, said that the Delhi government has no plan to impose a lockdown. It may press for certain restrictions in market areas for some days to prevent the spread of Covid-19, if such a need arises, he said. Lockdown was not a solution to the pandemic. It could be tackled through proper medical arrangements which the government was doing effectively, he said while interacting with reporters at the Delhi Secretariat. While capping the number of 50 guests at wedding functions, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, in an order, said that the decision was taken in view of the sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, which has further been aggravated due to rising pollution levels owing to various factors. "In closed spaces, a maximum of 50 percent of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 50 persons. Wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitizer will continue to be mandatory," Dev said. He also said, "In open spaces, keeping the size of the ground/space in view, subject to a ceiling of 50 persons and with strict observance of social distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks...." On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 6,396 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally to over 4.95 lakh, while 99 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 7,812.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-131-covid-19-deaths-highest-single-day-fatality-count-till-date-7486-new-cases-917300.html
18-11-2020||Opinion||Joe Biden wants to rejoin Iran nuclear deal, but it won’t be easy||President-elect Joe Biden has promised to move quickly to rejoin the nuclear deal with Iran so long as Iran also comes back into compliance. But that vow is easier said than done. While Biden’s pledge pleased the deal’s other signatories, who were angry that President Donald Trump withdrew from it two years ago, returning to the way things were maybe impossible, complicated by both Iranian and US politics. Trump, even as a lame duck, is moving quickly to increase US sanctions against Iran and sell advanced weapons to its regional enemies, policies that would be difficult for a new president to reverse. Last week, he asked his advisers for options to launch a military strike against Iran but appears to have been talked out of it. His aides argued that an attack could quickly lead to a larger war. Iran, where President Hassan Rouhani faces strong opposition from conservatives in elections set for June 2021, is expected to demand a high price to return to the deal, including the immediate lifting of the punishing sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and billions of dollars in compensation for them. Those are demands that Biden is highly unlikely to meet — especially given strong congressional opposition. Iran has some leverage. When Trump took office, Iran had roughly 102 kilograms, or about 225 pounds, of enriched uranium, whose production was limited by the 2015 agreement. After the United States withdrew, Iran declared it was no longer bound by the agreement and resumed enriching uranium at higher levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week that Iran now had more than 2,440 kilograms, which is more than eight times the limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal. The “breakout” time for Iran to possibly make a nuclear weapon — an ambition it denies — is now considerably shorter than a year. During the campaign, Biden called Trump’s decision to abandon the deal “reckless” and said it ended up isolating the United States, not Iran. “I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy,” Biden wrote in a September op-ed for CNN. “If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations.” A week ago, after Biden’s victory, Rouhani welcomed the initiative, calling it “an opportunity” for the United States “to compensate for its previous mistakes and return to the path of adherence to international commitments.” The choice of the word “compensate” was not accidental, said Robert Einhorn, a nuclear arms-control negotiator now at the Brookings Institution. Iran says it wants Washington to pay for the billions of dollars in economic losses it incurred when Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran deal in 2018 and reinstituted sanctions that it had lifted. Since then, Trump has piled on more sanctions. This maximum pressure campaign, as the administration has called it, devastated Iran’s economy but failed to push Iran back to the negotiating table or to curtail its involvement in Iraq, Syria or Lebanon. The administration is also trying to further limit Iran’s support for proxy militias in those countries. It is selling more sophisticated weapons to the Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf — countries that see Iran as an enemy and have their own regional ambitions — and accelerating the transfer of F-35 fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates. Some think Trump will take more kinetic measures, including further sabotage and cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear or missile programs or even military action, which Israel, Egypt and the Gulf allies would most likely support. “I don’t think the administration is finished on the Iran issue,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a long-standing supporter of a tough policy on Iran. “I think people are going to run hard for the next three months against Iran, knowing that after January there could be a very different Iran policy in place.” Iranian negotiators know that the United States would never provide financial compensation, Einhorn said. “But they may stake out a tough negotiating position, especially given the dynamics of their upcoming election.” He suggested that Iran would demand not just the removal of the nuclear-related sanctions but also those imposed for human rights violations, ballistic missile development and support for terrorist groups, which a Biden administration would find politically and technically difficult to do. Short of a quick re-entry into the nuclear deal, Einhorn said, the parties should work toward an interim agreement, in which Iran would roll back a meaningful part of its current nuclear buildup in exchange for partial sanctions relief — especially giving Iran access to some of its oil revenues now blocked in overseas bank accounts. Iran might welcome such an interim arrangement if it gave the economy a quick boost, especially before the mid-June elections. But given the complications of the US transition of power, with the requirements for security clearances and Senate confirmation already slowed by Trump’s refusal to concede defeat and cooperate with Biden, top officials might not be in place very soon. The practical window between inauguration Jan. 20 and June is likely to be only two or three months, which argues for a rapidly constructed “back channel” between Washington and Tehran after Biden takes office. Despite Trump’s pressure campaign, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has kept the door open to a US return, refusing to completely abandon the nuclear deal, said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Iranians opposed to the initial deal argue that the United States has proved it cannot be trusted, and Iran rejected any negotiations with Trump. But Khamenei provided Rouhani “the green light, the political space to make these messages to a Biden administration” about Iran’s desire for Washington to return to the deal, Geranmayeh said. At the same time, she noted, Rouhani’s hard-line opponents will not want him “to get this win before the elections in June, and they will look to jam this effort as the Republicans will try to jam Biden’s,” she said. Biden could quickly lift a number of sanctions tied to Iran’s nuclear activities, including approving more waivers allowing Iran to sell oil. He could ease travel restrictions on Iranian citizens, increase humanitarian trade by easing banking impediments, and lift sanctions on some key officials, like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, the main nuclear negotiator. But sanctions instituted under the category of counterterrorism and human rights, like those against the Revolutionary Guard, would be harder to void, especially because many Democrats also support them. But Geranmayeh said that Iran would insist that the United States lift the sanction against the Central Bank of Iran, accused of financing designated terrorist groups, so that it can once again use the global banking system. If the Iran deal can be reconstituted, Iran has said it is open to talks on other issues, especially regional concerns around Iraq and Syria. But Iran has so far refused to put on the table its missile program, which is already under separate US and U.N. sanctions. Some, like Trita Parsi, of the Quincy Institute in Washington, think Biden should aim higher, for example by proposing normalizing diplomatic relations with Iran. “Putting the puzzle of US-Iranian diplomacy back together will be tremendously difficult,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs. “But the last few years have shown that not trying will not make the difficulties go away.” The key, as with all major policies in Iran, is Khamenei, now 81. He regards the US as a doomed country in “political, civil and moral decline.” He went along with the nuclear deal because it promised significant economic benefits from the lifting of sanctions and now apparently regards his scepticism about the United States as confirmed by Trump’s withdrawal from the pact. But with the change in US leadership, he again sees the possibility of easing the economic straitjacket that renewed US sanctions have imposed. “Despite Khamenei’s hubris, a Biden presidency presents both an opportunity and a challenge for Tehran,” Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment wrote. “The opportunity is a chance to improve the country’s moribund economy; the challenge is that Tehran will no longer be able to effectively use President Donald Trump as a pretext or distraction for its domestic repression, economic failures and regional aggression.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/joe-biden-wants-to-rejoin-iran-nuclear-deal-but-it-won-t-be-easy-916980.html
18-11-2020||Opinion||Nitish Kumar’s unenviable last reign||Last week, as Modi strutted around his party office in the national capital, with almost his entire council of ministers and party office bearers appearing to fawn over him and attempting to catch his eye and register their presence, it was evident that the victory celebrations were directed at cocking a snook as much at his principal adversary, the Tejashwi Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), as much as Nitish Kumar and his party, the Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)). History had come a full circle in Bihar and Modi did not waste the opportunity to make the changed equation within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) obvious to the JD(U) chief. When the two parties first came together in the mid-1990s, (the JD(U) then existed as Samata Party under George Fernandes' leadership), the BJP was the bigger partner but roles were reversed subsequently, chiefly due to the absence of a charismatic state leader in the Saffron fold.  Becoming the ‘senior’ partner Ever since Nitish Kumar returned to the NDA fold in 2016, it was evident that at the first opportunity, the BJP would reclaim its primacy. Throughout the election campaign in Bihar, it was obvious that for the BJP the poll was as much about being able to ensure the return of an NDA government to office, as about emerging as the 'senior' partner in the alliance.  Modi views alliances as being purely transactional and driven solely by 'what's-there-in-it-for-me' calculation. When he was still Gujarat Chief Minister and the BJP was short of allies, I had asked Modi if he hoped to forge electoral pacts if he was made the BJP leader. His reply was typically Modi-sque: ‘When our winnability was high, they were with us, but they deserted us when our winnability decreased. If they think it has risen again, they will come back.’ Nothing testified to his assertion being bang on than Nitish Kumar's seeking votes this time in the name of Modi. It was a cruel blow for a man who once mocked Modi and disallowed him from campaigning in Bihar in the 2009 and 2010 parliamentary and assembly polls, respectively. Bihar’s confounding mandate The BJP has increased its tally appreciably from 53 to 74 seats but its vote share shrunk from 24.42 per cent to 19.46 per cent, a decline of 4.96 per cent. Clearly, this is not a verdict that mandates the nature of the victory ceremony the BJP held, but then, this is acceptable in the first-past-the-post system where the final tally is what matters in the end.   Little-known Deputy CMs  The moot question, however, is if the BJP has been provided with a victory that can lay a platform for it to emerge as the only dominant party in coming elections or would it continue to require allies, either smaller ones as in the just concluded polls, or a large one like the JD(U). The diminished profile of the chief minister certainly raises the prospect of a section of his party drifting into the BJP, aware that his winnability, ironically the same factor that forced him to seek votes in Modi's name, too had declined. That this process is certainly one of the objectives of the BJP is discernible in its decision to jettison Sushil Modi from the position of Deputy Chief Minister. The two BJP nominees for the position had people rushing to google their names as little was known about them. Their nominal stature vis-a-vis the national leadership and even when compared to other state leaders in Bihar, who have acquired prominence in recent years, reminded me of a R K Laxman cartoon when Indira Gandhi had, in the early 1980s, begun nominating little-known leaders as chief ministers. The cartoon depicted her walking past a file of Congress leaders. She stops and points at one: ‘O.K. you, there, you are the CM. What's your name?’ BJP leaders would have certainly known about Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi but their relative political lightweight status would make them more beholden to the national leadership than Sushil Modi. He is, after all, a near contemporary of the prime minister. He cut his teeth politically during Emergency and the students' agitation preceding it. He was also closely allied with Nitish Kumar, and under his leadership, it would have been difficult to pull the rug from beneath the chief minister's feet if the BJP leadership decided to do so in future. The Nitish Kumar-Sushil Modi team in their tenure consistently flagged India's federal character during the UPA years, especially on the issue surrounding the introduction of GST. The Centre since 2014 has frowned on efforts of state governments to raise federal issues as it remains committed to it primarily in name, not in spirit. Unlike in his previous terms in office, Nitish Kumar will be constrained by the absence of complete backing of his council of ministers. He, however, has no one but himself to blame for his situation. It remains up to the RJD and its leader to utilise the fault lines within the ruling edifice to secure greater support and prevent the BJP's further rise in the state.

18-11-2020||Panorama||Biden and America are key to addressing climate change, Covid-19||USA under President-elect Biden can galvanize global action to address global climate crisis and Covid pandemic, along with economic revival. In the midst of all the chaos and confusion post-US election, when all the TV channels, newspapers and websites were screaming about the presidential poll results, the Trump administration announced the completion of the formal withdrawal process from the Paris climate agreement. The outgoing US President was against the Paris Accord since the beginning for many reasons, including his opposition to one of its architects -- former president Barack Obama. On June 1, 2017, Trump had formally announced that he would withdraw the US from the accord, fulfilling his campaign promise. How important is the US to meeting the Paris Accord goals and addressing the climate crisis? America currently accounts for about 15% of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) or carbon emissions (China is the largest emitter, accounting for nearly 30%). If one takes the cumulative carbon emissions, say in the last 100 years, the US dominates. To achieve the Paris temperature target of limiting global warming to well below 2 0C, all countries especially the high income and emerging developing countries, have to participate. According to estimates made based on the national voluntary commitments submitted to the UN to reduce emissions, even if all countries achieve the targets, the world will warm by nearly 2.7-3 0C. Thus, the US, which accounts for about 15% of the global emissions, will become critical. Further, if the US withdrawal stands, many other countries may decide to leave the accord in the coming years, though as of now no country has threatened to do so. Even if countries do not leave, they may be less enthusiastic about achieving or enhancing their emission reduction commitments. This will make achieving the Paris temperature target impossible, forsaking the world to dangerous levels of global warming. Fortunately, the global climate change efforts received significant boost when President-elect Biden announced that the US will re-join the Paris Accord on day one of his presidency in January. He also announced re-joining the WHO. Both Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, in their first address after being elected, mentioned climate change as a priority concern. Biden also talked about creating 10 million new jobs through green energy and climate change mitigation efforts. World leaders, in their message of congratulations to Biden, talked about cooperating with the US in achieving the global climate goals. Climate financing or green financing, which is critical for assisting developing countries in implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes, has received very limited funding from rich countries. Trump completely stopped even the limited fund flows from the US to the UN Green Climate Fund (GCF). Hopefully, the Biden administration will resume and enhance US contribution to the GCF to assist developing countries to meet their climate goals. GCF has received commitments of only about $10 billion during 2014 to 2020, as against the initial expectation of hundreds of billions of dollars.  The Covid-19 pandemic may limit the capacity of rich countries in their ability to contribute to GCF. India is in the forefront of demanding that rich countries should meet their financial contribution commitment to assist developing countries. There is a need for enhanced financial commitment from rich countries to developing countries, but lack of fund flow may again halt any serious progress at the upcoming UN Climate Convention in Glasgow in late 2021. Many countries have already committed through policies and legislations to reduce carbon emissions. The European Union has agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The UK, Japan and South Korea have announced similar goals for achieving carbon neutrality. Even China announced a policy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Carbon neutrality is agreed under Paris agreement, where the net emissions from a country should be zero by around 2050. Any US commitment to a national carbon neutrality target, and policies supported by legislation and financial incentives, has the potential to galvanise other rich countries to adopt policies and financial arrangements to achieve carbon neutrality. Biden has on his website announced many large initiatives to address climate change along with economic revival in the face of Covid-19. Some of the action plans promised are: Ensure that the US achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050: On day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden administration platform and put US on the right track. Build a stronger, more resilient nation: On day one, Biden will announce smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that the buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change. Make a historic investment in energy and climate research and innovation, as well as clean and resilient infrastructure and communities. Rally the rest of the world: Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world.  Biden has announced a plan to spend $2 trillion over the next four years to promote use of clean energy in the transportation, electricity and building sectors, designed to create economic opportunities and strengthen infrastructure, while tackling climate change. Thus, the need of the hour is to address climate change as part of the economic revival package in response to the economic crisis arising out of the pandemic. Biden could catalyse global action on climate change and the pandemic. Both climate change and Covid-19 are global challenges and require global action. Hopefully, the Biden administration can work with all nations and international institutions to address global environmental and health challenges.

18-11-2020||Panorama||Should kids code or not?||Recently, my relative from the temple town of Sringeri called me and her first question was, “what is this coding?” This would perhaps be the question with any parent with young kids, after seeing advertisements that persuade children to take it up. Unable to comprehend, they are worried that their kids are deprived of something and likely feel apprehension for being left out. Let us remember that these are the same parents who are proud of their kids’ ability to demonstrate “smartness” by effortlessly using smartphones. Before we delve into whether parents need to push their kids into coding, let us understand the meaning of coding. Coding is a technical word for computer programming. Coding is a process by which source code for computer programs are created and maintained. All the computer and mobile applications that we often use, are a result of coding using various programming languages. Can anyone with no computer background pickup programming? The answer is a resounding yes. There are various online tutorials that can teach the nuances of programming. This is exactly the way someone can pick up Kannada or Malayalam with the “Learn a language in 30 days” type books. The depth in understanding the language ( spoken language or programming language) will be missing. Of course, Computer programming is an important subject and even the National Education Policy 2020 has emphasized the need for early exposure to children on computers and technology. As per MHRD website, India has over 12 crore students in the first to 10th standard bracket with over 6 crore in the 10-15 years age group. Do we want these kids to become programmers at the age of 10 or 12? There is much more to life for these young minds than coding. The NEP is envisaging holistic development of the future generation. Let us get the priority right. We need to provide a strong foundation on cognitive skills or life skills for the young kids to become effective in their life and career. We don’t need crores of coders. Let us face it, a good software engineer will go through four years Engineering course work on computer systems and related areas. In addition, a Master’s degree with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence or Data science can also be pursued. Of course, there are cases where non-engineering students too have fared exceedingly well in the Software Industry, but then those are exceptions. We have a great ability to identify a trend, exaggerate and create a mess. Remember how engineering colleges across the country piggybacked on the IT Industry wave? Jobs in the IT industry started picking up during the late nineties and we witnessed hundreds of engineering colleges mushrooming across the country. What is the result of this? We ended up creating lakhs of poor quality and unemployable Engineers. These students end up taking-up non-engineering jobs or would need some bridge courses (read 12 to 24 months) for them to make an effective career in the software Industry. It is no wonder that many colleges have already shut down during the past decade. Perhaps there is a lot to learn from the Engineering colleges example. With the current momentum to outsmart each other, hundreds of ed-tech companies will start claiming that they can create the best coders in the country. We may end up with lakhs or crores of “kid coders”. This is certainly not desirable. We must allow our next generation to gain a holistic perspective during their formative years. The new education system will provide the necessary exposure for software programming, but we should not mindlessly push children into it. The passionate ones will pick up skills and emerge as world-class coders.

18-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Gilded cage||While the recent coronavirus-induced lockdown caused hardship and difficulties to most of us, for me the lockdown paled in comparison to the containment I had to recently undergo. It was a Saturday morning when the news reached us that there was a Covid-19 positive case on the floor below ours. BBMP handled the situation very efficiently. They came over to our apartment building, sanitised the surrounding areas and then declared that the containment area would include the affected floor, the floor above and the floor below.  During the initial lockdown, you could at least go out to buy essentials. That meant some amount of fresh air and sunshine. However, during containment, three floors were barricaded with ropes and tapes and strict instructions were given – no movement outside one’s unit. Which basically meant that we were absolutely housebound. Okay, we thought, after we got over the initial shock, we can bear this for 14 days--can’t be too bad, can it? Then BBMP dropped the bombshell – the containment would be for 28 days! I had never imagined that staying at home could get so stressful! Home had always been a place of rest, a place to recover, a place to recharge one’s batteries. Now, with this enforced ‘imprisonment’, it became the opposite. It became a gilded cage and we, the residents, the birds in that enclosure. Thankfully, volunteers in our building ensured that we wanted for nothing. And of course, we had all the comforts of home – TV, internet etc. Waking up every morning to the fact that we were completely stuck in these four walls for the entire day, was enough to extinguish one’s mood. Absolutely no one was allowed to these quarantined apartments, which meant no visitors of any kind. This on top of the previous 60-day lockdown! The only ones permitted were the BBMP folks, who came to check on our status daily. Other than this, the only faces and the only people we saw for the next four weeks were the ones we had been incarcerated with – our immediate family. It is a wonder that we were not at each other’s throats! Thankfully, the ordeal did finally come to an end. When it did, I did not jump up in joy or rush out to meet friends or even walk out on the streets. All I did was heave a huge sigh of relief and wish fervently that I would never have to undergo such an ordeal again, gilded cage or no.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/gilded-cage-916935.html
18-11-2020||Second Edit||Bengaluru’s Bapujinagar fire a wake-up call||The massive fire that broke out a few days ago at a factory in Bengaluru’s thickly populated Bapujinagar where chemicals required for the manufacture of sanitisers were stocked once again draws attention to the callousness toward the storage, transport and disposal of hazardous material. That 20 units of fire tenders were required to douse the flames speaks of its intensity. Fortunately, the school nearby was closed due to Covid-19 and the damage was limited to a few neighbouring houses and vehicles. Had the incident occurred at night, the loss of life and property would have been colossal. Considering that over half-a-dozen serious fire accidents were reported from sanitiser factories across the country in the past few months, local authorities in Bengaluru should have acted proactively and shut down the Bapujinagar unit on their own. Instead, they even ignored repeated complaints over the years from residents. The factory was established over 40 years ago, when several such industrial units dotted Mysuru Road, off which Bapujinagar is situated. Over the years, the burgeoning city not only encroached into industrial areas which were on the outskirts but also into the green belt that once surrounded Bengaluru. While this unplanned growth, which continued over the decades, was ignored and often facilitated by the civic authorities and local politicians, many old industrial units have now come to be located within such residential areas. To make matters worse, authorities like Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Department of Factories either blindly renew the licences year after year or look the other way while many of these units function illegally. The government should initiate stringent action against negligent officers in this case and make an example out of them. The government should immediately identify hazardous units which are still operating in densely populated parts of Bengaluru and offer them incentives to relocate to designated areas on the city’s outskirts. Police Commissioner Kamal Pant has said that beat constables will be tasked with identifying such units, but the police are neither equipped to undertake such a task nor is it their responsibility. An appropriate agency must be given the task. With the demarcating line between residential, commercial and industrial areas fast disappearing, Bengaluru is becoming hazardous for its residents. What the city needs today are elected leaders and bureaucrats with foresight and vision. But this seems like a far cry, with self-aggrandisement taking precedence over the larger interests of the city. The warning bells have rung loud and clear, we can ignore them at our own peril.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/bengaluru-s-bapujinagar-fire-a-wake-up-call-916931.html

He was brought to the NCB office near Yelahanka for the interrogation on Tuesday evening, a senior officer said.  Officials will include charges against Bineesh after a detailed interrogation. Bineesh has been accused of staying regularly in contact with the alleged drug peddler Mohammed Anoop, in whose account officials found Rs 50 lakh unaccounted-for money.  In August, NCB officials had arrested Anoop in Bengaluru along with two others identified as Anika D and R Ravindran on charges of supplying drugs to film actors and celebrities. Officials said Anoop confessed during the interrogation that Bineesh was behind the transaction and he was Bineesh’s benami.  On October 17, ED officials arrested Anoop and he reportedly admitted his involvement in drug peddling and Bineesh had credited several transactions to his account. NCB officials said they were unable to say if Bineesh is a drug peddler or consumer at this stage of the investigation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ncb-to-grill-cpm-leader-s-son-for-3-days-in-drugs-case-916894.html

18-11-2020||South||IUML MLA Ebrahim Kunju arrested in Palarivattom flyover scam||V K Ebrahim Kunju, former public works minister of Kerala and Indian Union Muslim League MLA, was arrested by the Kerala Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Wednesday in connection with the alleged corruption in the construction of a flyover at Kochi that had to be reconstructed hardly three years after its commissioning due to poor quality. The arrest came as another major embarrassment for the Congress-led Opposition in Kerala as well as the IUML, which is a key coalition partner of Congress. IUML MLA of Manjeshwar, M C Kamaruddin, was recently arrested in connection with cheating over a hundred investors in his jewellery business. The Opposition is terming the moves as politically motivated aimed at diverting attention from the embarrassments being caused to the ruling Left Front because of the gold smuggling case as well as the arrest of CPM leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son Bineesh in connection with Bengaluru drug trafficking case, that too on the eve of the local body polls. The fresh moves assumed more political significance as Kerala is heading for local body polls next month and the Assembly election is hardly five months away. Ebrahim Kunju, who is an MLA representing Kalamassery in Kochi, was earlier arraigned as the fifth accused in the corruption case registered in connection with the flyover construction. He was earlier quizzed and his house raided. On Wednesday morning, a vigilance team reached Kunju's house in Kochi. But he got admitted to a private hospital in Kochi by Tuesday night, suspected to have done after getting information regarding the vigilance team's move. The vigilance team later went to the hospital and recorded his arrest, sources said. The flyover on National Highway 66 bypass at Palarivattom in Kochi was constructed at a cost for Rs 42 crore and commissioned in October 2016. But it had to be closed in May 2019  following safety concerns. Metro man E Sreedharan and experts from IIT Madras inspected the flyover and found cracks in 97 out of the 102 girders and 16 of the 18 pier caps. Hence it was proposed that it be demolished and reconstructed. The reconstruction cost was estimated at Rs 18.5 crore and the estimated time required was ten months. The reconstruction began in September. Former public works secretary T O Sooraj was earlier arrested in this connection.  The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala, an agency under the Kerala government, initiated the flyover project. Bengaluru-based Nagesh Consultants designed it and Delhi-based RDS Projects constructed it. Another Kerala government agency, KITCO, was the technical consultant. Officials of these agencies were also arraigned in the vigilance case. Meanwhile, Kunju is also under Enforcement Directorate's scanner in connection with allegations of depositing Rs10 crore illegally-earned money in the account of IUML's mouthpiece in Kerala. The ED had recently quizzed Kunju in this connection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/iuml-mla-ebrahim-kunju-arrested-in-palarivattom-flyover-scam-917072.html

All stakeholders from doctors to judges should be given special training in connection with the implementation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO), to ensure speedy justice to the child victims of sexual assault, the recent webinar, organised by the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR), said. The webinar was organised for the rights' panel officials, who deal with the POCSO cases in northern Kasaragod and Kannur. Kasaragod additional district judge and POCSO special judge R L Biju, who inaugurated the webinar, urged the child rights panel to take steps to impart necessary training in this regard. Training, as per the guidelines issued by the Kerala High Court recently, is inevitable to ensure punishment for the guilty and collective responsibility of various stakeholders, he said. The judge also said the change in the behaviour and attitude of assault survivors should also be taken into account while collecting evidence during the investigation of the case. Expert training is inevitable to record minute details, like the child victim's reluctance to communicate and his or her absence for weeks from school, and bring them as evidence before the court, he added. Panel chairman K V Manoj Kumar said the core objective of the KSCPCR was to bring in a social condition in which no child was molested in the state. The rights panel is implementing an ambitious drive titled "child-friendly Kerala", to create awareness about this among children and parents, he noted adding that special training would be imparted to all stakeholders in this regard as part of the project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-child-rights-panel-stresses-on-training-for-stakeholders-in-pocso-cases-917092.html

Sasikala, a close friend of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, is serving her four-year imprisonment in a disproportionate assets (DA) case and her jail term ends in February 2021. However, Sasikala's legal team has been pushing for her early release contending that she is entitled for ordinary remission by persuading the jail authorities to count all her non-availed leaves. The prison administration had also told an RTI applicant in September that Sasikala can walk out of the prison on January 27, 2021 if she pays the fine of Rs 10 crore. “We will get a clear picture of whether the court has accepted the fine by the evening. Once the court issues the order, we will move for remission of sentence,” a source from Sasikala camp said. Her legal team, led by senior counsel Raja Senthoor Pandian, took the first step towards securing her release from jail by depositing Rs 10 crore on Wednesday. Four demand drafts with the value of Rs 10.01 crore were submitted to the court on Wednesday afternoon. While Pazhanivelu, brother of Sasikala's late husband M Natarajan, paid Rs 3.25 crore, his wife Vasantha Devi submitted a DD with a value of Rs 3.75 crore. Another DD with a value of Rs 3 crore was drawn by Hema, wife of Sasikala's nephew Dr S Venkatesh. Vivek Jayaraman, son of Sasikala's sister-in-law Ilavarasi who is also serving her jail term in the DA case, paid Rs 10,000. Pazhanivelu is a retired police officer and Venkatesh is a radiologist who was close to Jayalalithaa before he was expelled from the party by her. Pandian has been maintaining that Sasikala is entitled to ordinary remission and that if she does not get ordinary remission, this will be the first time that someone has not been given that right. Sasikala surrendered before the jail authorities on February 15, 2017 after her conviction in the disproportionate assets (DA) case was confirmed by the Supreme Court. Jayalalithaa was also an accused in the case, but her conviction was set off as she died two months before the judgement. Sasikala’s release from the jail could be a major political event in Tamil Nadu as her physical presence in the state might alter political equations, especially, when the state stares at assembly elections in the first half of 2021. Sasikala, who was elected as AIADMK legislature party leader, could not be sworn in as Chief Minister after incumbent and party colleague O Panneerselvam rebelled against her. Before she went to jail, Sasikala got Edappadi K Palaniswami elected as the leader of the AIADMK and he eventually became the Chief Minister. However, Edappadi and his colleagues sacked Sasikala's nephew, T T V Dhinakaran, from the party and welcomed Panneerselvam back into their fold. Sasikala still remains a primary member of the AIADMK. But, the AIADMK says she is not a member citing the 'new constitution'. Palaniswami and Panneerselvam now run the AIADMK jointly and the party has been maintaining that Sasikala’s release will not impact them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sasikalas-family-initiate-her-release-by-depositing-rs-10-crore-fine-917150.html

Filmmaker Sanal Kumar Sasidharan approached the court raising suspicion over the death of his father's niece Sandhya, 40, in Thiruvananthapuram. While the postmortem examination indicated that Covid-19 could be the reason for the death, Sasidharan alleged that she was a victim of an illegal organ trade. Sasidharan approached the court alleging that Sandhya was subjected to organ trade in violation of Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act and sought a CBI probe. Owing to the objections raised by him, Sandhya's body was also not cremated even as she died on November 7. The court directed Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital superintendent to conduct a re-postmortem and the procedures should be videographed. The court will hear the case again next week. Sasidharan's allegation assumed significance as a preliminary probe by police into organ transplantation in the state found that illegal organ trade was thriving in the state with the involvement of middlemen and private hospitals. The Crime Branch also launched a detailed probe into it. Meanwhile, the private hospital in Kochi where Sandhya had earlier undergone liver transplantation had denied allegations of illegal trade. Sasidharan alleged that Sandhya sold her liver for Rs 10 lakh for a patient at the hospital in 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-hc-orders-re-postmortem-in-filmmaker-sanals-cousin-death-case-917203.html
18-11-2020||South||Kerala former minister held in flyover corruption case||Kerala former public works minister and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA V K Ebrahim Kunju was arrested by the Kerala Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Wednesday in connection with the alleged corruption in the construction of a fly-over at Kochi that had to be reconstructed hardly three years after its commissioning due to poor quality. The arrest came as another major embarrassment for the Congress-led opposition in Kerala comprising the IUML. MLA of Manjeshwar, M C Kamaruddin from IUML, was recently arrested on charges of cheating over a hundred investors of his jewellery business. The fresh moves assumed more political significance as Kerala is heading for local body polls next month and Assembly election in hardly five months away. Congress and IUML leaders said the move was politically motivated and aimed at diverting attention from the ruling Left Front mired in controversies due to the gold smuggling case and the arrest of CPM leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with Bengaluru drug trafficking case. The opposition charged the state government with misusing investigation agencies. Ebrahim Kunju, an MLA from Kalamassery in Kochi, was listed as the fifth accused in the corruption case registered in connection with the flyover construction. He was earlier quizzed and his house raided earlier. On Wednesday morning a vigilance team reached Kunju's house in Kochi. But he got admitted to a private hospital in Kochi by Tuesday evening. The vigilance team later went to the hospital and recorded his arrest. A vigilance special court judge remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. But he would continue to be in the hospital. The fly-over on NH-66 at Palarivattom in Kochi was built at a cost for Rs 42 crore and commissioned in October 2016. It had to be closed in May 2019 following safety concerns. Metro man E Sreedharan and experts from IIT Madras inspected the fly-over and found cracks in 97 out of the 102 girders and 16 of the 18 pier caps, and suggested demolishing and reconstructing it. The reconstruction that began in September was estimated at Rs 18.5 crore and the estimated time required was ten months. Former public works secretary T O Sooraj was earlier arrested in this connection. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala, an agency under the Kerala government, initiated the fly-over project. Bengaluru-based Nagesh Consultants designed it and Delhi-based RDS Projects constructed it. Another Kerala government agency KITCO was the technical consultant. Officials of these agencies were also charged in the case. Meanwhile, Kunju is under Enforcement Directorate's scanner in connection with allegations of depositing Rs 10 crore in the account of IUML's mouthpiece in Kerala. The ED had recently quizzed Kunju in this connection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-former-minister-held-in-flyover-corruption-case-917225.html
18-11-2020||South||AIADMK convenes meeting to draw strategy, discuss alliance for 2021 Tamil Nadu polls||Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK has convened a meeting of its zonal in-charges, ministers and district secretaries on November 20 to fine-tune the party's strategy for the Assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. The meeting might also adopt a resolution authorising coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami to decide on the alliance for the crucial elections. The meeting assumes significance as it comes on the eve of Union Home Minister and BJP's master-strategist Amit Shah's visit to Chennai to participate in government events and meet party leaders. Though no agenda has been made public, insiders told DH that the meeting is likely to discuss the alliance question and the impact of the release of former interim general secretary V K Sasikala from a Bengaluru jail possibly by January-end. A senior leader told DH that the meeting may turn to be more significant than expected. “What I infer is that the Friday's meeting may pass a resolution authorising Panneerselvam and Palaniswami to decide on the alliance question. And one should not miss the timing of the meeting. It comes a day before Amit Shah lands in Chennai,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. He also added that the BJP may not want to wait till the last minute to firm up alliances this time around as the saffron party has made Tamil Nadu polls a prestige issue. “Though there may be rumblings within the party on aligning with BJP, the leaders have little choice. The BJP wants the alliance to continue and in all probability, the AIADMK-BJP alliance will continue. Amit Shah's visit will make things more clear,” another senior leader said.      Shah, who will reach Chennai on Saturday afternoon and leave Sunday morning, is likely to meet Palaniswami and Panneerselvam during which they are likely to discuss the 2021 Assembly polls. The state unit of BJP has also planned to get leaders of alliance partners to meet Shah during his Chennai visit. AIADMK entered into a formal electoral alliance with the BJP in 2019 after a gap of 15 years and both parties are likely to continue with their tie-up for the 2021 Assembly elections. At the meeting on Friday, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, who patched up recently after a tug of war on the chief ministerial nominee, will also introduce the newly-appointed zonal coordinators to district secretaries and seeking their cooperation. For the AIADMK, which has had a roller-coaster ride ever since its leader J Jayalalithaa died in 2016, the Assembly elections in 2021 is the most crucial in recent years. Facing 10 years of anti-incumbency, the party is making every effort to put up a tough fight against a resurgent DMK, whose alliance swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and has divided the states, for its convenience, into zones for better coordination. Insiders said Friday's meeting will also serve as an opportunity for zonal coordinators and district secretaries to introduce each other. “In some places, there have been noises regarding the new appointments. The party top brass will send out a clear message against factionalism within the AIADMK and ask everyone to work for the party's victory,” another senior leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-convenes-meeting-to-draw-strategy-discuss-alliance-for-2021-tamil-nadu-polls-917237.html
18-11-2020||South||Now, Andhra CM Jaganmohan Reddy says no to local body polls||The Jaganmohan Reddy government has expressed its opposition to holding the Panchayat polls in the state during the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, State Election Commissioner (SEC) Ramesh Kumar had announced that “encouraged by the success of Covid-19 containment measures in Andhra Pradesh and elections successfully held in several parts of the country” a decision was taken to hold Gram Panchayat elections tentatively in February. In response, Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney cited “the high number of active cases and spread to rural areas … a matter of grave concern,” while asking the SEC to re-examine the plans. “A comparison amongst states may not present a correct picture. We may not let down our guard particularly as the Central government has warned states to be wary of winter months. We cannot afford to have another surge having already lost 6,890 human lives,” Sawhney wrote to the SEC on Tuesday. The stand is in the reversal of the situation in March when Chief Minister Reddy wanted polls but Kumar suspended them referring to the rising number of cases. The decision then led to the removal of Kumar, a retired IAS officer, from the SEC post in April by the Reddy government. The chief minister had even accused the SEC of functioning unilaterally and in a partisan manner, favouring the Opposition TDP. After a bitter legal confrontation, which even reached the Supreme Court, Kumar was reinstated in July on the directions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Last month, Kumar held consultations on the polls with various parties, in which the ruling YSRCP refused to participate. Reddy, it is believed, wants to wait till April by when Kumar's term as the SEC ends. Sawhney, in her letter, said the government would inform the SEC on its preparedness in resuming the adjourned elections “as and when the situation becomes conducive”. While Kumar wanted to hold a video conference with officials regarding the polls on Wednesday, Sawhney deemed it unnecessary. Kumar said “holding elections is not only a Constitutional obligation” but a prerequisite for the release of funds under the finance commission mandate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/now-andhra-cm-jaganmohan-reddy-says-no-to-local-body-polls-917247.html
18-11-2020||South||BJP lacks guts to fight China, says Telangana CM; plans conclave of Oppn parties||Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao announced a nationwide agitation, in association with like-minded parties, “against the anti-people, anti-farmer and anti-worker policies” of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. KCR said that the BJP government lacks the guts to fight China. “But they indulge in spectacular propaganda claiming high achievements. They create hype with attractive slogans like 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao', but do nothing actually. BJP is like an empty vessel that makes a loud noise.” “The nation's GDP rate fell to record depths. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are in a better position than us. If the Modi government continues, even Nepal’s GDP will surpass us." He added that China, with a lesser GDP rate than India in the 80s, is now the second-biggest economy in the world. "But our country is regressing due to the wrong policies, inept handling of the economy by the central government,” KCR said, continuing his tirade against the BJP and Modi. KCR also revealed a plan to hold a conclave of the prominent Opposition parties’ leaders of the country in Hyderabad, in the second week of December. The TRS supremo's statement comes days ahead of the Hyderabad local body polls, where the BJP is seen as the ruling party's principal rival. Rao had announced plans of such conclave in January too, to bring together the non-BJP chief ministers opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act, in Hyderabad, to discuss their plan of action. No such convention took place till now. CM's idea of a 'federal-front' ahead of the 2019 general elections had received a lukewarm response from other political parties. On Wednesday, addressing his party men in preparation of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls scheduled on 1 December, Rao said the Modi government did precious little in the past six and half years. “On the contrary, its wrong policies and false propaganda have pushed the country into regression. Since the Congress is pursuing action less politics, the responsibility to stand up and fight against the anti-people BJP policies rests with the other political parties,” KCR, as he is popularly known, said. KCR alleged that the BJP led NDA government was willfully weakening the PSUs established by the first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, “and withdrawing investments to hand them over to the corporate companies.” “Modi, who claims to have sold tea on railway platforms in his childhood, is selling the railways now,” KCR said launching a direct attack on Modi. TRS party chief expressed his party’s resolve “to oppose and stand up to the anti-people policies of the central government.” “TRS is trying to get all the opposition parties of the country under one roof. In this regard, I spoke with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Kerala CM P Vijayan, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, DMK Chief MK Stalin, and the UP, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka former chief ministers Akhilesh Yadav, Shard Pawar, Prakash Singh Badal, HD Kumaraswamy, and the Left leaders. We have decided to work unitedly to fight against the BJP policies.” The TRS president accused Modi as having done nothing for the welfare of the farmers, Dalits, tribals, and other sections. “During the elections, they evoke public sentiments by referring to Pakistan, Pulwama, Kashmir to seek political mileage. They try to divide people on the religious lines. They try to instigate communal clashes and get political benefit out of it.” A conclave with all these leaders would be held in the second week of December in Hyderabad, to discuss the movement to be launched across the country, standing by the farmers, workers and other sections who are becoming victims of the BJP's wrong policies, KCR said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-lacks-guts-to-fight-china-says-telangana-cm-plans-conclave-of-oppn-parties-917267.html

Forest and police officials are investigating and inquiring people from nearby villages. "The monkeys are suspected to have been poisoned to death. As of now who has done this act is not clear.

18-11-2020||State||Vijayanagar to be Karnataka's 31st district||Karnataka is all set to get its 31st district as the Cabinet on Wednesday gave ‘in principle’ approval to carve out a new Vijayanagar district from Ballari.  The decision was taken during an informal discussion on the subject, Law Minister J C Madhuswamy said.  Forest Minister Anand Singh, who is also the minister in charge of Ballari, called it a “historic decision” and thanked Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. “This demand was there for many years. Hampi was the capital of the Hindu empire and we want to upgrade it into a prestigious place,” Singh, who anchored the effort for the new Vijayanagar district, said.  “We don't want to hurt anyone. We want to do this by taking everyone into confidence,” he added.  The plan for a new Vijayanagar district was first officially mooted by Yediyurappa himself in September 2019 when Singh was a disqualified legislator. Singh had resigned from the Congress when the Congress-JD(S) coalition was in power, citing his demand for a new district fell on deaf ears. He went on to join the BJP.  After the plan created a rift, with some BJP legislators threatening to raise a banner of revolt if Ballari was split, Yediyurappa deferred a decision on this.  The mining district of Ballari is politically significant, comprising nine Assembly constituencies of which the Congress represents five and the BJP four.  Ballari has 11 taluks and splitting it will ease administration, it is argued. According to the earlier plan, five taluks - Ballari, Kurugodu, Siraguppa, Sandur and Kudligi - will be part of Ballari district, while six other taluks - Hospet, Kampli, Hagaribommanahalli, Kottur, Hadagali and Harapanahalli - will constitute the new Vijayanagar district.  “We will share the final details after the next Cabinet meeting,” Madhuswamy said.  Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu, a native of Ballari, had opposed the plan to create a new district. After the Cabinet meeting, however, he appeared to have come on board. “There was confusion about this. It’s a long-pending demand. We’ve decided informally thanks to all our efforts. The CM and the government will take the final decision,” he said.   Yadgir was the last district created in Karnataka when it was carved out of Kalaburagi in 2009.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/vijayanagar-to-be-karnatakas-31st-district-917062.html

18-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka govt struggles to update land records||Karnataka, a pioneer in digitising land records, is having trouble updating the records of rights, tenancy and crops (RTC), a key land ownership document.  The RTC, also known as Pahani, contains information such as owners’ details, area, soil type, nature of possession of land, encumbrance and so on. Updating or making corrections in the document is critical to ascertain ownership of land, given that the RTCs are presumptive in nature.   But government data shows that 1.25 lakh applications to update RTCs are pending for the last three years, which is odd considering the strides the state made in digitising land records through its flagship Bhoomi software over the last two decades.  Authorities say the pendency is largely due to mutation, or transfer, in the ownership of property over and beyond its original size. For example, an RTC has one column showing the total extent, boundaries and classification of the property (akarband). Another column shows the mutation. If the mutated land is bigger than the akarband, revenue authorities are required to follow a cumbersome process to nix the mismatch, which involves issuing notices and so on.  “Tahsildars are required to identify such cases and also examine applications (for correction in RTC) that are received through revenue adalats, and escalate them to assistant commissioners for disposal,” an official explained.  Bidar has the highest number of applications seeking corrections in RTC (26,200) followed by Chamarajanagar (10,825). Bengaluru Urban has over 9,600 applications pending.  “I don’t know why the government isn’t taking this seriously,” former revenue minister RV Deshpande said. When he was in office, Deshpande kick-started a pilot project to make land ownership dispute-free. “RTCs have a presumptive title. So, if the records aren’t perfect, it leads to problems. The project we started couldn’t reach the desired goal,” he said.  According to Principal Secretary (Revenue) M Maheshwar Rao, the government will soon issue orders asking officials to take up a drive across districts. “We have found that in the case of death, heirs to a property have not been recorded in the RTCs,” Rao said.  Asked if the RTC correction process can be taken online, Rao said he would review it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-struggles-to-update-land-records-916893.html

Yediyurappa, who arrived in the national capital to discuss the expansion of his Cabinet with top BJP leadership, warned of action if the bandh is called. "We have set up the Authority for the welfare of Maratha communities living in the state. A large number of people among them are poor and the Authority will focus on their welfare, " the chief minister told reporters here. "The Authority is nothing to do with Maratha language," he said adding that "We will take strict action if the forced bandh is called." The government''s decision to set up the Maratha Development Authority comes ahead of the announcement of by-election to Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, as well as Basavakalyan and Maski Assembly constituencies, which have a sizeable Marathi-speaking population. Yediyurappa also lashed out at Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar for "unnecessarily stoking" the border dispute between the two states. He said the Mahajan Commission's decision is final. Pawar had on Tuesday said Maharashtra's all-round growth and including Belgaum (Belagavi), Karwar and Nipani into the state were dreams of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray.

18-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Cabinet forms panel on SC/ST quota hike||Treading carefully, the Karnataka Cabinet on Wednesday decided to constitute a sub-committee to examine how reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be increased in the state.  The SCs want their quota increased from 15 per cent to 17 per cent whereas, STs have asked for a jump from 3 per cent to 7 per cent. The Cabinet authorised Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa to constitute the sub-committee.  “The SC/ST reservation quota was fixed many years ago. Now, with the population having gone up, there is pressure to revise it. The Cabinet sub-committee will go into details, such as, which categories should get how much enhancement in reservation,” Law Minister JC Madhuswamy said, briefing media. “The sub-committee will give its recommendations to the government soon," he added. The sub-committee is expected to take stock of the report, submitted by the Justice Nagmohan Das Commission that was set up by the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition. The Commission, which submitted a 277-page report in July, is said to have favoured the hike in quota.  Social Welfare Minister B Sriramulu, who belongs to the Valmiki (ST) community and is batting for a quota hike, said the government had already reviewed the pros and cons of the Justice Nagmohan Das Commission report. According to sources, the Commission, which received about 850 written representations from the public on hiking the quota, took note of the fact that despite existing reservation, a significant section of these communities do not have access to even primary education. The report also deals with issues pertaining to internal reservation, creamy layer, reservation in promotion and quota in the private sector.  The increase in reservation has been a political hot potato for successive governments. During the Congress-JD(S) coalition regime, some Congress leaders feared that the SC, ST communities were deserting them and pushed for a hike in quota.  If the state government were to increase the reservation now, it would exceed the ceiling limit of 50 per cent reservation set by the Supreme Court. However, such a move will not be unprecedented as states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have already exceeded the cap. At present, Karnataka provides 15 per cent reservation for SCs, 3 per cent for STs and 32 per cent for the other backward classes (OBC), adding up to 50 per cent. This covers 101 scheduled castes, 50 scheduled tribes and 207 OBCs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cabinet-forms-panel-on-sc/st-quota-hike-917202.html

The accident took place at Waghodia circle near the city around 2.45 am when the victims were heading towards Pavagadh in Panchmahal district, Vadodara Deputy Commissioner of Police Karanraj Vaghela said. Eleven people, including five women, succumbed to their injuries, while 16 others are undergoing treatment at the government-run SSG Hospital in the city, the medical facility said in a statement. "The deceased included 10 passengers and a co-driver of the vehicle," Vaghela said. "The mini-truck driver, who is under treatment, lost control over the wheels as he dozed off when the vehicle was passing from Waghodia circle on the Surat-Vadodara highway," he said. As a result, the vehicle rammed into another truck from behind, Vaghela said, adding that no FIR has been lodged yet.

This is the third time Mumbai police have asked the actor to appear before the Bandra police in the matter. Kangana had earlier informed the police that she was busy with a wedding in the family and will be available only after November 15. Mumbai police had issued the second notice to Kangana Ranaut and Rangoli Chandel on November 3 and ordered them to appear before it on November 10. Both the sisters have been booked for allegedly promoting enmity between communities through their remarks on social media. Earlier, the Bandra police on October 21 issued a notice to Kangana and her sister to record their statements in the case. However, Ranaut's lawyer had then sent a reply to the police station, saying she was in Himachal Pradesh and busy with the wedding preparations. Last month, the Bandra metropolitan magistrate's court had ordered the police to investigate a complaint filed by Bollywood casting director and fitness trainer Munawwar Ali Sayyed, referring to tweets and other statements of Ranaut and her sister. The Bandra police subsequently registered an FIR against Ranaut and her sister under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, etc), 295-A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition), 34 (common intention) and also asked Kangana and her sister to appear before the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kangana-ranaut-sister-summoned-by-mumbai-police-for-the-third-time-917059.html

The total transaction was valued at Rs 3,32,617 according to Bhoi’s complaint before the subdivisional magistrate of Pansemal tehsil. The produce was picked up and a token payment of Rs 25,000 was made with a promise that the rest will be paid within 15 days.   However, after a delay of four months, Bhoi approached the authorities. “A clerk I know in the local market alerted me to this provision in the new laws brought by the government,” he told the publication.  According to a new provision in the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act passed in September, this year, buyers are compelled to pay cultivators within three days of the transaction.  Following Bhoi’s complaint, authorities traced the traders and summoned them on October 6 where they faced prospects of the arrest.  “After studying the case, listening to the farmer, and going through documents, it has been ordered by me that the buyers must make immediate payments owed to the farmer,” the magistrate’s closure report said. Following this, the traders were forced to renegotiate the total pending amount to slightly less than initially agreed and pay the amount in two instalments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/farmer-sues-two-traders-for-delay-in-payment-under-new-farm-laws-recovers-dues-report-917082.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also wondered how long Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will hold ground under the "burden of favour" and if he will take a new route. In the recently concluded Bihar polls, the BJP bagged 74 seats, while its ally JD(U) won 43. The RJD emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats in the 243-member Assembly. After the Assembly polls in Maharashtra last year, the BJP won 105 seats, while its then ally Shiv Sena bagged 56. The two parties, however, parted ways following differences over sharing the chief ministerial post. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena later joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form government in Maharashtra. "The Shiv Sena was not given the chief ministers post in Maharashtra after BJP got more seats. But gave the crown of chief ministers post to the party which was relegated to third position in Bihar. What generosity! "There will be shortage of ink to describe this sacrifice in politics," the 'Saamana' editorial said. It said BJP leaders like Chandrakant Patil and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari are of the view that the state is being run by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. "All these (leaders) should keep an eye on who exactly will run Nitish Kumars government in Bihar now on," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/shiv-sena-taunts-bjp-over-sacrifice-of-giving-cms-post-to-jdu-917114.html
18-11-2020||West||Goa Archbishop asks people to tone down Christmas celebrations||Goa is likely to be bereft of its glitzy Christmas fervour this year, thanks to Covid-19 pandemic. Goa Archbishop Fr Filipe Neri Ferrao on Wednesday issued a circular to all churches and Catholic organisations in the state to tone-down Christmas celebrations in Goa, and make a conscious bid to contribute generously to the poor and downtrodden, who have had to face the worst on account of the pandemic. “This year, however, such a (community) celebration will not be possible, due to the unprecedented situation in which we all are, because of the pandemic. In fact, the situation calls to do things just the opposite way, by avoiding occasions for the physical convergence of many,” the circular said. “Avoid too many lights and decorations; the money could, instead, be channelled towards the needy. Think of moving from external illumination to lighting the lives of people! Small sacrifices to be made in the family. Savings (in cash or kind) to be given to the poor and the underprivileged in the parish,” Fr Ferrao said. Attending Christmas and New Year celebrations, including formal balls, music performances, parties etc, in the state are a popular affair for locals as well as visiting tourists. The festival season also accounts for the most amount of tourist traffic to the state, which is well known as a destination for beach and nightlife tourism. Calling the scenario triggered by the pandemic as an unprecedented one, Ferrao also said: "the situation calls to do things just the opposite way, by avoiding occasions for the physical convergence of many". “It is my earnest wish that the restrictions imposed by the ongoing pandemic may help us to focus on what is essential, indeed necessary, for us to celebrate the Feast of our God in a way most befitting to Him, that is, by turning our attention to the other, reaching out to others in our own families, neighbourhood groups and parishes,” the circular states. While the Central government's latest SOPs allow for the opening of religious places throughout the country, places of religious worship in Goa, across communities, have refrained from throwing their doors fully open to devotees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-archbishop-asks-people-to-tone-down-christmas-celebrations-917220.html

Without naming the Shiv Sena which has been controlling the cash-rich civic body for more than 30 years, Fadnavis said that the "lives of some people" are stuck in the BMC and added they need to be thrown out of power in the interest of the residents of the metropolis. Addressing BJPs Mumbai unit leaders and functionaries here, the former Maharashtra chief minister also targeted the state's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, led by the Shiv Sena, on a range of issues and labelled it as anti-development. "The life of a king was in a parrot. In fact, a monster's life was in a parrot. But I won't say monster," he said. "So, the life of a king was in a parrot. And some people's lives are stuck in the BMC...in 2022, we have to dislodge them from power in the BMC which is a den of corruption," Fadnavis said in a veiled attack on the BJP's former ally. Without naming anyone or any party, the BJP leader said he thought something good would happen after the MVA government, which has the Congress and the NCP as partners, was formed last year but the power went to their head. This arrogance needs to be dealt with for the people. We will need to bring in power those who are concerned about the people, he added. Saffron flag will need to be hoisted on the BMC again, but of the BJP, whose ideology is not adulterated, Fadnavis said in a further attack on the Shiv Sena. The BJP has been accusing the Shiv Sena of "diverting" from Hindutva after it joined hands with the ideologically- different NCP and the Congress to form the MVA government. He said those the Shiv Sena is sharing power with felt ashamed of tweeting about Bal Thackeray, founder of the saffron party, on the occasion of the latter's death anniversary on Tuesday. Fadnavis did not name the party, which he alleged, felt ashamed of tweeting about Bal Thackeray. This is surprising, he added. Fadnavis also referred to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut's comments made on Tuesday that the Uddhav Thackeray-led outfit does not need a certificate on Hindutva from any other party. Sanjay Raut ji you only talk about it. But Hindutva cannot be seen in your (Shiv Senas) action...Hindutva should be seen in actions, the former CM said. Attacking the MVA government, Fadnavis said it cannot suppress the BJPs voice using police force and asked, What late Indira Gandhi ji could not do, will you be able to do it? Among others, Fadnavis attacked the three-party ruling coalition over issues like its handling of COVID-19, metro car shed project, inflated electricity bills and alleged throttling of freedom of expression in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bjp-leader-devendra-fadnavis-targets-shiv-sena-says-some-peoples-lives-stuck-in-bmc-917256.html

Union Environment and Forests Minister Prakash Javadekar and Water Resources Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were also present at the meeting, Shekhawat said. He said issues were discussed as per the 2017 Supreme Court guideline. The discussions included the impact of accelerated filling of the Sardar Sarovar reservoir, whether there is an adverse impact due to its filing and the land submerged due to its backwaters. Shekhawat said resolutions were passed in the meeting and the Supreme Court will be apprised about it. Asserting that there was no adverse impact due to filing of the reservoir, he said a study on land submerged due to the backwaters said less land has been submerged due to it than what was originally estimated. The Narmada Control Authority has the Union Jal Shakti minister, Union Environment and Forests minister and chief ministers of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as its members. The NCA meeting was supposed to take place earlier this year but was postponed due to the pandemic and it was decided that virtual deliberations would be held.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-gujarat-cms-attend-meeting-of-narmada-control-authority-held-by-jal-shakti-minister-917290.html
