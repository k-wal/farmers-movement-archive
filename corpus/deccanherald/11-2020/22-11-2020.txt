22-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Uncertainty in JDS over fielding candidates for Maski, Basava Kalyan Assembly bypolls||The Janata Dal (Secular) is unlikely to field candidates for Maski and Basava Kalyan Assembly bypolls. Fielding of candidates is futile, said party leader and former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy. "Looking at the outcome of the recent by-elections (at RR Nagar and Sira assembly segments), it appears futile to field candidates," Kumaraswamy told reporters after inaugurating the party's ward office at Dasarahalli here on Sunday. He was replying to queries on the party's view on contesting the Maski and Basava Kalyan byelections due soon. On the reason for not fielding the candidate, Kumaraswamy said the way BJP has conducted itself in the recent byelections, it appears difficult for the JD(S) to face the bypolls. "In Basava Kalyan, our candidate got elected in the past. Our party had a good base there but the existing system demonstrated by the BJP in the recent byelections makes it difficult for us to face the bypolls," he said. He said the party should focus on strengthening its base for the general elections instead of contesting bypolls. He, however, said JD (S) would decide its future course of action by paying heed to the sentiments of the party workers in Maski and Basava Kalyan. In the recent bypolls at RR Nagar in Bengaluru Urban district and at Sira in Tumakuru district, the JD(S) was a distant third while the fight remained between the BJP and the Congress.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/uncertainty-in-jds-over-fielding-candidates-for-maski-basava-kalyan-assembly-bypolls-918762.html

The former minister claimed the BJP was trying to trap him through the Central Bureau of Investigation. "The CBI is working at the behest of the BJP. Let them do whatever they want but I am working to strengthen the party," Shivakumar told reporters here on the sidelines of a bike rally organised by the Congress workers. Shivakumar was issued summons asking him to appear before the CBI on Monday. However, citing party related activities, he requested that he be allowed to appear on November 25, for which the CBI officials have agreed. The CBI on October 5 had conducted searches at 14 locations, including in Karnataka, Delhi and Mumbai at premises linked to Shivakumar and others. The agency had said the searches have led to recovery of Rs 57 lakh cash and several incriminating documents, including property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk etc, and that the investigation was continuing. It had also registered a case against Shivakumar and his family members for alleged possession of disproportionate assets worth Rs 74.93 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cbi-working-at-bjps-behest-alleges-karnataka-congress-chief-d-k-shivakumar-918766.html

Speaking at the third Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)-India Conference, Shringla said since its establishment, the PCA has handled many politically significant and interesting cases. It has become a premier institution and the first choice for resolution of international disputes involving states, state entities, inter-governmental organisations as well as private entities, he said. "As a member of the international community, India has remained steadfast in ensuring the rule of law, and has had a long history of utilising arbitration and other such methods for amicable settlement of international disputes," Shringla said. He said institutions such as the Permanent Court of Arbitration have assisted us in this respect, and have played a pivotal role in ensuring that peace among nations is maintained, through a civilised and principled settlement of disputes. As a strong proponent of a peaceful and rules-based international legal order, it is no surprise that India supports the PCA and its mandate to resolve international disputes, Shringla said.

22-11-2020||National||M K Alagiri: The perennial rebel within the DMK's first family||There was a time when the supporters of M K Alagiri celebrated his birthday in the temple town of Madurai, like it was a mini-festival. Today, the 69-year-old elder son of the late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi is a lonely man, mostly confined to his bungalow in the city’s TVS Nagar. After six years of political hibernation, following his expulsion from the DMK in 2014, there is no clarity about what he means when he speaks of his “future plans”. He had to fervently appeal to his younger brother M K Stalin, whom he had opposed much of his political life, to take him back into the party fold. Stalin, now the DMK chief, continues to cold-shoulder him, a factor that could be responsible for recent hints about starting a party on his own or "supporting another one" (presumably the BJP) in the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls due in the first half of 2021. But whatever may be said about Alagiri’s political functioning, the timing of his recent moves has succeeded in attracting interest towards the DMK’s former southern general. He rose in the party, thanks to Karunanidhi’s decision to depute him to Madurai in 1980, ostensibly to manage Murasoli, the DMK party newspaper from there. He eventually made the city his base. Interestingly, the sibling rivalry between Alagiri and Stalin also dates back to this period. During his years managing the DMK in southern TN, Alagiri came to be known as ‘Anja Nenjan’ (braveheart) by his supporters. Without any formal post, Alagiri became the DMK's most influential person in southern Tamil Nadu, comprising nine districts. He was instrumental in keeping the DMK flock together after Vaiko quit the party in 1993. He wielded tremendous clout when the party was in power. However, poor temperament and his 'my way or the highway' attitude did him in, critics say. He was suspended from the DMK twice. During his first suspension, he ensured the defeat of DMK candidates close to Stalin in the 2001 Assembly elections. Alagiri’s animosity towards Stalin alienated him from Karunanidhi, who meticulously groomed his younger son as his political heir. Alagiri resented the importance given to Stalin and his immediate family and picked up fights with his father often. In the final reckoning, perhaps it was his image as an unruly strongman that proved to be his stumbling block. Much of the clout that Alagiri enjoyed was due to the arm-twisting tactics of his coterie, some of whom are accused of murder. Although he was a deft organiser and had his ears to the ground, he was never a mass leader. He is said to be behind ‘out-of-the-box’ ideas, such as the infamous 'Thirumangalam Formula' of doling out cash in return for votes, that the DMK is yet to live down. His leadership credentials suffered because he could never take criticism or opposition from his own people. He was accused of playing a role in the murder of DMK veteran Ta. Kiruttinan, who did not toe his line, but later he was acquitted of all charges. Then there is the instance of his supporters burning the office of Tamil daily Dhinakaran run by Maran brothers. The newspaper's ‘crime’ was that it carried a survey saying only two per cent respondents favoured the possibility of Alagiri succeeding his father Karunanidhi, while the majority vote went to Stalin, two years younger to him. Stalin eventually won over all of Alagiri’s loyalists—for he came to control the DMK with the backing of his father. Alagiri maintained a low profile till Karunanidhi's death in 2018. His efforts to raise a rebellion after his father's demise too petered out. Despite his recent attempts to draw attention to himself, any move against Stalin, whom the DMK feels is well-positioned to be the next CM, will only lead to Alagiri permanently burning the bridges with the family. By launching his own political party or extending support to BJP as is being speculated, he could at best only end up embarrassing Stalin, given his lack of support inside and outside the party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/m-k-alagiri-the-perennial-rebel-within-the-dmks-first-family-918340.html

The world's largest economy currently has 12,019,960 cases and 255,414 deaths, both by far the worst global tolls. The new toll comes just six days after the US crossed the 1.1 crore case threshold. Cases have been surging in the US at an alarming rate, forcing many cities to re-impose punishing lockdown measures. Health authorities have urged people to stay home for next week's Thanksgiving holiday when Americans usually travel from coast to coast to be with their families. New York City has shut down schools for its 11 lakh students, while California began imposing a 10:00 pm to 5:00 am curfew from Saturday. Chicago -- the third-largest US city -- has been under stay-at-home orders since Monday. On Friday, President Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, announced he had tested positive for Covid-19 and is quarantining. His positive test follows infections for a string of others connected to the White House, including his father, who was hospitalised, the president's wife Melania and Trump's youngest son Barron. President Trump's administration has been heavily criticised for its response to the pandemic and for downplaying the dangers. On Monday, President-elect Joe Biden expressed frustration over Trump's refusal to cooperate on the White House transition process, saying "more people may die" of coronavirus without immediate coordination on fighting the pandemic. There is, however, a new sign of hope: US biotech giant Pfizer and German partner BioNTech announced Friday they will seek approval to roll out their coronavirus vaccine early.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-surpasses-12-crore-coronavirus-cases-918510.html

The two countries had signed a preferential trade agreement (PTA) on March 8, 2006, and it came into force from August 2007. In 2016, they expanded the scope of the agreement by including more products. Currently, about 2,000 goods are covered under the pact. In a PTA, two trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate import duties on certain goods traded between them. "The talks for the second expansion of the agreement are in the final stages. About 400 more goods would be covered under the pact," the official said. Goods like lithium and copper ores could come under the ambit of the pact among other key items, the official added. Among Latin American countries, Chile is one of the largest trading partners of India. India's bilateral trade with Chile stood at USD 2.22 billion in 2018-19. India's exports to Chile include transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, yarn of polyester fibres, tyres and tubes, manufacture of metals, articles of apparel, organic/inorganic and agrochemicals, textiles, readymade garments, plastic goods, leather products, engineering goods, imitation jewellery, sports goods and handicraft. Major items of import from Chile are copper ore and concentrates, iodine, copper anodes, copper cathodes, molybdenum ores and concentrates, lithium carbonates, metal scrap, chemicals, pulp and waste paper, fruits and nuts excluding cashews, fertilisers and machinery.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/talks-for-further-expansion-of-trade-agreement-between-india-chile-in-final-stage-official-918533.html

The dialogue about the 91-year-old Chomsky's new book "Internationalism or Extinction" was scheduled to be held at 9 pm on Friday. But at 1 pm, Chomsky and Prashad received an email informing them about the cancellation of the virtual event. The duo asked the organisers if the move was a result of censorship. In his statement today, Dharkar said, on the morning of the session, they came across correspondence in the public domain, between Chomsky, Prashad and a group of activists, which clearly mentioned that this session would also be used to make a statement regarding "how they feel about corporations such as the Tatas, and the Tatas in particular, including airing the views of these activists, which was never the intended purpose of the session". The Tata group, one of India's leading multinational conglomerates, is the main sponsor of Tata Literature Live festival. "I do not wish to comment on their reasons for accepting an invitation to participate in an event and using the platform to air adverse views about the main sponsor. "What I do want to state as strongly as possible is that the festival which I founded and run with a dedicated team, owes its success to a free expression of ideas, not a free expression of someone's specific agenda. The expression of such an agenda -- whether against a specific organisation, a corporation or an individual -- is therefore misplaced in the discussions at our festival," Dharkar said. Dharkar said the cancellation of the session is a considered decision he has taken in his capacity as festival director. "Much as I deeply respect and admire the work of Prof. Noam Chomsky, this decision was necessary to protect the integrity of the festival," he added. The founder-festival director said the success of the festival is due to the literary talent it has been able to consistently attract from all five continents. "Another important reason is the wide range of ideas the festival has featured from writers across the political, economic and social spectrum... The diversity of thought and subjects featured every year is another reason for the festival's success," Dharkar noted. In a statement issued on People's Dispatch, Chomsky and Prashad on Saturday said the panel was to talk about the broad issues that threaten the planet, but then also talk about the specific role of countries such as India and corporations such as the Tatas. The issues about the Citizenship Amendment Act, Adivasi (tribal) killing, the industrialisation of indigenous lands and environmental degradation were also to be discussed during the session, it said. "We wanted to talk about how governments such as those led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and corporations such as the Tatas are hastening humanity towards a deeper and deeper crisis," the statement said. "We wanted to appear at this platform in the spirit of open discussion to hold our dialogue about extinction and internationalism, about the darkest part of our human story and the brightest sparks of hope that shine in our world," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cancelling-noam-chomsky-vijay-prashad-session-necessary-to-protect-tata-literature-lives-integrity-918540.html

The official said that with the opening of space sector to foreign investment and bringing defence sector under automatic route for 74 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI), MIDHANI shares are expected to attract investors.  MIDHANI manufactures special steel and super alloys for use in defence, nuclear and space sectors.  "We are looking at up to 10 per cent stake dilution via offer for sale," the official said.  Shares of MIDHANI closed at Rs 193.50 apiece on the BSE on Friday.  At the current market price, the government can raise about Rs 360 crore by selling 10 per cent stake in the company. So far this fiscal, the government has raised Rs 6,138 crore by selling minority stake in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and Bharat Dynamics Ltd through offer for sale so far this year. The government also divested 15.2 per cent in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd through an initial public offering. The government has set a Rs 2.1 lakh crore disinvestment target in current fiscal.

The scarcity forced many people to migrate from the region, he said after laying the foundation stone of rural drinking water supply projects in Mirzapur and Sonbhadra districts of the Vindhyachal region via video conferencing. Modi also interacted with village water and sanitation committee members during the event. "For decades after Independence, if any area had fallen prey to neglect, then it was this area. Be it Vindhyachal or Bundelkhand, this entire area despite having resources became an area of scarcity. Despite having so many rivers, this area was identified as the most thirsty and drought-affected area. This was the reason, which forced many people to migrate from here," he said. Referring to the temple of Vindhyavasini in the region, Modi said the Vindhya hills are a big centre of belief (vishvaas) and faith (aasthaa). "With the blessings of Maa Vindhyavasini, this project is beginning. The Vindhyachal hills have been a centre of belief (vishvaas), piousness (pavitrata) and faith (aasthaa) from ancient times. Poet Rahimdas had said 'jaa par vipadaa parat hai, so aavat yehi desh' (a person facing difficulty comes to this place). The reason for this belief was the abundant resources and possibilities present here," he said. Modi said the foundation laying of the projects is a moment of happiness for mothers, sisters and daughters. "This project is an example of Uttar Pradesh taking forward steps despite Covid-19," the PM said. The prime minister said in the past a year and a half from the start of the Jal Jeevan Mission, over 2.60 crore families have been provided with piped drinking water in the country. He added under the Jal Jeevan Mission, the life of mothers and sisters is getting easier due to easy water access. A major benefit of this has been the reduction of many diseases like cholera, typhoid and encephalitis caused by dirty water, he said. The prime minister said once piped water reached thousands of villages in Vindhyachal, the health of children would improve and their physical and mental development will be better. "When you get freedom to take decisions and work on those decisions for the development of your village, it increases the confidence of everyone in the village. Aatma Nirbhar Gaanv (self-reliant villages) will boost the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat campaign in a big way. Our government has given priority to villagers, the poor, the tribal, who were not given priority earlier," he said. Referring to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Modi said, "What type of house should be constructed in a particular area and what construction material should be used, are no longer decided in Delhi.” “The house should be constructed as per the living style of the tribal people," he said. The prime minister said his government had worked to help women get rid of smoke emanating from ovens (using wood) by providing LPG cylinders. "Our mothers and sisters used to daily consume smoke equivalent to smoke generated by 400 cigarettes. This has also reduced cutting of jungles," he said. Modi said the area is becoming a leader (agrani) in the world in the solar energy sector. "The solar energy plant in Mirzapur is writing a new chapter of development. Help is also being provided so that farmers can produce solar energy on barren land and earn additional income. Our 'anndata' (grain providers) should become 'urjadata' (energy providers)," he said and reminded people of the earlier energy situation. Referring to the Swamitva Scheme, Modi said verified ownership deeds for residential and land properties are being delivered to the owners leading to stability and certainty of titles. This is leading to an assurance against unlawful encroachment upon the property of the poor and improving the possibility of using property as collateral for credit. Speaking about efforts for the uplift of the people of the region, Modi said schemes are reaching the tribal regions under special projects. Hundreds of Eklavya Model schools are operating in such regions. The aim is to provide this facility to every tribal majority block. Projects on forest-based products are also being implemented. A district mineral fund has been established so that there is no dearth of funds for tribal regions and thinking behind such a scheme is that a part of resources generated from such areas are invested locally. In Uttar Pradesh, Rs 800 crore has been collected under the fund and more than 6,000 projects have been sanctioned, he said. Modi urged people to remain alert against coronavirus as the danger still exists. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was present on the occasion. The projects will provide tap water connections in 2,995 villages and benefit about 42 lakh people. Village water and sanitation committees will have the responsibility of operation and maintenance. The total estimated cost of the projects is Rs 5,555.38 crore. The projects are planned to be completed in 24 months under the Jal Jeevan Mission announced by the prime minister on August 15 last year. The projects aim at providing functional household tap connections to every rural house of the country by 2024.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-of-rural-drinking-water-projects-in-uttar-pradesh-918545.html

The last time the number of active cases increased was on October 3 after which there was a steady decline in such numbers on each of the subsequent days. But on Sunday with 45,209 new cases in the past 24 hours, the total number of active cases is now more than 4.40 lakh, which is 1,215 more than the number of active cases reported a day before. Last week top Health Ministry officials had warned that the consequences of the festivities, as well as Bihar polls, are yet to be seen on the Covid-19 numbers as the virus takes about two weeks to manifest. “As was predicted when a large number of people were gathering in markets and public places without precautionary measures in the pre-festival season, the transmission is now manifesting as active cases,” public health specialist Oommen John from the George Institute, Delhi told DH. “What is worrisome is the proportion of those needing hospitalisation and intensive care. The test to case proportions seem to a mismatch as for every case being tested, several others are missed, steadily contributing to the rapid transmission.” The ministry once again sent teams to eight states, each of which witnessed a rising trend between the first and third week of November. In Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, there is a clear second peak of the epidemic whereas very clear rising curves are seen in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The remaining three states where central teams have been deployed are Punjab, Manipur and Chhattisgarh. “The teams will visit the districts reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases and support the state efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing, infection prevention and control measures, and efficient clinical management of the positive cases,” the ministry said in a statement. Close to 77% of the new cases and 76% of deaths reported in the last 24 hours are from 10 states with Delhi topping both the charts. India’s Covid-19 toll stands at 1,33,227, out of which 501 was added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-indias-active-case-tally-increases-again-central-sends-high-level-teams-to-eight-states-918551.html

The veteran Congress leader was admitted to GMCH on November 2 due to post-Covid complications. Sarma told reporters that doctors have repeated all clinical tests and his vital health parameters have shown improvement compared to that of Saturday. "He is semi-conscious now. We had said last night that 48 hours were very critical for him. Twenty four hours have passed and there is no deterioration in his health condition. That is the most important thing," he stated. Gogoi's pulse rate and blood pressure are under check, and his oxygen saturation level 95-97 per cent. "The only worry is the urine output, which is around 100-120 ml in 24 hours," he said, adding that doctors will soon decide on the next step that was to be taken to improve his kidney functioning. The 84-year-old politician spontaneously opened his eyes and looked around in the morning, the GMCH superintendent said. "There was a slight movement, which we call moto movement. This is a good sign. Technically speaking, although he is critical, he is stable hemodynamically," he maintained. A big team of doctors from various departments are attending to Gogoi. "We are constantly in touch with doctors from AIIMS. They are satisfied with the treatment protocol and we will continue with that," he stated. Asked if the doctors would attempt dialysis to deal with his urine output, Sarma said that would be the last option. "As he is on inotropic support, we have kept dialysis as the last resort," he added. The veteran Congress politician's health condition deteriorated on Saturday following multi-organ failure and he became unconscious with difficulty in breathing. Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that Gogoi has been put on invasive ventilation. His son and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi rushed to the hospital along with Assam Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua. A host of MPs, MLAs and other senior leaders of the Congress also reached GMCH late on Saturday to enquire about his health. On October 25, the three-time chief minister, who was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and other post-recovery complications, was discharged from GMCH after two months. Gogoi had tested positive for Covid-19 on August 25. His health condition was being monitored by a nine-member committee of doctors, led by the head of pulmonary medicine Dr Jogesh Sarma. The panel was constituted by the state government when he tested positive for Covid-19 in August. After his discharge from hospital last month, the veteran Congress politician continued to remain under observation of the doctors' team at his residence here. In the days before he tested positive for Covid-19, Gogoi was at the forefront of the Congress initiative to form a 'Grand Alliance' comprising all the opposition parties for the 2021 assembly polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/marginal-improvement-in-tarun-gogois-health-condition-doctor-918557.html

The trails were proposed to start at the state-run College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital (CMSDH) in the North 24 Parganas district adjoining Kolkata later this week along with six other centres in different parts of the country. "We are on the verge of losing Phase II trials of Sputnik-V vaccine at the CMSDH because of the slow approach of the state health department in giving the approval. We had applied for the approval on November 4 and there is no response yet," the head of business development at site management organisation CliniMed LifeSciences, Snehendu Koner, told PTI. He said that while the initial feasibility process at CMSDH started along with the other centres where the trials are to take place, the approval could not be obtained in time. After securing the health department's approval, the consent of the hospital's Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) is also required before starting the trials, Koner said. The IECs of the rest six institutions have already given the go-ahead for the trials. When contacted, a senior official of the state health department, who was unwilling to be named, said, "This is an internal matter of our department. However, I believe that several official holidays on account of festivals could have delayed the approval process. I cannot talk much about it. We will look into it." The site management organisation had conducted necessary surveys to check infrastructure and cold storage facilities at the Sagore Dutta Hospital before approaching the state health department for approval to conduct the trials. "Such approvals from the state health department are not required to conduct trials for any vaccines or drugs. But surprisingly, we were asked to seek approval this time which delayed the process and eventually we are losing it," he said. Clinical trials of Sputnik V will be conducted by pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories in coordination with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The RDIF will be supplying 100 million doses of its potential Covid-19 vaccine to Dr Reddy's Lab. During the Phase II trials, 100 volunteers will be chosen from all over the country. Out of the 75 will be administered the vaccine, while the rest will be given placebo -- a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. Koner said Phase III of the trial of the vaccine candidate will begin in India in January and the state health department and the CMSDH will be urged to expedite the approval process. The site management organisation facilitates clinical trials by national and global pharmaceutical companies engaged in drug and vaccine development. Citing interim trial results, Russia's health ministry claimed earlier this month that the Sputnik V vaccine had shown 92 per cent efficacy in preventing Covid-19. The announcement had followed results unveiled earlier by vaccine developers Pfizer and BioNTech, who said their vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective at preventing the coronavirus disease. The calculation was based on 20 confirmed Covid-19 cases split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo, the RDIF had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengal-to-lose-chance-to-conduct-phase-ii-trial-of-sputnik-v-due-to-delay-in-govts-approval-918565.html

Addressing the virtual G20 Summit hosted by Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Lee on Saturday said that the group is well placed to coordinate and drive the global response required to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, the Straits Times reported. Saudi Arabia, which assumed the G20 presidency this year, is the host of the virtual summit that is bringing together leaders from the world's richest and most developed economies, such as the US, China, India, Turkey, France, the UK, and Brazil, among others. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among those participating in the closed-door virtual sessions that are taking place Saturday and Sunday. Singapore has been invited to this year's G20 meetings as a guest. It is also the convener of the Global Governance Group - an informal coalition of 30 countries that seeks to influence the G20 to take into account the interests of smaller countries affected by its decisions. Lee called on the world leaders to ensure affordable and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines - a point also made by other leaders, including King Salman. The Singapore premier expressed happiness that the G20 had advanced vaccine multilateralism by backing global initiatives such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access (Covax) Facility, which were set up to ensure that the distribution of any new vaccines would be shared equally. The scale of the pandemic led to a scramble for medical supplies earlier this year, with some countries limiting exports, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned about a similar situation with "vaccine nationalism", The Straits Times reported. Singapore is a co-chair of the Friends of the Covax Facility, and will do its part in contributing to the Covax Advance Market Commitment, which helps fund vaccines for lower-income countries, said Lee. Singapore will also continue to work closely with the WHO and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to accelerate vaccine development and enhance long-term pandemic preparedness, Lee said. He said that there is a need to strengthen global disease surveillance networks so that the world will be better prepared for the next pandemic. The effectiveness of such networks depends on countries investing in their domestic surveillance and response capabilities, and on their willingness to share information with one another, he said. "CCovidVID-19 has wreaked havoc in the whole world. But the next pandemic - Disease X - may be more contagious and far deadlier," The Straits Times quoted Lee as saying. Lee said the Saudi presidency had galvanised international action by coordinating fiscal resources, priorities and policies on a level, by supporting the most vulnerable countries and by completing a G20 action plan for a strong and sustainable economic recovery. Singapore stands ready to support the G20 in its endeavours to reinvigorate multilateralism - and to create a fair, predictable and stable international order, which will allow every country, big and small, to grow and prosper, he said. He also hoped that all countries would embrace multilateral cooperation under the leadership of the WHO. "Covid-19 has reinforced the need for countries to work together. Ultimately, no country is safe until every country is safe," he said. The G20 comprises 19 large advanced and emerging economies and the European Union, and was convened by the US to coordinate a global response to the 2008 global financial crisis||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/g20-summit-singapore-pm-calls-on-world-leaders-to-ensure-equitable-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccines-918569.html

The Green Tribunal Principal bench headed by its Chairperson Justice A K Goel noted that the concerned authorities had failed to take adequate steps to protect the water bodies so far. "We find that steps taken so far can hardly be held to be adequate...It helps not only aesthetics but also water availability, aquatic life, microclimate, recharge of groundwater and maintaining e-flow of the rivers," the bench observed. Under the oversight of chief secretaries of states/UTs, the designated nodal agency has been asked to hold its meeting by January 31, 2021 to take stock of the situation and plan further steps, including directions to district authorities for further course of action up to the Panchayat level. The bench also said that the nodal agency would evolve further monitoring mechanism as well as Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) and submit periodical reports to the Central Pollution Control Board or Secretary of Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India. Hearing a plea filed by a petitioner, Haryana resident Lt Col (retd) Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, seeking to restore the Ghata Lake in Gurgaon and 214 other water bodies in Faridabad district, the Tribunal expanded the scope of petition to the entire country. "Any individual grievances may be first raised before the appropriate GRM or by moving the concerned District Magistrate which may be looked into on merits," the Tribunal said. The tribunal also asked the Central Monitoring Committee, formed for monitoring remediation of 351 polluted river stretches, to monitor the steps for restoration of water bodies by all the states periodically, at least thrice in a year. First such monitoring may take place by March 31, 2021, the tribunal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ngt-directs-states-uts-to-designate-nodal-agency-for-protection-of-water-bodies-918580.html

The issue was discussed in an e-meeting by the NCW with the nodal officers and representatives of the 24 states and Union Territories. The meeting was held to review and discuss the cases of acid attack registered on the website of the Commission's Management Information System (MIS). National Commission for Women Chairperson Rekha Sharma expressed her concern over the non-payment of compensation to acid attack survivors. According to data till October 20, out of 1,273 cases of acid attack across the country compensation has been given to acid attack survivors in just 474 cases. "The nodal officers were requested to uphold the laws and schemes that support survivors in cases of attacks, such as the NALSA's Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes, 2018. The scheme provides compensation ranging from INR 3 to 8 lakh depending on the severity of the case," according to the commission's monthly newsletter. Sharma also expressed her view that a number of cases updated till date on the NCW's MIS was not adequate, as the numbers of the cases reported across the country and in states do not match with the commission's MIS data. This was conveyed as a huge concern during the discussion as the commission has the mandate to safeguard women laws and protection of their rights, including the safety of women from various atrocities such as acid attack crimes. The review of cases on MIS has revealed a delay in filing chargesheets. She said she has also taken up the matter with the chief secretary of states/UTs where nodal officers have not been appointed for maintaining acid attack data on MIS. During the discussion, the commission said it was disappointing to know from various reports that some states/UTs have not provided adequate and timely medical treatment/ assistance to survivors of acid attack. Out of the 1,273 cases, medical assistance was provided to 726 cases by the states, the data said. "This brought to the commission's notice that more works needs to be done in these states, to ensure women legal rights and implementation of women welfare schemes and provision for strengthening their support systems," it said. Additionally, the commission felt that states/UTs delay in filing charge sheets, as most cases do not mention dates, status of investigation or progress of the prosecution or any records of the cases; hence the delay in updates indicates that cases are not dealt properly in interest of the survivors, the document said. The NCW also insisted that the nodal officers must instruct the police authorities to take such cases at priority and to avoid delay in investigation and filing charge sheets. The nodal officers have also been asked to keep track at all levels of the systematic coordination. The representatives from the State/UT of Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Goa (North District), Jammu and Kashmir, Dadar and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu informed that no cases of acid attack were reported in 2020.   The National Commission for Women is the nodal body to overview acid attack cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/acid-attack-victims-not-paid-compensation-in-62-cases-ncw-918598.html

They say the easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population, such as the elderly and those having comorbidities, to the deadly virus. In the month of November alone, the national capital has recorded 1,759 fatalities till November 21 – around 83 deaths per day. The number of deaths breached the 100-mark four times in the last 10 days. Authorities reported 111 fatalities on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 deaths on Wednesday, the highest till date, and 104 on November 12. The average fatality rate in Delhi stands at 1.58 per cent at present, which is higher than the national death rate of 1.48 per cent, according to government data.   At 3.2 per cent, Punjab's fatality rate is the maximum among all states and Union Territories. Maharashtra (2.6 per cent), Sikkim (2 per cent), Gujarat (2 per cent), West Bengal (1.8 per cent), Puducherry (1.7 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (1.6 per cent) and Uttarakhand (1.6 per cent) have recorded more deaths per 100 confirmed cases than Delhi. Dr B L Sherwal, the managing director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said, "Overall, more deaths occur during winters. This is one major difference we have observed in case of Covid-19 fatalities, too."  The cold weather is not favorable for people with weak immune systems who are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, he said.  "Seventy per cent of those who have died due to coronavirus were elderly or had comorbidities," he said. Dr Sherwal said that mostly young people were getting infected before the lockdown curbs were lifted. "The virus has spread among the elderly rapidly due to easing of restrictions and the festival season. This segment accounts for most of the critical cases," he said. "High pollution levels and population density are also among major reasons for the large number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Delhi," he said. N K Ganguly, former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said mapping of deaths has become better as compared to the initial months. "Earlier, all Covid-19 deaths were not being counted. Reasons other than coronavirus were attributed to the deaths that occurred in households and small hospitals. Now, each death is being confirmed and counted due to better testing facilities," he said. An official from a Delhi government hospital said the high fatality rate was also due to the large number of non-resident critical patients coming to the city for treatment. "These serious patients come to Delhi after exhausting all their options. It is natural that the deaths will be more here as compared to other places," he said. The official said another important parameter is "reporting infrastructure". "The mapping and reporting of deaths in the national capital is better as compared to other places," the official claimed. Recently, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had also said that the Covid-19 death rate in national capital was slightly higher than the national average. He, however, noted that situation at present was much better than June when the fatality rate had soared to "3.5 per cent". While the mortality rate in July was 3.12 per cent, it had fallen to 2.54 per cent by the end of August. He said the city was reeling under the third wave of coronavirus but the gradual reduction in the number of new Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate is a "clear indicator" that the spread of the virus is decreasing in the national capital. Authorities reported a positivity rate of 12.9 per cent on Saturday, 10.59 per cent on Friday, 12.09 per cent on Thursday, 12.03 per cent on Wednesday, 13.04 per cent on Tuesday and 12.73 percent on Monday.  The positivity rate was 15 per cent on November 7, the highest this month.  Battling a surge in coronavirus cases, the AAP government had on Thursday increased the fine for not wearing masks from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 and directed private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for coronavirus patients. Private hospitals have also been directed to increase the percentage of non-ICU Covid-19 beds from 50 per cent to 60 per cent.  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had asked hospitals to postpone non-critical planned surgeries for the time being. The government also said it will increase the number of RT-PCR tests to 27,000 a day in the national capital and MBBS students and interns will be engaged to tackle the Covid-19 situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-sees-1759-covid-19-deaths-in-nov-experts-cite-non-resident-patients-cold-weather-as-reasons-918601.html

He will also prepare the party for 2024 Lok Sabha polls by focussing on the seats it lost in 2019 general elections. Briefing reporters on the programme, BJP general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Arun Singh said Nadda will also review the parties’ preparedness in the four poll-bound states of West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam. “States going to elections next year will hold special attention during this programme,” the statement said. Singh said the key objective of the nationwide programme is to strengthen the organisational structure, development of team spirit, strengthen booth-level operations, work on building a positive image for BJP state governments, streamlining party activities, public awareness through public programmes, strategy on 2024 election, work on creating a more cohesive and inclusive structure, dialogue and ideological approach of the party review activities. While there are still 3.5 years to go before the next general elections, just six months are left for the Assembly polls in the four states. Nadda’s Yatra is expected to create buzz for the party in these states. Virtual meetings and virtual community events will be organised throughout the Yatras along with press conferences in major cities. Nadda will stay for a minimum of two days in small states and for three days in large states. In Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls in 2022 and has 80 Lok Sabha seats, Nadda will be staying for more than a week.  Nadda will begin the tour from the religious-tourist hill state Uttarakhand on December 5, a day before the anniversary of the demolition of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid structure in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. The BJP has in many election rallies boasted about the Modi government facilitating the construction of Ram Mandir. During the Yatra, while interacting with ground workers, Nadda will also explore new allies for the party. Alliance and strategy will be two key components of Nadda’s Yatra. In BJP-ruled states, Nadda is expected to work on improving the coordination between the government and the organisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/eye-on-2024-polls-j-p-nadda-to-go-on-120-day-nationwide-tour-from-december-918602.html

The CCIM has notified 39 general surgical and 19 ENT, eye, head and dental care related procedures that PG Ayurveda scholars of Shalya and Shalakya streams need to be practically trained so that they can perform such procedures independently after completing their post-graduation. The notification was specific to those procedures and didn’t not allow Shalya and Shalakya postgraduates to take up any other types of surgery, the ministry clarified in a statement after Indian Medical Association described the move as a “retrograde step that would corrupt the entire Indian healthcare system.” “The question of mixing of Ayurveda with conventional (modern) medicine doesn’t arise as the CCIM is deeply committed to maintaining the authenticity of Indian systems of medicine, and is against any such mixing,” said the statement. The IMA on Saturday said it would resist any form of mixing of different forms of medicine and took strong objections to the use of modern medical names of such surgical procedures as used in the notification. For instance, in the notification Unddukpuchha-Shoth has been Appendectomy or removal of appendix while Pittashmari Nirharan-chhedan has been dubbed as removal of gallstones. “IMA exhorts the CCIM to develop their own surgical disciplines from their own ancient texts and not claim the surgical disciplines of modern medicine as its own. They have no right to the technical terms, techniques and procedures of modern medicine,” the association said in its statement. The ministry has responded to the charges. “The modern terminologies in the field of medicine are not modern from a temporal perspective, but are derived substantially from ancient languages like Greek, Latin and even Sanskrit, and later languages like Arabic. Evolution of terminologies is a dynamic and inclusive process,” it said. “Modern medical terms and terminology facilitates effective communication and correspondence not just among physicians, but also to other stake-holders including the public. In the instant notification, modern terms are adopted as per requirement to ensure that the same is understood widely in the medical profession, in the stake-holding disciplines like the medico-legal, health IT etc., as well as by the members of the public,” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-mixing-with-modern-medicine-clarifies-ayush-ministry-after-surgery-notification-draws-flak-918612.html

A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna gave the BDA Commissioner 10 days time to file a response or appear in person before it on December 2, the next date of hearing. The court was examining compliance of its August 3, 2018 judgment which directed the Karnataka government and the Bangalore Development Authority not to drop acquisition of 650 acres of land for 'Dr K Shivaram Karanth Layout' in Bengaluru.  The decision had repercussions for hundreds of people who have built their dwellings and establishments over the land of the layout proposed initially in 2008. In its hearing on November 19, the court noted that the BDA did not file any affidavit in the matter, despite its order of July 30, 2019 seeking progress made for the acquisition of land.  The Karnataka government, for its part, led by Advocate General Prabhuling K Navadgi, said that  after the final notification, the BDA has taken steps to issue notices of enquiry for passing of award as per law.  To this, the court pointed out particulars of notices have not been furnished by the state government along with the application. Taking a serious view, the bench ordered, "we direct the Commissioner, BDA to furnish the particulars of notices issued to the land owners and other progress made for completion of the acquisition of the notified lands within 10 days, failing which he is directed to be present before this court on the next date of hearing." In a related development, the court declined to consider a plea by a real estate developer, M/s Hill Land Properties, represented by advocate Balaji Srinivasan for providing a list of lands cited in the judgement and a copy of inquiry report submitted by Justice K N Keshvanarayana to the top court. It, however, allowed the applicant to approach the High Court for the purpose and subsequently to the Supreme Court, if need arises. The court had in 2018 appointed former Karnataka High Court judge, Justice Keshavanarayana, to conduct an inquiry for “fixing responsibility” on the officials of the BDA and the state government for excluding large tracts of land from acquisition process for the layout.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shivaram-karanth-layout-sc-gives-bda-commissioner-10-days-to-furnish-info-on-acquisition-of-land-918620.html

The ministry's secretary, M Rajeevan, said required approvals are being obtained for the "futuristic and game-changing" mission, and it is likely to be launched in the next 3-4 months. The mission, which is expected to cost over Rs 4,000 crore, will give a boost to efforts to explore India's vast Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf, another senior official of the MoES said. Rajeevan said the mission will also involve developing technologies for different deep ocean initiatives. The multi-disciplinary work will be piloted by the MoES and other government departments like the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Department of Biotechnology, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will be stakeholders in this mission, Rajeevan added. Some of the technologies involved will be developed by organisations such as the ISRO and DRDO. “One of the main aspects of the mission will be design, development and demonstration of human submersibles,” the MoES official said. Another aspect is exploring the possibility of deep sea mining and developing necessary technologies, the official added. The official said the move strategically significant as it will enhance India's presence in the Indian Ocean where other players like China, Korea and Germany are active. Last week, China live-streamed footage of its new manned submersible parked at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. This was part of its mission into the deepest underwater valley on the planet. India has been ear-marked nearly 1.5 lakh square kilometres of area in the central Indian Ocean for exploration. In September 2016, India signed a 15-year contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) for exploration of Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS) in the Indian Ocean. The ISA is an institution set up under the Convention on Law of the Sea to which India is a Party. The 15-year contract formalised India's exclusive rights for exploration of PMS in the allotted area in the Indian Ocean. The ISA earlier approved 10,000 sq. km for India with a 15-year PMS exploration plan along the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) and Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) region of the Indian Ocean. Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS), which contain iron, copper, zinc, silver, gold, platinum in variable constitutions, are precipitates of hot fluids from upwelling hot magma from deep interior of the oceanic crust, discharged through mineralized chimneys. PMS in the Ocean Ridges have attracted worldwide attention for their long term commercial as well as strategic values. “The aim is to be prepared when rules are formalised in this area. The deep oceans frontier is yet to be explored. We have been working on it on a piecemeal basis but the thrust is to carry out work on mission mode,” the official added. The mission will also involve procurement of more advanced deep sea vessels for explorations. The existing vessel Sagar Kanya is nearly three-and-half decades old.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-launch-deep-sea-mission-in-3-4-months-moes-official-918624.html

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health, in its report "The Outbreak of Pandemic COVID-19 And its Management", underlined the need for bio-safety to prevent the world community from any activity signalling bio-terrorism. The chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee, Ram Gopal Yadav, submitted the report to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday.  The committee's attention has been drawn to the fact that novel coronavirus, like viruses infecting large populations across the globe and emerging as pandemics, can be used as biological weapons against enemy nations. Bio-security, therefore, is a critical area of concern, the report said. The Department of Health and Family has submitted that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons, that inter-alia include an approach for deterrence, prevention, protection and response against biological weapons, engagement with agencies and active participation in ongoing international treaties and strengthening bio-safety and bio-security platforms in India. It also has pitched for instituting robust bio-repositories for high-risk emerging/ reemerging infectious pathogens, strengthening disease surveillance including at animal-human interface, training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising from the use of bio-weapons and strengthening research and surveillance activities related to the development of diagnostics vaccines and drugs.  "The adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic have taught the lesson on the importance of controlling biological agents and the need of strategic partnerships among different nations.  "The committee, therefore, feels that the present time is the most appropriate for the government to formulate effective laws to counter bioterrorism," the committee said in its report. The panel stated it also believes that with the expanding network of VRDLs, ICMR would serve as an important platform for diagnosis and surveillance of existing as well as emerging viral infections and thus make the country bio-secured against life-threatening viruses and the menace of bioterrorism. The committee agreed with the Department of Health Research that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons. The ministry should also engage with agencies and actively participate in ongoing international treaties.  The committee strongly recommended the ministry conduct more research and work towards training and capacity building for the management of public health emergencies arising from the use of bio-weapons.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parliamentary-panel-underscores-need-for-govt-to-formulate-laws-to-counter-bioterrorism-918629.html

22-11-2020||National||Centre exploring modalities of emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine||The government is exploring the modalities of emergency authorisation and usage of anti-coronavirus vaccines pending completion of phase-three clinical trial and regular licensure. The issue of advance purchase commitment for vaccines, including pricing, was also discussed in a recent meeting attended by NITI Aayog Member (Health) Vinod Paul, Principal Scientific Advisor to the government K VijayRaghavan and Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan. "It was decided that the PMO-constituted Vaccine Task Force (VTF) will lay down the principles for emergency use authorisation while the National Expert Group On Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) should take the lead in setting the principles for advance market commitment, including vaccine pricing," a source said. These developments assume significance against the backdrop of Pfizer seeking emergency use authorisation of its Covid-19 vaccine from the US regulators. Another US-based biotechnology giant, Moderna, said it also intends to apply for an emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in the coming weeks.  Meanwhile, five vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials in India. The Serum Institute of India is conducting the phase-three trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, while Bharat Biotech and ICMR has already started the phase-three trail of the indigenously developed COVAXIN jab. An indigenously developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has completed phase-two clinical trial in the country. Dr Reddy's Laboratories will soon start combined phase two and three trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India. According to the source, an urgent meeting of the vaccine task force (VTF) with experts will be convened to review the scientific status of vaccines globally and whether, if so how and when should the decision on emergency authorisation of vaccines be taken. The terms of references for two major bodies dealing with vaccine introduction -- the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the Central Drug Standards and Control Organisation (CDSCO) -- will be set and their roles clearly defined for authorisation and emergency authorisation It was also agreed at the meeting that one point of contact will be responsible for examining and responding to authorisations given (or in the pipeline), globally, the source said. Towards advance market commitment, NEGVAC should lay down principles for procurement and price negotiations. Using these principles, negotiations should be speedily initiated. It was also decided at the meeting that a NEGVAC group should be proactively reaching out to each company as their results from phase three are announced, a source said. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have announced that its vaccine appears 95 per cent effective at preventing mild to severe Covid-19 disease in a large, ongoing study. Moderna has also announced that its Covid-19 vaccine has shown to be 94.5 per cent effective in preventing the deadly disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-exploring-modalities-of-emergency-authorisation-of-covid-19-vaccine-918654.html

Degree, engineering and diploma colleges were reopened on November 17 after eight months of closure due to coronavirus-induced lockdown. Under the circumstances, reports emerged that at least 130 students got infected by Covid-19. "If the cases go up, then, as you have said in your (media) reports, we will have to go for a shutdown once again. There is no alternative," Sudhakar told reporters in Dharwad while responding to queries about the rising coronavirus cases among students. The BMTC will begin gender sensitisation training for all staffers and self-defence training for its women employees to counter sexual harassment. In a release, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) said it seeks to make a meaningful intervention to address the problem of sexual harassment and gender-based violence. Iran on Sunday vowed to defeat any Israeli attempt to harm its role in Syria, saying the era of "hit and run" attacks by Israel there was over, days after Israel carried out air strikes on Syrian army and Iranian paramilitary targets in the country. Israel, which views Tehran as its biggest security threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets and those of allied militia in Syria, where Tehran has backed President Bashar al-Assad and his forces against rebels and militants since 2012.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-bharti-singh-in-judicial-custody-iran-says-israels-hit-and-run-attacks-in-syria-over-918669.html

Speaking after releasing a "charge sheet" against the TRS rulingthe Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), he alleged it failed to fulfill its poll promises and also accused the party government led by K Chandrasekhar Rao in Telangana of indulging in corruption. TRS made a promise to make Hyderabad a Global City but it has been made into a flood city, he said, in an apparent reference to one of the worst deluges the state capital faced in recent times last month following unprecedented rains. In the GHMC polls to be held on December 1, the fight was for who will be the city's Mayor, the senior BJP leader and the Information and Broadcasting Minister told reporters here. The question is whether an MIMs Mayor is needed or BJP's Mayor is needed. The elections are being contested on this question. Because a vote to KCR (as the Telangana Chief Minister is popularly known) means vote to the MIM," he claimed. "Vote to Congress means vote to the MIM and vote to MIM means for division. And hence this time the people here have decided that a Mayor should be from BJP, he said. According to him what happened in Dubbak, where the BJP upset the TRS, is going to be repeated in Hyderabad also. The results of Dubbak has showed which way the wind was blowing in Telangana. "The same wind is blowing in Hyderabad also", he claimed adding We are fighting for (BJPs) victory. He described the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) as 'dynastic' parties. It is KCR and KT Rama Rao (KCRs son and state Minister) in TRS and Asaduddin Owaisi and Akbaruddin Owaisi (Asaduddins brother and MLA) in AIMIM. We have seen in the last six years these parties indulged in loot, Javadekar alleged. He claimed that there was only one speciality in Telangana and it is corruption. There is debt on state and assets in KCR's name. The assets of KCR and his friends are growing while assets of state are declining and its debts are growing. And because of this BJP brought out a charge sheet highlighting the 60 failures of TRS which has run away from keeping its promises, he said. The TRS government did not keep its promises of providing one lakh government jobs, making one lakh 2 bedroom, hall and kitchen houses, the senior BJP leader charged. He alleged corruption and irregularities in disbursal ofRs 10,000 financial assistance which was announced as immediate relief to each flood-affected household in Hyderabad and claimed only a few people got the money. Javadekar accused the TRS government of not implementing central schemes, including the PMJAY health insurance scheme under which COVID-19 treatment is covered, in the state. COVID-19 treatment was not covered underTelanganas 'Aarogyasri' health scheme due to which those affected by the coronavirus had to spend lakhs of rupees for treatment, he claimed. TRS ruled with MIM (in GHMC) and now say they don't have alliance with the latter. But the two will become friends soon after election results, he said. Responding to a query, the Union Minister said BJP was in power in 100 corporations in the country and there have been no riots there and that was the party's speciality. The BJP has compassion for all sections of society and hence we will present an Hyderabad which is riot-free, corruption-free and MIM-free with development," he said. Javadekar refuted KCR's recent statement that the Centre was privatising PSUs, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), saying we have not done disinvestment in LIC and Railways. The days of giving false information and misguiding people are over. People want KCR to speak on Hyderabad's issues and not LIC and other matters. They want reply on what had been done in the past five years in the city, he said. On the TRS supremo's statement that he would soon convene a conclave of opposition leaders to launch a united fight against the BJP-led NDA, Javadekar sought to downplay it, saying he (KCR) had made similar attempts (before 2019 general elections) but did not get any response.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/trs-turned-hyderabad-into-flood-city-people-want-to-elect-a-bjp-mayor-in-ghmc-polls-prakash-javadekar-918670.html

"Liberty of a citizen cannot be taken away in this manner," a bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud said. The court said the high court was “manifestly in error” in rejecting the revision in default and it ought to have appointed another lawyer as amicus curiae to assist it in the matter which pertained to conviction. The court allowed the appeal filed by the man and set aside the February 11 and July 16 orders of the high court. On February 11, the high court had dismissed the plea filed by the man. Subsequently, on July 16, the high court had dismissed the application for restoration of plea saying that no grounds for restoration was established. The man was convicted for the offence punishable under the Arms Act by a magisterial court in January 2015 and was sentenced to three-year imprisonment. A sessions court had upheld his conviction in July 2017 after which he had moved the high court. The top court restored his revision petition and granted him bail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-sets-aside-punjab-and-haryana-hcs-order-in-arms-act-case-due-to-lawyers-absence-918671.html

BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have expressed their intention to bring a law against 'love jihad', a term coined by Hindutva groups for Hindu girls being allegedly forced to convert to Islam in the guise of marriage. Opposition parties have dismissed this as an attempt by the BJP to divide the society and said any such law will be violative of the Constitution. "Love jihad is a serious problem. Many mothers and sisters have suffered its bad consequences. This is a state matter and state governments should enact law against it," BJP general secretary Arun Singh told reporters at a press conference. Some state governments are working in this regard and will continue to do so, he added. About Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel's attack on the saffron party over the issue and his reference to interfaith marriages of some BJP leaders, Singh said Baghel should first answer whether his government has fulfilled the promises like waiving farm loans and starting unemployment allowance the Congress had made during the Assembly polls in 2018.

The accusations were comical since the 'twins' who stood by Shah's side -Chief Minister K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam- were 'involved in corruption,' over the past about four years, Stalin alleged, referring to the Home Minister as "Delhi Chanakya." "They may do any number of conjuring tricks, but the people are clear," the DMK chief said adding a body blow awaited the AIADMK and BJP combine in the assembly elections due in April-May next year for levelling such charges. The AIADMK on Saturday said its alliance with the BJP would continue for the assembly elections. He would not rest till the DMK returned to power, Stalin said adding he would start his poll campaign in January. Till such time the party won power in Tamil Nadu there was no question of respite and he would start his poll campaign in January, Stalin said. "Let us march ahead by outmanoeuvring the conspiracies of AIADMK and the BJP to scuttle our journey towards victory," he said in a reference to the accusations against his party. On Saturday, Shah said DMK and its ally Congress had no right to talk about corruption since the 2G Spectrum allocation scam happened during the United Progressive Alliance regime. Dubbing the DMK a dynasty party, he had alleged it did not function based on democratic values but only took forward dynasty politics. It was now the turn of the DMK to lose elections -2021 Assembly polls- following the RJD in Bihar, he said. The Minister also demanded the DMK to list out what it had done for Tamil Nadu when it held the reins of power. Party treasurer T R Baalu alleged the BJP regime at the Centre has only betrayed Tamil Nadu so far by ignoring Tamil and imposing Hindi, and 'damaging' social harmony. Listing several projects like the Rs 908 crore Nemelli desalination plan, Baalu said these were the achievements of his party-led regime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/stalin-hits-back-at-amit-shah-calls-dynasty-politics-barb-a-trick-918690.html

China’s President Xi Jinping too stressed on the need “to follow the guidance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and push for the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement”. “I am glad to share that India is not only meeting our Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them,” the Prime Minister said. “We aim to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030; and, we are encouraging a circular economy”. He said that India’s next-generation infrastructure like metro networks and water-ways would also contribute to a cleaner environment. “We will meet our goal of 175 GW of renewable energy well before the target of 2022. Now, we are taking a big step ahead by seeking to achieve 450 GW by 2030”. Though Trump has not yet conceded defeat to Biden in the US presidential elections, the G20 virtual summit chaired by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was perhaps the last multilateral conclave that he could participate before the January 20, 2021 change of guard in the White House. Modi, Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and several other world leaders participated in the virtual meeting on “Safeguarding the Planet” that held on the side-line of the summit on Sunday. The 45th American President has since long been blaming that the 2016 deal has gone in favour of developing nations like India and China, but put the US in a disadvantageous position. “I refuse to surrender millions of American jobs and sent trillions of American dollars to the world's worst polluters and environmental offenders – and that's what would have happened (had the US not withdrawn from the Paris Climate Accord,” Trump said at the G20 side event on Sunday, albeit without directly referring to India or China. Though the Trump Administration initiated the process of withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord in June 2017, it came to its end on November 4 this year – just a day after the voting for the US presidential elections ended setting the stage for the imminent change of regime in the White House. The Paris Agreement set a long-term goal to limit rise in global average temperature below two degree centigrade above the levels that existed before industrial revolution. The agreement required each country to determine, plan and regularly report on the contribution that it would undertake to mitigate global warming, albeit without forcing a country to set a specific target for lowering emission by a specific date. India set a target to reach 175 GW of installed capacity in renewable power by 2022 as well as to achieve a 40% level of reliance on non-fossil fuel power by 2030. Trump said during the pre-election debate with Biden on October 22 that the air in India, Russia and China were “filthy”. He apparently made the remark to reiterate his allegation that developing nations like India and China contributed more than the US and other developed countries to global worming and climate change – an allegation dismissed by New Delhi and Beijing in the past as unscientific and politically motivated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/donald-trump-justifies-us-exit-from-paris-agreement-pm-modi-says-climate-change-cannot-be-fought-in-silos-918694.html

He also told reporters that results of polls held in Bihar and other states indicated that the Congress should take other parties along and "understand the ground reality". Addressing a press conference after inaugurating the Goa NCP office here, Patel said the Sharad Pawar-led party was willing to forge an alliance with the Congress and other like-minded parties in upcoming Goa Assembly elections. "But if such alliance doesn't materialise, the NCP is ready to contest polls on its own and form a government (in Goa)," he added. In recently-held Bihar polls, the BJP-JD(U) combine managed to retain power by defeating the RJD-led grand alliance in a tight contest. The poor showing by the Congress, which was part of the 'mahagatbandhan', affected the overall electoral performance of the alliance. "Results of the elections held in Bihar and other states have clearly demonstrated that Congress and other parties should be broad-minded enough to understand the reality and take other parties along. "If the Congress takes other parties for granted, it will lead to a division of votes," the former Union minister said. Speaking on the Goa assembly elections, due in 2022, Patel claimed that many leaders of other parties are in touch with him since the last few weeks. "We are very sure that even if it comes to contesting elections alone, we will have good candidates including some sitting MLAs," he said. Patel said the NCP, which has one MLA in the 40-member Goa House, has been expanding its base in the coastal state. "We are going to identify all the constituencies and start working for the next assembly elections. We are currently in a good position in at least 7-8 constituencies. We want to build our own strength on the basis of which we will contest," he added. The NCP is a part of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bihar-poll-results-show-congress-should-be-accommodative-ncp-918701.html
22-11-2020||National||Retrograde step: IMA on Centre allowing post-grad Ayurveda doctors to perform surgery||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has condemned the move by the Central Council of Indian Medicine authorising post-graduate practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda be trained to perform surgical procedures and described it as a "retrograde step of mixing the systems". Demanding that the order be withdrawn, the IMA urged the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry, to develop their own surgical disciplines from their own ancient texts and not claim the surgical disciplines of modern medicine as their own. The notification by the CCIM listed 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016. In a statement, the IMA said, "Such a deviant practice is unbecoming of a statutory body. The IMA will have no objections for the council to develop their own dedicated disciplines without mixing modern medicine surgical disciplines." It also demanded that the government should refrain from posting any doctor of modern medicine in the colleges of Indian medicine. "The IMA sees this development as a retrograde step of mixing the systems which will be resisted at all costs. All over India students and practitioners of modern medicine are agitated over this violation of mutual identity and respect. "What is the sanctity of NEET if such lateral shortcuts are devised? IMA demands to withdraw the order and first delineate the Indian Medicine disciplines based on original Indian Medicine texts," the doctors' body said. Meanwhile, AYUSH Ministry Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said the notification by the CCIM does not amount to any policy deviation or any new decision. "This notification is more of the nature of a clarification. It streamlines the existing regulation relating to post graduate education in Ayurveda with respect to the specified procedures. "Further, the notification does not open up the entire field of surgery to Ayurveda practitioners and specifies a set of surgical procedures. It outlines that not all post-graduates of Ayurveda can perform these procedures. Only those specialised in Shalya and Shalakya are allowed to perform these surgical procedures," Kotecha said. Chairman of the Board of Governors, CCIM, Vaidya Jayant Devpujari clarified that these surgical procedures are being performed in Ayurveda institutes for over 20 years and the notification legalises them. "The purpose of bringing out the notification is also to set boundaries by specifying the list of procedures so that practitioners restrict themselves to the set of surgical procedures as mentioned in the regulation," Devpujari said. According to the November 20 gazette notification the procedures listed include removal of metallic and non-metallic foreign bodies from non-vital organs, excision of simple cyst or benign tumours (lipoma, fibroma, schwanoma etc) of non-vital organs, amputation of gangrene, traumatic wound management, foreign body removal from stomach, squint surgery, cataract surgery and functional endoscopic sinus surgery.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/retrograde-step-ima-on-centre-allowing-post-grad-ayurveda-doctors-to-perform-surgery-918703.html

The ASI has been suspended and proceedings for his dismissal are being contemplated, they said. The accused has been identified as Rajbir Singh, police said, adding that four other accused in the case were earlier arrested. Singh had been awarded Police Medals for Meritorious Service in 2019. The Delhi Police in a statement said they have a zero tolerance policy towards police personnel indulging in unwarranted activities. "There is no place in the force for personnel like ASI Rajbir Singh, who is allegedly found involved in a serious criminal case. He will have to go through the legal process. Delhi Police is examining the possibility of withdrawal of medals conferred upon him. "He has been suspended and proceedings for his dismissal are being contemplated. This is a strong message for everyone to be careful and not to indulge in undesirable activities," the statement said. According to the police, an FIR was registered at Hauz Khas police station in which the complainant had alleged that on June 28, 2020, his father received a call where the caller introduced himself as gangster Kala, who threatened him and asked him to pay Rs two crore. Kala also threatened to kill the complainant and his entire family if they failed to comply with his demands, police said. During investigation, it was revealed that the SIM card and the mobile phone used to make the extortion call was allegedly snatched on June 27 from a person named Ram Murthy in Rohtak, Haryana, a senior police officer said. However, the snatched mobile phone was not used to make the call. Instead, its SIM card was used in another mobile phone to make the extortion call, the officer said. That handset was procured from a man named Sawan by a person named Mukesh, both residents of Pankaj Garden, Goyla Dairy and accused in the case, the officer said. Thereafter, Mukesh gave that handset to Parmod alias Kala, a resident of Jhajjar district in Haryana, who made the extortion call from Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, the officer said. Three accused -- Mukesh, Sawan and Sunny alias shooter -- were then arrested by the police. During enquiry, it came to light that Parmod was using three mobile phones. The numbers were analysed and it was revealed that ASI Rajbir Singh, presently posted in South West Zone of PCR, was in continuous touch with Parmod, the officer said. Singh also knew the complainant and provided information about the him to Parmod. He had also met Parmod on several occasions, police said. The complainant had gotten suspicious about Singh's role in the case after the ASI called him and tried to talk to him about the extortion call on July 14, police said. Parmod was later arrested and after sustained interrogation, he disclosed that Singh had provided the mobile number of complainant to him and also told him to make the extortion call, police said. Singh had also told him to fire at the car of complainant's son, if the extortion money was not paid. "Singh emerged as the mastermind of this entire extortion case. Based on technical analysis and interrogation of accused, Singh was arrested on Friday and sent to judicial custody," Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said. Further investigation is underway, police added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-police-asi-arrested-in-extortion-case-918722.html

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech this month started third-stage trials of COVAXIN, in a process that would involve 26,000 volunteers. It is the most advanced Indian experimental vaccine. "We are in the process of developing our indigenous vaccines, in the process of completing our third-phase trials in the next one or two months," Harsh Vardhan told a web conference on the pandemic. He reiterated that the government's plan is to immunise 200 million to 250 million Indians by July. An ICMR scientist told Reuters earlier this month that the vaccine could be launched in February or March, although Bharat Biotech separately told Reuters on Friday that results of the late-stage trials were expected only between March and April. Vardhan, however, said in September that the government could opt for emergency vaccine authorisation, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces. Officials have said that they expect to rely on COVAXIN and four other locally-tested candidates to control Covid-19, as they do not expect early access to sufficient quantities of those developed by Pfizer and Moderna. The other experimental vaccines on trial in India are the one being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute; Russia's Sputnik-V; Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and lastly one that Biological E. Ltd is developing with Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp. Serum's CEO said on Friday that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be delivered to the country's healthcare workers and the elderly by January. India on Sunday recorded 45,209 new infections, taking the total to over 90 lakhs, only behind that of the United States. Deaths rose by 501 to 133,227, with Delhi recording the highest number of daily fatalities in the country over the last few days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/final-trials-of-indias-local-covid-19-vaccine-can-end-within-two-months-918767.html
22-11-2020||National||Covid-19 will soon become a past episode of 21st century: Harsh Vardhan||The rapidness at which coronavirus vaccines are being developed will have a significant effect on new technologies that will help in faster drug discoveries, lowering the cost and making it more affordable for the poor, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday. The process, which used to take 10 years to produce vaccines, is now done in almost 10 months, Vardhan said while addressing the Boston Center of Excellence (BoCE) for Health and Human Development through video conference. The health minister saluted the millions of frontline workers and elaborated India's strategy to contain the virus. "It is not the first one and definitely not the last one. But this Covid-19 will soon be a past episode of the 21st century. Our treatment protocol for Covid patients is well defined now," a statement quoted Vardhan as saying. "Fewer and fewer people infected are dying. We will have vaccines available very soon and the cases will significantly go down in the next few months," he said. "The rapidness with which we have been able to create vaccines will have a cascading effect on new technologies that will help us all in the near future in faster drug discoveries, lowering the cost and making it more affordable for poorer sections of our population," Vardhan said. "The process that used to take 10 years, now produces vaccines almost in 10 months -- developed, tested, and soon will be available in the market," he added. The knowledge of drug discovery will also help to develop in several new frontiers, as they may enable to find a cure for many viral ailments that do not respond to antibiotics, Vardhan said, expressing hope that the research might have potential in treating superbugs. He compared the pandemic to a "transitory state of our civilization". "We have not seen the Spanish Flu, World War I and World War II. But we are living in a phase of a silent war," he said. The minister said India had already mastered all components of modern medicine, from antibiotics to emergency care, surgery, immunisation and vaccine, adding that the focus was now on the quality and affordability of this system, which is becoming more complex. He elaborated that India had already made strides in remote diagnostics and treatment using the latest telemedicine technology to treat people in many remote villages of the country. Speaking on yoga and ayurveda, Vardhan described them as India's "gift" to the world. "The ancient knowledge and health-management system have been using nature's cure for millennia. The time has come for modern medicine and India's traditional system to go together with an integrative approach to impact our lives and much better disease outcomes," he said. Vardhan invited knowledge and technology experts, and inventors to come to India, join hands with the country's scientists and experts, and create a great collaborative platform to heal people all round the globe, the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-will-soon-become-a-past-episode-of-21st-century-harsh-vardhan-918790.html

Khurshid, who is among the leaders considered close to the Gandhi family, also said that there are enough forums in the Congress for airing views and doing so outside the party "hurts" it, remarks that come days after senior leader Kapil Sibal and some others went public with their criticism of the party leadership. "The leadership listens to me, I am given an opportunity, they (those criticising in the media) are given an opportunity, where does this thing come from that the leadership is not listening," Khurshid told PTI in an interview. Asked about comments by Sibal and another senior leader P Chidambaram on Congress' poor showing in the Bihar election and recent bypolls, he said he cannot disagree with what they have said, but asked why does anybody have to go out and tell the media and the world that "we need to do this". "Analysis is done all the time, there is no quarrel about analysis. It will be done. The leadership, of which all these people are a part, will appropriately look at what may have gone wrong, how we could have improved, and that will happen in the normal course, we needn't talk about it in the public," said Khurshid, a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC). His remarks come days after Sibal's public criticism of the Congress leadership and his statement that the time of introspection was over and people no longer saw the party as an effective alternative. Asked about some leaders calling for having a full-time president, he said they should come forward and talk about it inside the party. "See our leader and say you don't look good without a label, the leader will take a call," Khurshid said. Hitting out at those voicing concerns that Sonia Gandhi has been interim chief for over a year, he asked who decides one year is too long for having an interim chief and asserted that if the process of electing a new president is taking time, there must be a good reason for it. "Nobody has gone away, they are all here. The only insistence is on a label, why do you insist on a label. There is no president in the Bahujan Samaj Party, there is no chairman in the Left-wing parties, only general secretaries...Every party cannot follow the same model," he said. The party has a president in Sonia Gandhi, though interim, which is not outside the Constitution, not unreasonable, and not something the party "can't survive with", Khurshid said. "We are happy, we are working with it. There is no leadership crisis, I say that with great emphasis," he asserted. The election committee is working on the election of the president which is taking time due to Covid, he said, adding that all the work and preparations are underway. Asked if everyone in the Congress is strongly behind Rahul Gandhi as their leader, Khurshid said, "I think that is apparent to anyone who is not blind, that people are fully supportive of Congress president Sonia Ji and of Mr Rahul Gandhi, who is our former president. Everybody supports them." "Those who question (the leadership), if they claim to be democrats, they should have some courtesy to include us who don't question (the leadership) and inside the party we can decide whether they are more or we are more. All our objection is about this happening outside the party," he said. On whether there are forums available in the party where leaders can articulate their concerns, Khurshid said, "Of course. How did they (those saying there is no forum to express views) become MPs. Everyone who is talking, are they not MPs. That must have been done somewhere in the party, not done on the streets." There is a reasonable amount of exchange of views in the party, said Khurshid, who was last week named as convenor of the committee on foreign affairs formed by the party. Interestingly, among those nominated in the party's committees on economic affairs, foreign affairs, and national security, were senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Veerappa Moily and Shashi Tharoor, who were part of the 23 letter-writers seeking an organisational overhaul of the Congress. On his recent assertion that if the mood of the electorate is resistant to the liberal values the party has espoused, it should be prepared for a long struggle rather than look for shortcuts, Khurshid said what he meant by shortcut was that one gives up their ideology. "Why should you give up your ideology. If your ideology is not persuading the voter to go with you, you should either shut shop, or you wait. We persuade the voter, it will take time," he said. "Why are we so worried that we have lost power and therefore we must get back into power in weeks or months or years etc. If it doesn't happen for a while, we will continue to work. Politics is about the passion for a cause, politics is not about a pre-qualification for power. We must pursue our cause and we will pursue our cause," Khurshid said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-leadership-crisis-in-congress-support-for-sonia-rahul-apparent-to-anyone-not-blind-khurshid-918554.html
22-11-2020||National Politics||Congress leader Acharya Pramod demands Priyanka Gandhi be made party president||Close on the heels of senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal's remarks that the party was no longer an ''effective opposition'', another senior leader of the Congress on Sunday demanded that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be handed over the mantle of the grand old party. Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, who had contested on the party ticket against union defence minister Rajnath Singh from Lucknow Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 LS polls, said that millions of Congress workers across the country wanted Priyanka to be the party president. ''Keeping in view the current political situation in the country, millions of Congress workers want Priyanka Gandhi to be handed over the mantle of the party so that a mass countrywide public agitation be launched against the anti-people policies of the Modi government,'' Krishnam said in a tweet. देश के वर्तमान राजनैतिक “परिदृश्य” को देखते हुए कांग्रेस के करोड़ों कार्यकर्ताओं की भावना है कि पार्टी की “कमान” प्रियंका गांधी को सौंप दी जाये, ताकि मोदी सरकार की जन विरोधी नीतियों के “ख़िलाफ़” पूरे देश में एक जन आंदोलन खड़ा किया जा सके. Krishnam, who was a well known Hindu seer and chief of the famous 'Kalki Dham' in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district, about 400 kilometres from here, had earlier also supported the Congress leaders, who had sought change in the party leadership at the central level. UP Congress leaders appeared to be guarded while responding to Krishnam's demand and sought to play it down saying that it was up to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take a decision in this regard. ''Priyankaji is already the party general secretary and UP in-charge...all we want is that only a member of the Gandhi family is made president of the party....it does not matter if it's Priyankaji or Rahulji,'' remarked a senior state Congress leader when asked to respond to Krishnam's tweet.

Chidambaram said that he is shocked by the law made by the LDF government of Kerala making a “so called offensive post” on social media punishable by “five years in prison”. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor too joined Chidambaram, saying that the Kerala government's law is in response to several cases of offensive posts abusing and threatening women, but was “so loosely drafted” that it could be used against political opponents, journalists and critics. “This law can & will be challenged in the courts, because any political attack on social media against a party or ‘class of persons’ (eg ‘Sanghis’or ‘libtards’) could attract its provisions,” said Tharoor, who is the chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology. “It must be revised to narrow its application to flagrant cases of abuse & threats only,” Tharoor said. Chidambaram also expressed shock at the attempt to implicate Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly Ramesh Chennithala in a case where the investigation agency had filed a closure report four times. On Saturday, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan signed an Ordinance that granted the state police powers to punish those guilty of spreading a derogatory or defamatory content by any means (including social media) with either three year jail term, or a fine of Rs 10,000 or both. The UPA government had amended the Information Technology Act to add Section 66-A that made posting offensive comments online a punishable crime, and later it was scrapped by the Supreme Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shocked-at-kerala-govts-tough-social-media-law-congress-remembers-friend-yechury-918631.html
22-11-2020||National Politics||Congress is at its lowest in the last 72 years: Ghulam Nabi Azad||A big fight has broken out within the Congress, with veteran party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad backing concerns about the functioning of the party flagged by Kapil Sibal and slamming the five-star culture that has gripped the organisation. Azad’s open support of Sibal laid bare the divide in the Congress even as leaders such as Ashok Gehlot, Mallikarjun Kharge and Salman Khurshid has time and again insisted that there is no leadership crisis within the party. “Polls are not won by five-star culture. Problem with leaders today is if they get a party ticket, they first book a five-star hotel. They will not go if there is a rough road. Till the time five-star culture is given up, one cannot win elections,” Azad, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha told ANI. He said that the Congress had reached its lowest point in 72 years and has not even succeeded in getting the post of the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha for two consecutive terms. Azad further added that the party’s structure had collapsed and there is an urgent need to restructure the party at every level. “We need to rebuild our structure and then if any leader is elected in that structure, it will work. But saying that just by changing the leader, we will win Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh is wrong. That will happen once we change the system,” said Azad, the former J&K Chief Minister. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, senior leaders Salman Khurshid, Mallikarjun Kharge have launched a strong defence of the leadership, chiding the “dissenters” for weakening the party from within instead of fighting the RSS-BJP ideology. Khurshid on Sunday said there is no leadership crisis within the Congress and everyone’s voice is being heard by the party leadership which enjoys all-round support. “I think that is apparent to anyone who is not blind, that people are fully supportive of Congress president Sonia ji and of Rahul Gandhi, who is our former president. Everybody supports them,” Khurshid was quoted as saying by PTI. Earlier, Gehlot had hit out at Sibal for airing his views in public, contending that the Congress has weathered many a crisis and emerged stronger. However, Azad insisted that his remarks should not be seen as a rebellion against the leadership. “There is no rebellion in the Congress party. Rebellion means replacing someone. There is no other candidate for the post of the party president. This is not a rebellion. This is for reforms,” Azad said. Azad also said that he is giving a “clean chit” to the Gandhis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “I'm giving a clean chit to Gandhis right now. They cannot do much due to Covid-19 pandemic. But there is no change in our demands. Our leadership will have to hold these (internal) elections.. be it two months from now, four-month. … Plus, there has to be a culture of accountability after loss in elections,” Azad said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-is-at-its-lowest-in-the-last-72-years-ghulam-nabi-azad-918665.html
22-11-2020||National Politics||'No formal proposal for virtual Parliament session'||In times of Covid-19 pandemic, demands for holding virtual sessions of Parliament have been abound, but top Lok Sabha Secretariat officials said it had not received a single formal proposal from any political party. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, several presiding officers believed that members should be present physically in legislatures and discuss issues threadbare. Accordingly, several state assemblies and Parliament had taken extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of lawmakers and support staff across legislatures. Birla acknowledged that several countries such as Brazil, Britain, Belgium have been holding virtual sessions of Parliament. Lok Sabha officials said that some individual members had demanded virtual sessions of Parliament, but the secretariat had not received any formal proposal from any political party for holding online sessions of both Houses of Parliament. The Budget Session and the Monsoon Session of Parliament had to be curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At least 40 parliamentarians had tested positive for Covid-19 during the monsoon session, which had to be cut short by eight days. The Winter Session of the Parliament begins usually held in the last week of November, but the third wave of the Covid-19 spread in the capital has put a question mark on the conduct of the session. Parliament sources said that the government was mulling merging the Winter Session of Parliament with the Budget Session that begins on the last day of January. A parliament functionary pointed out that several members are not keen on having virtual sessions as it would be "less lively" with speeches dominating the proceedings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-formal-proposal-for-virtual-parliament-session-918710.html

22-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi records coldest November morning in 17 years; cold wave in parts of city||Delhi's minimum temperature dropped to 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday, the lowest in the month of November since 2003, as a cold wave swept parts of the city.  The national capital had recorded a minimum of 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday, the lowest in the month in 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department. "The Safdarjung Observatory which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. It is Delhi's lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius," said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre.   The mercury dropped to 6.1 degrees Celsius at the Palam weather station, he said. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. “However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria are fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said. Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius last year, 10.5 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 7.6 degrees Celsius in 2017 in the month of November. The all-time record for the lowest minimum temperature in November is 3.9 degrees Celsius recorded on November 28, 1938. Srivastava said icy cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury. However, the minimum temperature will rise by two to three degrees Celsius in the next four to five days under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance.  The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and  radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-coldest-november-morning-in-17-years-cold-wave-in-parts-of-city-918519.html

The drive began on October 17 following orders from the Delhi government to check the dust pollution in the national capital, they said According to the Fire Department, about two lakh litres of water is being sprinkled every day by its personnel at 13 places declared as pollution hotspots by the Delhi government. The places are Jahangirpuri, Narela, Ashok Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Dwarka, Mundka, Rohini, Wazirpur, Okhla, Bawana, Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh and R K Puram. A total of 15 fire tenders have been pressed into service to sprinkle water at the identified hotspots and around 45 fire personnel have been deployed for the task, said Atul Garg, Director of Delhi Fire Service. "On an average, two lakh litres of water is sprinkled every day. It has been an ongoing drive ever since the directions were issued from the Delhi government. The exercise began on October 17 and since then our personnel have sprinkled more than 70 lakh litres of water across 13 identified hotspots to curb dust pollution," he said. The exercise is being carried out for nearly two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening every day, Garg said. Pollutions levels breached the emergency threshold twice this month in the national capital as a grey apocalyptic smog enveloped the city for days, blotting out the sun and smudging landmarks from view. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the “severe plus” or “emergency” category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours. Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot from November 4 to November 9. It had recorded seven “severe” air days in November last year. Pollution levels on Diwali this year and the day after were the maximum in the last four years. The Delhi government had on November 5 banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city till November 30. The National Green Tribunal had also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign -- “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’ -- which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai. A ''green war room'' has also been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor steps being taken to bring down pollution levels in the city this winter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-pollution-over-70-lakh-litres-water-sprinkled-at-13-hotspots-in-36-days-918547.html

According to Lady Sri Ram college Principal Suman Sharma, the college administration has announced a reduction in fee for a few courses, setting up a committee to provide laptops and allowed some second-year students to reside in hostels. "Given the fact that students are not able to avail certain facilities of the college due to being off-campus, the college has removed such charges from the fees this year. This has led to a substantial reduction in the fee. In addition, it is possible to pay the fee in installments," she said. "Keeping in mind the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, current second-year students upon fresh application and on the basis of need will be allowed to stay in the hostel after the commitments to incoming first years and the current third years, who already are in the hostel, have been met," he added. Miranda House Principal Bijaylaxmi Nanda said the college is working on facilitating internet data packs to students on whom the burden has increased due to classes moving online during the pandemic. "We realised it during the first month of lockdown only that just online classes will not be enough and equal attention will have to be paid to mental wellness. We took some steps but we will increase our efforts now and focus on one-on-one interactions," Nanda said. "We are exploring options for offering financial support to students not just in terms off fee waiver but to provide internet data cards as well to help in online classes,” she added. The staff association of the St Stephen’s college has also approached college principal, demanding setting up of a committee to reach out to students facing monetary issues. "As we are all aware, the pandemic has caused great distress in the society. There is an increased financial hardship and some of our students are facing genuine difficulties in accessing online classes and paying the fees," staff association president Nandita Narain said. "Some of the faculty members have been receiving requests from students for help with both the payment of fees and also for obtaining devices to attend the online classes. We fear that there are many more students out there who have not yet reached out," she added. According to Simrit Kaur, the principal of Shri Ram College of Commerce, the college has been receiving requests for scholarships and laptops since the lockdown. "There are a few students who had their own devices but there were a few who needed help with laptops, we have tried facilitating each student with the kind of help they needed. We are also providing round-the-clock counselling services to students so that if there is any issue it can be addressed timely," Kaur said. Aishwarya, a student of the Lady Sri Ram (LSR) College for Women and an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district on November 2. In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the 19-year-old said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses, police said. The second-year BSc Mathematics (Honours) student had returned to Telangana from Delhi in March after those staying in the hostel were asked to go home by the college authorities in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi University colleges are closed since March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and all teaching and learning activities have moved completely online since then.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/fee-support-data-cards-and-laptops-du-colleges-step-up-efforts-to-help-students-following-lsr-suicide-case-918570.html

22-11-2020||North and Central||Railways' use of bio-toilets to be case study for management students||The railways' use of bio-toilets in its coaches will now be part of management school classrooms as a case study on its development and installation has been approved by the national transporter to be used as study material, according to a document accessed by PTI. According to the document, the railways has given its nod to the Indian School of Business (ISB) to use the study by them on the IR bio-toilets as curriculum for business schools. "Based on our review of the attached case and other associated material, we hereby confirm that the Indian School of Business has the authority to use the case study and to authorize other educational institutions or organizations to use the case study. We further approve the use of our images and logos as displayed within the case," the approval letter from the railways said. Senior officials involved in the process confirmed that the use of bio-toilets, the technology developed with DRDO and the association with private entities to install them in the coaches of IR was an achievement, accomplished over a decade was ready material for management schools to learn about coordination between different departments and also a lesson in sustainability. "There are two major takeaways from the bio-toilet project. One is that it's the environment- friendly and their installation has resulted in cleaner stations and rails. The second is that due to the use of bio-toilets, the corrosion in rails has reduced and will eventually lead to extending the life of the rails. We have signed an MOU with ISB and based on that they can also take it to other management schools," said a senior official. He also said that the bio-toilet model was perfect for management schools as it highlighted the development of sustainable technology and how the national transporter has managed to go big with the concept. "We have taken this on the largest scale possible and perhaps nowhere in the world has this been used at such a large scale," the official said. The study, which will be part of the business school curriculum, mentions how in 2011 the first prototype train with bio-toilets started from Gwalior and how the project was scaled up by 2014. In less than ten years (between 2011 and 2020), 245,775 bio-toilets were installed in 68,694 coaches. Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) studied the impact of bio-toilets' fitment and found that with bio-toilets' adoption, the burden of cleaning the tracks and subsequent manual scavenging was eliminated. The study said that this, in turn, improved the respect for labor, and the alternate jobs that manual scavengers were provided improved their livelihood. This resulted in saving 5.4 million litres of water per day spent earlier on track washing at the train stations, the study said. TERI estimated that this energy-saving benefit was of the order of reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent of 155 tonnes per annum. "The bio-toilets initiative served as a source of open innovation. lt significantly expanded the markets to produce and sell bio-toilets to improve small and medium enterprises segment. The successful implementation of bio-toilets in the passenger trains demonstrated a critical message that while technical innovation is essential, its solution must be grounded in reality. That capability to carry out innovations in an evolutionary mode is -necessary to bring a change al the grass-root level. To make a fundamental social impact, considering the socio-economic factors becomes essential," the study says||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/railways-use-of-bio-toilets-to-be-case-study-for-management-students-918576.html

"As far as Majlis party (AIMIM) is concerned, BJP is very clear (in its stand). There is no relation between the Majlis party and Muslims. Muslims brothers are different and the Majlis party is different. The Majlis Party harasses thousands of Muslims in Hyderabad. It encroached properties of thousands of Muslims using mafia gangs and settlements," Reddy told reporters in "meet the press". He further alleged that BJP sees MIM as a political party which inherited the ideology of Razakars-private militia organised by Qasim Razvi during the rule of Nizam and supported terror activities by extending financial and legal aid to some of them. He said if BJP was voted to power in the GHMC polls, the city will witness overall development across all areas. Slamming the TRS for 'failing' to keep its poll promises such as "two-bedroom houses" for the weaker sections, the Minister of State for Home asked people to demand the ruling party candidates to show them their houses. Reddy also claimed that the L&T Metro rail cost was overrun by Rs 3500 crore due to delays caused by the K Chandrashekhar Rao's government. Works of the metro rail began much before Rao took over as CM of the state. Blaming the "poor conditions of civic infrastructure" in the city, Reddy said about six lakh houses were inundated and 15 lakh people were affected during the heavy rains that lashed out the city last month. GHMC polls are scheduled to be held on December 1 and the counting will take place on December 4.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/muslims-and-aimim-party-not-related-g-kishan-reddy-918586.html

"This purifier may not solve the problem of pollution completely but as someone born and brought up in this city, I cannot just sit at home and let things worsen. "Allowing people to breathe clean air should be the top priority of the government, but the chief minister and his colleagues are not concerned (about it)," he said. The air purifiers are approximately 12 feet in height and cover an area of 1,000 sq metre. These fully automatic machines deliver two-lakh cubic metre of clean air daily and the schedule for these machines can be pre-determined, said a statement from Gambhir's office. The BJP MP has a vision to install giant air purifiers in all major crowded markets in his constituency, it said. In January this year, Gambhir inaugurated the first giant air purifier in the heart of Lajpat Nagar's Central Market as a pilot project. "The air purifier at Krishna Nagar market that witnesses tremendous activity and high footfall will be highly benefited with the air purifier. In terms of technology, the new purifiers are more advanced and have additional features like high mast lights," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/gautam-gambhir-inaugurates-giant-air-purifier-in-east-delhis-krishna-nagar-market-918595.html

All the four terrorists were killed in a gunfight when a Kashmir-bound truck, in which they were travelling, was stopped for checking at Ban toll plaza on Jammu-Srinagar national highway on Thursday. A huge cache of arms and ammunition including 11 AK assault rifles, three pistols, 29 grenades and six UBGL grenades were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists, who, according to police, had come to execute a “big plan” to disrupt District Development Council polls, slated to be held in eight phases beginning November 28. Based on the material recovered from the slain terrorists, it was suspected that the terrorists infiltrated into this side from Pakistan through an underground tunnel in Samba district, the officials said. They said a massive anti-tunnelling operation is being carried out by the BSF since Friday and the presence of a tunnel is suspected near Regal village in Samba district.

In the purported conversation over the phone, Rajasthan Sports Minister Ashok Chandna is allegedly heard using a casteist slur against Congress worker Raju Gurjar over the ticket for the panchayat polls in Bundi district and dared him to contest the elections. The casteist slur has been made at the end of the conversation. Chandna could not be reached for comments while the opposition BJP has demanded an inquiry into the issue. “An inquiry into the matter should be ordered and if it is the voice of the minister, he should be sacked,” BJP spokesperson Ramlal Sharma said.

I texted the minister seeking an update on it but he lost his cool. He called back and threatened me,” Gurjar alleged. Gurjar is now contesting the elections as an Independent candidate. The polling in Nainwa will take place on November 27.

Three months ago, Shadab Khan, a journalist, had filed a complaint with the police that his dog, Coco, was missing.  According to Hoshangabad police, the dog was answering to both the names, Coco and Tiger, and was friendly with both the parties.  “As neither of them was willing to budge for two days, we decided to perform the DNA test. Shadab Khan said the parent of the dog was in Panchmarhi while Shivhare said the parent of his dog was in Itarsi,” said the police officer. Police teams were dispatched to both the places and blood samples of the dog's parents were collected through the district veterinary doctor and the cops let Shivhare keep the dog.  “I have submitted all the documents including a vaccination card to the police to prove my ownership and I insisted on a DNA test,” Shivhare said, alleging that Khan took the dog without his permission. Meanwhile, Swati Gaurav Bhadoriya of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said, “The dog fell ill because the police didn’t take care of him. He is suffering from a high fever. We want an FIR to be registered against the police and the person who made the false ownership claim under the sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.”  The police denied the claim. “We are dealing with the case sensitively to ensure the dog gets its rightful owner,” Hoshangabad superintendent of police Santosh Singh Gaur said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-police-to-conduct-dna-test-to-determine-dogs-owner-report-918648.html

A review meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier this month had decided to double RT-PCR tests and conducting survey in containment zones among others. "For the first time, the number of RT-PCR tests in Delhi have exceeded the rapid antigen tests," a spokesperson of the Home Ministry said. The spokesperson also said 250 ventilators have been delivered to the DRDO hospital and are being installed. The house-to-house survey in containment zones in Delhi is progressing with the spokesperson saying that 3,70,729 persons have been surveyed November 20. Keeping mind the shortage of health professionals, the spokesperson also said that AIIMS has started the process for recruitment of additional 207 Junior Residents. The capital has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases since October 20 with the Delhi government officials attributing it to the festival season and laxity in adhering to norms like ensuring social distancing and wearing masks during a similar review meeting on November 2 chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla. Keeping in mind the surging cases, Delhi government also restricted the number of guests at weddings to 50 from 200 while increasing the fine for not wearing masks from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-delhi-reports-more-rt-pcr-tests-than-rapid-antigen-tests-for-the-first-time-918673.html
22-11-2020||North and Central||Article 370 not there now, it will never be: Shahnawaz Hussain||The BJP Sunday said Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was “buried” by Parliament following proper procedures of law, and expressed hope that it will not be restored by the Supreme Court. Several mainstream parties from Jammu and Kashmir have challenged in the Supreme Court the Centre's August 5, 2019 decision to withdraw Article 370 and also divide the state into two union territories. “I do not want to discuss anything on the SC (Supreme Court), the judiciary. But, (Article) 370 is gone. The 'Gupkar gang' is sure it (Article 370) will be restored, but I am also sure it will not be restored. The way they are making a claim, I too am. We have abrogated it according to proper procedures and both the houses of the Parliament have passed it. Parliament frames laws and it (Art 370) has been abrogated,” BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain told PTI. He was recently appointed the BJPs in-charge for the elections in Kashmir. The special status of the erstwhile state was abrogated at the highest temple of democracy and the law was repealed by the “makers of Constitution”, he said, referring to the Parliament. “The BJP has done nothing. It is the Parliament which has done it...Was it done at the BJP's Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg office? It was abrogated at the highest temple of democracy. The makers of the Constitution abrogated it,” he said. Asked about the challenge ín Supreme Court, the BJP leader said, “When some decision is taken, we will see it. But as of now, it (Article 370) has been buried in a grave”. Hussain said no power in the world, including the United Nations, can restore the special status of J&K. “Article 370 is gone and even the UN, the whole world, does not have the courage (to restore it). Pakistan pleaded before Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Countries, but has anyone said anything?... Article 370 is not there now and it will never be. It is gone forever,” he asserted. Asked how was the party sure that Article 370 will not be restored when the case was sub-judice and the Supreme Court was still hearing the matter, the BJP national spokesperson said every issue is being taken to the court nowadays. “The Article has been revoked. If it is sub-judice, does it mean Article 370 is there? It is not. Every issue is taken to court...If the court has granted a stay, then it is a different issue, but there is no stay from anywhere. “If (PDP president) Mehbooba Mufti is saying they will get it back, then let them hold on to their belief, I will hold on to mine,” he said. Hussain said the government and the Attorney General of the country will respond to the issue in the court. Referring to the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) polls in J-K, the BJP leader said the whole election is about development. “We are pro-development and we will undertake development in J-K. It is a question of our credibility. The Prime Minister loves J-K and this whole election is on development. We want to live in the hearts of the people of Kashmir. “We want the youth who have gone astray and picked up guns to hold pens in their hands. We will respect the aspirations of the people of J-K and we will win Kashmir through love,” he said. Asked about the concerns raised by political parties about their candidates not being able to campaign, the former Union minister said the administration must take care of their security. “When elections took place in Punjab after terrorism, the candidates were taken in police protection. If they go separately, they will become the target of the terrorists. So, Mehbooba's allegations are wrong. BJP candidates are being given the same treatment as those of the Gupkar gang. “The BJP candidates are also complaining about the same thing. It is the responsibility of the administration to protect their lives,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/article-370-not-there-now-it-will-never-be-shahnawaz-hussain-918683.html

On the occasion, Adityanath said, "Stray cows should be kept in cow shelters and then should be distributed among farmers. Every farmer rearing a stray cow should get Rs 900 per month per cow.” The UP chief minister also handed over cows to 11 families and said, "When the children of these families will get milk, their malnourishment will be eradicated. When the children are healthy, the future of the country and society is bright." In a statement, the UP government said, “In what could arguably be the most unique scheme in the country, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath chose the occasion of Gopashtami to hand over cows to 11 families who have malnourished children. It will serve the dual purpose of preserving cows as well as providing nourishment to under-nourished children." Designated as the Sahbhagita Yojana, the UP government is giving Rs 900 every month to the person taking care of cows. As many as 66,257 cows have been given under the scheme, of which 1,071 were distributed among 1,069 families with malnourished children. "The scheme is part of the process of brightening the future of society as well as the nation. We have made an arrangement that all destitute cows will be brought to cow shelters and if any farmer is willing to keep them, he will be given Rs 900 per month as maintenance charges," Adityanath said.

An office-bearer of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the ruling BJP, has claimed the kissing scenes were filmed in a temple in MP's Maheshwar town and submitted a complaint to the Rewa superintendent of police. "The series 'A Suitable Boy' was released on an OTT media platform. Kissing scenes were filmed inside a temple with bhajans being sung in the background. I consider it objectionable. I think this hurt feelings," Mishra, the state's Home minister, said in a video statement on Sunday. "I have directed police to examine the series and determine what action can be taken against the producer and director of this series.," the minister added. Meanwhile, BJYM national secretary Gaurav Tiwari told PTI that he had submitted a memorandum to Rewa SP Rakesh Kumar Singh on Saturday demanding an apology from Netflix and makers of the series and removal of "objectionable scenes". "Parts of the series were filmed in Maheshwar town in Madhya Pradesh. The kissing scene inside the temple has hurt our sentiments," Tiwari claimed. Talking to reporters, Rewa SP said that further action will be taken after footage of the objectionable scenes are received from Netflix. "I have received a memorandum from Gaurav Tiwari, in which it is said that objectionable scenes in the series were shot in a religious place. Legal action will be initiated after examination," he said.

22-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh govt planning 'gaumata' cess for welfare of cows: CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is planning to levy a cess to raise money for the welfare of the cow, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Sunday. Addressing a public meeting in Agar Malwa, Chouhan invoked "Indian culture" while speaking about the "gaumata" tax. "I am thinking of imposing some minor tax to raise money for the welfare of the 'gaumata' (cow) welfare and for the upkeep of cow sheds....Is it alright?" the BJP leader asked while the people replied in the affirmative. "...We used to feed the first 'roti' (baked in households) to cows. Similarly, we used to feed the last roti to dogs. Such was the concern for animals in our Indian culture which is vanishing now, so we are thinking to collect some small tax from the public for the sake of cows," Chouhan said. He said a law will be enacted to run cowsheds in the state. "The society should also help the government in protecting cows. Earlier, agricultural farming was impossible without cows, but tractors have replaced such farming," the CM added. He lamented that people abandon cows once they are past the prime and stop giving milk. "Lakhs of cows are wandering on streets. They will get a shelter in sanctuaries," the CM said. In an apparent reference to anganwadi centres, he said a decision has been taken to provide cow's milk, which is like "amrit" (nectar), instead of eggs to children. "This move will help cow-keepers and cowsheds to flourish," Chouhan said. The CM further said cow dung has many applications and can also help in protecting the environment. "Use of 'gaukasht' (cylindrical pieces made from cow dung) attracts a good rainfall. Make it a point to use cow dung and 'gaukasht' to perform last rites," the CM appealed. He said 'gaukashts' also save wood and thus environment, and its usage should be promoted in burning 'holikas' during Holi festival. "We have to save the environment. Urea and DAP fertilisers are like a slow poison. The earth is troubled by their usage," he said. The chief minister further said cow dung manure acts like nectar for the earth. "If chemical fertilisers are used for a long time, the land won't produce a wheat harvest," he added. The chief minister said medicine made from cow urine can heal many ailments. "Angrezi (allopathic) medicines bring in more diseases. Many such medicines are being made in cow sanctuaries," Chouhan told the gathering. "...Don't think that cows are redundant. If cows are saved, then the earth will sustain itself. Keep this in mind," he added. Earlier in the day, the CM chaired the first meeting of the newly-formed 'gau cabinet' (cow cabinet) through virtual mode, during which it was decided to boost the cow- based economy and to set up a research centre for it in Agar Malwa district. Chouhan also wished participants on the occasion of 'Gopashtami', a festival dedicated to Lord Krishna and cows, his aide said. The chief minister underlined the need for promoting milk instead of eggs to help improve the health of the extremely malnourished children. It was decided, among other things, to promote use of cow dung and urine for the well-being of society. After the meeting, Chouhan flew to 'Kaamdhenu Gau Abhyaranya', a cow sanctuary spread over 472 hectares at Salariya village in Agar Malwa district. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had laid the foundation stone of this sanctuary in 2012. Chouhan started his day's work by worshipping cows at his residence in Bhopal. He later worshipped eleven cows at the sanctuary and interacted with experts in the field, officials said. Chouhan had on Wednesday announced the setting up of a separate "cabinet" for the protection and promotion of the cow. Ministers of Animal Husbandry, Forest, Panchayat and Rural Development, Revenue, Home and Farmers' Welfare departments will be part of this cabinet, said to be the first such body in the country, he had informed. According to official sources, ministers from the six departments were part of the meeting held on Sunday. The cow cabinet meeting was earlier scheduled to be held in the sanctuary at Agar Malwa, but the plan was dropped in view of the Covid-19 situation in the state, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-govt-planning-gaumata-cess-for-welfare-of-cows-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-918697.html

22-11-2020||Opinion||Now, now, Vikram, who is the most delicate of them all?||The Raghuvamsha has a memorable passage: King Dilipa hands over the throne to his young son and retires to the forest with the queen because, Kalidasa tells us, “This is the family tradition of the Ikshvaku kings.” Granted, in a democratic republic, officials no longer hand over charge to their own children (or so it is supposed to be), but usually to someone their own age, and more often than not, to someone equally attached to power. But we live in unprecedented times when incumbents blatantly refuse to concede elections and instead take to ranting on Twitter. But let us forget that for a moment and turn to a handy tale from the Vikram-Betal collection. We all know the story of the Princess and the Pea, in which an innocent pea tucked beneath the cushions causes a delicate princess a night of sleeplessness and bruises on the back. Well, wait till you hear the story of King Dharmadhvaja’s queens. Vikram carried Betal over his shoulders, and Betal, who liked his entertainment, much as we all do, launched into a story. King Dharmadhvaja had three beautiful queens: Indulekha, Taravali, and Mrigankavati. Once, the king was sitting by the side of his first queen, Indulekha, when a blue lotus that she had tucked behind her ear fell on her thighs. Indulekha was so sensitive that she fainted from pain! The royal physicians had to be summoned to bandage the wound that the lotus caused and treat her with every royal ointment they had. The king was distraught, so of course he sought the company of Taravali to console him. He went on the terrace with her and retired by her side. It was a cool night, and the breeze blew Taravali’s veil aside, exposing her delicate self to the rays of the moon. She immediately woke up from the pain. We’ve all had a bad case of sunburn some time, but Taravali holds the unique distinction of having experienced ‘moonburn’. The cool rays of the moon (a cliché in Sanskrit) were enough to give her blisters! Her attendants had to treat her with delicate sandal paste and a soft bed of lotus leaves. Then the third queen, Mrigankavati, concerned for the king’s emotional state, set out to meet him. It was a quiet night, and very unwisely, she was out in the open air. Unwise, because she distinctly heard the sound of a pestle pounding some rice in a distant house. Unable to walk, she sat down, shaking in pain. Her attendants had to take her back to her bed, where examination showed that her own hands were covered in bruises, just from hearing someone else’s hands pound the grain with the pestle. The first queen was wounded by a lotus, the second was burned by the rays of the moon, and the third was bruised by the sound of a pestle. Here, Betal paused to ask Vikram, “Which of the three queens was the most sensitive, and why?” Vikram answered, “Mrigankavati was the most delicate. The other two queens experienced the contact of the lotus and the moon rays respectively, but she was bruised without even touching the pestle.” We have to take leave of the king and Betal here, but don’t you think Betal could have given Vikram a few additional options? After all, we can tell Vikram of a man more sensitive than all these three mythical queens, whose tweets are evidence that he was wounded, burned, and bruised, all at the same time — to the point of derangement — simply on hearing the news of election results on television!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/now-now-vikram-who-is-the-most-delicate-of-them-all-918467.html
22-11-2020||Opinion||Electoral Bonds: Scourge of Democracy||Sir Sean Connery, who made James Bond -- the arch nemesis of Ian Fleming’s villainous characters hankering for world power -- a household name, died peacefully in his sleep last month. Far away, in India, another “Bond” has taken birth already and has become the scourge not of Dr Evil but of our electoral democracy. The name’s “bond”, “electoral bond” (EB): sold through State Bank of India (SBI) to any buyer, four times a year, for donating any amount of money to a political party without revealing the amount or the donor’s identity to the people of India. Initial fears that EBs are a way for rich individuals and corporates to channel large amounts of money to political parties, especially the ruling party, are being proven true. Data supplied by SBI to veteran RTI activist Commodore (retd) Lokesh Batra shows that of the more than Rs 282 crore worth of EBs sold during the 14th season, just before Bihar went to polls, the single EB of Rs 1,000 denomination that was sold remained unclaimed by the political party that received it. Who cares for a Rs 1,000 donation when there are EBs of Rs 1 crore and more that form the bulk of the donations! The small change goes into the PM’s National Relief Fund. The “little man” need only press the EVM button once in five years; he can keep his money. Electoral politics has truly become the business of the rich and the powerful. Touted by the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2017 as a ‘reform’ measure to make political party funding more ‘transparent’ than before, EBs were actually meant to do just the opposite. Ironically, nothing in the EB Scheme or the three laws amended to float it -- namely the Reserve Bank of India Act, the Income Tax Act, and the Representation of the People Act (RPA) -- actually requires the SBI to keep the identity of the donor and the recipient party secret. In fact, political parties are mentioning the quantum of donations received in the form of EBs in their annual audited statement of accounts to the Election Commission of India (ECI). The only thing no one is telling the people of India is, who is giving these hundreds of crores to the political parties, especially the BJP, the ruling party and the biggest beneficiary by far? Keeping the identity of EB donors secret is legitimised by other laws governing the business of banks. Under these laws, SBI holds the KYC details of donors in confidence. Of course, the government can access it as and when required under the pretext of law enforcement. While there is a strong case for maintaining the confidentiality of dealings between customers and their banks, the sale and redemption of EBs are not banking transactions but transactions between donors and political parties. SBI is only a facilitator, forced into that role by the government. Ironically, the RPA continues to require disclosure of the identity of donors who give Rs 20,000 or more to political parties in cash, or by way of bank draft or electronic transfer. Political parties are duty-bound to declare their names, bank account details and PAN numbers to the ECI every year. The ECI publishes them on its website. In all these conventional modes of donating, too, SBI and other banks play a role, but the excuse of banking secrecy is not used to hide donor identity. But when money is channelled to political parties via electoral bonds – which is as good as cash – the details of who is giving and who is taking suddenly becomes a sarkari secret! A fourth law, namely the Companies Act, was also amended in 2017 to remove the 7.5% cap imposed on corporates on donating their profits to political parties. They are also no longer required to inform even their own Boards or shareholders which political party they threw the company’s money at. EBs can be used to deliver it in a “sealed cover” as it were! After analysing donations data that the ECI displayed on its website last year, this author showed how opaque EBs have edged out transparent modes of political funding. Many a watcher of political financing has rightly said, electoral bonds are a fraud perpetrated on the people of India. Nevertheless, RTI activists are doing what they know best -- demanding information about the sale and redemption of EBs every season. Cases relating to SBI’s denial of such information are coming up for hearing one by one. Will the CIC bond with the best, i.e., transparency, or side with the worst, namely, opacity? That remains to be seen.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/electoral-bonds-scourge-of-democracy-918468.html
22-11-2020||Opinion||In defence of reality||I don’t know if reality is stranger than fiction, but reality sure is confused with fiction in many parts of the world. In America, the epitome of political spoof, President Donald Trump, has been running the proof-less ‘election fraud’ buggy for weeks now. In India, many people seem convinced that there is a ‘global conspiracy’ by Muslim men to lure and convert millions of Hindu girls to Islam. Elsewhere, folks believe that Covid-19 is just part of an elaborate plan to implant microchips in people, with Bill Gates spearheading the whole operation. Global political discourse is now filled with a long and ever-expanding menu of lies. But why do lies spread so quickly? Most people would want to point fingers at social media: In order to increase audience engagement, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms run sneaky algorithms that study people’s biases and then feed them with ‘news’ that confirms those biases – whether true or false. But this still doesn’t explain why so many people are so quick to believe fantastical stories, or why they refuse to open their mind to fact-checking. I’ve had countless exhausting conversations, both online and offline, with people who refuse to believe intelligence reports, scientific journals and even video footage that dispel their beliefs. There are people who refuse to read a certain newspaper because it doesn’t confirm their biases. There was one person who refused to read a book that would have busted many of his false beliefs because it was “too time-consuming.” The problem is not with the internet; it’s with what the modern human being has become – impatient, with short attention span, and an unquenchable thirst for drama. Let’s face it: reality is boring. It’s nuanced, complicated, and comes with multiple sides to every coin. It’s simply not as satisfying as bite-sized conspiracy theories. We want to believe that there are aliens locked up in the American desert, that Nehru secretly owed allegiance to the British, or that Virat Kohli only opposed Diwali crackers because he wants to ‘destroy Hinduism’. During my time both in the policy consulting world and the international media space, I have been made painfully aware of all this. If you don’t engage people’s attention with something spicy, they will not listen to you. Memos and presentations must be colourful and graphic, articles should be shorter and more dramatic, and videos about news events can’t be too long. At some point, everybody in the media has had to sacrifice at least some nuance in their productive output, so as to not ‘bore’ the audience – even if one needs a few more minutes or many more words to tell the whole story. What’s worse is that many people have made short attention spans a virtue, as if the public somehow doesn’t owe it to its own interest to be better informed, rather than acting on a bunch of sensational lies! Writers are often panned for being “too boring,” regardless of the comprehensiveness of their work. The problem with this drama-obsessed approach to public affairs and politics is that it hurts society in very real ways. Information is a public good; what you believe – and how you act on it – matters to everybody else, because democracy is ultimately a contract among voters to take enlightened decisions that would uplift everybody, not just oneself. Being an informed citizen is, therefore, not just courtesy; it’s an essential duty. So, the next time you come across a long article or a heavy book, don’t pass on it because you “don’t have time”. Be a good citizen – give it a read.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-defence-of-reality-918470.html
22-11-2020||Opinion||A magisterial effort at reconstruction||The rise of the Christian Right sits along with the corporate stranglehold over the American polity, the deep-rooted fetish for consumerism, and an open racism as a phenomenon that makes it tough to imagine America as a liberal society in recent years. Remarks that Trumpism was still going strong even when Trump had lost the presidential election are the latest acknowledgement of how worse the state of affairs has become. Led by the desire to avoid religious strife, the American political seriousness about separating religion and the State had also meant an exclusion of theological reasoning from its mainstream intellectual life. The Church-State separation could have enabled a milieu for the flourishing of religious conversations in public, but the power and attractions of secular intellectual culture saw an indifference, if not active hostility, among the universities, media and other public institutions towards it. Amidst this scenario, though, a small number of American writers and thinkers have offered theological responses to their country’s predicament. In mulling over the work of reconstructing their liberal tradition, poet and agriculturist Wendell Berry and the philosophers Cornel West and Michael Sandel, among others, represent noble efforts to engage religious thinking as a vision of humanity, as a source of moral appeal in contemporary times. What are We Doing Here? (Virago, 2018), a recent book of collected lectures by the distinguished American novelist Marilynne Robinson extends this minority intellectual tradition in scintillating ways. Observing that “We have surrendered thought to ideology,” she bemoans the hesitation to think in terms of “wisdom, courage, generosity, personal dignity,” – both by the Right that wants to be readily “excused from these ideals, standards that have been historically invoked in order to mitigate the uglier impulses, greed prominent among them,” and by the Left “which cannot account for these civic virtues in theoretical or ideological terms and feels awkward about speaking about them in religious terms.” While American society is now commonly seen as polarised, Robinson observes, the false assumptions that unite the factions in consensus also need to be recognised. For instance, both the Right and Left ideologues are content to see their country as having been capitalist from its founding moments, with a value system that worshipped the self-interest-seeking human. Her lectures go on to reveal this historical picture of American culture to be a hopeless distortion. America, she affirms, “needs to recover the memory of the best it has done, and then try to do it all the better.” Robinson’s discussion is anchored in her belief in Christian, more precisely, Calvinist faith. To read her is to encounter the rich legacy of Christian thought on faith, love, hope, soul, among others, being freshly brought to bear on the contemporary world. Arguing that “the religious conservatives who believe that the redeemed need not take their sins, or the sins of the redeemed in general or their allies, too seriously, had a faulty definition of sin,” she states: “In the great majority of cases, a sin is injury done to another person, other people, whom, we must assume, God loves at least as much as loves us.” And, her anchor in her faith is without self-aggrandisement or intimidation towards people of other faiths. Indeed, Robinson seems to show the exit door to the notorious Christian image of a heathen or pagan. If we accept “the ancient institution that creation has some profound business with us,” she remarks, “many things follow, one of them being the presumption of the validity of categories of human experience, for example, beauty, meaning, good, and evil. Another being the essential, irreducible interest and value of the human person and of human life. There is no baseline reality against which human reality can be called less real, however radically unlike they are, and because they are radically unlike.” A heartfelt effort to get Americans to reconsider their encrusted images of themselves, Robinson’s book also passionately asks everyone everywhere to look inside the depths of their faiths and see the world anew.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-magisterial-effort-at-reconstruction-918471.html
22-11-2020||Opinion||High inflation in times of Covid-19 will hit us hard||In October 2020, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), stood at 7.61%. This is the highest inflation level since March 2014, when it was at 7.63%. Let’s look at this issue in all its dimensions. 1) A major reason for high inflation has been high food inflation, which was at 11.07% in October. Food forms around 39% of the weight of the CPI. Within food, prices of egg, fish and meat, oils and fats, vegetables, pulses and spices, went up by more than 10%. Interestingly, potato prices have risen 104.56% higher since last October. This is the highest inflation among all the items that are a part of the CPI. One reason offered for this is a disruption in supply chains. But the economy has now more or less fully opened up, meaning disruption can’t continue to be a valid reason. Interestingly, food inflation has been on the higher side since October last year, much before Covid-19 broke out. 2) The high inflation is not just because of high food inflation. If we look at core inflation, which leaves out food items and fuel and light items, the inflation is at 5.64%, the highest in 30 months. A major reason for this has been an increase in transport costs, which went up by 11.16% in October. Fares of buses, taxies, autorickshaws and rickshaws have gone up. And the reason for that is that petrol and diesel are now more expensive, primarily because of the government increasing excise duty on them. This, despite the fact that oil prices have fallen internationally. The government’s dependence on fuel taxes has only gone up this year and that is reflecting in higher inflation. Petrol and diesel used for vehicles come under the transport and communication category of the CPI, and not the fuel category. 3) Another reason for high core inflation is the higher inflation in the paan, intoxicants and tobacco segment. Interestingly, foreign liquor and beer cost 22.32% and 25.32% more this year than last year. This reflects the state governments’ increasing the tax on these products to shore up revenues. Toddy prices have also risen 20.19%. Also, the personal care and effects segment saw inflation of 12.07% in October. The cost of going to a barber/beautician went up by 7.04%. But the major increase here has been in the prices of gold, silver and other ornaments, which went up by 33.77%, 36.66% and 20.52%, respectively. For some reason, they are categorised under personal care and effects. 4) While inflation in the health category has been lower this year than the last year, in October it went up by 5.22%, the highest it has been this year. 5) Within the fuel category, the price of domestic cooking gas went up by 10.16% in October, while non-PDS kerosene was up 8.28%. 6) The high inflation is primarily in the areas of food, parts of fuel, communication and, to some extent, health. These are areas that impact the common man. How do higher prices of gold, silver and other ornaments impact the common man? They play a very important role in Indian weddings. All in all, high inflation has hit India at a time when the country has just gone through its first-ever recession since Independence. The Indian economy contracted by 23.9% during April to June. It is expected to contract between July and September as well. In fact, as Nikhil Gupta and Yaswi Agarwal of Motilal Oswal point out in a recent research note: “The rise in the core inflation in India is also the highest among the 21 major economies in the world.” This is very worrying. 7) High inflation has hit us at a time when an economic contraction has led to a fall in incomes. Over and above this, people are also saving more, to be ready for a rainy day. The total amount of bank savings increased by Rs 6.32 lakh crore between March 27 and October 23. Last year, during a similar period, the deposits had gone up by Rs 3.29 lakh crore. The psychology of a recession is fully in place. What does this mean? A good segment of the population has been cutting down on consumption, particularly non-essential consumption, thanks to lower incomes. A high rate of inflation, if it prevails, will only add to that, making the job of the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), even more difficult. 8) While deposits with banks have soared, the total amount of credit given by banks has actually contracted by a little over Rs 32,000 crore between March 27 and October 23. On the whole, in effect, banks haven’t given a single rupee of a new loan since Covid-19 struck. This has led to the RBI cutting the repo rate, the rate at which it lends to banks. Along with this, the central bank has printed and pumped a lot of money into the financial system, in the hope of driving down interest rates, in order to get both companies and individuals to borrow and spend more money. That clearly hasn’t happened because of the lack of certainty of economic future. But all the money flooding around in the financial system has led to lower deposit rates, making the lives of senior citizens difficult, who have no option but to cut down on their consumption. Even those who use fixed deposits to save for the future are caught up in a jam. In this environment, if inflation continues to remain stubbornly high, as it has through much of this year, neither will the government be able to get consumption going, nor will the RBI be able to continue cutting the interest rate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/high-inflation-in-times-of-covid-19-will-hit-us-hard-918475.html

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said parts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal regions would witness rainfall at most places. Some areas might experience heavy to very heavy showers, while extremely heavy rains is a possibility at isolated places. IIt said that the south-west and adjoining south-east Bay of Bengal has become a well-marked low-pressure area. It persists over the same region, adding that the low pressure is very likely to concentrate into a depression over the south-west Bay of Bengal during the next 24 hours and intensify further into a cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours. “It is very likely to move north-westwards and cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around 25 November 2020 noon/afternoon,” the IMD said. The cyclonic storm, if it develops into one, will be known as Cyclone Nivar and the first in the region this year. Independent weather blogger Pradeep John forecast two scenarios wherein a weak cyclone makes its landfall in the Cauvery Delta region, while in the case of a strong cyclone, the landfall area will be between Karaikal to Chennai. “In the first scenario of a weak cyclone, the landfall will be between Vedaranyam and Karaikal with wind speed going up to 70 km per hour. This will bring widespread heavy rains from Delta to Chennai and extreme rains to Delta,” John said. In the second scenario of landfall between Karaikal and Chennai, the wind speed may go up to 120 to 140 km per hour. This will ensure northern Tamil Nadu districts, including Chennai, get very heavy rains. Tamil Nadu experienced its last Cyclone in 2018 when Cyclone Gaja left a trail of destruction across the Cauvery Delta region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-likely-to-hit-tamil-nadu-puducherry-on-november-25-918593.html

22-11-2020||South||What does the alliance with BJP mean for AIADMK in Assembly polls?||With Amit Shah by their side, O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami taking turns to declare that the AIADMK's alliance with BJP will continue shows that the Dravidian outfit was under compulsion to tie-up with the saffron party for the Assembly elections due next year. The way the alliance was announced on November 21 speaks volumes about the vulnerability of the AIADMK to the BJP's pressure – a government event in which Shah, the Union Home Minister participated, was exploited to affirm the alliance stitched together in 2019. The rainbow alliance failed to make any gains by losing 38 of the 39 Lok Sabha seats it contested to the DMK combine. The alliance will once again take on a resurgent DMK, which is leaving no stone unturned to make a strong comeback after 10 long years. After the declaration, Chief Minister Palaniswami and his deputy Panneerselvam rushed to a luxurious hotel where Shah stayed for the night and were closeted with him for nearly an hour. The red-carpet that the AIADMK rolled out for Shah with the CM, his deputy, and six ministers lining up to receive him at the tarmac was not lost on the eyes of the party cadre and public at large. The scenes that unfolded on Saturday are extrinsic to Tamil Nadu's political culture where regional leaders have always wielded tremendous influence and immense respect from national players. It was more so in the case of late AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke protocol to drive to her palatial Poes Garden residence for a luncheon in 2015. The “unusual” meeting then came just a year after Jayalalithaa turned the 2014 Lok Sabha elections into a 'Lady versus Modi' fight and asking people to ensure that the BJP candidates forfeit their deposit amounts. Just six years down the line, the AIADMK under OPS-EPS looks helpless vis-a-vis BJP, which has walked the extra mile to save the government after Jayalalithaa's demise in 2016. Many ministers of the current government face potential cases and corruption charges, while the AIADMK is also facing anti-incumbency after being in power for a decade. R Kannan, biographer of C N Annadurai and M G Ramachandran, believes that the current AIADMK leadership neither had a choice nor they seemed worried about the party's future. “I do not think this leadership of the AIADMK is thinking long-term and it is clear that their aspirations are short term. But they did not have a choice either. Their government owes its existence to the BJP and the current leadership is just eager to complete the current term and get maximum support from the BJP,” he told DH. The BJP, which does not have much of a base in the state, wants to grow at the cost of its ally much like it did in states like Maharashtra and Bihar, but such a scenario looks nearly impossible in Tamil Nadu any time soon. AIADMK, though on a decline since 2016, commands an “uncompromising and strong cadre” base meticulously cultivated by M G Ramachandran and nurtured by Jayalalithaa. Sasikala, a long-time aide of Jayalalithaa, playing a role in strengthening the party, not immediately, but at a later stage cannot be completely ruled out, political analysts said. However, the BJP is using the AIADMK's disadvantageous position to send an unequivocal message that it will be at the driver's seat despite being a junior partner in Tamil Nadu. It is no secret that the BJP wants to emerge as the prime challenger to both Dravidian majors DMK and AIADMK and is working towards its plans, though such a feat is not possible overnight. Despite all the grandstanding for the past few weeks, the AIADMK made the announcement at a time when leaders of the Tamil Nadu unit of BJP are openly talking of a coalition government in the state after the assembly elections. The two parties were involved in a tug of war over BJP's 'Vetrivel Yatra' for which the AIADMK Government refused permission. The analysts said that the “tough time” for AIADMK has begun as the BJP will now try to dominate the political scene and indulge in tough negotiations during sharing of seats. “In the alliance, AIADMK may face multiple challenges within and outside the party at the grass-roots. As the state election is so crucial for both, balancing each other would be a tough task, though they have been in an alliance earlier. More than this, AIADMK will be held answerable for all the policies of the Centre like Hindi imposition. And of course BJP will go for a hard bargain.,” political analyst P Ramajayam said. Prof Ramu Manivannan, Head of the Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Madras, said that the way the alliance was announced itself shows the change in dynamics. “It is a known fact that the AIADMK is under compulsion and they have survived so long only because they have pleased the BJP. This is probably the first time that the alliance is announced first and leaders going for a discussion. The AIADMK leadership very well knows an alliance with BJP will be detrimental for the party in the long run but it cannot raise its voice,” he told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/what-does-the-alliance-with-bjp-mean-for-aiadmk-in-assembly-polls-918638.html

Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao directed officials to take all the preventive measures needed as some states are seeing a rise in number of infections, an official release said on Sunday. Rao who held a review meeting with senior officials said all the required steps would be taken to withstand even emergence of a second wave of the Covid-19 in the state. He suggested people be cautious and observe self-protection guidelines. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) accounted for the most number of cases with 152, followed by Medchal Malkajgiri 78 and Rangareddy 71, a government bulletin said providing details as of 8 pm on November 21. As many as 11,643 patients are under treatment and 41,646 samples were tested on November 21. Cumulatively, nearly 51.34 lakh samples have been tested. The samples tested per million population was over 1.38 lakh, the bulletin said.  The case fatality rate in the state was 0.54 per cent, while it was 1.5 per cent at the national level. The recovery rate in Telangana was 94.03 per cent, while it was 93.7 per cent in the country. "Situation is returning to normalcy in the state. Covid- 19 cases are on the decrease in Telangana State. Despite an increase in the number of tests conducted, the positive cases are less than 10 per cent. Though people with Covid-19 are suffering a bit, the mortality rate is very low. But the government is on high alert and taking all the necessary precautions," the release quoted Rao as saying. All over the state, 10,000 beds with oxygen facility are kept ready which can be increased even as the situation is under control, it added. States like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have witnessed a surge in cases. Infections are on the rise in Kerala and Karnataka too. There is a chance of Covid-19 second wave emerging, the release said. Instructing officials to stay alert and be prepared in case the state is hit by a second wave of Covid-19, Rao said his government will make all the efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Seeking public support to contain the spread of the virus, Rao said as and when a vaccine is available for Covid-19, it would be first given to the healthcare workers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-logs-873-new-covid-19-cases-cm-k-chandrashekhar-rao-alerts-officials-on-second-wave-918640.html
22-11-2020||South||Sabarimala temple's daily revenue drops 97% to Rs 10 lakh; temple in acute financial crisis||The Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala is facing an acute financial crunch owing to Covid-19 as the average daily revenue from pilgrims during the initial days of pilgrimage fell from around Rs 3.5 crore to Rs 10 lakh, forcing the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages the temple to desperately seek relaxation in the restriction on the number of pilgrims as well as government's financial assistance. At present only 1,000 pilgrims are allowed on weekdays, 2,000 on weekends and holidays and 5,000 on special occasions like Mandala pooja day and Makaravilakku day. The board president N Vasu told DH that normally there used to be 50,000 pilgrims daily. It had even gone up to one lakh on some occasions like the first day of pilgrimage. In that place, it is only 1,000 now. Hence the revenue fall was quite obvious. If the current situation persists, the board would struggle to meet even the daily requirements of the temple which comes to around Rs 50 lakh, apart from the salary of the board employees. It was from the revenue surplus from Sabarimala during the pilgrimage that major chunk of expenses of the board, as well as around 1,250 temples under it for the entire year, was met. Kerala Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said that the government would consider increasing the daily limit of pilgrims. The board is pointing out that since darshan is allowed for 14 hours every day, a higher number of pilgrims could be allowed by following social distancing norms. However, it was for the health authorities and other government agencies to take a decision to increase the limit of pilgrims. Though the daily limits are now fixed as 1,000 and 2,000, on weekdays and weekends respectively, over the last one week of pilgrimage around 50 pilgrims who booked on the virtual queue did not turn up every day. Owing to the financial crisis due to Covid-19, the board was also exploring the option of depositing the huge quantity of gold and silver recovered as offering over the years in RBI bonds. Meanwhile, as many as 20 pilgrims who turned up for Sabarimala pilgrimage were so far tested Covid-19 positive during the test conducted at the Nilakkal base camp. Hence the infected persons, as well as all those who travelled with them, were sent back. Majority of the pilgrims are from other states. The norms stipulate a Covid-19 negative test result issued 24 hours prior to reaching the base camp. Hence almost all pilgrims from other states have to undergo Covid-19 antigen test at the base camp only. The pilgrimage that began last Monday will last till January.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-temples-daily-revenue-drops-97-to-rs-10-lakh-temple-in-acute-financial-crisis-918646.html
22-11-2020||South||Kerala law to curb 'insulting through media' triggers row||An amendment in the Kerala Police Act initiated by the state government through an ordinance has triggered allegations of attempts to curb freedom of expression as well as to gag the media. Even as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan denied the concerns, a section of leaders within the Left Front were also learnt to have expressed apprehensions over it. It was with the stated intention of curbing insult towards persons on social media, especially women, that the Left Front government in Kerala decided to introduce a new section in the Kerala Police Act, section 118-A. But the ordinance that received Governor Arif Mohammed Khan's assent on Saturday did not specify the word social media, but only states any form of media. Hence it triggered concerns that the new section was aimed at curbing the mainstream media also from publishing news against individuals, especially politicians. Moreover, it provides for anyone to raise complaints against insults caused to any other individual. The non-bailable section also warrants a four-year imprisonment and fine of Rs 10,000 to offenders. Kerala Chief Minister, many ministers and CPM leaders used to allege that the media was targeting CPM by publishing baseless news, especially related to the Kerala gold smuggling accused. Hence the allegations assumed more significance now. With the opposition parties BJP and Congress alleging that the ordinance was aimed at curbing freedom of expression and the media, the Chief Minister came out with a statement that the amendment would in no way be used against free speech or impartial journalism. However, he added that the government would look into all creative opinions and suggestions being aired with regard to this amendment. He said that the fresh amendment was initiated as the state government was receiving several complaints against the rampant misuse of social media, especially by certain online channels. Even prominent public and cultural figures had made such complaints. Women and transgenders were also facing cyberattacks. The amendment only has clauses that are in tune with the sections that ensure the freedom of press and individual liberty. It may be recalled that the state capital recently witnessed a known dubbing artist and two women activists assaulting a vlogger alleging that he posted insulting remarks. They alleged police inaction in their complaint, while the police cited lack of provisions in law to act upon. The was learnt to have prompted the government to bring in the amendment. CPI, which is the second largest party in the Left Front in Kerala, had earlier expressed concerns over the amendment. It said that the concerns raised by the media and human rights activists that the proposed amendments could be misused by the police could not be ruled out and such amendments need to be introduced only after detailed discussions in the society. Various forum of journalists, human rights activists and opposition parties had already flayed the move. The Supreme Court had earlier scrapped section 66-A of IT Act and section 118-D of Kerala Police Act which dealt with publishing of objectionable contents of social media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-law-to-curb-insulting-through-media-triggers-row-918687.html

The ED was learnt to have sought details from RBI on any permission given to KIIFB, a body corporate under the Kerala government, to issue Masala Bonds that were listed in London Stock Exchange and raised foreign funds to the tune of Rs 2,150 crore. The move came close on the heels of the Comptroller and Auditor General flaying the move as unconstitutional. The ED would be looking into any sorts of foreign exchange violations involved, said sources. The Finance Minister alleged that it was yet another political ploy the against Kerala government. He also alleged that the central agencies were leaking out information to media. The Kerala government had earlier strongly flayed the ED for seeking derails regarding Kerala government's flagship projects as part of probe against Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alleged that the central agencies like ED were trying to sabotage key infrastructure projects of Kerala. Later when the CAG raised suspicions over KIIFB, the state government alleged that the CAG's move was also a political ploy of the BJP with Congress's support to attack the left-front government in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-government-provoked-by-eds-move-to-probe-kiifb-918707.html

The first leg of the 620-km-long Kochi-Bengaluru gas pipeline begins from Kuttanad in Palakkad and extends up to Valayar, which is on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. The work on this 95-km line is progressing at a frenetic pace, the official said. "We have laid the pipes and pressure testing is being done on the 95-km long Kuttanad-Valayar stretch. We hope to complete it by January,” P Murugesan, executive director in-charge of the southern region at Gail, told PTI from Bengaluru over the weekend. Once testing is over, the pipeline will supply natural gas to Palakkad town as well as to Kanjikode and other industrial estates in the district, he said. The Kochi-Bengaluru line was also announced along with the Kochi-Mangalore line that is now awaiting official commissioning, but got inordinately delayed due to public and political pressure which held back land acquisition for long. The project was initially expected to cost Rs 2,500 crore but the cost is set to escalate due to the delays and after the management agreed to pay higher compensation to farmers for the land. While the Kuttanad-Palakkad stretch will be completed anytime from now, the line will go live up to up to Valayar by January and in Coimbatore by March, which is 280-km long, he said. The line passes through seven districts in Tamil Nadu--Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Tirupur, Krishnagiri, Dharmagiri and Hosur. While the Krishnagiri stretch is almost complete, the work on the Valayar-Coimbatore leg is also on, Murugesan said. When asked about likely opposition to the project and the resultant delays, he expressed hope that work will resume at full speed now as there is complete backing by the state government and farmers are likely to give up their land for higher price being offered now. He also pointed to the success of the project in Kerala which was also delayed for long due to the same reasons and was resolved by offering higher prices. Murugesan also said now the Tamil Nadu government is very serious about completing the project and has appointed nodal revenue officers in each of the seven districts for regular monitoring and coordination. On November 16, Murugesan had told PTI that the Kochi-Mangalore line was finally ready for commissioning after completing testing of a 540-metre stretch across the Chandragiri river in Kasargod on November 14, which took them nearly eight months to complete due to the geological complexities. The 444-km long Kochi-Mangalore pipeline was launched in 2009 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,915 crore, and was to be commissioned in 2014. But opposition on safety and commercial grounds wherein the land price was the main hurdle, both from political parties and the public, ensured that the project lingered on. This led to the project cost nearly doubling to over Rs 5,750 crore. Kuttanad is the main junction for both the projects as from here the line bifurcates to Mangalore and Bengaluru. The first phase of the Kochi project was commissioned in August 2013 with industrial supplies and domestic supplies in the Kochi metropolitan region from February 2016 by Adani Gas. Today the pipeline supplies 3.8 million cubic meters of gas every day in and around Kochi, while Mangalore has a demand for 2.5 million cubic meters per day, Murugesan said. The pipeline is a big boost to the struggling Kochi LNT Terminal of Petronet which has an annual capacity of 5 million tonne but 90 per cent of it has been idling for want of demand, and Murugesan said with the commissioning of the Kochi-Mangalore line the capacity ulitisation of the terminal will go up to 25-30 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/first-leg-of-kochi-bengaluru-gail-pipeline-to-be-ready-by-january-2021-say-officials-918712.html

Nirmala, from Kundapur, told DH that for Mala, she is still “atthe” (father’s elder sister) and her husband “maava and never aunty or uncle. “Mala is an affectionate and lovely girl. She treasures relationships and has her roots firmly in India,” recollects Nirmala. Nirmala added that Mala had called her on Saturday to share the good news of being made a senior staffer at White House when Biden takes office as President of USA in January 2021. “I had congratulated her on her new responsibility,” informed Nirmala, gushing. Mala’s father Dr Ramesh Adiga (84), is the second among three siblings. He had left for the US when he was 25 to hone his skills as a vascular surgeon. Mala’s mother Jaya Adiga had studied medicine in Vellore.  Nirmala recollected meeting Mala at a family get-together in Bengaluru in 2019. Nirmala had travelled with her daughter Sujatha Nakkatthaya and family to Bengaluru in November 2019. Mala had come to Bengaluru with husband Charles and daughter Asha to attend the event with her parents. Sujatha says she still considers 47-year-old Mala her kid sister and adds that she loves Brahmin cuisine, especially ‘tomato sambar’ and ‘potato pallya’. She's also an animal lover. Sujatha said Mala, who had come to Kundapur seven years ago, had fallen in love with the beaches. She had offered puja at the Kakkunje temple and her family visited their ancestral house in Babbarianakatte.

They forget their miseries and nurture their dreams during the time they spend at this house. “My house has been their home and I have been their mother since last 15 years,” says home maker and Yoga expert Roopa Ballal. In a classroom constructed by her husband Nagaraj Ballal on the terrace, she teaches Kannada and English to these children. She teaches them reading, writing and serves them healthy food every day. The children learn Karate, while, a choreographer conducts dance classes. She teaches them ettiquette and communication skills. She explains the importance of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness. “Besides educating them, I pay attention to their health, nutrition and well-being,” she says. Beyond the four walls Learning for these children goes beyond the four walls. These children have taken part in eight marathons held in Manipal. Roopa takes them on picnics and excursions and visits on to exhibitions and workshops. Udupi is home to a huge population of migrant labourers from Ballari, Bagalkot, Kalaburagi, Hubballi, Vijayapura, among others. Long hours of work and paltry wages prevent migrants from focusing on the well-being of their children. Very few send their children to government schools, while most of them engage them in begging. Roopa told DH that often neglected children end up becoming substance abusers. Roopa decided to do her bit towards their betterment by dedicating her time. A native of Bagalkot, she is fond of children. “I used to visit the slums to teach them for a few hours. Later, my children, who are settled in the USA, encouraged me to guide these children in a systematic manner,” she explains. Pursuing college education Nearly 500 children have been groomed by Roopa. Over 25 children are pursuing their college education in Karnataka. Among them, Manjunath went on to become an engineer and is now employed in her husband’s firm. According to Manjunath, Roopa is responsible for all positive changes in his life. “If not for her, it would not have been impossible for me to be at this place, in my life. I salute this amazing lady, who has given me a new life,” he adds. Nagaraj Ballal, a contractor, and also a trustee for many educational institutions, says, “It is my duty to support her in all her noble endeavours.” Roopa regrets that she could not do much for these children during the pandemic but hopes that she will continue to bring hope to these underprivileged children.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/learning-beyond-classrooms-udupi-woman-grooms-500-kids-918599.html

Degree, engineering and diploma colleges were reopened on November 17 after eight months of closure due to coronavirus-induced lockdown. Under the circumstances, reports emerged that at least 130 students got infected by Covid-19. "If the cases go up, then, as you have said in your (media) reports, we will have to go for a shutdown once again. There is no alternative," Sudhakar told reporters in Dharwad while responding to queries about the rising coronavirus cases among students. The Minister's statement came ahead of Karnataka government's crucial meeting on Monday to decide on the reopening of schools. Sudhakar conceded that the schools have not been reopened yet in the state for the fear of coronavirus. Stating that about 120 to 130 students were infected with the coronavirus as per media reports, Dr Sudhakar said he would gather information from senior officials. Explaining the reason behind reopening the colleges, he said youth have immunity. "I won't say that the students won't contract the disease. Youth have more immunity. We have to protect the lives of the students as well as shape their academic future. Since we have a big responsibility, we decided to reopen schools and colleges in a phased manner," Dr Sudhakar said. According to officials in the higher education department, the decision to reopen colleges were taken as students were not able to grasp the lessons online due to various reasons such as lack of gadgets, poor connectivity and health issues such as eyesight. Besides, the faculties and the college staff were staring at unemployment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/colleges-in-karnataka-may-be-shut-if-coronavirus-cases-rise-minister-dr-k-sudhakar-918630.html

This will enable merchant vessels to use IRNSS for obtaining position information similar to GPS and GLONASS to assist in the navigation of ships in ocean waters within the area covered by 50°N latitude, 55°E longitude, 5°S latitude, and 110°E longitude - approximately up to 1,500 kms from Indian boundary. According to a press statement, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) of IMO during its recent meeting - 102nd session - held from 4-11 November has approved the recognition of the IRNSS as a component of the World-Wide Radio Navigation System. This is a significant achievement of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW), Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) towards Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Mumbai-headquartered Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has initiated matters with the IMO. Details of the tests carried out on merchant ships with regard to the accuracy of the system have been included in the report prepared by ISRO which was submitted to IMO for consideration. After detailed analysis, the sub-committee on Navigation, Communications and Search and Rescue (NCSR) of IMO during the 7th session held in January recommended to the MSC of IMO for accepting the IRNSS as a component of the World-Wide Radio Navigation System. “IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to assist in the navigation of ships in Indian Ocean waters,” the statement said.

He also said that the unlock process in Delhi began too soon, leading to the present spike in Covid-19 cases there. Blaming the Delhi government's "overconfidence" for the present crisis, Sena's chief spokesperson apprehended another lockdown in the national capital. "Markets, public places, and places of worship will be closed down again. Why did this happen, Maharashtra BJP leaders should think...they are opposing every move of the MVA government for the sake of it," he said. The Rajya Sabha member further said that BJP leaders staged protests over their demand for granting permission for the 'Chhath Puja' celebration in Maharashtra. "You may have won the Bihar polls, but there is no need to drag Mumbai's Bihari population into the controversy. Lakhs of people gather on Mumbai's seashore and in the pandemic, this is illegal," he said. The BJP governments refused permission for Chhath Puja at public places in Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, but the party demands the same in Maharashtra, he said. "The BJP wants to criticise every step of the state government even if it means people lose their lives," he alleged, and said if the BJP feels there should be another lockdown in Maharashtra, "it is the state's bad luck". Raut also said those who could not give the 'Bharat Ratna' to Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar are planning to rename Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi.

The bridge connects Naigaon in Palghar district to Bhayander in Thane district – and goes over the tiny Panju Island. People travelling on the Western Railway (WR) mail/express and suburban trains can see this bridge as they pass the Vasai creek. The original railway bridge built in the 1860s connecting the old Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&CI), the forerunner of WR with Mumbai. The now 156-year-old bridge was decommissioned in 1983 after two new bridges were constructed almost parallel to the old ones. The bridge, now abandoned, was auctioned in February, however, the work could not commence because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown. The work has commenced on 5 November and is expected to be complete by 26 January next year. On the other hand, the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) has planned 3+3 lanes road bridge that would run parallel to the rail bridge. While the bridge that is being dismantled was of no use to the railways, people of Panju Island used to reach Naigaon or Bhayender. They, however, also walk on the new bridge from which the trains pass. The Panju Island that is cut off from the mainland and like Mumbai also has a unique history. The village is spread over 600 acres and has huge patches of salt pans and fishing boats dotting the elliptical coast. Villagers own around 100 plus boats – mainly used to sand dredging or fishing.  “We connected with the old bridge. This was of emotional value to us,” said Kiran Bhoir, the founder of KMC Holidays Pvt Ltd, who hails from Panju Island.  While the British-era bridge would go down, the WR is contemplating preserving some heritage like the seals of the bridge - at the Churchgate heritage gallery.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/150-plus-year-old-bridge-near-mumbai-to-be-brought-down-918575.html

Ahmedabad city currently has 2,906 active cases, led by its west zone with 479, and followed by 464 in the north-west and 457 in the south-west. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation said there was no need to panic as 1,500 beds were available and it was in the process of requisitioning another eight to ten hospitals to enhance the numbers further. It said some private hospitals were admitting Covid-19 patients who did not require hospitalisation in a bid to fill up beds and create "artificial scarcity". The civic body said it had reached out to private hospitals across the city after a review meeting was chaired by Additional Chief Secretary Rajiv Gupta, who is the special officer for Covid-19 in Ahmedabad city, and directed them to stop any such "unscrupulous and illegal practice." The AMC said the office-bearers of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association have been intimated about this issue as well. The civic body also told providers of 108 ambulance service to ensure, as much as possible, that members of a family are admitted in the same hospital and not different ones. On Saturday, the city witnessed 354 new cases, among the highest single-day additions since the outbreak began in March, and five deaths.

The incident took place a few days back, they said, adding that the woman was a "high risk" category patient as she was underweight and had low blood pressure. When contacted, District Medical Officer Dr Dayanand Suryawanshi told PTI that there was a delay in the ambulance service as one vehicle of a local public health centre (PHC) was on Covid-19 duty, while another one had broken down. On November 17, Manisha Dhore, who was seven months pregnant, started having labour pains at her home in Amle village of Khodala area in Mokhada taluka following which her family members called for an ambulance. However, as there was adelay in the arrival of the ambulance, some locals carried her in a 'dholi' (makeshift cloth stretcher) to the nearest main road. The ambulance arrived at the main road after over two hours and the woman was rushed to the PHC in Khodala. But, her condition became critical and she was shifted to the civil hospital in neighbouring Nashik district, the official said. The woman, who was a member of the Suryamahal gram panchayat, also lost a lot of blood in the intervening period, he said. Doctors at the Nashik Civil Hospital performed a Cesarean surgery on the night of November 18, but the baby could not be saved. The woman, who was administered blood, also died the next morning, Dr Suryawanshi said. Admitting there a was delay in the ambulance service, he said the ambulance of the Khodala PHC was on Covid-19 duty in neighbouring Vikramgad taluka, while the emergency vehicle assigned for the Mokhada PHC had broken down. The official said he conducted a probe into the matter and informed that the victim had a bad obstetric history. She earlier had one abortion and another case of stillborn child, and doctors had advised her against conceiving as it could pose a risk to her life, he said.

"From tomorrow (November 23), only night curfew will be imposed, which began in three cities (Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot) from last (Saturday) night. From tomorrow, there will only be night curfew (in these four cities)," he said. Rupani said the decision to impose night curfew was taken due to spike in coronavirus cases, adding that there was a rise not just in Ahmedabad but in other cities nationwide after Diwali, and asked people to support the government's efforts fully. The police will impose a fine of Rs 1,000 for mask violations, the CM reminded the people. Rupani assured people there were sufficient number of beds in hospitals to tackle rise in infection numbers.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, both asked people to remain alert and maintain all precautions and follow protocols. “We do not have the vaccine yet…the threat of coronavirus is not yet over….the best possible measures are compulsory wearing of masks, physical distancing, sanitization and avoiding crowding in public places,” Thackeray said in a webcast to the people of the state.  “Do we want another lockdown? I do not want to end five years with lockdown after lockdown,” he said, adding that the state celebrated various festivals including Ganesh Utsav, Dussehra and Diwali. “We did it successfully but have seen crowds….We have opened places of worship but please do not crowd. You have to follow the norms if you do not want a lockdown again,” he said in his address. Thackeray said that people should not take Covid-19 lightly. "Yes...there has been a reduction in cases in Maharashtra, but the threat of the pandemic is not yet over," he said, adding that so far, he has received cooperation from the people and the My Family My Responsibility programme has been progressing successfully. In Pune, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was more specific. “There was a huge crowd during the Diwali period. Even at the time of Ganesha Chaturthi, we saw crowds. We are speaking to relevant departments. We’ll review the situation for the next 8-10 days and then the further decision will be taken about the lockdown,” said Pawar.  Both Thackeray and Pawar spoke of the Covid-19 pandemic’s second wave. “We are seeing what is happening in Europe…it is a second wave, sometimes I wonder if it is a second wave or a tsunami,” said Thackeray, adding that the state needed to learn from what was happening across the globe. "Now, there are predictions that a second wave may come. Government has made a lot of regulations to start schools, which includes different ways on how they should be sanitized," said  Pawar. The separate statements of Thackeray and Pawar on the same day come at a time when speculations about the state considering a possible suspension of train and flight operations to and from Delhi in view of the rising Covid-19 cases in the national capital are gathering steam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-maharashtra-govt-hints-at-another-lockdown-918730.html
