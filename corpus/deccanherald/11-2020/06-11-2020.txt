It would be good for the Joint Select Committee, which is reviewing the BBMP Bill, to heed the lacunae identified by the CAG and suggest suitable remedies, if Bengaluru, or any other Urban Local Self-Government (ULSG) in Karnataka, is to get a semblance of good decentralized governance.  CIVIC, a non-profit, has been pointing out that we need amendments to the KMC and KM Acts, not a separate Bill only for Bengaluru as improvements are required for all municipalities, given that ULSGs are facing several challenges as well.   The Performance Audit by the CAG criticises the government, stating that though statutory amendments were enacted to comply with the provisions of the 74th CA, they were not implemented in letter and spirit. The CAG states that all 18 functions to be transferred to cities, as per the 12th Schedule attached to the 74th CA, were mandatory but the state classified functions such as “slum improvements and upgradation” and “poverty alleviation” as discretionary functions. It is amusing to note that full jurisdiction to ULSGs has been devolved in only three out of the 18 functions, namely, burial grounds, cattle pounds and slaughterhouses! A plethora of parastatals--such as BDA, BWSSB, Karnataka Slum Development Board--or state government departments are still in charge of urban planning, slum development, poverty alleviation, water supply, public health, protection of environment, etc. The new BBMP Bill too does nothing to change this. The Audit says that the government should have amended the Acts governing the parastatals and made them accountable to the ULSGs as otherwise “the raison d’etre of decentralization, viz., accountability to the people” gets undermined. The power to delimit wards, reserve and rotate seats and posts for the council is vested with the state government, causing delays in conducting elections to ULSGs. Hence, though the term of the last BBMP council would expire in September 2020, the state had not taken up the delimitation process even by January 2020. Thus the SEC had to undergo the mortification of filing a PIL, which resulted in the High Court “cautioning the government regarding the imposition of penalty”.  It was only thereafter that the government undertook delimitation and reservation of wards. The second Administrative Reforms Commission had recommended that these tasks should be entrusted to the State Election Commission (SEC). The new BBMP Bill too does not propose to make this change. The Audit notes that a mayor has only a one-year term and a municipal president a term of two-and-a-half years, which affects effective reforms, long-term continuity in priorities and planning. The Model Municipal Law of 2003 circulated by the Central Ministry of Urban Development, had prescribed that the tenure of the Mayor or President should be coterminous with that of the municipality, that is, five years. Though the new BBMP Bill bats for a five-year term for the Mayor, it makes no change to the colonial relic of vesting executive powers with the Commissioner, with the Mayor being a mere ceremonial head. The Audit notes that Ward Committees have not been constituted in any of the City Corporations except BBMP, leading to an absence of community participation in the planning and monitoring of works and in ensuring proper utilisation of funds. Despite a HC ruling in this regard, the formation of ward committees in Mangaluru and other cities is yet to happen after 27 years of the 74th CAA.  Ward committees not overseeing “proper utilisation of funds” is the reason for recurring scams in BBMP. Thus projects worth thousands of crores handed over to KRIDL without calling for tenders has escaped the scrutiny of the citizens. The new BBMP Bill, instead of strengthening ward committees, in fact, downgrades them by making their recommendations merely advisory.  The Audit observed that though District Planning Committees (DPCs) and a Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC) (for Bengaluru area) were formed, neither had the test checked cities coming under the DPCs nor had the MPC prepared their development plans. The new BBMP Bill has not proposed any measures to strengthen planning by the MPC. There were delays in the constitution and implementation of the recommendations of State Finance Commissions (SFCs) hurting ULSGs’ finances, the CAG stated. There was a shortfall of Rs.15,564 crore in fiscal transfers to cities by the state between 2014 to 2019 due to differences in the interpretation of the recommendations of the SFC. The budget of cities was also prepared on the basis of expected allocation of funds by the state government which resulted in unrealistic budgets as the expected allocations failed to materialise.  Thus we have the situation of cities forever lacking funds and also lacking complete autonomy in generating their own revenue to fulfil mandatory functions. The CAG observed that the state government had overriding powers over ULSGs--it could cancel a resolution or decision taken by ULSGs--which was against the spirit of the 74th CA. Thus, even when the BBMP council passed a resolution that there should be no hoardings in Bengaluru, or that Cubbon Park should be vehicle-free, the state government countered it. The new BBMP Bill has nothing significant to say regarding the above ills. These deeper issues should be looked into by the government, the KMC and KM Acts suitably amended to benefit all cities, rather than doing a limited exercise of bringing in a new BBMP Bill.

06-11-2020||First Edit||America needs a unifier, and quickly||It has been called the most important election in the lives of Americans. It is, and it has already stretched over three agonising days now. If it were a ‘normal’ election, the kind that seemed to demonstrate America’s democratic credentials every four years through a peaceful transition of power, we would have known, more or less, on election night itself who was on the path to the White House. This, of course, is not a normal election. It could even be weeks, and violence and court battles, before the final word is said on who will be the next President – Donald Trump again or Joe Biden -- as a seesaw counting battle rages on in a handful of battleground states. The uncertainty is partly due to the Electoral College system. In America, a candidate does not become President by winning the popular vote, as Joe Biden is on track to doing, but by winning at least 270 out of 538 Electoral College votes. These Electoral College votes are distributed among the states, and it matters which states and how many of them candidates win in the popular vote. A few states emerge as battleground states, where the candidates fight for the votes of the undecided in each election. Biden is short of the 270 mark by one or two such battleground states, Trump far shorter of it. And the counting process in these states is going slow. But the biggest reason for the uncertainty is that Trump has done as well as he has, even after presiding over the deaths of nearly 240,000 Americans due to Covid-19. Clearly, Trump’s large following among White, non-college educated voters remains loyal to him. He has also managed to get other groups on his side – such as Latino immigrants in Florida and undecided White voters elsewhere -- by playing on their fears: the fear of Communism if Biden wins; the fear of Biden handing over the presidency midway to his running mate Kamala Harris, and the like. It is ominous. No matter what the election result, Trumpism is here to stay in America. This America is split into White and Black, coastal America and middle America. Trump has widened another divide -- that between the big cities, which are predominantly Democrat, and rural and small-town America, which has plumped for him. Biden has multiple pathways to the presidency. Trump still has one or two ways to it. But America has only one pathway out of these divisions. It needs a unifier who can rally them all together. They call it the battle for the soul of America, and a battle for the soul is never easy, especially when it is in the grip of the devil of misinformation and conspiracy theories.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/america-needs-a-unifier-and-quickly-911875.html

However, planning for a pandemic, especially one that threatens to stretch indefinitely, requires a different set of skills as well as certain continuity assumptions. Unlike natural disasters that are often confined to certain spatial areas and are potent for finite periods, a pandemic might diffuse geographically and could appear in a flutter that can persist for several months. Due to the limitless nature of a pandemic, resources cannot easily be deployed geologically to help an area in need, as would be feasible in other crises.   It is important for critical sectors and governments to work seamlessly to ensure that they can deliver essential goods and services while responding to a pandemic. Critical infrastructure such as healthcare, supply chains for food and medicines, communications, water power and other utilities will bear the additional onus to assist in containing a contagion. Critical infrastructure entities would themselves be impacted by the pandemic, much like any other business. It is estimated that up to 40% of a company's employees could be absent sick, quarantined, or might stay home to care for ailing family members. Vendors and suppliers that critical infrastructure companies rely upon, could experience similar personnel shortages and disruptions. Given the protracted impact of a pandemic, it would be difficult for organisations to depend on mutual assistance programmes that normally help restore service after natural disasters. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic shares many characteristics with the deadly 1918 influenza that infected over 500 million worldwide, claiming over 50 million victims.  While the fundamental traits of the Spanish Influenza and Covid-19 are different, the best-available index on the proclivity of the virus to infect, referred to as the reproduction number (R0) is comparable to that of the 1918 influenza. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on critical infrastructures (CI) will depend predominantly on the extent of absenteeism, the degree of know-how required to maintain utilities and the extent that a society can be trained and mobilised as required. The Canadian Labour Force estimated that absenteeism rates were at 12% for seasonal influenza between 1997-98 to 2008-09 and 13% for the two H1N1 pandemic waves. It is now predicted that the corresponding rate for Covid-19 could be as high as 20-50% as both morbidity and fatality rates for the virus are much higher.  In the past 100 years, there have been significant advances in the complexity, architecture, ownership and the interdependency of our critical utilities. CIs are fully intertwined today as never before, and there are major cross-sector interdependencies. National power grids are highly unified and operate at a single frequency, and are largely controlled through sophisticated computer systems. Water utilities are dependent on their chemical sector (for requisite materials to treat water) and the transportation sector to deliver critical supplies from the chemical sector. Many infrastructure sectors today require a high level of competency in areas such as information technology, machine learning, robotics, communication skills, pharmaceutical specialisation, additive manufacturing, etc. The dilemma is that there is relatively a small population that has acquired these skills through on-the-job training needed to perform the task securely. Therefore, if there is going to be high absenteeism, it will be extremely difficult to find replacement personnel in a short time. This makes effective advance planning critical for a unified public-private sector response as in its absence, the joint response will be arduous, if not futile. In a pandemic situation, governments need to be extremely watchful about digital threats to critical infrastructure. Terrorists and hostile nations are already looking to take advantage of more than one attack vector at a time. A cyber-attack during disasters becomes far more debilitating and exponentially increases the impact than any single event. If an adversary were to target the electricity network of a sovereign state during a pandemic, the emergency response would be inhibited to the extent of damaging the overall efficacy of the counter-strategy. This is a stimulus for a perfect storm. With an outdated infrastructure, the enemy will find a more compliant surface area for a cyber-attack. An attack on the electricity supply of any major electric grid for 48 hours can cause inconsistencies in the supply of potable water in any major city in the subcontinent. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. in Hyderabad reported a cyberattack last Thursday, after which it isolated its entire data centre services as a preventive measure. Its plants in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Russia were also impacted. This came just a few days after the company had signed a partnership to run clinical trials of Russia's Sputnik-V Covid-19 vaccine in India. Such an attack has the potential to inflict severe damage. Critical infrastructure protection encompasses the prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, which is primarily aimed at augmenting resilience of people, systems and physical infrastructure.

The 84-year-old ailing entity applied for closure following heavy losses last year. Yediyurappa directed MPM authorities to make use of forest trees for its operations in order to pay salaries during a review meeting pertaining to the Shivamogga district. The meeting was attended by Shimoga MP BY Raghavendra, legislators from the district, and officials from the forest and revenue departments. The MPM was founded by Krishnaraja Wodeyar Bahadur, the Maharaja of Mysore in 1936 at Bhadravati in Shivamogga. Later, in 1977, it became a government company. Currently, the state government owns a 64.74% stake in the company and the rest is with the public including IDBI Bank and LIC. The CM also took stock of the rehabilitation of farmers whose lands have submerged in the Sharavathi river basin. The government has identified an area of 9,773 acres where farmers will need new land rights documents. Yediyurappa asked officials from the forest and revenue departments to conduct a joint survey for this. Based on this survey, new Pahani documents need to be created for the displaced and the Supreme Court must be approached for this, Yediyurappa said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/cut-forest-trees-pay-salaries-bsy-tells-mysore-paper-mills-912236.html

06-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Private schools demand waiver of cess||CBSE, ICSE and State Board private schools in Mysuru region have urged the government to waive off property tax and cess for the academic year 2020-21, due to the Covid-19 crisis. The schools are incurring a huge loss, due to Covid and the urban local bodies are exerting pressure on the institutions to pay the cess. Many local bodies have considered education institutions as residential complexes or commercial establishments and are demanding to pay property tax.  According to CBSE, ICSE and State Board Private School Management Association (CISPMA), Mysuru division, president Sudhakara S Shetty, nearly 80% of the parents have not paid their children's school fee, for the academic year 2020-21. Many schools are not in a position to pay salaries of their staff and electricity bill. The state government must allow the schools to collect the fee, he said. The association members have urged the government to order district-level banks to waive off interest on loans obtained by education institutions for the financial year 2020-21. The members have demanded relaxation from paying insurance premium of school vans for a year.  According to Shetty, 80% of the parents are not ready to send their children to schools. A meeting of private school management association was held recently in Mysuru and it was decided not to open schools till December 31. The schools will be opened only after January 1, 2021, only if the government assures that no action will be taken against school managements or teachers, if a student or teacher is infected with the virus. MLA L Nagendra and Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Chairman H V Rajeev were present in the meeting, held at Jnanasarovara International Residential School in Mysuru. Shetty said, “We have brought the issues to the notice of Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S Suresh Kumar. The minister has assured of taking measures to fulfil our demands.” MLA Nagendra said that a few people are harassing education institutions, under the guise of Right to Information (RTI) activists. The Police and Education department will be asked to check the menace. Private schools are an integral part of the government. The problems of the institutions will be discussed with the district in-charge ministers, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/private-schools-demand-waiver-of-cess-912257.html

Following several complaints from parents against the schools conducting online classes after regular school hours that even stretched to night time, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar has directed the department commissioner to issue a detailed circular directing the schools to conduct online classes only during the school hours. The schools have been asked to conduct online classes as per the guidelines issued by the department recently. However, there are complaints against some schools are conducting classes even during night times. Considering this seriously, the minister on Friday directed the commissioner to issue a  circular. Dist-level nodal officers Meanwhile, the department has requested the parents and the public to file complaints about online classes by calling the helpline set up. To file complaints about the online classes, they can call 18004257302 or send a WhatsApp message to 9483045130. In addition, the department is also appointing nodal officers at district levels to monitor online education and also to address complaints about online education. As explained by the minister, most of the complaints are from Bengaluru, Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Mangaluru and Hubballi-Dharwad. “The officers at the block level will monitor the school hours of online classes at taluk levels. The schools are allowed to conduct online classes only during the school hours and as per the duration/schedule recommended by the expert committee according to which department had issued an official order,” Suresh Kumar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/online-classes-govt-to-monitor-school-hours-912274.html

This can be decided through a consultation between employers and the workers, the note said. In case an employee has used up all leaves for a particular period, then employers can allow s/he to avail in advance the leaves that may be applied for in the future.  The pro-worker note comes months after the government promulgated an ordinance to liberalise labour laws during the Covid-19 lockdown.  The Industrial Disputes and Certain Other Laws (Karnataka Amendment) Ordinance, would make only those establishments that employ 300 or more persons to seek the government’s permission for closure, retrenchment or layoff. Similarly, worker thresholds will be increased from 10 to 20 in units which use power and from 20 to 40 in factories that do not use power. Also, the overtime work of any quarter will go up from 75 to 125 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/be-liberal-with-covid-19-leaves-for-staffers-govt-to-firms-912275.html
06-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Plaints by elected representatives need to be transferred to special court: HC||The High Court has observed that the trial courts across the state need to transfer the cases involving elected representatives, whether filed against the MPs/MLAs or filed by them, to the special court exclusively to deal with criminal cases related to MLAs and MPs. The court made this observation while dismissing a petition filed by former minister S A Ramdas challenging a trial court order transferring a case, in which Ramdas is the complainant, to the special court. The petitioner argued that the specific direction issued by the Supreme Court was to constitute a special court only to try the cases pending or registered against the MPs/MLAs, and not in respect of the cases or complaintsfiled by them. However, a special public prosecutor argued that the expression ‘involving’ is a comprehensive word which takes with its fold not only the cases registered against the elected representatives but also cases in which they areinvolved. Justice John Michael Cunha observed that the Supreme Court constituted the special court keeping in mind the capability and potential of the elected representatives to influence or hamper the effective prosecution. “If that be so, the possibility of the elected MPs/MLAs influencing the investigation and prosecution even in the cases initiated by them either by lodging a report before the police or by approaching the Magistrate by way of complaint, cannot be ruled out,” the court said. The court also observed that anomalous situations and practical difficulties arise in conducting the trial when there is an instance of a case and a counter-case on the same set of facts and allegations. The court held that the government order dated February 2, 2018, constituting the special court, is in consonance with the orders passed by the Supreme Court. Based on the complaint filed by Ramdas, MLA from Krishnaraja Assembly constituency in Mysuru, the Kuvempunagar police in Mysuru had filed the charge-sheet. The court had transferred the case to the special court in Bengaluru on June 17, 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/plaints-by-elected-representatives-need-to-be-transferred-to-special-court-hc-912277.html

The surveyed population in these districts had high antibodies indicating that they all had a past infection. The said districts had a high case-to-infection ratio which is a measure of undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case. The aforementioned districts, despite having high antibodies in its surveyed population, had a low infection fatality rate that means there is under-reporting of deaths. The districts have been asked to at least prioritise verbal autopsies as currently Covid patients’ autopsies are being avoided largely. The serosurvey report has recommended strengthening death audits to ensure  efficient clinical management. Vijayapura has the highest case-to-infection ratio in the entire state (higher than the state average of 1:40) with 1:111 which means for every RT-PCR confirmed case 111 infected individuals are going undetected, which is worrisome. At the same time, it has the least infection fatality rate in the state at 0.02% (lower than the state average of 0.05%) and the highest rate of antibodies with 23.9% (higher than the state average of 16.4%) indicating a significant percentage of people with past infection. Not surprisingly, Vijayapura till Wednesday reported only 196 deaths and 12,807 cases. P Sunil Kumar, Deputy Commissioner, Vijayapura, told DH, “Death audit has been done for 177 Covid deaths, so far.  The remaining 19 cases are pending for audit. For all deaths, verbal autopsies are being done. We have also been testing all vulnerable populations, all primary contacts, and symptomatic secondary contacts. Officials regularly visit their homes and check if they have any symptoms. We do target testing, which is why our positivity rate hovers around 4% to 5%.” The district has 15 private hospitals, two medical colleges and one district hospital. “It is not a case of under-reporting but a case of late reporting by private hospitals, by 20 to 30 days. From August, they started updating deaths every day, in an app. As far as deaths where the patients were not diagnosed for Covid while alive, the revenue department is tracking if there was a rise in non-Covid deaths in any village in the district. The serosurvey in Delhi and Dharavi said the Covid prevalence is 20% to 30% but that cannot be the bar, I think,” Kumar added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/serosurvey-reveals-underreporting-of-covid-19-deaths-in-7-districts-912291.html

06-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||We have already won, says Karnataka CM B S Yediyurappa on polls||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Friday declared victory for the BJP in the legislative council elections and the two assembly bypolls. "We have already won by a large margin...It'll be clear to all on November 10," he told reporters. Two graduates' and two teachers' constituencies of the Legislative Council went to polls on October 28. The Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar assembly segments voted on November 3. Their results will be out on November 10. "If I say something, I will have thought about it a 100 times. My predictions till date have been accurate. This time, too, we will win by a large margin," Yediyurappa said. To a question on the expansion of his Cabinet, the CM said that he was awaiting the bypoll results. "I will try and get clearance for the Cabinet expansion by contacting the high command over the phone after the results are out. If required, I will go to Delhi on November 11 and finalise the Cabinet expansion," he said. Earlier this week, Yediyurappa and BJP national president JP Nadda spoke over phone to discuss the election results and the Cabinet rejig. Yediyurappa is learnt to have told Nadda that delaying the Cabinet expansion further would be troublesome. The CM made a case for accommodating into this Cabinet those who helped the BJP come to power. “It will be good if a decision is taken soon,” Yediyurappa told Nadda, sources said. There are six berths vacant in the 34-member Cabinet. Yediyurappa will have to accommodate MLCs MTB Nagaraj, H Vishwanath and R Shankar - rebels who helped the BJP come to power. If Munirathna wins the Rajarajeshwarinagar bypoll, he could make it in. Plus, Yediyurappa will have to keep space for Pratapgouda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The CM has also publicly assured a berth for 8-time MLA Umesh Katti, who is sulking. There are several others who are vying to become ministers. Some within the party opine that the Cabinet expansion was delayed because of differing stances taken by Yediyurappa and the party’s top brass. While Yediyurappa prefers an expansion, the top brass wants to promote fresh faces through a reshuffle keeping the next election in mind.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/we-have-already-won-says-karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-on-polls-912163.html

The advocate representing CBI had sought the three-day CBI custody citing that the probe agency needs to elicit more information from the ex-minister on the case. However, the counsel representing Vinay argued that his petitioner was co-operating with the CBI team and had appeared before them for questioning on Thursday, thereby, there was no need for CBI custody. After hearing both the sides, Judge Panchakshari M remanded Vinay Kulkarni to three-day CBI custody and directed the investigating team to produce Vinay before the court on November 9. For security reasons, Vinay will continue to be lodged at Hindalga jail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/ex-minister-vinay-kulkarni-sent-to-three-day-cbi-custody-912276.html
06-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||DA case against CT Ravi: HC remands matter to trial court||The High Court of Karnataka has remanded the corruption case against BJP leader C T Ravi to the trial court with a direction to allow the private complainant to file an affidavit, as mandated by the Supreme Court. The bench said the complainant may also file the complaint to the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB). Ravi, Chikkamagalur MLA and BJP general secretary, had moved the petition praying to quash the entire proceedings in the disproportionate assets case against him.  The petition challenged the procedure followed by the special court in referring a private complaint about the investigation to the ACB. The private complaint was filed in 2012, but the order for the investigation was passed in 2016. The petition said that the procedure, adopted by the special court, is contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Priyanka Srivastava’s case. The Supreme Court-mandated recording of the sworn affidavit by the complainant before passing the order for the investigation so that the magistrate could verify the truth of the allegations and also obviate false and irresponsible complaints being filed. The counsel for the ACB argued that the complaint was filed much earlier to the law laid down by the Supreme Court (2015) and non-filing of the affidavit does not amount to an illegality. Justice John Michael Cunha held that since the private complaint prayed for the investigation under section 156 (3) of CrPC, the law, laid down by the Supreme Court, comes into force. The court observed that considering the mandatory nature of the direction, the coordinate bench of the High Court has directed the registry to send a copy of the judgment to the Law Commission for bringing about necessary amendment. “Until the said amendment is brought about, the directions given by the Honourable Supreme Court are required to be followed as the law of the land,” the court said. The court remanded the matter to the special court to grant an opportunity to the complainant to file his affidavit. “It is also open to the complainant to file the complaint, if need be, before the Anti-Corruption Bureau, as the allegations pertain to the offences under Prevention of Corruption Act,” the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/da-case-against-ct-ravi-hc-remands-matter-to-trial-court-912284.html
06-11-2020||National||All insults against SC/STs can't be offence: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday declared that an offence under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is not established merely on the fact that the complainant is a member of Scheduled Caste.  The court said that it has to be proved that there is an intention to humiliate such a member for the reason that the victim belongs to such caste. "All insults or intimidations to a person will not be an offence under the Act unless such insult or intimidation is on account of victim belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe," a three-judge bench presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao said. The bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, pointed out the object of the law is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as they are denied a number of civil rights.  "Thus, an offence under the Act would be made out when a member of the vulnerable section of the society is subjected to indignities, humiliations and harassment," Justice Gupta said in a judgement authored by him on behalf of the bench. The court also pointed out another key ingredient of the provision under Section 3(1)(r) is insult or intimidation has to be in “any place within public view”. The top court passed its judgement, quashing the charge sheet to the extent of offence under the special law against petitioner Hemant Verma and others. "In the present case, the parties are litigating over possession of the land. The allegation of hurling of abuses is against a person who claims title over the property. If such a person happens to be a Scheduled Caste, the offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act is not made out," the court said. It also pointed out the offence was alleged to have taken place within the four walls of the building, which can't be said to be in public view. The court further said that the assertion of title over the land by either of the parties was not due to either the indignities, humiliations or harassment.  "Every citizen has a right to avail their remedies in accordance with the law. Therefore, if the appellant or his family members have invoked the jurisdiction of the civil court, or that they have invoked the jurisdiction of the civil court, then the parties are availing their remedies in accordance with the procedure established by law. Such action is not for the reason that the complainant is member of Scheduled Caste," the court said. It said the object of the Act is to punish the violators who inflict indignities, humiliations and harassment and commit the offence as defined under Section 3 of the Act. The Act is thus intended to punish the acts of the upper caste against the vulnerable section of the society for the reason that they belong to a particular community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-insults-against-sc/sts-cant-be-offence-sc-911858.html

06-11-2020||National||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', may improve slightly||The national capital recorded its air quality in the “very poor” category on Friday morning, while government agencies said it is likely to improve slightly in the next 24 hours. On Thursday, the city's air quality had dropped to the worst levels since December last year, with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far. Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions – calm winds and low temperatures – and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states pushed the air quality index to the “severe” zone on Thursday, the first time since January. However, higher wind speed picked up later, helping in dispersion of pollutants. Delhi's air quality index (AQI) stood at 397 at 9 am. On Thursday, the 24-hour average AQI was 450, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 458. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurugram and Noida also recorded “very poor” to “severe” air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 414 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am, down from 563 at 10 am on Thursday -- the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.  The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were reduced to 228 µg/m3 at 9 am from 360 µg/m3 at 12 noon on Thursday. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.  The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest this season so far. SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction is northwesterly – favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires. “The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per centfor Thursday,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-may-improve-slightly-911981.html

Asserting that India would not accept any shift in the Line of Actual Control's position, General Rawat said that the possibility of border confrontations, transgressions and unprovoked tactical military actions spiralling into a larger conflict couldn't be discounted. "Even though the Chinese People's Liberation Army faced unanticipated consequences for its misadventure in eastern Ladakh because of the firm and strong responses by the Indian armed forces, the situation along the LAC remained tense," he noted. The comments from India's topmost military official came on a day when senior military commanders from India and China met for the eight-time to explore new ways to deescalate the tension at the LAC that witnessed firings from both sides for the first time since the 1962 India-China war. "Our posturing is unambiguous. We will not accept any shifting of the LAC," said Gen Rawat addressing a webinar organised by the National Defence College, Delhi celebrating its diamond jubilee. On the security challenges surrounding the western front, the CDS said the unabated proxy war unleashed by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir coupled with vicious anti-India rhetoric took between the two countries to a new low. "The surgical strikes after the Uri attack and Balakot airstrikes have delivered a strong message that Pakistan no longer enjoys the impunity of pushing terrorists across the LoC under the nuclear bogey. The new Indian template to deal with terrorism has injected ambiguity and uncertainty in Pakistan,” he said. Gen Rawat said Pakistan would continue to profess that Kashmir is their unfinished agenda notwithstanding internal problems, failing economy, international isolation and vitiated civil-military relations. "And their Army will continue to raise the bogey of an existential threat from India to justify their disproportionately large strength and need for funds to maintain its warfighting capabilities," said General Rawat. Constant friction with two nuclear-armed neighbours, Gen Rawat said, posed a danger of regional strategic instability with the potential for escalation as the two countries were in collusion. "Furthermore, China's ever-expanding military maritime footprint in the Indo-Pacific region was also a matter of concern as India would witness China's aggressive pursuit of its hegemonic interests," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/will-not-accept-any-shift-in-line-of-actual-control-general-bipin-rawat-912002.html

Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notice to the CBI and also asked the agency to respond to Sengar’s application seeking suspension of the sentence till the pendency of the appeal. The high court listed the matter for further hearing on November 10. Sengar, who was also sentenced to the "remainder of his natural biological life" for raping the minor Unnao girl, was stripped of his membership on February 25 as the lawmaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly following his conviction in the rape case. The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in the Arms Act and had died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities in custody. On March 4, Sengar, his brother and five others were convicted for the death of the victim's father in judicial custody by the trial court which on March 13, sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Sengar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unnao-custodial-death-case-hc-asks-cbi-to-reply-to-disqualified-bjp-mlas-appeal-against-jail-912011.html

Mohammad Abdulla Azam Khan, son of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, was disqualified as an MLA by the HC after finding him underage at the time of the Assembly elections in 2017. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian stayed the HC order. The HC declared his election as void on December 16, 2019, finding irregularity in the declaration of his date of birth. His petition challenging the HC's order is pending before the top court. However, recently, acting on a writ petition, the HC directed the Election Commission to start the process for holding bypolls in the constituency as no interim order was passed by the top court on Khan's plea. Both Khan and the EC moved the top court against the HC's order. Khan contended that despite the pendency of his petition before the Supreme Court, Allahabad High Court has shown "an unusual haste" and directed the Election Commission to hold the byelections. Notably, the HC had taken a very serious view of the failure of the EC to hold bypolls in the Assembly constituency as seats remained vacant since December 2019. "Will of the people is supreme in a democracy and it cannot be lightly interfered with. The EC, under no circumstance, can frustrate the will of the people. This court, which is a custodian of the Constitution, cannot be a silent spectator in a case of this nature where the EC has failed to exercise its powers in a manner which has the effect of destroying or making erosion into the democratic setup, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution," the HC had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-hcs-order-on-bypolls-to-constituency-held-by-azam-khans-son-912037.html
06-11-2020||National||Indian Army chief Gen Naravane calls on Nepal PM Oli||Indian Army chief Gen. M M Naravane on Friday called on Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and discussed bilateral relations, officials here said. The meeting between Naravane and Oli, who is also the Defence Minister of Nepal, took place at his official residence in Baluwatar, the Nepal Army sources said. Gen Naravane, who is here on a three-day visit, earlier in the day enjoyed a mountain flight during which he had a brief stopover at Syangboche airport, the gateway to the world's highest peak Mount Everest, they said. The Chief of Army Staff also addressed the middle-level student officers at the Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri on the outskirts of Kathmandu. During the interaction, he shared his experience with the student officers, they said. On Thursday, Gen Naravane was conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari at a special ceremony, a decades-old tradition that reflects the strong ties between the two militaries. His visit is largely aimed at resetting the bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row early this year. It was the first high-level visit from India to Kathmandu since ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory. Nepal had protested after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal claimed that the road passed through its territory. Days later, it came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. India's decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region. Gen Naravane is scheduled to leave for home on Friday afternoon.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-army-chief-gen-naravane-calls-on-nepal-pm-oli-912046.html
06-11-2020||National||Indian, Chinese armies hold eighth round of military talks on Ladakh standoff||The Indian Army on Friday strongly insisted on early disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh at the eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks between the two sides that primarily focused on a roadmap for the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the region, according to people familiar with the developments. The talks began at around 9:30 am in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and ended at 7 PM, they said. "The Indian side insisted on early restoration of status quo ante of April and comprehensive disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points to resolve the row," said one of the persons cited above. When asked about the six-month-long military standoff, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing that both sides continue to maintain close communication at the military and diplomatic levels to achieve complete disengagement along the LAC. "The two sides are guided by the leaders’ consensus to jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas. We will continue to maintain the dialogue with the Chinese side to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution to the current situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh," he said. In the last few days, the top military brass of India held a series of meetings where the overall situation in eastern Ladakh was reviewed and it was decided to press for comprehensive disengagement of the troops at talks with China. The seventh round of Corps Commander-level talks took place on October 12 during which the Chinese People's Liberation Army(PLA) pressed for withdrawal of Indian troops from a number of strategic heights around the Southern bank of Pangong lake. However, India maintained that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points. Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff. China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May. Last week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said ties between India and China have come under "severe stress" and that the agreements inked by both sides on the management of the border must be respected "scrupulously" in their "entirety" to restore normalcy in relations. The Indian delegation at the eighth round of military talks was led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the newly-appointed Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps. Naveen Srivastava, Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the Ministry of External Affairs, was also part of the Indian delegation. At the seventh round of talks, both sides had agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement "as early as possible". India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region. Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters. The sixth round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave. The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-chinese-armies-hold-eighth-round-of-military-talks-on-ladakh-standoff-912051.html

The minister also cited the country's "diverse" nature in terms of regional languages to stress the benefits of having primary education in a child's mother tongue. Speaking at the inaugural session of Amity University's two-day conference on "Implementation of National Education Policy 2020 for Transforming India", he said there is awareness and excitement regarding the implementation of the NEP not only in the county but also globally. "The new education policy connects the past with the future and focuses on leading India to the top," Pokhriyal said. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, he said the country is resolved to achieve its objective in education. "If you look at the NEP from a wider horizon, the policy is as national as it is international. It is impactful, inclusive and interactive. The new education policy stands firm on the foundations of equity, quality and accessibility," he said.  He said the NEP promotes mother tongue as mode of education because it is considered that no other language can provide expression to a person as much as one's mother tongue. "Primary education will be in mother tongue and later one may switch to other languages," Pokhriyal added. Noting that some people had raised doubts over the global appeal of the new policy vis-a-vis use of English, he asked if countries like Japan, Germany, France, and Israel have lagged behind others just because they stuck to their mother tongue. "These arguments do not make any sense," he said, stressing the importance of education in mother tongue in a "diverse" country like India with several regional languages. "This is not one man's or one government's education policy, it is the education policy of a country which has provided leadership to the world," Pokhriyal added. The minister told the audience, including vice chancellors of various universities and UGC officials, that the implementation of the policy is as crucial as the policy itself.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-education-policy-based-on-equity-quality-accessibility-pokhriyal-912052.html

Bhalla, however, also made it clear that the government is making special safeguards to ensure safety and security of the country's communication network. "On 5G, the government in any case has not taken any call. Discussions are still on...when it will be allowed and who are the people to be allowed. Point is very valid. The penetration of existing telecom hardware and software is too extensive," he said at the Diamond Jubilee webinar organised by National Defence College. He was replying to a question on participation of Chinese telecom players in India's 5G trials. The home secretary said unless India gets a substitute, the existing facilities cannot be closed down abruptly. "Unless we have a substitute available, we just can't switch off and say that this will not be allowed. But the government can definitely make special safeguards and ensure the safety and security of the system of communication of the country. That we are having and we are developing and we will definitely be able to deal with that," he said. The US has banned Huawei, the world's leader in telecom equipment and the number two smartphone producer, over concerns of security and Washington has been putting pressure on other countries to restrict the operations of the Chinese telecom firm. India, however, is yet to take a call on whether it intends to place curbs on Huawei or allow the Chinese telecom equipment maker to participate in the upcoming 5G trials. Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had earlier said India has its security issues over allowing Huawei to participate in the upcoming 5G trials. "We will take a firm view on it. There are also security issues...it is not only a matter of technology, as regard their participation in 5G is concerned...Participation of 5G is not conditional upon the trial being started. Whether a particular company is allowed to participate or not, is a complex question, including security issues," he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-yet-to-take-call-on-chinas-entry-into-5g-penetration-in-existing-network-extensive-bhalla-912053.html

She belongs to the country's lowest caste, the Dalits. At 35, the Chennai-based communications executive has been forced to repeatedly change jobs to escape persistent discrimination and has battled stress-related health issues. A sixth of India's 1.3-billion population are Dalits, whose low status in Hinduism's hereditary social hierarchy exposes them to daily violence and abuse. India's President Ram Nath Kovind is Dalit, as was B.R. Ambedkar, architect of its constitution, yet as researchers, activists and HR professionals reveal, caste-related stigma remains pervasive across the corporate sector. The centuries-old scourge has even hit Silicon Valley, where tech giant Cisco is facing a caste discrimination lawsuit. With a master's in communications, Padavattan -- not her real name -- seemed set for the fast-track when she joined one of India's oldest conglomerates in 2008. But as soon as upper-caste colleagues realised that she belonged to a community once considered "untouchable", the taunts began, she told AFP. By the age of 29, she already had high blood pressure from stress. "India lives and breathes caste. Whether you realise it or not, your caste is chasing you from the time you are born," she said. A senior colleague called her a peasant for dropping a fork while others from the traditionally vegetarian Brahmin upper caste berated her for eating beef. A belief in so-called upper-caste purity -- enforced through religious rituals, food habits and segregationist practices -- has long been central to Hinduism. Dalits were barred from temples and schools and forced into "unclean" jobs such as sanitation. The upper-caste stranglehold on economic opportunity remains strong. In 2009, Indian and US academics conducted a hiring experiment and found that candidates with upper-caste surnames were nearly twice as likely as Dalits to be called for interviews. A 2012 study by Canada-based researchers said that 93 percent of board members in India's top 1,000 businesses belonged to upper castes, which make up less than 15 percent of the population. And last year, a US study of 4,005 leading Indian firms found that Dalits and other marginalised groups accounted for just three out of 35,000 directorships. Few Dalits ever make it as far as Padavattan, who lost promotions to junior colleagues and was advised to leave by some HR managers. Even multinational firms revealed the same rot, she said. "The trouble with the diversity and inclusion initiatives in these companies is that it is all lifted from foreign contexts," said Christina Dhanaraj, who advises social media platform Smashboard on caste diversity. Multinational firms are "looking at gender and sexuality, but not caste", she told AFP. "It is hard enough to get hired as a Dalit, much less rise in a corporate hierarchy dominated by upper castes." Dalits are at such a disadvantage that many hide their identities, she added. Most are reluctant to speak out, fearing reprisals. When AFP reached out to Dalit professionals, nearly all declined interviews.     The issue is exacerbated by the refusal of India's private sector to maintain caste data. "This ensures you have no sense of the magnitude of the problem. It reinforces inequality," said Hari Bapuji, professor of strategy and international business at the University of Melbourne. Many Indians believe caste discrimination only exists in remote villages, not in their everyday life. From coming-of-age ceremonies celebrating the higher status of Brahmin males to vegetarian restaurants advertising "pure" food, caste turns up everywhere, Bapuji told AFP. Upper-caste Indians who express horror at crimes targeting Dalits often see nothing wrong with practices like arranged marriage, which strengthen caste ties. Even affirmative action, aimed at helping lower-caste groups access higher education and government jobs, is used as a weapon against its beneficiaries, fuelling the notion that they are less qualified. Indian industry has largely resisted affirmative action-based hiring, saying it would hurt competitiveness, and focused on providing scholarships and training to marginalised youth. Sougata Choudhury, who handles affirmative action initiatives for the Confederation of Indian Industry, denied there was caste discrimination. "Companies have to be allowed to work instead of pushing some inclusion agenda," he told AFP. But experts such as Bapuji say diversity is crucial "if businesses want to understand the needs of the market and grow". The lawsuit against Cisco could prove a wake-up call for Silicon Valley, where more than 250 Dalits have contacted civil rights group Equality Labs to report discrimination at companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. In India though, few are holding their breath. "Even terrible crimes against Dalits go unnoticed here," said Padavattan. "But we have to keep fighting."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/caste-discrimination-taints-corporate-india-912056.html

An RTI applicant, Gurvinder Singh Chadha, had demanded from the Union Home Ministry list of all the material seized during the operation and its present status as well as all records related to the operation and list of all the persons who died during the operation conducted by the Army to flush out militants holed up inside the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Without giving the list and the specific details of the seized material, the ministry had said in its RTI response to Chadha that "about 4000 documents/books/files and gold /gold ornaments, silver/silver ornaments, precious stones currency, coins etc. were recovered by a central agency during the Operation Blue Star. The articles and documents were handed over either to SGPC or to the Government of Punjab”. "As per records available with this office, 493 terrorists/civilians and 83 Army officials were killed in Golden Temple area in June, 1984," the home ministry further said. Dissatisfied with the denial of specific information about the seized material, Chadha filed first appeal within the ministry before a senior official who upheld the denial of information invoking Section 8 1(a) of the RTI Act. The Section allows the government to withhold information, disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence. During the second appeal before the Central Information Commission, highest adjudication body in RTI matters, Chadha stated that a satisfactory response was not yet provided on points related to records of Operation Blue Star and a list of material seized during it. The ministry said a point wise response was provided to Chadha but the details sought pertained to confidential information, the disclosure of which could prejudicially affect the safety and security of the country. Agreeing with the home ministry’s view, Information Commissioner Y K Sinha held Chadha has sought "vague, ambiguous and generic information" which cannot be disclosed in terms of the provisions of the RTI Act, 2005.  "Hence, no further intervention of the Commission is warranted in the matter," Sinha said. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has been demanding the return of the artefacts, allegedly taken away by the Army during Operation Blue Star in 1984. Last year in June, SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh had said the holy scriptures, artefacts and historical books, which were part of the Sikh Reference Library, were taken away by the Army during the operation. When asked that a section of media had reported that the Centre had returned the artefacts to the SGPC, Singh had claimed that only a few copies of historical books were returned. He had said still a large quantity of material and handwritten copies of the Guru Granth Sahib were with the Centre.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cic-allows-centre-to-withhold-list-of-documents-precious-material-seized-during-operation-blue-star-912085.html

The submission was made in context of recent reportage on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and PILs calling for restrain on media coverage of the high-profile case. Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh told a bench that there existed adequate statutory as well as self-regulatory mechanism for the media, including TV news channels, to follow while printing or broadcasting any news items. The ASG was responding to previous queries posed by the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni while hearing a bunch of PILs seeking that the press, particularly television news channels, be restrained in their reportage on the death of Rajput. The PILs, filed through senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, by activists, private citizens and a group of retired police officers, had also sought that TV news channels be stopped from conducting a media trial into the case. Last month, the bench had asked the Union government if there existed any statutory mechanism to regulate the content broadcast by the electronic media akin to the regulatory mechanism exercised by the Press Council of India for the print media. The bench had also asked at the time if there existed any vacuum in law on the issue, and had asked the Union government to clarify if the high court had the jurisdiction to frame guidelines for the same. On Friday, Singh said while the HC had the requisite jurisdiction, there was no need for any new statutory mechanism or guidelines to be framed for the electronic media. He said besides the statutory mechanisms that included the guidelines of the Programme Code of the Cable TV Network Act, an aggrieved party also had the option of invoking the court's intervention through the law of defamation, or the Contempt of Courts Act. "There is statutory and self-regulatory mechanism in place. The Programme Code specifically states that transmission is allowed only if it confers with the code," Singh said. "I am submitting that on the point of guidelines, there is already a mechanism in place," the ASG said. He said that while the court could exercise its jurisdiction to frame new guidelines, the trouble would be in implementing such rules. Singh added that the Contempt of Courts Act could be invoked in a case in pre-trial stage, too. He said that prejudicial media reporting at the stage of investigation could amount to contempt of court if it interfered with the administration of justice. "It (the Contempt of Courts Act) can be invoked from the time that an FIR is registered and trial becomes imminent," Singh said. "This is the view taken by the Supreme Court," he said. "Today this high court frames guidelines, tomorrow, if another high court frames guidelines, and then another one does too, how will the guidelines be implemented?" Singh said. Senior advocate Arvind Datar, who appeared for the National Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA), an independent body set up by the National Broadcasters Association to look into complaints, said there was no shortage of regulatory framework at present. Datar assured the court that the NBSA would soon come out with guidelines on media reportage on a case after registration of an FIR. On previous hearings, private TV news channels, that are a party to the case, had argued that the self-regulatory mechanism was adequate and that no new mechanism or guidelines were required to control the media. On Friday, the HC closed all arguments in the case and reserved its verdict.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-legal-void-to-regulate-tv-news-content-centre-to-hc-912101.html

In "Social Protection: Lands of Blossoming Hope", development expert Hayes uses an insider's knowledge to examine and dissect the level of interest and also assess the drivers and influencers, namely those who occupy key positions overseeing the processing and promotion of social schemes, and identifying obstacles. She says her book "recounts our triumphs and follies - it's about those of us, the indefatigable UN staffers, who have been driven by the zeal of 'making a difference'. It is about our naivety, our errors as well as our drive, passion, perseverance and commitment". According to UNICEF, social protection is key to inclusive growth and development, and is defined broadly as a "set of public and private policies and programmes aimed at preventing, reducing and eliminating economic and social vulnerabilities to poverty and deprivation". The book takes note of the experiences and reforms within the two largest social protection schemes in India - the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) - and calls them major poverty targeting programmes. NREGA, it says, is the "big success story of recent times" in India. "This is a fully home-grown model, built on the back of decades-long efforts towards home-based relief and poverty reduction programmes. NREGA has been a success and has provided protection from starvation to vulnerable sections of the population," the book, brought out by Palimpsest Publishing House, says. Hayes argues that while its contribution to food security and other development outcomes has been well-established, the project often has created socially and economically useful infrastructure for the community and contributed to its overall development. She also says that it will be pertinent here to take a "look at India's urban poverty since there has been a strong trend among the rural poor to migrate to the cities looking for livelihood". "In response to this emerging situation, there is a determined move to replace the take-home ration scheme with cash transfers. The government is working with the UNICEF and the WB in order to achieve this," Hayes writes. She says having subscribed to a global agenda, countries are embarking on expansion, consolidation and reform of existing social protection measures.    She is of the view that the road to setting up a national social protection system is never an easy one, especially in a country like India that has established large-scale social safety nets and social protection programmes. Many countries like India and the UK have enacted legislations to address the basic needs like health, education, income and food, she says. On Afghanistan, Hayes writes that the first thing that struck her there was how a well-designed UNICEF programme could still work effectively and yield results in a war-ravaged, extremely fragile social environment. Afghanistan provides a powerful and inspiring example of setting up of a social protection system in a fragile environment, she says. "Starting with a modest beginning by the UNICEF and the World Bank, the country has by now been able to set up a regular, predictable, cash-based social protection programme in 100 districts (one-fifth of the total districts in the country," the book says. "Many positive government policies and practices do not originate in a country's strategic development planning process. They begin as pilots, as an experiment to test their relevance and effectiveness, and are then gradually given the appropriate policy space," it says.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nrega-big-success-story-in-recent-times-un-advisor-912109.html

New ration cards are regularly issued to genuine and rightfully eligible beneficiaries or households against the deleted ration cards, it said in a statement. In a statement, the Union food ministry said that amid the technology-driven reforms to modernise the PDS, a total of about 4.39 crore ineligible or bogus ration cards have been weeded out in the country during the period from 2013 to 2020 so far by the state governments. To bring transparency and improve efficiency in PDS, the government has digitised beneficiaries' database and made it mandatory the seeding of Aadhaar number that has helped detect ineligible and bogus rations cards. It has also helped to weed out de-duplication of digitised data and migration or deaths of beneficiaries during the run-up to the implementation of NFSA, it added. Under the NFSA, the central government is providing foodgrains to states for distribution to 81.35 crore people via a public distribution system (PDS), also known as ration shops, at a subsidised rate of Rs 2 per kg rice and Rs 3 per kg wheat, costing over Rs 1 lakh crore annually to the exchequer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-weeds-out-439-cr-bogus-ration-cards-under-nfsa-from-2013-to-2020-912110.html

A team of experts is scouting for sites to set up vaccination booths for administering Covid-19 vaccines beyond healthcare facilities to ensure the speedy rollout of the vaccine. The Covid-19 vaccination drive is expected to run parallel to the existing universal immunisation programme and the government is planning to harness the same infrastructure to monitor the inoculation drive.  The Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) would be used for the distribution and delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine. The same network would be used to send SMS to the recipients of the vaccine conveying the date and time of the vaccination drive and monitor their response. Three vaccines are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which two are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III trials. Indian Scientists and Research Teams are also collaborating and strengthening the research capacities in neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Officials from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar and Bhutan have also requested for conducting clinical trials in their countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a review meeting on vaccine delivery on October 17, had directed officials not to limit efforts to India’s immediate neighbourhood but also reach out to the entire world in providing vaccines, medicines and IT platforms for vaccine delivery system. The prime minister has also asked officials to utilise the experience of successful conduct of elections and disaster management in the country for putting in place vaccine delivery and administration systems. The Covid-19 vaccine, once available, would be distributed under a special inoculation programme, using the processes, technology and network of the existing UIP. The Centre will procure the vaccine directly to make it available to the priority groups through the existing network of states and districts. The Centre has also started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries who would be given the vaccine in the initial phase. Four categories, including around one crore healthcare professionals, around two crore frontline workers, including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces, about 26 crore people aged above 50 and a special category of those below 50 with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care have been demarcated for the first phase of vaccine administration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/anganwadis-schools-panchayat-buildings-to-be-used-as-covid-19-vaccination-centres-912117.html

In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73 per cent said they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, down from 77 per cent in August. While vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87 per cent in India since August, it has declined in 10 of the 15 countries surveyed, most of all in China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil. Globally, the two main reasons for not wanting to get a Covid-19 vaccine are concerns about side effects (cited by 34 per cent) and concerns about clinical trials moving too fast (cited by another 33 per cent). In India also, 34 per cent respondents said they are worried about side effects, while 16 per cent are concerned about fast-moving trials. Besides, one in ten persons globally said they are against vaccines in general (19 per cent in India), while another 10 per cent said they don't think a vaccine will be effective (14 per cent in India), and 8 per cent cited a low risk of getting Covid-19 (14 per cent in India), as per the survey. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said the latest survey has shown a growing reluctance to receive a vaccine, despite progress made by numerous pharmaceutical companies working on vaccine trials and international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi and CEPI working to ensure any future solution is available for those most in need. Arnaud Bernaert, Head of Shaping the Future of Health and Healthcare at the WEF, said, "This drop in vaccine confidence is a remarkable and sad trend as we edge closer to a possible vaccine roll-out." "The numbers are significant enough to compromise the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine to manage the disease and to see an end to the cycle of new lockdowns and restrictions. It is critical that governments and the private sector come together to build trust in the next steps. It's important to know that when a vaccine is ready, it will make a difference," Bernaert added. The survey also asked the respondents how soon after a vaccine becomes available would they get one. Nearly half of the adults globally said they would get vaccinated within three months after the Covid-19 vaccine is available to all (54 per cent in India). Globally, 72 per cent said they would get vaccinated within a year (82 per cent in India). The WHO had called 'public hesitancy towards vaccination' as one of the top-10 threats to global health in 2019, affecting not only public health but businesses and economies also. The survey was conducted by leading market research company Ipsos from October 8-13, 2020, with a sample of 18,526 adults in the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and the UK. The survey also put Indians as being the second most optimistic about availability of a Covid-19 vaccine soon -- 34 per cent expecting it within three months and 72 per cent within six months. China topped the chart with 37 per cent expecting a vaccine in three months and 75 per cent in six months. Globally, 16 per cent expect the first vaccine for general use in three months and 45 per cent in six months. More than 4.8 crore people have tested positive for the virus so far globally, while more than 12 lakh have died. India's COVID-19 caseload has crossed past 84 lakh, while nearly 1.25 lakh have died.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-tops-global-survey-on-covid-19-vaccination-intent-rising-hesitancy-in-many-other-countries-912121.html

The minister said he is scheduled to make an hour-long presentation on EVs before the Chief Justice of India post-Diwali. India has the potential to become the largest EV producer in the world in the next five years. However, Indian manufacturers prefer to wait and watch and are late in participating in any global competition, he said addressing a virtual "Electric Mobility Conference 2020 - The Spark Revolution in India" by industry body Ficci. Assuring help from thr Centre for the growth of the industry, the minister do admitted that significant EV-specific concerns persist like on batteries, charging, and driving range that prevent a large-scale consumer pull, but these issues being addressed rapidly. He expressed concerns over the fact that India needs to import oil to cover over 80 per cent of its transport fuel, saying import of crude is a big economic problem. "Air pollution is a million-dollar problem. We need to find an integrated approach to it. Transport sector alone was responsible for 18 per cent energy demand and 70 per cent of it was met through imported crude oil," Gadkari said. Terming EVs as a solution to it, he said 22 new green expressways are planned, including Bangalore-Chennai - which will be completed in three years. He said the government is committed to provide all help to EV makers and 100 per cent GST subsidy has already been offered. He exhorted people to come forward to use such vehicles for rental or personal use to promote and support the EV industry. The extensive use of small vehicles such as two-wheelers, three-wheelers gives greater opportunities to manufacture these vehicles in the EV segment. One challenge for the wide usage of EV technology is the affordability of batteries with efficient technology, but has seen enormous technological advancement in recent years, in both improving battery performance and reducing cost, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitin-gadkari-asks-automakers-to-reduce-ev-cost-forgo-profit-initially-to-capture-market-912122.html

MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Aftab Hassan Khan, the Pakistani CDA, was categorically told that the decision by Pakistan is "highly condemnable" and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. Pakistan has decided to transfer the management and maintenance of the gurudwara from the Pakistan Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandhak Committee to the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board, a non-Sikh body. "The CDA of the Pakistan High Commission was summoned and our strong protest was conveyed. It was also conveyed to him that this unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor as also the religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large," Srivastana said. India has received representations from the Sikh community, expressing "grave concern" over the decision by Pakistan targeting the rights of the minority Sikh community in that country, he said. "Pakistan is called upon to reverse its arbitrary decision to deprive the Sikh minority community it’s right to manage affairs of the Holy Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib," said Srivastava. In the midst of heightened tension between the two countries, the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India with Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan was thrown open in November, in a historic people-to-people initiative. Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur. The relations between the two countries nosedived after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two union territories. The corridor was shut in March in view of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-summon-pakistan-diplomat-over-gurudwara-kartarpur-sahib-912131.html

The message was delivered by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla during an interaction with ambassadors and high commissioners of foreign missions in India. "Several countries have been approaching us for receiving vaccine supply. I reiterate our Prime Minister's commitment that India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis. India will also help interested countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines," he said. The interaction was organised to provide the envoys an outline of the Covid-19 vaccine development programme in India, delivery system management and ongoing international cooperation on it. Shringla said India is on track to develop the vaccines. "We are exploring the possibility of conducting phase three trials in a few of our partner countries. We are also looking forward to research collaboration in the field of vaccine development. Based on willingness, we may also go for joint production of vaccines in some countries," he said. "We have already conducted online training sessions for nearly 90 participants from eight neighbouring countries to develop capacity in clinical trials and clinical practices. Based on demand, we can conduct more such training courses," he added. To give a flavour of India's "robust and resilient" progress in vaccine development and the trial process, the foreign secretary said that the government is planning to take a delegation of resident envoys for a tour of vaccine and diagnostic facilities in Pune. Talking about the Covid-19 infection in India, he said the daily caseload has reduced to below 50,000 from around 1,00,000 a few weeks ago. "We remain vigilant though, and continue to devise and re-devise strategies based on our experiences across India," he said. Shringla said India's recovery rate is now 91.96 per cent (as on November 3, 2020) and case fatality rate has dropped to 1.49 per cent due to increase in testing numbers, contact tracing, effective isolation protocol, efficient use of hospital beds, increased availability of medical equipment, testing kits and sustained public awareness campaign. "With progressively falling positivity rate, testing has worked as an effective tool to limit the spread of infection," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-ready-to-help-countries-in-covid-19-vaccine-production-delivery-foreign-secretary-shringla-912138.html

M M Naravane who paid a courtesy call on him. Gen Naravane's three-day visit to Nepal was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries. The meeting between Gen Naravane and Oli, who is also the Defence Minister of Nepal, took place at his official residence in Baluwatar, Nepal Army sources said. Prime Minister Oli said that “there has been good friendship between Nepal and India,” according to his foreign affairs advisor Rajan Bhattarai. Oli expressed hope that the “problems between the two countries would be resolved through dialogue,” Bhattarai said in a tweet after the meeting. During the meeting, the Prime Minister mentioned the centuries-old special relations existing between Nepal and India, and the tradition of conferring Honorary General of Army on each other’s Army chiefs, Bhattarai said. Gen Naravane's engagements in Nepal included a visit to the headquarters of the Nepalese Army and attending a banquet hosted in his honour by chief of Nepalese Army Gen Purna Chandra Thapa. On Thursday, the two Army chiefs held talks and discussed ways to boost bilateral military cooperation. The Chief of Army Staff, who arrived here on Wednesday, earlier in the day enjoyed a mountain flight during which he had a brief stopover at Syangboche airport, the gateway to the world's highest peak Mount Everest, they said. Gen Naravane also addressed the middle-level student officers at the Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri on the outskirts of Kathmandu. During the interaction, he shared his experience with the student officers, they said. On Thursday, Gen Naravane was conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari at a special ceremony, a decades old tradition that reflects the strong ties between the two militaries. The Army chief's visit is the first high-level trip from India to Kathmandu since ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory. Nepal had protested after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal claimed that the road passed through its territory. Days later, it came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. India's decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region. Last month, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on an important visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmarese Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/problems-between-nepal-india-would-be-resolved-through-dialogue-pm-oli-to-indian-army-chief-912141.html

From registering more than 73,000 average daily new cases in the first week of October, the average daily new cases have declined to 46,000 cases.    According to data updated at 8 am, active cases are also on a sustained decline as a result of continuously rising recoveries. The active cases stand at 5,20,773 as on date and now comprise only 6.19 per cent of the total Covid-19 caseload, it stated. A total of 54,157 Covid-19 patients have recovered and were discharged in a span of 24 hours as against 47,638 new infections being reported during the same period.   The recoveries have surged to 77,65,966 and exceed active cases by 72,45,193 as on date.

Mohammad Abdulla Azam Khan, son of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, was disqualified as an MLA by the HC, which found him underage at the time of Assembly elections in 2017. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian stayed the HC order, after hearing senior advocates Kapil Sibal for Khan, and Rakesh Dwivedi for the EC. "Until further orders, there shall be a stay of interim direction given by the High Court to Election Commission of India to start the process for holding the by-election on the Uttar Pradesh’s State Assembly Constituency, “Suar” Rampur," the bench said. The court issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and others on Khan's petition. The HC declared Khan's election as void on December 16, 2019, finding irregularity in declaration of his date of birth. His petition challenging the HC's order is pending before the top court. However, acting on a writ petition, the HC on October 22 directed the Election Commission to start the process for holding by-poll on the constituency as no interim order was passed by the top court on Khan's plea. Both Khan and the EC moved the top court against the HC's order. Khan contended that despite pendency of his petition before the Supreme Court, Allahabad High Court has shown "an unusual haste" and directed the Election Commission to hold the by-elections. Notably, the HC had taken a very serious view of the failure of the EC to hold bypoll in the Assembly constituency as seats remained vacant since December, 2019. "Will of the people is supreme in a democracy and it cannot be lightly interfered with. The EC, under no circumstance, can frustrate the will of the people. This court, which is a custodian of the Constitution, cannot be a silent spectator in a case of this nature where the EC has failed to exercise its powers in a manner which has the effect of destroying or making erosion into the democratic setup, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution," the HC had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-stays-allahabad-hcs-order-for-holding-bypoll-in-constituency-held-by-azam-khans-son-912157.html

Most vaccines are handled in the 2C and 8C temperature range, and the Covid-19 vaccines that are currently being developed and tested require temperatures well below 0C, according to the World Health Organisation. A vaccine that does not depend on cold-chains could result in easier transportation to the country’s remote areas, as scientists claim it can be stored at 100C for 90 minutes, at 70C for about 16 hours, and at 37 for more than a month. The team is waiting for funding to begin safety and toxicity tests on humans.  "I am hopeful that after this study, newer avenues would open up with regards to having cold-chain independent vaccines," said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology. "The possibility to transport vaccines outside the cold chain for the very last mile to reach the most remote populations in resource-limited settings is very helpful. It can be particularly helpful for mass vaccination campaigns when hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses need to be transported to several vaccination points within a short period of time," said Julien Potet, policy adviser (vaccines) of Médecins Sans Frontières' Access Campaign. "India has largely managed vaccines and immunisation drives well," says B Thiagarajan, managing director of Blue Star, which has a major share of pharmaceutical cold chain products.  "When it comes to vaccines which have to be stored at temperatures between 2 to 8C, we are well equipped. If the vaccine has to be kept at -40C, there will be a problem," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/warm-covid-19-vaccine-underway-can-be-stored-at-100-degrees-celsius-for-90-min-912165.html

"The people of Amethi are very decent (sajjan). This is the reason why one family from the country got elected from here," he told reporters. Amethi has been the constituency of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was defeated by BJP’s Smriti Irani in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Union minister also claimed that development of the constituency is now taking place at a fast pace. Industrial units are being developed and this should be called as a step towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "atma nirbhar” (self-reliant) Bharat, said Balyan who was here to attend a function at the residence of BJP leader Rajesh Agrahari. To a question on the agriculture-related laws enacted by the Centre recently, he said protests over the issue are politically motivated. “Nobody has been able to tell as to where farmers' interests have been compromised. This is petty politics by the Opposition. Had the new laws been anti-farmer, I would myself have been at the forefront of the agitation,” he said. He also junked claims of inflation, saying if rates of onion go up by Re 2, then it should not be linked to the price rise. Several other BJP leaders, including UP minister Chaudhari Bhupendra Singh, MLC Vidyasagar Sonker, MP Satish Gautam, were present on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/one-family-got-elected-from-amethi-because-of-decent-people-union-minister-912171.html

Top officials of the Union environment and health ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a "permanent solution" to air pollution in the national capital and adjoining areas. In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas. The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon "steps taken for prevention of air pollution special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR." In a presentation before the panel, officials from the central government expressed concern over the threat of Covid-19 spreading faster due to air pollution. "Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading Covid-19 faster. More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer," the health ministry said in the presentation to the committee. Citing a Lancet study, the health ministry said, "There is average loss of 1.7 years of life expectancy in India due to air pollution." Similarly it said in Delhi there is 1.7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually. The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019. As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days. And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days. Delhi's air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies. Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the 'severe' category. The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446. All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded 'severe' air pollution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/air-pollution-may-lead-to-faster-spread-of-covid-19-infections-officials-tell-parliamentary-panel-912174.html

He said the IT industry showed resilience during the lockdown, with up to 97 per cent of its workforce working from home or anywhere they found suitable to serve not just domestic but global clients also. "We are very excited at what happened at that point of time (during lockdown). Now it is a fact, I can't imagine going back to the old way of working and I am told by the industry as well, going back to the old ways of working is almost out of question. "It is quite possible that 75 per cent of the workforce will continue to work outside a formal office and yet be equally or more productive," Sawhney said at a Microsoft event. The government on Thursday announced simplified guidelines for BPOs and ITES companies to reduce the compliance burden on them and to facilitate "Work From Home" and "Work From Anywhere" framework. The new rules for Other Service Providers (OSPs) seek to create a friendly regime for "Work from Home" and "Work from Anywhere", while removing frequent reporting obligations for such companies. The move assumes significance as the industry had been asking for relaxations for "Work From Home" to continue on a permanent basis as the sector moves towards a blended working model in the post-Covid-19 era. Sawhney said the services being provided with the help of data centres helped everyone to work from outside office without any disruption. "Before lockdown, at least half of my work was on physical files. It took us less than 48 hours to switch over seamlessly into a system where 100 per cent of our work was digital. We started working from home, making use of video conferencing solutions," Sawhney said. Talking about the need for cyber security due to expansion of technology, Sawhney said the government is providing market support for local development of products and applications in the segment. Minister of State for Electronics and IT Sanjay Dhotre said 'Digital India' is a transformational mission of the government. "Modern technologies have unprecedentedly expanded the horizons of our public services in all sectors of our economy. Today digital platforms, remote working, online education and other such intervention are no more an option but necessity after Covid-19," Dhotre said. After developing various technology platforms, Meity is developing an artificial intelligence based natural language translation mission in collaboration with academic and research institutions, industry and start-ups, which will pave the way for voice-enabled internet in Indian languages, he added. Microsoft India President Anant Maheshwari said his company's team was stationed at data centres during the lockdown as it was notified as an essential service. With the growth in technology, India's digital transformation is driving demand for technology enabled jobs and skills across every industry and there is a need for reskilling and upskilling all of India's workforce, even the technology workforce, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/about-75-of-it-workforce-may-continue-to-work-from-outside-office-it-secretary-912184.html

Here are the top stories of November 6, 2020: Karnataka has decided to ban the bursting of firecrackers for one year starting from the upcoming Deepavali season, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa announced Friday. "We have discussed the issue of banning crackers during the Deepavali season and have decided to prohibit its use. A government order will be issued shortly," Yediyurappa said.  The cracker ban comes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Karnataka became the seventh Indian state to prohibit the use of firecrackers. States such as Rajasthan, Odisha, Sikkim, West Bengal, Delhi and Maharashtra have issued guidelines against bursting crackers during the festive season keeping the health of Covid-19 patients in mind. Indians are the keenest on getting vaccinated whenever a Covid-19 vaccine is available, even as people in 10 out of 15 countries showed a growing reluctance about getting vaccinated, according to a global survey. In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73 per cent said they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, down from 77 per cent in August. While vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87 per cent in India since August, it has declined in 10 of the 15 countries surveyed, most of all in China, Australia, Spain, and Brazil. The countdown for the November 7 launch of earth observation satellite EOS-01 along with nine international customer satellites onboard launch vehicle PSLV-C49 has begun, ISRO said on Friday. The launch is scheduled at 15:02 Hrs IST on Saturday. Indias Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its 51st mission (PSLV-C49), will launch EOS-01 as the primary satellite along with nine international customer satellites. The government on Friday said that about 4.39 crore bogus ration cards have been weeded out since 2013 for the rightful targeting of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). New ration cards are regularly issued to genuine and rightfully eligible beneficiaries or households against the deleted ration cards, it said in a statement. Stressing that there was a need to restore West Bengal's "lost glory", Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said the present "appeasement politics" in the state has hurt its age-old tradition of upholding the nation's spiritual consciousness. Maintaining that Bengal is the land of luminaries such as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Ramakrishna, and Swami Vivekananda, Shah said the state once used to be the centre of spiritual awakening in the entire country. Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Friday asked US President Donald Trump to "chill" while calling his demand to stop the counting of votes "ridiculous". Seventeen-year-old Thunberg took to Twitter to slam Trump over a tirade of unsubstantiated claims on the counting of votes posted by him on the microblogging site. The words that Thunberg used might sound vaguely familiar, especially to Trump. In December 2019, the US president had slammed Time magazine for naming Greta Thunberg as 2019 Person of the Year, saying the climate activist should "chill" and go see a movie.  US election is nearing its climax with Democrat Joe Biden inching closer to the required 270 electoral votes.

"Any action in the matter that may be taken by the defendant (Union government) shall be subject to the orders of this court. The defendant(s) shall take care to inform any recipient of any benefit of any nature that the action is provisional in the sense that it will be subject to the orders that may be passed by this court," the bench said. The bench posted the matter arising out of a petition filed by Jharkhand government, for further hearing on December 8.  Senior advocates Fali S Nariman and A M Singhvi, appearing for Jharkhand, said that cutting of trees in the area should be prohibited.  Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for an intervenor NGO ‘Jharkhand Nagrik Prayas', said that the Centre should ensure that there should not be any cutting of trees till then.  Venugopal submitted that they have already said that there will not be any cutting of trees.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/auction-of-coal-mines-are-subject-to-further-orders-sc-912217.html

The Akhil Bharatiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha had earlier condemned the petition for the removal of the Shahi Idgah mosque, built within the 13.37-acre premises of the Katra Keshav Dev temple. The organisation had said "some outsiders" are trying to disturb the peace and harmony of Mathura by raising a frivolous temple-mosque issue. The senior national general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Tirth Purohit Mahasabha, Srikant Vashishta, on Friday said the body decided to become a party to the case at a virtual meeting attended by 50 members of its national executive. He said organisation’s president Mahesh Pathak and vice-president Navin Nagar have been authorised to represent the body in the case. Earlier, a group of people had filed a suit over the 17th century mosque, which they claimed was built at the birthplace of Lord Krishna, within the 13.37-acre premises of the Katra Keshav Dev temple. A lower court had dismissed the plea after which the plaintiffs moved the district court against the order last month. The suit was filed on behalf of child deity Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman, through the "next friend" Ranjana Agnihotri and others. Next friend is a legal term for a person who represents someone directly unable to maintain a suit. The petition named the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board; Shahi Masjid Idgah Trust; Shri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust; and Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan as defendants. Vashishta said it has also been decided to hold a protest in Uttarakahnd’s Dehradun after Diwali against renaming of the “Har ki Pauri” on the bank of the Ganga in Haridwar. The organisation also requested the Uttarakhand chief minister to rescind the government’s decision of forming a Devasthan Board for noted four shrines (char dham) in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/priests-body-to-become-party-to-mathura-temple-mosque-case-912218.html

"At the end of admissions, when you count heads, the five per cent reservation/induction should have been met. You are doing that, right," a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said to the varsity. The varsity assured the court that the five per cent induction of disabled students was being met at the end of the admissions. JNU, represented by central government standing counsel Monika Arora, said it was duty bound to ensure that five per cent reservation for PWD candidates is provided and realised. The latest stand is contrary to the varsity's earlier submission that it was not achieving the mandate of five per cent induction of PWDs as provided under the law. The varsity on October 13 had conceded before the court that after the admissions were over the intake of disabled persons did not meet the five per cent quota provided under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act. In July, JNU had told the court that it has never violated the mandate of five per cent reservation for disabled students and was committed to providing it in all courses in the 2020-21 academic year. In view of the latest stand of the varsity, the high court disposed of a PIL by the Javed Abidi Foundation, which works for the welfare of disabled persons, claiming that JNU has kept less than five per cent seats for disabled category in the academic session 2020-21.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/total-induction-should-comprise-5-of-disabled-students-hc-to-jnu-912219.html

So I want to reassure each one of you that we are not going to do the sunburn even if it's not believed to be safe at that point in time," Singh told a press conference in Panaji.  "Last year we had five (performance) stages, this year there will be only three stages. We want to make sure there's no crowding," Singh also said, adding that all SOPs, including wearing of masks, social distancing would be rigidly followed at the event, if and when it is organised.   "I'm gonna make sure everyone wears a mask. I am more concerned about Covid than anyone else. So if anyone believes, that we want to be stupid and make money at the cost of your health. No, we don't want to," Singh also said.  Opposition parties led by the Congress have demanded that the event should be postponed in wake of the ongoing pandemic, even as Health authorities in the state have warned of a second Covid-19 wave in Goa over the coming months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sunburn-in-goa-likely-in-december-end-if-covid-19-scenario-manageable-percept-live-912220.html

Abdullah also said that the real development in Jammu and Kashmir would come when there will be a people's government. "For 28 years, they are saying that Kashmiri Pandits will be taken back to their homes in the valley. They are in power for more than five years but they are still waiting for the day of their return," Abdullah said addressing his party workers at a jam-packed Sher-e-Kashmir Bhawan here. He accused the BJP of spreading hatred among communities and asked "how long will you use them as vote bank". "You have always used them," Abdullah, who arrived in Jammu for the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into union territories in August last year, said. "People are the real fountain of power. When there will be elections, bring forth the people who can help the masses and are not self-centric,” he said, adding “the real development will come to J-K when there will be people's government and all rights of the people restored." Asserting that the National Conference is not "anti-national", he said those who are hurling such wild allegations should check their vision. "We are not the ones whom you could buy or make them to tear apart their clothes," he said, referring to a BJP leader who tore his shirt to claim that he is a nationalist to the core. "How many more you will buy (in J&K). I know there are some elements in NC as well. I have seen a lot (in politics) and the day is not far when another group will come and they will buy you as well," he said. He asked the party workers to remain steadfast and united to thwart such conspiracies. "We have to remain cautious as they are trying to divide us on the basis of religion and region.... This nation is strong as people from different backgrounds, regions, climates and languages are one. A Madrassi, a Bengali, a Maratha who are not habitual to below 30 degrees Celsius is guarding Ladakh sector in minus 30 degrees Celsius," he said, adding "we are together and one because of our nation". He said the BJP cannot be "my master and I am not afraid of them.” Asking his party workers to be patient in the face of abuse by opponents, he said they can burn his effigy and abuse him because it is a weapon of the weak and the strong replies with patience and a smile. "As long as your party is strong, nobody can force you down,” he said, asking people not to worry though there will be attempts to create “confusion and divide” them. "Those who are accusing us of being Pakistanis are in reality the ones who are supporting Pakistan. If something wrong happen, they would be the first to chant Pakistani slogans,” he said. He said National Conference workers do not tear clothes to demonstrate nationalism. Abdullah also appealed to the people of Jammu not to burst firecrackers on Diwali festival to reduce air pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kashmiri-pandits-being-used-as-vote-bank-by-bjp-farooq-abdullah-912221.html

A three-judge bench of Justices N V Ramana, Surya Kant and Anirudhha Bose, said the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018, approved by it should be strictly enforced by the Union, States and Union Territories. "Keeping in mind the vulnerability of the witnesses in such cases, the Trial Courts may consider granting protection under the said Scheme to witnesses without their making any specific application in this regard," the bench said. The apex court noted that most witnesses are unwilling to appear before the respective courts to make depositions in courts. It directed that no unnecessary adjournments be granted in cases related to lawmakers keeping in mind the public interest involved in these matters. "At the cost of repetition, it is clarified that the directions in the present writ proceedings are applicable to both sitting as well as former legislators (MPs and MLAs)," the bench said. The apex court also granted Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, one more week's time to file a reply to submit the status report relating to investigations against lawmakers by special agencies. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay seeking speedy disposal of cases against the lawmakers. Earlier during the hearing, the bench had not agreed to the submission of senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who is amicus curiae in the matter, that a direction be given to the special courts to grant protection to the witnesses in cases against lawmakers. “There are thousands of witnesses in over four thousand cases against MPs and MLAs and is it possible to grant protection to all. There must be some application by somebody seeking protection,” the bench had said. On the issue of providing public prosecutors to try such cases, the bench had said the example of 2G and the coal scam cases cannot be followed in such matters which are huge in numbers and moreover, this aspect is governed by CrPC as well.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cases-against-lawmakers-sc-asks-trial-courts-to-consider-witness-protection-912225.html

Kanta Prasad (80), the owner of the eatery, had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown was shot by Wasan and shared widely across social media platforms recently. The case was registered against the YouTuber following a complaint lodged by Prasad on October 31, nearly a month after the video went viral. In his complaint to police, Prasad alleged that Wasan "intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation... without providing any information to the complainant". Wasan, however, denied the allegations. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, "After we received a complaint, preliminary enquiry was done and an FIR was registered under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of Indian Penal Code and an investigation has been initiated." Earlier in the day, Prasad said he was hurt over being called "greedy" by some people on the social media after he lodged a complaint against Wasan and challenged the YouTuber to disclose his bank details to prove his innocence. Talking to reporters at a press conference, Prasad, accompanied by his lawyer Prem Joshi and blogger Tushant, claimed that Wasan gave him a cheque of 2.33 lakh on October 26 after the YouTuber was trolled for not handing over the donation amount to Prasad. Tushant alleged that Wasan has only disclosed his bank account statements from October 7 to 10 whereas he received more money after that. He demanded that Wasan must reveal his bank account statements till October 26. Joshi highlighted that in the initial videos shared by Wasan, he had claimed that Prasad did not have a bank account or a mobile phone but that was a "lie". Joshi also claimed that on October 26, when Wasan gave the cheque to Prasad, he made him sign a paper claiming that all dues had been settled. However, later he again gave Rs 1.45 lakh to Prasad. Wasan, however, said that he has submitted to the police his bank account statements till November 2 and maintained that he gave all the amount received as donation for Prasad to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-police-books-youtuber-gaurav-wasan-accused-of-cheating-baba-ka-dhaba-owner-912227.html

Raninder is indisposed, therefore, he could not appear before the ED on health grounds, his counsel and Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said. The ED summons pertained to a case registered by the agency under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) with regard to alleged possession of undisclosed assets abroad.

Among the places, the Patidar leader has mentioned in the affidavit, is Rajasthan where he has planned his "first vacation with wife after marriage." He got married to his childhood friend Kinjal Parikh in January 2019. Patel had moved the high court after his similar plea had been rejected by the trial court where he had sought relief on the ground that as a Congress leader he had to attend political events as "a star campaigner" in Bihar where Assembly elections are underway, besides going to Delhi to consult with his lawyer in separate cases filed there. Justice Rajendra M Sareen granted relief to Hardik with several conditions that included refraining from "conducting or attaining" any rally, political activity, or any activity which would constitute an offence. The order stated, "The applicant is permitted to travel outside the local limits of Gujarat state from 11.11.2020 to 13.11.2020 i.e. Delhi for political reasons, from 18.11.2020 to 23.11.2020 i.e. Rajasthan for a vacation with his wife, from 24.11.2020 to 28.11.2020 i.e. Delhi for conferences with Advocates at Supreme Court and from  29.11.2020 to 01.12.2020 for Haridwar or Devprayag, at Uttrakhand, as the case may be depending upon the advice of elders and traditions that follows – for last rites of the uncle, as per the schedule submitted by the learned Advocate for the applicant. The applicant shall return to Gujarat on or before 02.12.2020."   In January this year, Hardik Patel was arrested by the Detection of Crime Branch following an arrest warrant issued by a special court conducting trial against him in a sedition case registered in 2015 during the Patidar agitation for reservation movement. The warrant was issued for his repeated absence from the trial. While granting him bail, the trial court had put a condition that he should not leave the Gujarat border without the court's prior permission.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hardik-patel-permitted-to-travel-outside-gujarat-first-vacation-with-wife-912233.html

The full bench, comprising Justices KK Tated, GS Kulkarni and NR Borkar, held that though the proviso Rule 19 of the Maharashtra Prison Rules did not specifically mention the POCSO Act, the 2012 law gets covered under the head of special Acts, and serious offences, which are ineligible for emergency parole in light of the Covid-19 outbreak. The bench was referring to the notification issued by the state home department by which Rule 19 of the Maharashtra Prisons (Bombay Furlough and Parole) Rules, 1959, has been amended to allow decongestion of prisons by granting certain convicts parole and furlough following the pandemic. The proviso to Rule 19 states that those convicted for serious economic offences or bank scams or offences under special Acts other than the Indian Penal Code, such as MCOCA, NDPS, UAPA, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act - which provide for additional restrictions on grant of bail - shall not be released on parole or furlough. The full bench was presiding over a petition filed by a person convicted under the POCSO Act, who is currently serving a sentence of ten years in a city prison. The petition had first come before a division bench of the Bombay HC that referred it to the full bench after petitioner's advocate Rupesh Jaiswal pointed out that there existed two conflicting judgements on the issue. The Nagpur bench of the HC recently held that there was no impediment on providing emergency parole to POCSO convicts since the Act wasn't mentioned in the proviso. However, the Aurangabad bench of the HC had recently denied emergency parole to a person convicted under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act even though the 1987 Act now stands repealed. Advocate Jaiswal had told the court that the list of Special Acts in this proviso was exhaustive. Since the POCSO Act was not expressly mentioned, convicts under the legislation were also entitled to Covid-19 emergency parole, he had argued. Jaiswal had also maintained that the POCSO Act itself did not impose any additional restrictions, hence his client was eligible for emergency parole. The state's counsel, YP Yagnik, had argued that the SC had said emergency parole could not be claimed as a matter of right by convicts. The larger bench held on Friday that the "POCSO Act was covered under the proviso of Rule 19."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-emergency-parole-for-pocso-act-convicts-full-hc-bench-912246.html

Shah, who was addressing an internal meeting of BJP, asked the state unit to work hard so that the party can dislodge the Trinamool Congress and form the next government in the state. He also asked the party workers to strengthen the organisation and ensure that the pro-people policies of the Centre are made known to the general people. "During the meeting, Amit Shah Ji said some people are apprehensive about violence during the West Bengal assembly polls. He assured that the Centre will ensure free, fair and violence-free assembly polls. He asked us to work hard so that we can form the next government," a senior state BJP leader said after the closed-door meeting. The BJP has alleged that 120 party workers have been killed in violence in the state during the past few months. According to party sources, Shah asked the party leaders and workers to highlight the anti-people policies of the TMC and its misrule. "He asked us to spread the word on how people of the state are being deprived of the pro-people central schemes as the Mamata Banerjee government has not allowed their implementation in West Bengal. We have been told to also speak to the people about the misrule and the corruption of the TMC regime in the state," another BJP leader said.

Rifleman Chhettri, who was with the Indian Army’s Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force), was known for his bravery and daring acts. Born on August 21, 1950 in Nepal’s Matta Dang district, he joined the Indian Army on August 21, 1968. In the 1971 war against Pakistan, his Battalion was part of the advance towards Sylhet in Bangladesh. His Battalion was given the specific task of clearing a well-fortified Medium Machine Gun (MMG) enemy post at Atgram. Rifleman Chhetri, with complete disregard to his personal safety, fought fearlessly, charged the bunker, killed eight enemy troops with his khukri (a type of machete) and captured the MMG post. For his conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. He had to quit the service due to some personal reasons even before reaching the requisite pensionable service. He was discharged from service on April 8, 1976. Since then, he has been leading a very modest life in a remote village of Banke district in Nepal. His life, after quitting the service, got filled with misery as he has had no major source of income and has been surviving on his gallantry award allowance. Due to his introvert nature, his condition was never highlighted. However, his case recently came to notice when one senior officer of his unit informed the Defence Wing, Indian officials said. He was contacted and a total amount of Rs 10 lakh was approved as a welfare measure to alleviate the hardships being faced by him in his old age. During an ex-servicemen rally at Butwal, Nepal on November 21, 2019, he was felicitated with a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as the first tranche. Gen Naravane, during his visit to Nepal, handed over the balance amount of Rs 5 lakh to him on Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-army-chief-hands-over-rs-5-lakh-to-1971-indo-pak-war-hero-in-nepal-912264.html

The senior military commanders of the two nations held the eighth round of talks near the LAC on Friday. Lt Gen P G K Menon, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 14 Corps, led the delegation of the Indian Army. Maj Gen Liu Lin led the delegation of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The two sides discussed India's response to the fresh “disengagement proposals” put forward by the Chinese PLA last month to end the six-month-long stand-off along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. “As conveyed earlier,” the MEA spokesperson said, “both sides continue to maintain close communication at the military and diplomatic levels to achieve complete disengagement along the LAC. The two sides are guided by the leaders’ consensus to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas.” The sixth round of talks between the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA on October 12 saw both sides agreeing to stop further deployment of soldiers on the face-off scenes. They, however, could not reach an agreement to restart the stalled process of pulling back soldiers already deployed on the LAC. The Chinese PLA put forward a fresh proposal for disengagement when the military commanders of the two sides had the seventh round of meetings. The proposal was studied by a panel comprising senior army and intelligence officials, bureaucrats, and diplomats of the Government of India. The disengagement process the two sides had mutually agreed upon in early July remained stalled since mid-July with the Chinese PLA declining to completely withdraw troops from several “points of friction” along the LAC – like Depsang Y junction, Gogra Post, and the northern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-will-keep-talking-with-china-to-end-stand-off-mea-912270.html

Conte extended the invitation to Modi during a virtual India-Italy summit, which saw the signing of 15 pacts, including several between business entities of the two nations. Italian prime minister told his counterpart in New Delhi that his government in Italy had planned several events to celebrate the life and works of Dante Alighieri next year, coinciding with the 700th death anniversary of the 13th-14th century poet and philosopher. Conte told the prime minister that Dante had referred to India, particularly the River Ganges, in his epic poem “Divine Comedy”, Joint Secretary (Europe West) at the Ministry of External Affairs, told journalists after the virtual summit between the two leaders.  Chakravorty quoted Prime Minister telling his counterpart that Dante’s reference to the river Ganges and India in “Divine Comedy” and the Italian Government’s plan to celebrate his life and work next year had added to his interests to visit Italy. Modi was planning to visit Italy in May, but had to postpone the tour in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 15 pacts signed on the sideline of India-Italy summit included a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Italian Trade Agency and Invest India, another to promote co-financing between Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA (CDP) of Italy and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) of India, Cooperation Agreement to set-up a CNG compressors factory in India between Snam S.p.A., Italy and Adani Gas Ltd of India and a pact to enhance the development of green hydrogen between Snam S.p.A., Italy and Greenko Energies Private Ltd of India.

"We are also awaiting the election results," Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said during an online media briefing while replying to questions on impact of US presidential outcome on the Indo-US ties. He asserted that "the comprehensive strategic (Indo-US) partnership has very strong bipartisan support in the US and successive presidents and administrations have raised the level of the relationship even higher." As per latest vote count, Democrat Biden was inching closer to the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the race. "Indo-US relations rest on strong foundations. Our relations encompass cooperation in every possible sphere, extending from strategic to defence, from investment to trade to people-to-people ties," the spokesperson added. The ties between India and the US have witnessed a major upswing in the last four years under the Trump administration, particularly in areas of defence and security. The Trump administration has also been strongly favouring a greater role for India in the Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of rising military assertiveness by China in the region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/strong-bipartisan-support-for-indo-us-ties-india-on-us-presidential-election-912308.html

List thereafter,” said a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde. “You serve the copy of the petition to the counsel for Union of India. We will see,” the top court orally told the lawyer. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was hearing a plea which has referred to media reports and alleged that a state and a private company had signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) for business with China-based firms. The plea, filed by Jammu-based lawyer Supriya Pandita, has referred to the standoff between the two armies at multiple locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for the last several months. It said that the Centre had also banned 59 Chinese mobile app citing national security reasons. "While the ban on these mobile apps may be a welcome step but on the other hand allowing few select business house or few select state government to enter in to MoU with Chinese business house or stakeholders from China sends a wrong message to the people of India," said the plea, filed through advocates Om Prakash Parihar and Dushyant Tiwari. The plea has also sought the apex court's direction to the Centre and others to "terminate" the MoUs signed with Chinese firms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-to-make-trade-policies-with-china-public-sc-asks-petitioner-to-serve-copy-to-centres-lawyer-912314.html

On October 21, Bhushan had said that the CJI availed the special helicopter during his visit to Kanha national park while "an important case of disqualification of defecting MLAs of MP (Madhya Pradesh) is pending before him. Survival of MP govt depends on this case". However, Bhushan on November 4 regretted the error in his earlier tweet. "Elections were held yesterday to seats of defecting Cong MLAs in MP who were made ministers in the Shivraj Govt. Survival of Shivraj govt will depend on their re-election, not on decision of case in CJIs court challenging their ministership. I regret this error in my tweet below," the lawyer tweeted. It is significant to note that on November 4, a bench headed by the CJI disposed of a plea that had raised the issue of pendency of disqualification proceedings against some Congress MLAs who had joined the BJP and were appointed as ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh. The plea was disposed of after senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for petitioner Congress MLA Vinay Saxena, said that bypolls on 28 assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh have been already held on Tuesday rendering the plea as infructuous. The top court, on August 31, had imposed a token fine of one rupee against Bhushan as punishment in the contempt case against him. Bhushan was earlier convicted for two tweets against the judiciary.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prashant-bhushan-regrets-error-in-his-october-21-tweet-on-cji-912325.html

The technology will use virtual reality and augmented reality to showcase the life of the Mahatma in a dome at Gandhi Darshan through short films, officials said. Content from archives such as photos, videos and interviews were processed into digital formats and used. The 360-degree dome project has been implemented by the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT-D). Speaking on the occasion, Science and Technology Minister Vardhan said that Mahatma Gandhi's persona continues to inspire humanity even today. Mahatma Gandhi's thinking was a perfect amalgamation of cultural thinking and scientific temper, and his teachings are much more relevant today, especially for rural development, Culture Minister Patel said. The additions to the Gandhi Darshan were part of projects undertaken to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhian philosophy touches all aspects of life, Vardhan said, adding that Mahatma Gandhi always stressed on sustainable development. Secretary at the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Ashutosh Sharma, said that the department felt that virtual reality and augmented reality are very powerful technology tools that could be used to disseminate the message of Gandhiji to the youth of India. Therefore, the 360-degree video-immersive experience technology was proposed and set up, he said.  Officials said that after completion of testing, calibration and fine-tuning for public viewing, the films have been integrated with the dome at Gandhi Darshan using the technology. The DST through Vigyan Prasar, a science communications body under it, took up the task of setting up digital exhibits on Mahatma Gandhi's life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/360-video-immersive-tech-digital-exhibits-to-show-mahatma-gandhis-life-story-912328.html

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, on Friday, said the Modi government is deliberately hurting the morale of army officers by "snatching away" their pension and demanded an immediate reversal of the decision. "We demand that Prime Minister Modi comes forward and clarifies his stand on the issue and takes back its anti-army decision of October 29," he told reporters. This is Congress’ second attack on the Modi government regarding welfare of armed forces after the high-decibel campaign about four years ago over the implementation of ‘one rank, one pension’, a long-pending demand of the armed forces. Randeep Singh Surjewala circulated a letter at a press conference here written by the Department of Military Affairs seeking suggestions on proposals to increase the retirement age for officers of various ranks in the Army and the Air Force. Suggestions were also sought on reduction of pension entitlements for pre-mature release of officers. “The Modi government has become the first regime in history to steal the pension and alternate career choice after the active service of those officers who protect our motherland,” Surjewala told reporters here. He said according to the Modi government’s new proposal, only those officers who have spent more than 35 years in the Armed Forces service shall be entitled to a ‘Full Pension’. “But the reality is, 90% of the army officers retire before 35 years of service. In such a situation, the Modi government is hatching a conspiracy to deny 90% of the army officers their full pension,” Surjewala said. He contended that the proposal of the Department of Military Affairs was akin to modifying the terms of service of military officers with a ‘backdate’. Surjewala contended that 65% of the officers inducted into the Army are confined to the Lieutenant Colonel rank due to the limited number of posts in the higher ranks. In such a situation, several army officers serve for 20 years and seek early retirement for exploring second career options with full retirement benefits from the government, he said. “If the Modi government’s devious proposal comes into force, then 65% of military officers will forever lose their second career option and their creative support in nation building in civilian areas outside the military,” Surjewala said. The Congress leader said there is already a shortage of 9,427 officers in all the three Armed Services. The figures available for June 2019 show that there is a shortage of 7,399 officers in the Army, 1,545 in the Navy and 483 in the Air Force.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-accuses-government-of-fake-nationalism-stealing-pension-of-army-officers-912083.html

Campaigning ahead of the 2021 Bengal Assembly elections, Amit Shah was in the tribal region of Jangalmahal and decided to pay tributes to legendary freedom fighter Bisra Munda. However, the tribal leaders pointed out that the statue garlanded was not the acclaimed Munda but a general tribal hunter.  Shah tweeted the commemoration, Paid floral tributes to legendary tribal leader Bhagwan Birsa Mundaji in Bankura, West Bengal today. Birsa Mundaji's life was dedicated to the rights and upliftment of our tribal sisters and brothers. His courage, struggles and sacrifices continue to inspire..." Paid floral tributes to legendary tribal leader Bhagwan Birsa Munda ji in Bankura, West Bengal today. The Union Home Minister’s act was not taken well by the tribals and the Bharat Jakat Majhi Pargana Mahal has declared itself upset, adding that they feel it is an insult to Birsa Munda. The report also added that people from the community sprinkled water from the Ganges around the statue to ‘purify’ it. The statue-mix up has fuelled the feud between the BJP vs Trinamool Congress, and the latter targeted them tweeting, "'Bohiragato' are at it again! Union Home Minister @AmitShah is so ignorant of Bengal's culture that he insulted Bhagwan Birsa Munda by garlanding a wrong idol & placed his photo at someone else's foot. Will he ever respect Bengal?"  The saffron party after having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades has emerged as the main rival of the TMC in the last few years. With the BJP's strength increasing in the state in the last few years, where it has never been in power, its leaders are upbeat that the party will end the TMC's 10-year-long rule in the assembly polls scheduled in April-May 2021.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shah-garlands-wrong-birsa-munda-statue-in-west-bengal-912107.html

Mocking Shah's scheduled visit to a Matua family for lunch, the party described his refugee community outreach as a "poll gimmick" to divert attention from atrocities committed on backward communities in states ruled by the saffron party. Stressing that there was a need to restore West Bengal's "lost glory", Shah on Friday, during his visit to the Dakshineswar temple here, said the present "appeasement politics" in the state has hurt its age-old tradition of upholding the nation's spiritual consciousness. Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of organisational activities, ahead of the 2021 state polls, had on Thursday said he could sense massive public anger against the Mamata Banerjee government and that the death knell of her regime has been sounded. "What does Amit Shah mean by appeasement politics? Was he speaking as a BJP activist or as the Union Home Minister of the country? The government has to treat all communities with equality and respect. I don't think it is a crime to do something for the development of minorities in the state," senior TMC leader and MP Sougato Roy said. He sought to know why Shah ignored the fact that the Bengal government had allowed Durga Puja celebrations, even when many BJP-ruled states cancelled it. "Why is he not speaking about the state government's decision to allow Durga Puja celebrations? Was it minority appeasement? I would want to say that communalism has no place in West Bengal. The people of the state will reject BJP's divisive politics," he added. Echoing him, state minister Firhad Hakim, too, took a jibe at Shah over his scheduled lunch at a Matua family's residence and said it was a desperate attempt to fool people. "In all BJP-ruled states, tribals, Dalits and those from the backward communities are being tortured. There are reports of atrocities everywhere. "So this drama of having lunch at the house of a person from the Matua community is nothing but a poll gimmick before the assembly elections. But he can't people fool every time, and the Matuas are very well aware of the BJP's double standards," Hakim said. The Matuas, originally from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), had been migrating to West Bengal since the 1950s, mostly due to religious persecution. The community, with an estimated population of three million in the state, influences at least four Lok Sabha seats and 40 assembly seats in Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas districts. According to state BJP sources, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which was passed in the Parliament last year, is likely to help several refugee communities such as the Matuas to obtain citizenship of the country. The CAA will benefit more than 1.5 crore people across the country, including over 72 lakh in the West Bengal, the sources said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tmc-slams-amit-shah-over-appeasement-remark-says-communalism-has-no-place-in-west-bengal-912118.html
06-11-2020||National Politics||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar does not have retirement on his mind, asserts JD(U)||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's stunner that the ongoing assembly elections were his last, triggered hectic speculation in the political circles here Friday. The ruling Janata Dal (United) categorically dismissed suggestions that Kumar, who also heads the party, had retirement from politics on his mind while stating that the ongoing assembly elections were his "last". Vashishtha Narayan Singh, a veteran socialist leader who has been associated with Nitish Kumar for more than 30 years and currently heads the party's state unit, disapproved of interpretations "without listening to the full statement". "Ye mera aakhiri chunaav hai.......Ant bhala to sab bhala" (This is my last election...all is well that ends well), Kumar had said at Dhamdaha in Purnea district on Thursday while winding up his speech, leading to a flurry of reactions from the opposition parties which insisted Kumar's words were admittance of an "impending defeat". "Does a political or social worker ever retire? Is Nitish Kumar himself contesting the assembly elections", asked Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP, pointing to the fact that the Chief Minister is himself a member of the legislative council.  "We can't help it if the opposition finds pleasure in drawing inferences without listening to the full statement or understanding the context. But the fact remains he was addressing his final election rally, minutes before a campaign for the third and last phase of elections came to a close. He was referring to that", Singh asserted.  State minister Sanjay Kumar Jha too echoed similar views. "Every time since 2005, in his last public meeting during campaign Kumar has been saying like this so its wrong to interpret that this is his last election," Jha, a close confidante of the chief minister, told PTI. "Kumar will continue to serve the state and its people till public wants," he said and ridiculed the rivals for reading too much in it. RJD Chief Ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, who has emerged as the principal challenger to Kumar, nearly four decades his senior, at the young age of 31, reacted with glee "we stand vindicated. We had been saying all along that Nitish Kumar is tired and no longer able to govern Bihar. He would do well to retire". A Nitish-basher Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan grabbed the chief ministers remarks to enchantment to folks to not waste their votes on any candidate of the ruling Janata Dal-United. "Sahab says this is his last election. He refused to give an account for his last five years and has already declared that he has no intention of doing so next time. Don't elect a person who will not come to you for blessings tomorrow. There will be no sahab or JDU in the next election. Who will you then question," Paswan tweeted. Born on March 1, 1951, Kumar has risen in politics from 1974 "JP movement". As an office-bearer of the Patna University students union, he along with Lalu Prasad, Sushil Kumar Modi and union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad among others took active part in the 1974 movement launched by Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan against the Congress government. During his near four decades in politics, he has been legislators and member of Parliament several times. He is seeking fourth straight term in the chief minister's office in the current polls. He served in the cabinet of Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Dipankar Bhattacharya, secretary-general of the CPI (ML), insisted that Kumar had played an "emotional card" in a bid to strike a chord with voters who were angry with him. "Nitish Kumar will always be remembered as the man who made it possible for the BJP and its toxic communal politics to take roots in Bihar. His party supported the CAA and later made pretensions of opposing the NRC. "His emotional card will find no resonance with the people", said Bhattacharya, whose party is a constituent of the opposition Grand Alliance which is helmed by the RJD and includes Congress, CPI and CPI(M). Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, whose party has shared power with Kumar in the past, concurred that the Chief Ministers utterances were "sentimental and politically motivated" which came out "too late" and would "achieve too little". "It appears Kumar is regretting his failure to snap ties with the BJP in time. He is now anguished to see that he has been trapped by his ally which is engineering his downfall by clandestinely backing the rebellion from LJP president Chirag Paswan. "It may be the end of the road for him as a politician. I do wish him, though, good health and contentment for the rest of his life", Mishra added. Shivanand Tiwary, RJDs national vice-president who has known Nitish Kumar since the 1970s, added a cautionary note. "Whatever Nitish Kumar says, must never be taken at face value. He can be quite brazen in doing the exact opposite of his averments. It was on the floor of the House that he had vowed never to go back with the BJP and look what he did thereafter", Tiwary said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-does-not-have-retirement-on-his-mind-asserts-jdu-912181.html

The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said that a time will come when the Centre will ask the people "with folded hands" what more do they want besides restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state. "They (Centre) have suppressed people's voices and are not allowing them to talk. It is like a pressure cooker... they have created such an atmosphere. But when the pressure cooker explodes it burns down the whole house," Mufti said at her first public function in Jammu after her release from detention. The PDP chief arrived here on Thursday to attend the People's Conference for Gupkar Declaration (PCGD) scheduled to be held here on Saturday. It will be chaired by National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah. She was shown black flags by the activists of the Rashtriya Bajrang Dal and Shiv Sena over her statement about not holding the tricolour till Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, including its separate state flag, was restored. Mufti asserted that the People's Democratic Party (PDP) will not be a mute spectator to the prevailing situation and not sit silent until Article 370 is restored. "A time will come when the government in New Delhi will ask with folded hands (to the people of Kashmir) 'what more do you want besides restoration of special status'... Mark my words," she said in her address to PDP workers at the party headquarters here. Stressing that the BJP is "not going to rule forever", Mufti said the Centre committed a blunder by scrapping Article 370 and "misused" the Constitution. "I and Surinder Choudhary (Jammu PDP leader) have vowed to defend it (Constitution)," she said, vowing to take the fight to restore Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir to its logical conclusion. Mufti said Article 370 was given to the people of Jammu and Kashmir by Maharaja Hari Singh to save the identity of Dogras. She also said that those coming from outside to set up industries in Jammu and Kashmir will bring their employees resulting in rise in unemployment as "our children cannot compete with them due to lack of facilities here". "He (Maharaja) was apprehensive that the people from Punjab and other parts will come and threaten the identity of Dogras. This (scraping of article 370) cannot be done by parliament because the Constitution is bigger than parliament," she said. She alleged that the country is being run according to the agenda of the BJP and not the Constitution of India. She further accused the BJP of indulging in vote bank politics while claiming to fight a "Dharm Yudh" in Jammu and Kashmir. The BJP is telling the world that the situation in Kashmir is normal but not allowing people to come out and hold protests, she said. Mufti said PDP activists were held by police for protesting and were asked to give affidavits for their release. "They are suppressing every voice. Protesters are being lodged in jails and are being tagged as anti-nationals... What kind of democracy is this? Is this Ram Rajya? Why are you afraid of the PDP?" she asked. Taking a dig at the Narendra Modi government over the Chinese incursion, the PDP chief said, "China took 1000 square kilometres of our land. They are raising infrastructure and buildings but none of the ministers have spoken about it." "They are reluctant to mention the name of China. China is setting up permanent barracks and buildings, but they turn a blind eye. Eight rounds of talks have happened... You can talk to China but feel insulted to talk to the people of J&K whose identity has been snatched," she added. During the regime of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, talks were resumed with Pakistan and separatists but the current dispensation in New Delhi has "spoiled" the structure of Indian democracy, she said. She also questioned why Modi had not talked about the 20 soldiers killed in Galwan, Leh while fighting Chinese troops, in his Bihar election rallies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/mehbooba-mufti-accuses-centre-of-creating-pressure-cooker-like-situation-in-jammu-and-kashmir-912226.html

He also questioned the promised new phase of development in the erstwhile state after the abrogation of its special status and said "every citizen of Jammu and Kashmir is unhappy with the August 5, last year decision". Omar was addressing party leaders and workers at the Sher-e-Kashmir Bhawan here, his first in more than a year. The former chief minister also claimed that the decision had pushed the "people with separatist leaning" further away from the mainstream and also triggered a spike in the number of youths joining militancy. "We are here to talk on your behalf and nobody will ask you to come on the roads. You have conveyed your resentment and we will be your voice as our fight is not for a particular party, region, religion, or family. This fight is for our future and identity," he said. "This is the fight of all of us and we know some will come in open and some will remain on our back but we will not backtrack and will emerge successful in this fight," Omar said amid thunderous applause by his workers. The NC leader said that if the identity and future of the people cannot be saved, nothing can be left behind. Attacking the BJP for snatching the rights guaranteed under the Constitution to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar asked, "Where is the promised new phase of development and what happened to the notion that the separatism will finish and all the diseases will be cured." "The people with anti-India ideology had not come close but had gone far away, while the youth whom we tried to bring back from the path of terrorism are joining militancy in large numbers. In 2011-14 (during NC-Congress rule headed by Omar), terrorism-related incidents were at the lowest ebb and so the youth joining militancy. But today, the number of youth joining militancy is much more," he claimed. Accusing the BJP of misleading the country over Article 370 before its abrogation, he said it was claimed that there is no development, employment and people are facing starvation while the separatists are outnumbering the nationalists. "Unfortunately, we are in times of a fight between falsehood and truth...the people of J&K were promised of a new phase of development and new land laws were introduced on the pretext of setting up industries," he said and challenged Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to prove that Article 370 was a hurdle. "If you (Sinha) have time, go to Kathua (in Jammu region) and stop at Baribrahmana...Setting up of industries did not need the removal of Article 370,” he said. Accusing the BJP of having different yardsticks in different states, he said the BJP-led Haryana government recently assured the people of the state that 75 per cent jobs there will be reserved for them and the same is the case in Himachal Pradesh and many other parts where no outsider can buy land. "BJP has done this to J&K because it wanted to avenge the 2014 election results when it failed to achieve its goal of winning 45+ seats," he said and claimed that the BJP's propaganda machinery had no parallel in the world. On Article 370, he said, "It was not Pakistan's constitution which had given us this safeguard. This was the basis of J&K accession with the Union of India and had it not been there, the structure would not have been there as well."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-misled-country-over-article-370-will-continue-our-fight-for-its-restoration-omar-abdullah-912266.html

From now on, the agency has to seek permission from the state government to probe each case, official sources said. The Chief Minister's Office issued a statement saying that the Home department withdrew its consent granted on February 19, 1996, by the then Bihar government to the CBI to conduct investigations and raids. The Jharkhand government's move came a day after Left-ruled Kerala decided to withdraw the general consent granted to the CBI to probe cases. Earlier, states such as Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have also taken back the general consent accorded to the agency to exercise its powers under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Under Section 6 of the Act, all states except Delhi and the union territories have the discretion to give their consent to the CBI for a probe in the state. A coalition of the JMM, Congress, and the RJD came to power in Jharkhand in December last year, defeating the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/now-jharkhand-withdraws-general-consent-accorded-to-cbi-to-probe-cases-911911.html

Justice Najmi Waziri put on hold the East Delhi Municipal Corporation's decision on Hussain's plea challenging it. The court also issued notice to the corporation, represented by its standing counsel Gaurang Kanth, and sought its stand on the petition by March next year. Advocate Rizwan, appearing for Hussain, confirmed that the court stayed the EDMC decision. The plea on behalf of the ex-AAP councillor was moved through his wife. EDMC had disqualified him as a councillor for allegedly being absent from House meetings for three consecutive times without information.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-high-court-puts-on-hold-tahir-hussains-disqualification-as-mcd-councillor-912022.html

Additional Director General of Uttar Pradesh Police 112, Aseem Arun, in a statement issued here on Thursday, said, "Police personnel have been instructed that if they apprehend any criminal or a suspect or ask someone to stop for a search, they should assume that he may be a Covid-19 patient." He said that to ensure better policing, police personnel are being told modern methods of search and patrolling. "Besides, they are being told about precautions to be taken if they have to arrest anyone. All this is a part of the new training," he said. Arun said after the Covid-19 outbreak, 567 policemen have been infected so far, of which 533 have recovered, 27 are undergoing treatment while seven have died. The ADGP said that police personnel posted in the emergency service have been instructed to use masks while apprehending or interrogating any culprit and wash their hands with soap. "If a person is a suspected case of Covid-19, then be extra careful and also change their clothes," he said. In the training, the personnel are also being told about the "Mission Shakti" campaign launched in the state for instilling a sense of security among women, the statement said. Till now, 3,174 police personnel have been given training in 72 districts of the state. About 32,000 police personnel are deployed in the police emergency service 112.  Out of these, 3,000 police personnel are deployed on four-wheelers, while 1,500 policemen are deployed on two-wheelers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/over-500-uttar-pradesh-cops-infected-by-covid-19-7-dead-912026.html
06-11-2020||North and Central||Supreme Court asks Centre to ensure no smog in Delhi-NCR||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to ensure that there would be no smog in Delhi as the Union government informed that a Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and adjoining areas has started functioning from the day. The Centre has set up the 15-member Commission headed by ex Petroleum Secretary, M M Kutty, excercising powers under Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that the court would take up the matter after Diwali break. "We will hear this after vacations. But ensure that there is no smog in the city," the bench said. Mehta, for his part, said, "We have made appointments to the commission under the Ordinance." Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for a minor, Aditya Dubey, asked the court to ensure that if any person suffered from health issues, then the government would be responsible. He also pointed out the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare officials were not members of the commission. The offences, declared in the Ordinance also did not have classification. "The situation now is of public health emergency. Something drastic needs to be done," Singh said. To this, the bench said, "Whatever anyone says we are court of law. This problem will be dealt by executive as they have money and resources. We have certain limitations and we are not abdicating our responsibility. Let the SG take steps." During the hearing, the court also asked why there was no grading of offence under the Ordinance.  To this, Mehta said he would respond. The air quality index has reached to dangerous level in Delhi recently. On Thursday, the city air quality dropped to the worst levels since December, last year with farm fire accounting to 42% of its pollution, the maximum this year. Experts fear the situation may get further exacerbated around Diwali next week. The Union government has on October 28 issued the Ordinance to set up a permanent Commission for air quality management in Delhi and adjoining areas as it has become a cause of concern due to activities of stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust and urban construction. The contravention of Commission's orders would be an offence, punishable with upto five-year jail or with fine upto Rs one crore or both.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-ensure-no-smog-in-delhi-ncr-912032.html

Inaugurating a PWD project to strengthen Rohtak road in Mundka, the chief minister said he hoped that just as people faced the first two waves of coronavirus, they would face the third wave too and that it will end soon. "Till there is a medicine for corona, face masks are the medicine. These are the biggest protection against Covid-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement," he said. Citing the arrival of 32,000 Indians from virus-hit countries in March as well people coming from different parts of the country, he noted that Delhi faced a tough situation. On the issue of air pollution, he said air quality in Delhi remains good from January till mid-October but worsens after that due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP. Delhi has provided an alternative in the form of a chemical developed by the Pusa Institute that converts stubble into manure. Next year there should not be any excuse by Punjab, Haryana and UP and stubble burning should stop, he said. If needed, the Delhi government or Pusa Institute may give the chemical (bio decomposer) to the states where stubble is burnt, he said. PWD minister Satyendar Jain said strengthening of the 13.33 Km stretch of Rohtak Road from Jakhira to Delhi Border is scheduled to finish in six months but he would ensue that efforts are made to wrap it up in four months instead.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/need-to-promote-use-of-face-masks-to-check-spread-of-covid-19-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-912035.html

The exercise has been started following the Centres directive to states to constitute committees for coordination and overseeing Covid-19 vaccination drive, he said. A State Task Force Committee has been constituted for inter-department coordination for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, he said. Primary preparations for Covid-19 vaccination drive have started in Chhattisgarh, the public relations department official said. As per instructions of the Government of India, a database of healthcare personnel from government and private healthcare institutions is being prepared. They would get top priority for immunisation against coronavirus," he said. However, inclusion of names in the database does not mean that they will be compulsorily vaccinated as the final decision in this regard will be taken by the Centre, the official said. Health Minister TS Singh Deo said the state has made adequate arrangements for storage and maintenance of vaccine once it is made available and supplied. As many as 530 cold chain points are currently operational and 80 new ones are being set up for safekeeping of vaccine. "A new walk-in-cooler facility is being arranged for the purpose, the official quoted the minister as saying. At present, the total retention capacity of vaccines in the state is 1,05,000 litre which is 60,000 litre more than the required capacity, the minister said. Besides the task force, a state-level steering committee is also being formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary for smooth conduct of the drive, the official said. Orders have been issued to set up such panels in all districts, he said. Director of the National Health Mission in Chhattisgarh will be the Nodal Officer for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, while the State Immunisation Officer will be the Assistant Nodal Officer, the official said. The Nodal Officer for districts will be Collectors whereas Chief Medical and Health Officers (CMHOs) will act as Assistant Nodal Officers, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chhattisgarh-starts-preparation-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-912057.html
06-11-2020||North and Central||Ahead of Diwali, pottery markets deserted as coronavirus takes over festive cheer||Nothing underscores the despondency of Diwali 2020 quite as much as the unsettling quiet over Delhi’s pottery markets in a festive season normally marked by the bustle of people buying diyas and idols to usher in the festival of lights.   In the weeks leading up to Diwali, pottery hubs across the city would come alive with the sounds of cars driving up and scores of people bargaining at stalls overflowing with handmade earthenware – including not just diyas of all sizes but also decorative flower pots, platters and vases.   The bright lights are strung up like every other year to beckon people but the customers are just so few. Though some people are stepping out despite the continuing fear of contracting Covid-19, the numbers are just a fraction of what they were.   “Earlier, the crowds would begin two to four weeks before Diwali and we barely had time to breathe. We would be so busy we couldn’t take a tea break. But this year the situation is really bad,” said Anita, sitting amid the heap of earthen lamps and pots and quite literally swatting flies.   Her makeshift shop on a pavement in south Delhi’s Hauz Rani market is overflowing. But there are no buyers. And the 60-year-old, who also stocks pottery from places such as Khurja in Uttar Pradesh, is despairing.   “We always ran out of our Diwali stock weeks before the festival, but this year I have barely sold anything,” she said. In fact, she has barely had any customers at her shop since the lockdown was lifted. And nothing has changed even with Diwali just eight days away.   The fear of the coronavirus has taken over the festive cheer, leaving some of the most popular pottery markets in Delhi struggling to bring in business, even during what has traditionally been the busiest season in the year.   Delhi on Thursday recorded 6,715 Covid-19 cases, taking its infection tally to over 4.16 lakh. The relentless spread of the infection, eight months on, has taken its toll on millions of livelihoods across the country and in its capital too.   And Anita, who took over the 30-year-old shop nearly a decade back after her mother-in-law passed away, is just one of them. She said her shop is the only source of income for her family of eight, and the pandemic has made survival very difficult.   Located a stone’s throw from the Malviya Nagar metro station, the Hauz Rani market is essentially a row of nearly 30 shops running along the footpath, selling all things earthen and beautiful.   Anita’s neighbor, 38-year-old Seema who runs her shop in the same market with her husband, is frantic.   “Business is not even 25 per cent of what it used to be,” Seema said.   The shelves are lined with beautiful items of ceramic crockery in shades of blues, pink and yellow and rows of Ganesh-Lakshmi idols, screaming to be picked up, admired and purchased. But there are just too few takers.   She added that she buys all the items on loan from wholesale shopkeepers in places such as Khurja, Jaipur and Kolkata and pays them back once she has made the sale, keeping the profit for herself.   “This year, it looks like we will barely make enough money to pay the shopkeepers back, forget about earning anything ourselves. There are so few customers coming in that we have to sell items at prices lower than what we bought them for,” the mother of three said.   Livelihood in the aftermath of the lockdown has been hand-to-mouth. The Diwali season, which is when they make the most sales, was the sliver of hope but that too is receding.   “We dipped into our savings to survive through the lockdown and months after that, hoping that business would be better during the festive season. But we just manage to make enough to run the household on a daily basis,” Seema said.    While those like Anita and Seema face an unprecedented crisis because their shops are the mainstay of their earnings, there are some who are better off – if only marginally.   Like Pankaj and Rahul, who own shops at the Sarojini Nagar pottery market a few kilometres away from Hauz Rani but also have jobs. While Kumar works at a leather export company, Rahul is a mechanic.   As in Hauz Rani, here, too, the small, makeshift shops sell a mix of earthenware and ceramic stuff ordered from other vendors.   The Sarojini Nagar market is a lane of 50 odd shops that sell pottery items like flower pots and earthen pots for water throughout the year and bring in additional supplies before Diwali. Many said they had preempted the possibility of low sales by just ordering less.   Pankaj, 45, a third-generation owner of a shop, said he was always expecting a poor turnout of customers. Business is bad but some of his loyal customers have returned.   “For us, the festive season starts from Dussehra. The business has been at least 50 per cent less than previous years but I think it’s still good considering the current circumstances. I ordered only half the stock that we usually get for Diwali,” he said.   Rahul, 30, too, adopted the same strategy and brought in only half of his stock from West Bengal, Gujarat and Agra.   “It used to get so crowded here before Diwali that one could barely find a spot to stand. This year, I am lucky if one customer stops. No one wants to touch the products in the shop,” he said.   “Through the year, my mother sits at the shop and I am at work. It is only during Diwali that I am here because of the rush,” Rahul said.   Standalone shops face the same fate.   Madan Lal Yadav, 64, who has been setting up his shop of Diwali items at the Green Park market in south Delhi since the late 1980s said business couldn’t be slower.    “I have been opening shop everyday since Dussehra but there’s really no one stopping by."   While potters count their losses, customers are just looking at the rising trajectory of the disease.   Aditi Khandelwal, for instance, has decided to go online for all her Diwali needs, including diyas.   "I have been buying diyas and candles from local/roadside vendors, but this time, I have shopped for things online and have begun preparing hand-made decorative items. I am just avoiding stepping outside,” the 25-year-old said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ahead-of-diwali-pottery-markets-deserted-as-coronavirus-takes-over-festive-cheer-912060.html

Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav allowed the foreigners' plea seeking deportation to their countries and imposed certain conditions on them. The court directed the investigating officer (IO) to facilitate expeditious closure of the Lookout Circulars (LoC) against them. It said if the pending revision petition filed by the police against the foreigners was allowed by the court, then they would have to come back to India to join the proceedings. It further directed them to deposit a surety amount of Rs 30,000 to the court and furnish their name, phone number, e-mail address and address to the investigating officer before leaving the country. The court further said they should respond to the IO as and when notified. A magistrate court had on August 24 discharged them of all charges under which they were charge sheeted in the absence of any record or credible material against them. The police had challenged the order before the sessions court, which is pending. The applications, filed through advocates Ashima Mandla and Mandakini Singh, had stated that though the foreigners were discharged of all charges and their passports were released, necessary orders directing deportation and closure of LoCs against them were not granted. The application had further said that the Supreme Court had on October 15, granted them liberty to move formal application before the trial court for deportation as per the law. They foreign nationals were chargesheeted under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. They were also booked under section 51 (obstruction) Disaster Management Act, section 14 (1) (b) (violation of visa norms) of Foreigners Act and Section 3 (disobeying regulation) of Epidemic Diseases Act. While discharging two foreigners each from Indonesia and Thailand, and one each from Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Jordan, the court had said perusal of the entire charge sheet and other documents placed on record showed that they were not present or participated at the Makaz during the period.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-court-allows-deportation-of-8-foreign-tablighi-jamaat-members-discharged-of-all-charges-912065.html

"Under able guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, UP is committed to become a favourite investment destination across the globe. The Ease of Doing Business ranking and single window clearance system are clear indicators of our investor friendly policies," the UP Chief Minister said in a tweet. He shared a tweet of Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra in which the latter said, "The first few drops, which turn into a trickle, then a strong flow and finally a flood. Let's make sure we do nothing to prevent this 'good' flood of investment. It's a huge opportunity. I hope @investindia can catalyse this." Mahindra's tweet came on a report about German shoe brand Von Wellx shifting its production to Agra from China. Due to the investment-friendly initiatives in the state, UP has gained the second position in the ease of doing business leaving behind Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana and Rajasthan.

The Himachal Pradesh assembly had last year passed a bill against conversion by force, inducement or through marriages solemnised for the "sole purpose" of adopting a new religion. "We are mulling to bring a law against love jihad in Haryana," Vij said replying to a calling attention notice drawing attention towards the Ballabhgarh’s Nikita Tomar murder case. The home minister said a challan in the case will be filed soon and it will be listed before a fast track court. Vij also told the House that security has been provided to the victim’s family. The accused--Tousif--belonged to some "powerful political family" and he was held within 12 hours of committing the crime, Vij said, adding that the murder has shaken the whole country. Nikita’s family has alleged that the accused was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. Some Hindu outfits have alleged the woman's murder is a case of "love jihad", referred to an alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. Earlier, INLD MLA Abhay Singh Chautala sought from the state government to take adequate steps to protect lives of women.

06-11-2020||North and Central||Change student's name, insisting on same in CBSE records 'impossibility', HC tells DU||The Delhi High Court Friday directed Delhi University to change the name of one of its students without insisting upon a change in his CBSE records, saying such a requirement amounted to "asking for the impossible". Justice Jayant Nath said the student passed out from class 12 in 2018 and was seeking a change in his name in 2019 while he was a student of DU and therefore, asking him to first get the CBSE records changed was "a misplaced requirement and cannot be accepted". The direction and observations came on the plea by Rayaan Singh, Hindu College student, who sought change of his name to Rayaan Chawla in his DU records. He challenged DU's notification of 2015 which mandates that for change of name in the varsity records, the change has to be first effected in the certificate issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The student wanted to change his surname to adopt that of his mother as, according to his plea, his parents separated in 2007 and divorced in 2015 and throughout his life, he "never enjoyed any form of constructive relationship" with his father. He had already published a declaration regarding change of his name in two newspapers and the Gazette of India.  DU opposed the plea on the grounds that he had adequate time to get his name changed to Rayaan Chawla after his parents got divorced in 2015 as he passed out from class 12 only in 2018. The court, however, did not agree with DU and said, "When CBSE issued the documents, the petitioner had the original name 'Rayaan Singh'. The same cannot be changed now as in 2018 when the petitioner completed his class 12th he was known as 'Rayaan Singh'.  "The law would not require the petitioner to perform the impossible. The insistence of respondent No.1 (DU) to first get the name changed in the records of CBSE is a misplaced requirement and cannot be accepted." Justice Nath further said that in his opinion, as the change of name is with effect from August/September 2019 i.e. much after the Class 10th and 12th certificates issued by CBSE, DU cannot in these peculiar facts and circumstances insist that the student should also get his name changed in the records of CBSE/in the Class 10th and 12th certificates.  "It is ordered accordingly," the court said and added that in order to avoid confusion between the names in the CBSE and DU certificates, the varsity can show the student's name as -- 'changed name alias/nee earlier name'. "It would be appropriate that respondent No.1/ University of Delhi may change the name of the petitioner in their records/in the degree that may be given in future to the petitioner as above. It added: "Such a course of action would avoid any confusion in the two names, which would be seen on the records of CBSE and of University of Delhi/appropriate documents issued by the said entities. "In the facts and circumstances, it is accordingly directed that respondent No.1/University of Delhi may change the name of the petitioner in their records accordingly as noted above."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/change-students-name-insisting-on-same-in-cbse-records-impossibility-hc-tells-du-912091.html

Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notice to the Central government and asked it to assess the threat perception and take a decision. “As she was provided security here, it has to be provided there also,” the judge orally observed. The court listed the matter for further hearing on November 20, as Neelam Katara told the bench that she will be shifting to Dehradun from Delhi at the end of the month. She has been provided security here since 2002, the court was informed. Her counsel submitted that she fears for her life and the high court has the power to direct the central authority to provide her security at both the places, Delhi and Dehradun. Advocate Pradeep Dey said she is shifting her residence from Delhi to Dehradun due to financial and other issues. Central government standing counsel Gaurang Kanth submitted that it was a state’s matter and she should give representation to the Uttarakhand authorities to provide her security. On October 3, 2016, the Supreme Court had awarded a 25-year jail term without any benefit of remission to Vikas Yadav and his cousin Vishal for their role in the sensational kidnapping and killing of Katara. Another co-convict Sukhdev Pehalwan was also handed down a 20-year jail term in the case. Prior to this, the Delhi High Court, while upholding the life imprisonment awarded to Vikas and Vishal Yadav by the trial court, had specified a 30-year sentence, without any remission, to both of them. It had awarded a 25-year jail term to third convict Pehalwan. All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish Katara from a marriage party on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, the sister of Vikas.

The properties attached, as part of a provisional order issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), include plots and flats in Patna, Ghaziabad, Pune and Bengaluru, three four-wheelers and some balance in bank accounts, it said. The total value of the attached properties is Rs 3.14 crore, the agency said. Probe found, the central agency said in a statement, that "medicines, chemicals, equipments and machines were purchased by the officials of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) during 2008-09 and 2009-10 from local vendors and commission agents contrary to guidelines prescribed for purchase of these items." "The then superintendent (O P Choudhary), the then deputy superintendent and the concerned faculty head of PMCH at that time and others in connivance with the suppliers had purchased medicines, chemicals reagents, machines and equipments at a higher rate and in much higher quantity than the required quantity which resulted in loss to government exchequer," the ED alleged. The agency had slapped criminal sections of the PMLA against Choudhary and others after studying a 2017 FIR of the special vigilance unit of Bihar on the matter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ed-attaches-over-rs-3-crore-assets-of-ex-superintendent-of-patna-medical-college-912130.html

Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Lalpora Chatlam area of Pampore in the south Kashmir district Thursday evening following information about the presence of militants there, a police spokesman said. During the search operation, the militants fired indiscriminately, resulting in injuries to two civilians, and managed to escape from the hiding spot, he said. In the first instance, both the injured civilians were immediately rescued and shifted to a hospital. However, one of the injured, identified as Abid Ahmad Mir, a resident of Meej Pampore, succumbed to injuries, while as the condition of other is stated to be stable, the spokesman said. He said the security forces continued with the search operation and again tracked the militants. They were given the opportunity to surrender, the spokesman said, adding, however, they again fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party of the forces, which was retaliated leading to an encounter. Due to darkness, the operation was suspended and the whole area was put under strict cordon, he said. The spokesman said the operation was resumed in the early hours of Friday, and in the ensuing encounter, one of the trapped militants was killed. However, the opportunity to surrender was yet again offered to the other trapped militants, as a result of which one of the trapped terrorists of LeT outfit laid down his arms and surrendered in an injured condition before the forces during the live encounter and was subsequently shifted to a hospital, he said. The surrendered militant has been identified as Khawar Sultan Mir, a resident of Drangbal area of Pampore, he added. The spokesman said the operation went on as another militant continued firing on the forces and was killed in the afternoon. The bodies of both the killed militants were retrieved from the site of the encounter and as per reliable sources, they were Pakistani nationals, he said, adding all the three were affiliated with proscribed outfit LeT. Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, recovered from the site of the encounter have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe the militants' complicity in other terror crimes, he said. The spokesman said Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar has congratulated the joint team of police and security forces for showing utmost patience and exhibiting professionalism, which resulted in saving the life of a local "misguided youth". The IGP Kashmir further added that the local "misguided youth" are always welcomed to return to the mainstream. This year has been successful as many of them are returning and the IGPP has reiterated his appeal to them to shun the path of violence, the spokesman said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-let-militants-killed-in-encounter-jammu-and-kashmirs-pulwama-another-surrenders-912133.html

As many as 22 sites protesting farmers still blocking railway tracks. Though Punjab Government assured us to clear all blockades by Friday morning, it did not happen. The railways needs 100% security clearance from the state to resume operations, Yadav told reporters here. "We have conveyed Punjab Government that they provide us security clearance for all trains so that we can restore them at one go. We will not start selective train services, whether freight or passenger. We have conveyed to them that we require 100 per cent security clearance from them to begin operations," he said. Sources said that during the meetings between railway and state government officials, it was indicated that the state wanted freight trains to resume operations but not passenger trains. Also, there were proposals from the state, sources said, to begin transportation of select goods for a select number of days, which the railways declined to do. Sources said that the railways has conveyed to the state government that this "on and off" system suggested by them was "not feasible". "We have bookings for our passenger trains and it is sad that during this festival season we are cancelling the trains everyday. I have full faith in the state government that in some time the blockades will be cleared and we won''t have to cancel the trains scheduled for tomorrow, said Yadav. RPF Director General Arun Kumar said that while in some places protesters have been cleared from the tracks, they have accumulated in the circulation area. The concern, he says, is that these people might again block the tracks. The loss suffered by the railways due to the agitation in Punjab over the central farm reform laws has already crossed an estimated Rs 1,200 crore as protests on train tracks continued. According to data from the national transporter, over 2,300 freight rakes carrying vital commodities could not be operated till date due to the blockades caused by the protesters. Around 1,350 trains have been forced to be cancelled or diverted, it said. Train services in Punjab have been suspended since September 24 due farmers'' protests. While it had resumed for a few days in October, it was suspended again due to concerns over safety and security of train crew members. The three farm laws -- the Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 -- were enacted recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/need-100-pc-security-clearance-from-punjab-govt-to-resume-train-services-railway-board-chief-912139.html

The man, Sandeep Yadav, a police service aspirant, had taken the mine on lease from the government after recruitment in the police force was deferred due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. The precious stone found by Yadav can fetch around Rs 30 lakh in the market, local diamond inspector Anupam Singh said. Panna, a district in the impoverished Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh, is known for its diamond mines. Yadav is the fourth person to hit the jackpot in last 30 days in the district. He extracted the diamond on Wednesday from the mine located in the Krishna Kalyanpur area, Singh said. The precious stone has been deposited at a local diamond centre and it will be put to auction, he added. Yadav will get sale proceeds of his diamond after deduction of 2.5 per cent royalty, the inspector said. I am overwhelmed with joy after stumbling upon the diamond. As recruitment in the police force has been frozen due to the coronavirus outbreak, I thought of trying my hands at diamond mining, Yadav told PTI. I took a tract of mine on lease and after a fortnight -long toil, I found the diamond. My family's financial condition will improve once I get proceeds from its auction," Yadav added. Yadav is the fourth person to strike rich in the last one month. Earlier, three persons had found diamonds from mines. All four diamonds collectively weigh 29.82 karat, Singh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/man-finds-diamond-worth-rs-30-lakh-in-madhya-pradeshs-panna-mine-912140.html

The chief minister also said new experiments to use crop residue should be encouraged and projects to prepare biofuel/power from stubble should be reviewed. "The farmers should be made aware of the impacts of stubble burning on environment and pollution caused by it and asked the Agriculture Department to run awareness programmes for this. It should be ensured that farmers should not be misbehaved with or harassed while taking action against stubble burning," an official statement quoted the chief minister as saying. "Effective use of stubble can help farmers in increasing their income," Adityanath said, according to the statement issued here.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ensure-farmers-arent-harassed-over-stubble-burning-up-cm-to-officials-912143.html

Khawar Sultan Mir, a resident of the Drangbal area of Pampore in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, laid down his arms before the security forces during the encounter at Lalpora in Pampore, in which two militants were killed. A civilian also lost his life while another was injured during the exchange of fire. Mir, who had joined the militancy on September 1 this year, surrendered after numerous appeals by the security forces. In a video of the surrender, put on Twitter by police, Mir is seen coming out of a building holding his arms in the air.   In another video, he expresses gratitude to police and security forces for offering him to surrender during the gunbattle. “I am thankful to J-K Police and forces, Army, who gave me another chance to live my life. They told me to come out, took me out alive, and treated me well. They did not torture me and treated me like their brother. Whatever (arms) I had, I left it there only (at the encounter site),” Mir says in an over-a-minute video clip uploaded by the Kashmir Police on its Twitter handle. He appealed to militants to give up arms, saying the path of militancy was a “deceit” and a “deception”. “I appeal all my brothers that this (militancy) is a deceit, this bloodshed is a lie, a deception…there is nothing in it,” he said. Inspector-General of Police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar described the surrender of the local militant as a success for the security forces. “#Surrender over #Death! #Success of Police & SFs is that they are getting #misguided youth back. This year has been #successful as they are returning, know well that they are being honorably welcomed (sic),” the IGP Kashmir said in a tweet on the Kashmir Zone Police's Twitter handle. In the last few months, several local militants have surrendered before the security forces during live encounters. Director-General of Jammu and Kashmir Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh recently said militants preferring to surrender during encounters with security forces was a welcome development “The surrender by militants in the last few encounters is a welcome development. The youth are accepting the offers of police and security forces to surrender even during live-action when bullets are being fired, so it is a welcome development,” Singh said on October 31. The DGP said all those who have picked up arms should shun the path of violence and return to the mainstream, assuring them of support. “We want the youth, who have been lured into taking a wrong path, to return. There is still time, they can return and we will help them in every way,” he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/militancy-is-deception-says-militant-who-surrendered-before-security-forces-in-jk-s-pulwama-912149.html
06-11-2020||North and Central||IAF'S strong posturing during Ladakh standoff helped India ward off any threat from China: RKS Bhadauria||The proactive deployment of IAF's "offensive" capabilities in response to the standoff with China in eastern Ladakh demonstrated its current operational readiness and the strong posturing was instrumental in dissuading the adversary to a large extent, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Friday. The Indian Air Force (IAF) chief also said that the Balakot airstrikes in Pakistan clearly demonstrated that airpower could be put to sophisticated use and create a space for action below the conventional threshold. Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria was speaking at an online seminar organised by the National Defence College. "Over the past few months, the proactive deployment of our offensive capabilities in response to developments in eastern Ladakh, both in terms of deployment of air assets as well as rapid airlifting of Army combat elements, demonstrated the IAF's operational readiness today," he said without elaborating. He said the deployment also reflected the capability and the nation's resolve to use airpower if the need arises. "It is our belief that our pro-active action and strong posture was instrumental in dissuading the adversary from making further attempts...We remain hopeful that the peace and stability will be restored along the LAC through ongoing dialogue," he said. The IAF has deployed almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the Line of Actual Control(LAC). The newly inducted fleet of Rafale jets has also been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh. On the Balakot strikes, he said terrorist organisations will have to think "hard" before making any further attempts to carry out attacks. Indian warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM) terrorist training camp on February 26 last year, nearly two weeks after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. "The airstrikes in February last year by Indian Air Force targeting terror infrastructure at Balakot clearly demonstrated that airpower could be put to sophisticated use and create a space for action below the conventional threshold," Bhadauria said. Talking about the overall security scenario, he said there has been a transformation of the security paradigm in recent years. "Our definitions of national boundaries have shifted beyond the classical definition of land border, shorelines etc. We cannot remain chained to the old concepts of fronts -- two fronts, one front. The nature and scope of warfare itself have expanded," he said. In Indian defence parlance, the two front conflicts refers to hostilities along the country's western and northern borders. The Chief of Air Staff said the induction of modern platforms and acquisition of nice capabilities has bolstered the IAF's combat capabilities across the entire spectrum of warfare. "The ongoing transformation is aimed at adding agility to our combat fleets. However, practitioners of airpower are mindful of the fact that besides providing a host of kinetic and non-kinetic response options against an adversary, a strong and capable air force plays a much larger role in ensuring deterrence and avoiding conflict in the first place." Speaking on the occasion, Vice Chief of Army Staff S K Saini said India's unsettled borders have been its biggest security challenge. "The possibility of conflict over territorial disputes with China and Pakistan will continue to remain an important factor in our defence planning," he added. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh said the Indian Navy remained poised for rapid response in any situation. "For the Indian Navy, operating farther and outward from Indian shores, in step with our country’s national interests, is a strategic imperative and necessity," he said. He said the aim of the Indian Navy is to be ‘first responder’ and ‘preferred security partner’ for the Indian Ocean littorals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/iafs-strong-posturing-during-ladakh-standoff-helped-india-ward-off-any-threat-from-china-rks-bhadauria-912150.html

The farmers also overturned their trolley loaded with paddy in protest, they said. Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Surendra Kumar said a case will be registered against the incharge of the paddy purchase centre, which refused to buy the crop. "There are 10 paddy purchase centres at Roza grain market. When the farmers' crop was not bought at a centre, they overturned their trolley full of paddy and climbed on top of a wanter tank, threatening to end their lives," the SDM told PTI. A police team arrived at the site and pacified the farmers -- Anil Kumar, Ajit Verma, Ashish Verma, Rajnish Kumar and Awadhesh -- after which they came down, he said. The farmers were later able to sell their paddy at another centre, the SDM said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/5-uttar-pradesh-farmers-climb-atop-water-tank-threaten-suicide-912154.html

On Friday, Priyanka lashed out at the Yogi government over the arrest of some farmers in Saharanpur in western Uttar Pradesh for burning farm stubble, triggering a sharp reaction in the region. “Are only farmers responsible for pollution? When will the action be taken against real culprits of pollution? Farmer’s vote – Legal, Farmer’s Paddy – Legal, Farmer’s straw – illegal,” said the AICC General Secretary tasked with reviving the party’s fortunes in Uttar Pradesh. She congratulated the Congress workers and leaders in Saharanpur for standing in unison with farmers and ensuring their release from jail. Stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and parts of western Uttar Pradesh has emerged as a key contributor to air pollution in the winter months with state governments penalising farmers resorting to burning crop residue as they prepare the farms for the rabi crop. Priyanka also hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government over the increase in electricity charges in the state. “People are already reeling under price rise, business of small enterprises has collapsed, farmers' crops are not being sold, they are not getting help in the event of floods, hailstorms and natural disasters, crop insurance scheme has become a source of income for big companies, and in such a situation, electricity prices are constantly increasing. Consumers can no longer bear the brunt of irregularities,” Priyanka said in a statement. She said in the last eight years, the electricity rates for rural household consumers have increased by 500%, urban domestic electricity rates have risen by 84% and for farmers the rates have increased by 126%. “Electricity bills of farmers should have been waived and weavers-artisans, small-scale industries should have been given concession in electricity bills,” Priyanka said referring to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. She demanded that the electricity rates for farmers be halved and weavers-artisans as well as small-scale industries be given relief in power bills.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/priyanka-targets-up-cm-yogi-on-farmers-arrests-rising-power-bills-912161.html
06-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'severe' for second day on trot||The national capital's air quality remained “severe” for the second consecutive day on Friday, while government agencies said it is likely to improve slightly. Experts said while meteorological conditions were “moderately” favourable for dispersion of pollutants, a “very high” number of farm fires in Punjab was the primary reason for the “severe” air quality on Friday. The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 406. On Thursday, the AQI was 450, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 458. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Gurugram also recorded “very poor” to “severe” air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 435 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 6 pm, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.  The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 242 µg/m3 at 6 pm. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.  According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature 11.2 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. V K Soni, the head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said, “The air quality was in the 'very poor' category on Friday morning. It entered the 'severe' zone again by evening, with a very large number of farm fires over Punjab being the primary reason”. He said the boundary layer wind direction was north-northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires to Delhi-NCR. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the farm fire count in Punjab (around 5,100) remained “very high” on Thursday and it is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 percent on Friday. It was 42 percent on Thursday, the maximum this season so far. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 percent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. Health experts said during the Covid-19 pandemic, air pollution has become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital. According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. With Delhi witnessing a spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases amid worsening pollution levels, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a blanket ban on firecrackers from November 7 to November 30. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said those violating the ban on firecrackers can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh by the administration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-severe-for-second-day-on-trot-912177.html

The National Conference (NC) president also assailed the BJP for "misleading the country" and making "false promises" to the people of Jammu and Kashmir as well as those in Ladakh. "I will not die until the rights of my people are given back.... I am here to do something for the people and the day I will finish my work, I will leave this world," Abdullah told NC workers who packed the Sher-e-Kashmir Bhawan here ahead of a scheduled meeting of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) on Saturday. It was 84-year-old Abdullah's first political meeting in Jammu since the abrogation of Article 370, which accorded Jammu and Kashmir special status, and bifurcation of the state into union territories in August last year. Mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, including the NC and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), formed the PAGD last month for the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state as it existed before August 5 last year and also to initiate a dialogue between all stakeholders on the issue. Abdullah, accompanied by his son and former chief minister Omar Abdullah, arrived here this afternoon, their first visit to the region in over a year. The Abdullahs, along with other political leaders in Kashmir, were detained under the Public Safety Act and released this year. Farooq Abdullah, the sitting parliamentarian from Srinagar and a former chief minister, said his party had never differentiated between Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir and always considered them a single entity. "We have never thought that Jammu, Ladakh and Kashmir are separate from each other. We could not be able to take the people of these regions on board at the time of the formation of the PAGD due to the urgency of the situation and now we are here," Abdullah said. He said the parties have joined hands to pitch for the restoration of the Article 370, Article 35A and throw away the "black laws" which were implemented in Jammu and Kashmir beyond Lakhanpur -- the gateway to the erstwhile state bordering Punjab.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-not-die-until-rights-of-my-people-are-restored-farooq-abdullah-912180.html

A magistrate court had on October 26 said police cannot refuse to lodge the case for investigating the allegations of complainant Nisar Ahmed on the grounds that the complaint has been allegedly clubbed with some other case. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav issued notice to Ahmed on the revision petition filed by the police against the magistrate court's order. The court stayed the magistrate court's order till November 19, the next date of hearing. The magistrate court had said that it failed to appreciate how the police could even claim that Ahmed's allegations were false and without any evidence before conducting any proper investigation, of which FIR was the commencing point as per the law. Ahmed claimed he had seen some burqa-clad women or looking like Muslims were killed by swords and their bodies thrown into Bhagirathi Nala. The police reply had stated that Ahmed's complaint was clubbed with the complaint filed by Aas Mohammad, in which he alleged that he was looted by unknown rioters on February 25, and an FIR has been registered in the theft case. Ahmed's counsel had contended that Mohammad's complaint was different from his complaint, which related to alleged murders, looting, assault, arson, intimidation and rioting witnessed by him. The court had said that even further investigation in the registered FIR would not cover the required proper investigation in the allegations levelled by Ahmed. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-court-stays-order-directing-lodging-of-fir-on-alleged-murder-of-women-912210.html

Ghosh claimed, "Eight hundred rupees is being extorted to attend an online session and receive an online degree with absolutely no concern for the students who have nothing in the way of experience except the empty platitudes of a VC who has worked tirelessly to try and jeopardise their research. The university has cut funds for journals, bungled recruitment and dismantled research".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jnusu-to-boycott-varsitys-convocation-ceremony-over-research-fund-cuts-912222.html

Taking a strong exception to utterances by some of the leaders of "so-called" mainstream Kashmir-centric political parties like the PDP and the National Conference, he said unsubstantiated assertions made by these leaders are only motivated by a desperate attempt to hold back the ground which is fast slipping from under their feet. "No political party in India can ever afford to restore back Article 370 and the unsubstantiated assertions made by these leaders are only motivated by a desperate attempt to hold back the ground which is fast slipping from under their feet," Singh told PTI. He also dared the Congress to make its stand clear on the issue, saying if it has the courage and conviction, it should go for the ensuing District Development Council (DDC) elections in Jammu and Kashmir with the slogan that it will restore Article 370 if voted to power at the Centre. Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel, alleged that the bogey of autonomy or self-rule is raised by the leaders of National Conference and other Jammu and Kashmir-based political parties only when they are out of power. He said the leadership of National Conference must explain to the people of Jammu and Kashmir why Farooq Abdullah did not find it appropriate to resign as chief minister when the autonomy resolution put forward by his government in the erstwhile state of J&K was summarily rejected by the then Vajpayee government at the Centre. "Not only this, his son also continued as a junior minister in the Vajpayee government," Singh said. "Let us not forget that the decision to abrogate Article 370 was passed by the Parliament which also has members representing National Conference and PDP," he said. "If indeed, they are sincerely against the decision taken by the Parliament, why do they not, for the sake of minimum propriety, resign from their seats in Parliament so that the people may trust them for what they are saying," he asked. Accusing the political parties of Kashmir and their leaders of "having their cake and eating it too", Singh said this craft of double-speak and change of stance overnight for political expediency is now meeting with the fate of diminishing returns. He said three generations down the line, common masses are now wary of this jugglery and are not ready to be hoodwinked any longer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-political-party-can-ever-afford-to-restore-article-370-in-jammu-and-kashmir-jitendra-singh-912223.html

No treated water from any sewage treatment plant will be released into drains, he said during a visit to the Keshopur Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). "We will ensure that 100 per cent wastewater is recycled and reused. The Delhi Jal Board will fulfill CM Arvind Kejriwal's vision of considering treated water as a resource and utilising every drop coming from STPs,” he said. Jain told officials that high-quality treated water from the 12 MGD Keshopur STP should be provided to farmers through a 30 kilometer irrigation canal network. A pipeline should be laid to provide treated water to the lake in Paschim Vihar and nearby parks, green belts and forests, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-will-ensure-wastewater-is-recycled-reused-in-the-city-water-minister-912252.html

Superintendent of Police, Ramgarh, Prabhat Kumar said that a few vegetable sellers in camp daily market tried to disrupt tests but the police controlled the situation. The vegetable sellers threw medical tools and papers, tables and chairs to protest alleged forcible collection of swab samples during peak business hour closing the gate of the camp vegetable market, said another official on the condition of anonymity. The vegetable sellers also blocked old NH 33 road which passes through Ramgarh town for several hours, police said. Dr Mritunjay Kumar, in charge of special Covid-19 test in Ramgarh, told PTI that in order to increase sampling special rapid antigen test camps were being organized in various locations of the district but unfortunately, a medical team visiting the vegetable market to collect samples was attacked by vegetable sellers who threw away papers, medical tools and Covid test kits. It's because of lack of awareness as they were not aware of Covid-19 outbreak and government initiatives to make the state Covid free, Dr Kumar said, adding that after protest the venue of medical camp was shifted to another location. Bhola Shankar Mahto, circle officer, Ramgarh who was present in the market with the medical team as magistrate said that administration would take initiative to convince the villagers about the threats of coronavirus outbreak and seek cooperation from them. A woman vegetable seller, Rita said that medical team frequently visits market and tries to collect samples forcibly after the closing gate of the market which affects their business as no customers are allowed to enter the market from dawn to dusk. No case has been registered in the matter as no serious injuries were caused in the attack, a government official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/vegetable-sellers-attack-medical-team-trying-to-collect-swab-samples-for-covid-19-test-912263.html

The AAP government in Delhi and the BJP that commands the municipal corporations have been taking potshots at each other, levelling allegations of corruption and fund delays in view of the civic body polls due in early 2022. Sisodia in his acerbic letter accused the Corporations of creating a financial mess and hit at the mayors saying they were "peddling lies" and asked them to rise above "petty politics" and focus on real issues of "corruption and financial mismanagement". North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash, responding to Sisodia's letter, said it showed his "frustration". "Delhi government constituted Delhi Finance Commission and then accepted its recommendations. Now they owe Rs 13,500 crore to Corporations, out of which Rs 6,550 crore is of North Delhi municipal corporation as per 3rd, 4th and 5th DFC recommendations," he claimed.  Prakash said Sisodia must explain when Kejriwal government is releasing the due amount of Rs 13,500 crore due to the Corporations.  "He must also explain have they (AAP) ever given loan to local bodies since their party came to power. Moreover, during trifurcation we were promised a bail-out package by the then Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dikshit which has not been paid," he said. Sisodia in his letter claimed the Delhi government has given Rs 960 crores to the BJP-ruled Corporations as a grant for education. The Delhi government was supposed to pay this by December 2020 but paid much before that, he claimed.  "Despite this release of funds by the Delhi government, the BJP-ruled MCDs are not paying the salary of the teachers, therefore, they are on protest demanding their salaries," Sisodia said. He asked the mayors, keeping in mind Diwali and the pandemic situation, to immediately release the salaries of the teachers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/manish-sisodia-asks-bjp-ruled-mcds-to-immediately-release-teachers-salaries-912327.html

Concentration of major air pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 also remained high in the five neighbouring cities of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The average 24-hour AQI at 4 pm on Friday was 433 in Ghaziabad, 421 in Greater Noida,  415 in Faridabad, 406 in Noida and 392 in Gurgaon, according to the CPCB's Sameer app. It was 464 in Ghaziabad, 457 in Greater Noida, 450 in Noida, 443 in Gurgaon and 416 in Faridabad on Thursday. PM 2.5 and PM 10 were the prominent pollutants in these satellite cities of Delhi, where the average AQI remained at 406 on Friday, according to the app. The CPCB states that an AQI in the "severe" category affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.

06-11-2020||Oasis||Mental purification and duty||Where there is no other source of water, people will go the lone well that is available. But when there are copious rains and the river is full, why would people go to the well? To the realized sage who has purified his mind by doing all his actions in a detached manner without any motive, all other rituals and rites are as useful as the well is to the people who are surrounded by the full river”. This example is given by Lord Krishna in the second chapter of the Bhagavad  Geeta to drive home two important messages, namely, purification of the mind and the performance of one’s duty in life.  Everyone is born with certain inborn tendencies or characteristics which may be classified as (i) a predisposition for uprightness, honesty, spiritual and philosophical leanings, concern for fellow beings and so on, broadly called ‘sattva’, (ii) a mind constantly in a disturbed and unsteady state, manifesting as anger, pride, egotism, broadly called ‘rajas’, (iii) a tendency for laziness, doing prohibited things, casual and indifferent attitude etc, broadly called ‘tamas’. All these three characteristics are present in all men in varying proportions. The characteristic which dominates determines the nature of the individual. The crux of Lord Krishna’s advice is that human life should be a constant effort at reducing or mitigating the rajas and tamas characteristics and increasing the sattva characteristic. Man is always trying to achieve or gain something. Getting that which we do not have is called ‘yoga’. Next, that which has been gained has to be retained, protected from loss. This effort to retain and protect that which has been gained is called ‘kshema’. Thus, yoga and kshema are inseparable from human existence.  “Man should work hard and ambitiously to lead his life in comfort” is upheld by all scriptures. But, “never do your work with only the final benefits in mind. Do it in the best possible way. At the same time, do not shirk your responsibilities and keep away from performing your duty” is the well-known statement of the Geeta. Such an approach is conducive for achieving mental purity which is the doorway to higher things in life is the message of the Geeta.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/mental-purification-and-duty-911886.html
06-11-2020||Opinion||Is America becoming a failed state?||By Paul Krugman As I write this, it seems extremely likely that Joe Biden has won the presidency. And he clearly received millions more votes than his opponent. He can and should claim that he has been given a strong mandate to govern the nation. But there are real questions about whether he will, in fact, be able to govern. At the moment, it seems likely that the Senate — which is wildly unrepresentative of the American people — will remain in the hands of an extremist party that will sabotage Biden in every way it can. Before I get into the problems this confrontation is likely to cause, let’s talk about just how unrepresentative the Senate is. Every state, of course, has two senators — which means that Wyoming’s 579,000 residents have as much weight as California’s 39 million. The overweighted states tend to be much less urbanised than the nation as a whole. And given the growing political divide between metropolitan and rural areas, this gives the Senate a strong rightward tilt. An analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight.com found that the Senate in effect represents an electorate almost 7 percentage points more Republican than the average voter. Cases like Susan Collins, who held on in Maine, a Democratic state, are exceptions; the underlying right-wing skew of the Senate is the main reason the GOP will probably retain control despite a substantial Democratic victory in the presidential popular vote. But, you may ask, why is divided control of government such a problem? After all, Republicans controlled one or both chambers of Congress for three-quarters of Barack Obama’s presidency, and we survived, didn’t we? Yes, but.  In fact, GOP obstruction did a lot of damage even during the Obama years. Republicans used hardball tactics, including threats to cause a default on the national debt, to force a premature withdrawal of fiscal support that slowed the pace of economic recovery. I’ve estimated that without this de facto sabotage, the unemployment rate in 2014 might have been about 2 percentage points lower than it actually was. And the need for more spending is even more acute now than it was in 2011, when Republicans took control of the House. We desperately need a new round of federal spending on health care, aid to the unemployed and businesses, and support for strapped state and local governments. Reasonable estimates suggest that we should spend $200 billion or more each month until a vaccine brings the pandemic to an end. I’d be shocked if a Senate still controlled by Mitch McConnell would agree to anything like this. Even after the pandemic is over, we’re likely to face both persistent economic weakness and a desperate need for more public investment. But McConnell effectively blocked infrastructure spending even with Donald Trump in the White House. Why would he become more amenable with Biden in office? Now, spending isn’t the only form of policy. Normally, there are many things a president can achieve for good (Obama) or evil (Trump) through executive action. In fact, during the summer a Democratic task force identified hundreds of things a President Biden could do without having to go through Congress. But here’s where I worry about the role of a heavily partisan Supreme Court — a court shaped by McConnell’s norm-breaking behaviour, including the rushed confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett just days before the election. Six of nine justices were chosen by a party that has won the popular vote only once in the past eight elections. And I think there’s a substantial chance that this court may behave like the Supreme Court in the 1930s, which kept blocking New Deal programs until FDR threatened to add seats — something Biden wouldn’t be able to do with a Republican-controlled Senate. So we are in big trouble. Trump’s defeat would mean that we have, for the moment, avoided a plunge into authoritarianism — and yes, the stakes are that high, not just because of who Trump is, but also because the modern GOP is so extremist and anti-democratic. But our skewed electoral system means that Trump’s party is still in a position to hobble, perhaps cripple, the next president’s ability to deal with the huge epidemiological, economic and environmental problems we face. Put it this way: If we were looking at a foreign country with America’s level of political dysfunction, we would probably consider it on the edge of becoming a failed state — that is, a state whose government is no longer able to exert effective control. Runoff elections in Georgia may yet give Democrats Senate control; barring that, Biden might be able to find a few reasonable Republicans willing to pull us back from that brink. But despite his apparent victory, the Republic remains in great danger.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/is-america-becoming-a-failed-state-911935.html
06-11-2020||Opinion||Covid-19's third wave is big, but there is hope||By Justin Fox When White House coronavirus coordinator Deborah Birx went to Bismarck, North Dakota, late last month, she wasn’t thrilled with what she saw. “Over the last 24 hours, as we were here and we were in your grocery stores and in your restaurants and frankly even in your hotels, this is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,” she told reporters. “And we find that deeply unfortunate because you don’t know who’s infected and you don’t know if you’re infected yourself.” Birx is right! Not wearing a mask in the midst of one of the country’s worst Covid-19 outbreaks is dumb. Sitting in a Bismarck restaurant for 90 minutes without a mask on may bring a 5% risk of catching the disease, going by the estimates of the microCOVID project. But do you know what most Bismarckians were doing when Birx visited? Staying home, from the looks of it. For the past couple of weeks, people in the Bismarck metropolitan area have been restricting their movements relative to normal even more than New Yorkers have.  This measure is calculated by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from mobile-device geolocation data. It combines several different variables such as the fraction of devices leaving home in a day and the average time spent at locations far from home. In the now-months-long debate over whether lockdowns or the pandemic hurt the economy more, this seems to offer a bit of evidence for the latter, as New York still has many more government restrictions on commerce and behavior than North Dakota does, according to the coronavirus stringency index compiled by the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. I’m more interested, though, in what the slowdown in activity implies for what happens next with the outbreak in North Dakota and neighboring states, and the overall resurgence of the disease that has now for the first time put the U.S. at more than 100,000 new confirmed cases a day. For North Dakota, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s aggregate of 25 independent epidemiological forecasts projects confirmed cases in the state will stop rising this month. This forecast could turn out to be way off, of course. And confirmed cases are an inadequate metric of the disease’s spread when the percentage of tests coming back positive is in the double digits and rising, as it has been in North Dakota (the latest seven-day average is 14%). But the change in behavior reflected in the above chart should have some impact. Similar modest declines in mobility preceded epidemic peaks in several Sun Belt metropolitan areas hit hard by Covid this summer.  The link between people going out less and the disease spreading less seems obvious enough, but it can be helpful to run through a simple infection model to clarify it. The key variable is the reproduction number, usually represented by the letter R, which is how many other people each person with the disease can be expected to infect. R0, or R-naught, reflects how the disease spreads when (a) nobody has immunity, (b) nobody changes their behavior and (c) everybody mixes with everybody else more or less randomly. For Covid-19, R0 is usually estimated at a bit above 3. That’s a lot lower than the measles (15 or so) but a lot higher than seasonal influenza (around 1.3). The effective R — how fast the disease is really spreading at any given time — reflects people developing immunity to the disease, changing their behavior and mixing with one another unevenly (that is, some people hang out together in Bismarck bars while others stay home). It can be thought of as the product of four things that London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine epidemiologist  Adam Kucharski dubs DOTS, for: - The duration of time someone is infectious - The opportunities for transmission during this period (such as social interactions) - The transmission probability during each opportunity (such as whether someone coughs or sneezes) - The probability that the person on the other end of the interaction is susceptible to that infection. When people go out less, the opportunities for transmission of Covid-19 decline. When lots of them wear masks, the transmission probability likely declines. And when people get the disease and recover from it, susceptibility declines. Estimates of the effective state reproduction numbers on the rt.live website created by Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom and statistical modeler Thomas Vladeck ranged from 0.84 in Mississippi to 1.45 in Maine when last I checked. North Dakota’s is 1.17, which doesn’t sound like much. But as German Chancellor Angela Merkel elegantly explained back in April, it only takes a few months at an effective R of 1.1 or 1.2 for a Covid outbreak to grow from tiny to hospital-filling. Still, that’s a lot slower-moving than a Covid outbreak with an effective R of more than 3, which is what overwhelmed New York City in a matter of weeks early this year. It also means it shouldn’t take all that big a change in behavior, coupled with rising immunity, to get the effective R back down below 1. That’s the optimistic view currently reflected in most of the epidemiological models tracked by the CDC. The agency’s aggregate forecasts show cases plateauing in coming weeks in currently hard-hit states such as Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. On a national level they predict cases will continue to increase but at a slower pace than over the past couple of months. Cases are rising now in almost every state, but most states have already been through at least one Covid wave, which makes a difference. As Bob Wachter, medicine department chair at the University of California at San Francisco, put it on Twitter this week: “One gets the sense that prior surges are protective — likely a combo of people w/antibodies & fear of God.” Add to that the seeming decline in the deadliness of the disease, and the possible looming arrival of vaccines and, well, maybe there really is a light at the end of this tunnel. A less-optimistic view is that we have yet to experience Covid through a Northern hemisphere winter, and can’t judge yet what impact much-colder weather and shorter days will have on both the spread of the disease and its severity. There is at least the possible upside that the customary winter scourge of influenza will be much less widespread than usual because the precautionary measures people are taking against the much-more-contagious Covid-19 drive the effective R of the flu well below 1. Who knows, though. Back at the beginning of July, I took a probably unwarranted stab at epidemiological forecasting, arguing that because of the forces described above, the Covid epidemics in Arizona and elsewhere were about to peak. That turned out to be right, but I don’t get the sense anybody worth taking seriously is truly confident in forecasting just what will happen with Covid in the US over the next three or four months. We haven’t turned the corner, and it’s not magically going away. Beyond that, in the likely absence of any major pandemic-fighting push from Washington before late January, it’s going to be up to state and local policies and a lot of individual decisions like the ones people are currently making in Bismarck to determine the shape of the curve. So … wear a mask, people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/covid-19s-third-wave-is-big-but-there-is-hope-912268.html
06-11-2020||Opinion||Trump’s Supreme Court comments put Justice Barrett in a bind||By Noah Feldman If the Supreme Court takes on a case connected to the outcome of the presidential election, Justice Amy Coney Barrett will face the most important decision of her career: not how to vote, but whether to participate at all. The situation is unprecedented. Never before has a president explicitly stated that he is choosing a justice so that she will be able to adjudicate that president’s own immediate re-election. And while there are arguments both for and against recusal, the argument for recusal is stronger. The one Supreme Court case that is most directly relevant is 2009’s Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. It involved a West Virginia judge who was elected after receiving $3 million in campaign contributions from the chairman of a company appealing a $50 million penalty. The chairman knew whichever judge won the election would review his appeal. The Supreme Court held, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, that the due process clause of the Constitution was violated when the judge chose not to recuse himself and participated in the appeal that reversed the $50 million verdict against the company. The vote was 5 to 4, with Kennedy joining the court’s (then) four liberals to form a majority. In a fascinating op-ed in the Washington Post last month, retired conservative judge J. Michael Luttig — who didn’t care for the outcome in the Caperton decision — nonetheless argued that the decision likely obligates Barrett to recuse herself from participating in a 2020 election decision involving President Donald Trump. He emphasized the crucial sentence from Kennedy’s opinion: “Just as no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise when — without the other parties’ consent — a man chooses the judge in his own cause.” One thing that makes the Caperton case different from Barrett’s situation is, of course, that the West Virginia judge was elected — and that the interested party spent cold hard cash on the judge’s campaign.  Barrett, in contrast, was appointed by a president exercising his constitutional authority. The fact of her appointment alone certainly should not count as a reason for the justice to recuse herself. If it were, no justice would never be able to sit on any case involving the president who appointed him or her. Yet there is another major factor in play for Barrett that wasn’t present in Caperton — and that cuts the other way, in favor of recusal. Trump has publicly and repeatedly said that one of the reasons he chose Barrett was that so she could cast the decisive vote in an election case involving him. As the president put it back in September, “I think this [election] will end up in the Supreme Court, and I think it’s very important that we have nine justices … having a four-four situation is not a good situation.” A four-four tie at the court is what has allowed Pennsylvania to count ballots postmarked by November 3, rather than only those arriving by November 3. This is the very archetype of the concern expressed by Justice Kennedy when he said that fears of bias would arise when “a man chooses the judge in his own cause.” Trump chose Barrett with the explicit intent that she judge his cause in the election battle he expected to wage at the Supreme Court. Indeed, litigation in the lower courts had already begun when Barrett was nominated. The Pennsylvania case was already pending at the Supreme Court before Barrett was confirmed. The important issue for recusal is not only — or even primarily — whether the justice can trust herself to be fair. It’s whether the public can reasonably and legitimately expect fairness. As the federal recusal statute makes clear, recusal is proper where a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” The optics of Trump choosing a justice specifically to decide his on case, and that judge then ruling in his favor, would have a devastating effect on public perceptions of the fairness and legitimacy of the court. Trump has repeatedly called for the Supreme Court to intervene in the election, most recently in a 2 a.m. tweet Friday morning. Just a few hours earlier on Thursday evening, a Trump legal advisor and campaign proxy told Fox, “We’re waiting for the United States Supreme Court — of which the President has nominated three justices — to step in and do something. And hopefully Amy Coney Barrett will come through.” This is precisely the kind of situation where a reasonable person might question Barrett’s impartiality. Barrett’s situation is therefore not at all like that of Justices Brett Kavanaugh or Neil Gorsuch, who became justices long before the 2020 election issues were before the Supreme Court. Her situation is unique on the court — and in U.S. history. The limited principle that would emerge from Barrett’s recusal would be simply this: that recusal is appropriate when the president of the United States is involved in active litigation before the Supreme Court regarding his re-election while the justice is in the process of being confirmed, and the president has expressly said that he needs that justice on the court to decide the outcome in that particular case. With any luck, this situation would never arise again. Barrett is, I believe, a deeply conscientious judge. She has thought carefully about recusal, even writing an important academic article about the subject. Ultimately the decision will be up to her. But a close analysis of this situation leads me to conclude that Barrett must recuse herself in order to preserve the legitimacy of the judicial process and the Supreme Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/trump-s-supreme-court-comments-put-justice-barrett-in-a-bind-912322.html
06-11-2020||Opinion||US Elections: Republicans, now is the time to step up||Speaking from the White House briefing room Thursday night, President Donald Trump tried to delegitimize the 2020 election. This attempt may have been shuddersome, disgraceful and dangerous. But there’s one thing it was not: a surprise. On the contrary. It was tediously predictable, exactly what you’d expect of a man who has spent four years lumbering through Washington, crushing custom after custom and norm after norm. As Trump faltered on the brink of losing a presidential election — the first incumbent to do so in 28 years — he declared, baselessly, that absentee votes legitimately cast were fraudulent; that the diligent workers paid to count those votes were doing something nefarious; and that the “election apparatus” in the still-unresolved states were controlled by Democrats. (They are not. Georgia’s secretary of state, for one, is a Republican.) “They are trying to steal an election,” Trump said, speaking (I think) of ballot counters in Detroit and Philadelphia. “They are trying to rig an election. We can’t let that happen.” But here’s my question for Republicans: Are they going to let this happen? Allow the head of their party to challenge the integrity of an election with record-breaking participation rates — in the midst of a pandemic, no less — just because he despises the result?  They’ve allowed just about everything else and given this demagogue a rather comfortable home; perhaps Trump’s words right now will hardly shock them. Faced with the prospect of losing an election, he’s now doing what demagogues do. We just haven’t seen the likes of it in the United States. What Trump said Thursday night was historic, and not in a good way. These past four years, the president has done his best to weaken the foundations of democracy. But on the evening of Nov. 5, he seemed hellbent on breaking the 244-year-old thing itself. Telling your nation that the free election it just had is a sham — that’s taking aim at the head and heart. Back in June, I wrote that you could see Trump trying, already, to make an autocratic lunge for power. He had replaced the last of his honorable civil servants and Cabinet officials with a gallery of dupes, dopes and devotees. He had dispatched Attorney General William Barr to do his bidding at the Department of Justice. He had gotten rid of five inspectors general. He had used the military to clear a public square of protesters. He had found an ally to purge the heads of Radio Free Europe and its three cousins, in what seemed like a spooky bid to make his own version of state-run TV. As the election approached, he and his allies did everything they could to disenfranchise Democratic voters. Their efforts do not appear to have been sufficient. As I write, Joe Biden is poised to win enough Electoral College votes to win the 2020 election. And so Trump is now doing what any aspiring strongman would: making a mad grab for power, the people’s choices be damned. He’ll use his lawyers, certainly. But just as important, he’ll use disinformation. From his Twitter feed. From the podium in the White House briefing room. From his own children — essential accessories in any banana republic — who are currently throwing Molotov cocktails on Twitter. The company had to remove a tweet by Don Jr. on Thursday, who called on his father to “go to total war over the election to expose all of the fraud, cheating, dead/no longer in state voters, that has been going on for far too long.” (And perhaps this goes without saying, but: Sic) More than ever, these falsehoods have consequences. Those who simply shrug them off don’t seem to care about their reach, their power, their ability to foment unrest. A Facebook group called “Stop the Steal” started Wednesday and was shut down within the space of 22 hours, after the company learned that members were trying to incite violence. At that point, it had acquired over 320,000 followers, becoming one of the fastest-growing groups Facebook had ever seen. Those who’ve supported Trump have one last chance to be on the right side of history. A couple already have. And I’m betting more will join them, though it may be for the wrong reasons. On Thursday, after the president’s news conference, the New York Post ran a story about it under the headline “Downcast Trump makes baseless election fraud claims in White House address.” I do not think the paper’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, had a sudden flash of conscience. I suspect that he likes winners, and he suddenly senses that Trump isn’t one. If the president is a cult leader, now is the moment he’s demanding that his followers drink the Kool-Aid. Rupert decided he wasn’t all that thirsty. Let’s see how many other Republicans decide they aren’t that thirsty either. Let’s see how many of them finally put country before party, deciding it’s more important — no, imperative — for American democracy to live.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-elections-republicans-now-is-the-time-to-step-up-912324.html
06-11-2020||Panorama||Twin problems for India: Energy transition and energy poverty||A recent BP report, “Energy Outlook 2020” suggested a possible path for the world to keep temperature rise due to global warming less than 1.5 degree centigrade above the preindustrial period. While it is easier for developed countries to manage energy transition, developing countries like India face the twin problems of energy transition and energy poverty.  Unlike previous BP reports which were influenced by assumptions regarding economic growth, oil prices, geopolitical factors, etc, this report was developed to avoid the existential crisis of climate change.  BP has developed three scenarios --Business As Usual (BAU), Rapid transition, and Net Zero carbon emission. BP is honest in stating that it does not believe that any of these three scenarios will take place. However, the report hastens to state that BP’s business plans are influenced by these scenarios. Unlike in the past, the company has paid special attention to India’s critical role in enabling the world to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement.  Carbon emissions from energy in the ‘rapid transition’ scenario will fall by 70% by 2050 to 9 giga tonnes of Carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) to keep temperature rise below 2 degrees and in ‘net zero’, by 95% to 1.5 Gt CO2 by 2050 from the current level of 33 Gt CO2 to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Under BAU, there is a minimal amount of carbon reduction.  The largest carbon reduction is in the transportation sector where electric vehicles (EV) will replace internal combustion engines, and fossil fuels for power generation will be replaced by solar and wind energy to charge EV batteries.  EVs in the ‘rapid’ and ‘net zero’ scenarios account for between 70-80% of four-wheeled vehicle kilometres (VKM) travelling on roads by 2050, compared to less than 1% in 2018. The corresponding shares in BAU are around 30% in 2050.  The intermittency associated with solar and wind power requires a variety of technologies and solutions to supply power on a 24x7 basis. It is more than likely that many governments will impose a carbon tax to promote faster energy transition.   Renewable energy increases more than tenfold in both the ‘rapid’ and ‘net zero’ scenarios, with its share in primary energy rising from five percent in 2018 to over 40% by 2050 in ‘Rapid’ and almost 60% in ‘net zero’. Hydrocarbons' share of primary energy will decline from close to 85% in 2018 to around 40% by 2050 in the ‘rapid’ and 20% in the ‘Net Zero’ scenario.  The consumption of oil will fall to less than 55 Mb/d and 30 Mb/d in the ‘Rapid’ and ‘Net Zero’ scenarios respectively by 2050. In short, the beginning of the end of the oil era has started.  For India, such a dramatic drop in oil demand will pose a huge problem. BP’s model shows that India’s oil demand is to increase from the current level of 5.1 mmbd to 9.7 mmbd in BAU or is to fall to 2.4 mmbd in 2050 in the ‘Net Zero’ scenario. Gas demand is expected to increase in all three scenarios from 58 billion cubic meters (CBM) in 2018 to between 332 and 215 BCM. Such wide variations will make long-range planning extremely complex.  Should India add to refinery capacity or manage with the existing ones? When there is a huge surplus of refining capacity in the world, it does not make economic or strategic sense to invest in expensive refining capacity in India.  Similarly, when oil reserves are likely to be stranded and oil-producing countries will lose oil power, changing the geopolitical power equation, what impact will this have on India’s foreign policy? Will there be a need for strategic oil reserves in the future?  Since natural gas will play a critical role during and after the energy transition, how should India get ready to meet increasing gas import requirements? Sound plans to invest in terminals to import Liquified Natural Gas and pipelines to transport gas to consuming centres will be needed.  Electricity consumption in India will increase robustly in all three scenarios, growing between 4.0- 4.6% per year over the Outlook, as India’s GDP increases and energy poverty decreases.  The pace and extent of decarbonisation of power is greater in the ‘rapid transition’ scenario, with coal power generation falling by around 40% by 2050. Wind and solar power generation will grow by around 30-fold and 60-fold respectively, and gas over 13-fold. To balance the intermittency of renewables, greater use of natural gas power plants will be required. Intermittency problem can also be solved by using green hydrogen produced by renewables.  While India as a major country should contribute its share to manage the climate change crisis, it needs to give higher priority to eliminate the shocking levels of energy poverty. Even after providing power access to all villages in India, millions do not have electricity connections. Those who have access, do not get quality power.   Thus, there is an urgent need to supply villages with distributed energy generated by renewables.  Smart Power India (SPI), an initiative launched by Rockefeller Foundation in 2015, has been supporting 300 mini-grids, run by a diverse set of private companies, benefiting more than 2.5 lakh customers. Tata Power has formed a partnership with SPI last year, to establish what will become the largest mini-grid company in the world, reaching 10,000 villages and serving over 25 million people. Unfortunately, our planners have not yet considered expanding such mini-grids on a massive scale to help solve energy poverty. On October 26 at India Energy Forum, PM Modi presented a map of Energy Policy, listing seven drivers of the energy sector. While the PM’s metaphor of seven horses driving the Solar God’s chariot sounds convincing, the two horses of fossil fuels and biofuels are wrong ones. The other five horses, renewables, use of digital technology, EV mobility,  hydrogen and gas-based economy are appropriate as discussed in this article. It is high time that India develops an expert-driven integrated energy policy.  (The writer is former governing council member of Manipal Institute of Technology, and an international oil expert)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/twin-problems-for-india-energy-transition-and-energy-poverty-911876.html
06-11-2020||Panorama||Covid-19 and climate change literacy||Nine-year-old, Manipuri activist, Licypriya Kangujam was detained by the police and ordered not to peacefully protest outside the Indian Parliament about air pollution in Delhi.  Social media users were aghast and shocked at how officials treated the girl for spreading awareness and helping Delhi improve its air quality.  What is climate change literacy and what can we learn from the coronavirus pandemic?  Climate change literacy is a term with layers of meaning to it. This is about being aware of how one’s actions contribute to climate change and its consequences. This would include making an effort to shift to sustainable practices and greener solutions. Climate change literacy is more than just knowing that the earth is in danger. Rather, it is about connecting with the issue on a personal and political level and acting on it. In order to take action at a community or global level, we need to know the causes and problems of climate change. Since the outbreak of coronavirus, people have started to understand the connection between planetary health and their well-being. Though strict measures were taken by countries to prevent the spread of the virus, like sealing boundaries, the total number of cases has risen alarmingly. The virus did not differentiate between human-made borders. Similarly, the impacts of national-level decisions that degrade the environment may be transboundary, so we must consider how we can persuade policy-makers to implement necessary measures.  Samantha Montano, a professor of energy management and disaster, argues the need to be proactive. She believes that the coronavirus outbreak will initiate some policy changes. After fighting a pandemic and learning how difficult it is to implement laws, we must be prepared for climate-related disasters. Urban populations are especially susceptible to the virus, because of higher population density and overcrowding. The lack of open spaces has allowed the virus to thrive; in the case of vast, open lands, the virus would die without a host to attach to. Likewise, the environmental impact of climate change events is severe in many urban areas. For example, flooding is more likely in urban areas where there is no place for water to flow and collect. Eric Holthaus, a British meteorologist, claims that Kerala’s efficient response to the virus outbreak outperforms the delayed, laid-back approach of certain well-developed countries that misunderstood the potential of the virus. We can draw upon policy-lessons from Kerala’s community-based approach in dealing with Covid-19, where all socio-economic groups were taken care of when the lockdown was imposed. The rest of India witnessed massive migration because policy-measures were short-sighted. While health was prioritised over the economy, the weaker sections of the society were worst affected by the restrictive measures. The lesson here to draw for climate change literacy is that extreme events cannot be underestimated or treated with short-sightedness. To prevent or mitigate such events, every section in the community needs to be involved. The peculiar nature of the coronavirus shows that the outcome of any lockdown can be seen only if all the citizens strictly abide by it. Much like climate change mitigation, a slow and continuous process that requires everybody’s participation, the situation won’t get better overnight. If staying home helps to reduce the number of infections in the community, shifting towards sustainable practices will contribute to mitigating climate change. To build on this momentum, activists suggest a “degrowth” in developed countries where people are encouraged to reduce their usage and consumption of resources even if it slows down the nation’s economic growth.  Many climate change activists are talking about these connections now, amplifying the urgency of the issue. Their voices on social media and online platforms have reached a large audience, greatly increasing climate change literacy. However, fake news or misleading ideas are also being circulated, making people question what they already know. As a stepping-stone to climate change literacy, we must learn to trust only well-known sites, voices from activists and experts in this field. We must question our experiences to weigh what is best for the planet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/covid-19-and-climate-change-literacy-911884.html
06-11-2020||Right in the Middle||A theft under broad streetlight||I often patronise this particular store, housing panoplies of prepossessing accessories. Which, I delight in giving away as gifts to many female-folks. Especially, to teeny-tots, whose tiny eyes twinkle with tons of joy on seeing these things.   On an evening, some two years ago, as I was scanning across several items at this store, I saw the streets getting shrouded in darkness. Hurriedly, I hurtled myself outside to hail an auto to hop into, to get back home. After a great wait, I got one with a driver being quite garrulous, gushing out with gusto over sundry topics. I managed, responding in monosyllables, as my mind meandered around many other matters.        As I neared my destination, I asked the driver to stop near a streetlight, to see the auto-meter readings better. The fare was Rs 28, and I handed Rs 20 and a tenner. The driver took it and, in a trice, retuned it, showing a small ‘snip’ at the centre-crease of the note. “The note is pretty new. How come this ‘tear’?” I wondered inwardly.  With no other small currencies other than a wad of Rs 500 note, I offered one of them. And lo! The driver gave this note back too, pointing out a ‘cut’ in the same place. Then, the next one, only to be promptly returned. Now, on the trot, he had returned five currency notes with the ‘tear’ (including Rs 20), bang at mid-fold. I began to panic, as the driver slickly played with my psyche. He asked, “Is there something in your sling bag, causing these ‘slits’ in currencies?”  I started cogitating over the collection of ‘bought’ accessories! The auto-driver, as if bestowing big favour, finally accepted the ‘torn’ Rs 20 itself, and zoomed off. When I came home, I was indeed shellshocked, to see I had bartered away four of my Rs 500 notes for four of his Rs 100 currencies! Thus, making me incur a loss of Rs 2,000! Yes, the new purplish Rs.100 currency, introduced just then, appeared like a Rs 500 note, in the golden yellowish streetlight!  The driver’s act was like magician’s legerdemain, who, in quick succession was swapping notes, in between, swiftly creating small ‘tears’ himself! The best part was, I was unaware of being bamboozled! As seldom have I got swindled in life, call it my spunky and super-vigilant attitude.   Well, the story’s moral: In testing times, to remain calm, confident, cautious, instead of being too trusting, tizzy and tensed! Once diddled, twice daringly smart!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-theft-under-broad-streetlight-911881.html
06-11-2020||Second Edit||Death sentence is not the answer||The Karnataka High Court’s assertion that there should be no leniency shown to culprits in cases of sexual violence against women is commendable, and its concern is timely and relevant when more and more cases of gang rape, the murder of rape victims, and sexual assaults on children are coming to public attention. The court expressed its views and sentiments while dismissing the appeals of seven persons who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for gang rape by the trial court. They had been convicted and sentenced for the gang rape of a student in 2012 in Bengaluru. Apart from confirming the lower court’s decision, the court also recommended to the government to amend Section 376D of the Indian Penal Code to award death sentence to the accused in gang rape cases. The section currently provides for a jail term of not less than 20 years, with a penalty. The court has said that this would help to “curb the menace of gang rape in society at large.’’  While the court’s concern is welcome, its proposal may not be the right solution to the problem. It has said that “gang rape is worse than murder’’ and so it thinks that the death penalty is the right punishment for it. Capital punishment already exists in the statute for gang rape and the Nirbhaya case accused were sentenced to death. Last year, the law was amended to allow the death penalty for rape of children younger than 12 years. But it may not be right to assume that a harsher penalty would be a deterrent against crimes, including sexual crimes. It has been pointed out that it is the certainty of punishment and not its severity that acts as a deterrent. It is doubtful if the certainty of the death penalty would bring down the number of sexual crimes, including gang rape. It might actually increase the possibility of the victim being killed in a bid to destroy evidence of the crime.  More than 40% of those sentenced to death in 2018 and about 53% of those in 2019 were convicted for cases that included sexual offences and murder. Death sentences are increasingly being meted out in cases involving sexual violence. This is happening extra-judicially also, as in the killing by the police of four persons accused of rape and murder in Hyderabad in December last year. What is needed, rather than the death penalty, is better investigation and prosecution of rape cases. The conviction rate in rape cases is low. It actually dropped from 32.2% in 2017 to 27.2% in 2018. The death sentence is not a right and just punishment for any crime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/death-sentence-is-not-the-answer-911874.html

The searches were carried out on Thursday at 66 premises in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Chandigarh, Punjab and Telangana.  The action was carried out, the CBDT said in a statement, of a well-known self-styled evangelist of Thiruvalla (Kerala) and his group of various trusts that enjoy exemption under the I-T Act of 1961 as charitable or religious trusts.  While the statement did not identify the group, I-T department sources identified it as the Believer's eastern church. "The group operates places of worship, a number of schools and colleges across the country, a medical college and a hospital in Kerala," the statement said. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is the administrative authority for the tax department. It said "unexplained cash of about 6 crore has also been found during the raids including Rs 3.85 crore in a place of worship in Delhi." "Substantial electronic computing and data storage has been found, which is being examined," the CBDT said. The Board said the searches were carried out as "credible information was received that the group has received donations from foreign countries ostensibly for helping the poor and the destitute and for evangelical purposes but was actually siphoning out such tax-exempted funds in cash to engage in unaccounted cash transactions for personal and other illegal expenses in real estate transactions." It said the Thiruvalla-based group operates about 30 trusts, registered across the country, and most of them "exist only on paper and have been found to be used for routing unaccounted funds and for accommodation (hawala) transactions."  "It has been found that the modus operandi of the group is to systematically inflate expenses with the help of other parties who would return the inflated amount in cash through domestic hawala channels to the functionaries of the group," it said. "Some of these other parties were also covered in the search action," it said.  During the raids, it said, evidences have been found of "systematic inflation of expenses in the purchase of consumables, construction expenses, real estate development expenses, payment of salary, etc." "The search has led to unearthing of a number of real estate transactions involving unaccounted cash payments. Related documents such as sale agreements, etc have been seized. The group has also inflated the price in real estate transactions to show as if the money received in donations is being spent on the activities of the trusts," it said. "The evidence found so far indicate that the siphoning of funds in cash may be running into hundreds of crores of rupees," it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/i-t-raids-kerala-evangelist-his-churches-group-on-charges-of-siphoning-donations-meant-for-poor-912041.html

In a path-breaking move, the TDB, which manages over 1,200 shrines across the southern state, has decided to appoint 19 lower caste people, including 18 belonging to the Scheduled Caste and one from the Scheduled Tribe, as priests in its shrines on a part-time basis. The TDB is an autonomous temple body which manages many famous shrines including the Sabarimala Lord Ayyappa Temple. "This is for the first time that the temple body is appointing a Scheduled Tribe person as a priest in shrines under TDB," state Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said in a Facebook post. People from lower caste are appointed in the part-time shanti (priest) posts through special recruitment, he said. So far, 310 people have been selected for the post of part-time priests in the Travancore Devaswom Board from the rank list, published in 2017, he said. As there were not enough eligible candidates from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities for the examination at that time, a separate rank list was prepared as per a special notification for them, which was published on November 5, he said. Though there were four vacancies notified for the ST community, only one application was received, the minister said. After the Left government came to power, the recruitment board was restructured and a total of 815 people had been selected for various posts in Travancore, Cochin and Malabar Devaswom Boards, the minister added. A total of 133 non-Brahmin priests have been appointed in various temples in the southern state in the last four and half year tenure of the government, official sources added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/in-a-first-keralas-apex-temple-body-to-appoint-scheduled-tribe-priest-912043.html

The Saffron party's top state leader said the yatra was to 'expose' the DMK which was allegedly behind the 'Karuppar Kootam', a YouTube channel, that had reportedly denigrated "Kanda Sashti Kavacham", a spiritual hymn in praise of Lord Muruga. Amid chants of 'Vetri vel' and 'Veera Vel,' when Murugan, clad in saffron tried to start the yatra in his custom made van from Tiruttani, he was held along with scores of BJP workers. Union Minister of State for Home, G Kishan Reddy visited Tiruttani to offer worship at the temple and Murugan called on him at a hotel before he was detained. BJP national general secretary C T Ravi, state leaders including Pon Radhakrishnan, C P Radhakrishnan and H Raja were among those who arrived at Tiruttani for the yatra. Asked on BJP's attempt to go on yatra, Chief Minister K Palaniswami said in Nilgiris district that law will take its own course. Vel, a spear-like weapon of Lord Muruga, is worshipped by the devotees as a destroyer of evil. Tiruttani is 85 km away from here, close to the Andhra Pradesh border and the town is home to Sri Subramanya Swami temple, one of the six sacred shrines, 'padai veedu' of Lord Muruga. The yatra was originally scheduled to commence from Friday and go on till December 6 covering all the six abodes of Lord Muruga or Karthikeya spread across Tamil Nadu. The government, however, refused permission for it "in view of the coronavirus pandemic." The Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi had petitioned the police against permission for the yatra alleging that it could lead to violence. Also, two petitions were filed in the Madras High Court against the yatra and the government informed the court on Thursday that there would be no permission for it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-bjp-chief-l-murugan-tries-to-go-on-vel-yatra-defying-ban-detained-912069.html

According to the agreement, these government-runs ITIs would be upgraded at a cost of Rs 4636.50 crore in partnership with Tata Technologies Ltd and other industry partners. Skill development training would be provided as per current demands of the industries, an official statement said. Along with Tata Technologies, about 20 companies are contributing Rs 4,080 crore from their CSR funds. The remaining amount would be provided by the State government. These 150 ITIs would be upgraded at a cost of Rs 30 crore each. "It is intended to provide training in necessary skills to the ITI students based on requirements of Industry 4.0 (i.e; 4th industrial revolution) and provide better employment opportunities," the statement said. The scheme also has the vision to attract more investments to the State through skilled human resource in different fields, it was stated. The agreement was signed in the presence of Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, President, Asia Pacific, Tata Technologies, Anand Bhade, and Secretary to Government, Department of Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood, S Selvakumar, among others. The Chief Minister appreciated the Government-Industry partnership. He said it would enable the youth to have excellent skill training based on industry demand and on the other hand industry would have a skilled workforce. The State and the industrial sector would benefit mutually from this agreement, the statement quoted Yediyurappa as saying. The Deputy Chief Minister, C N Ashwathnarayan said that, through this programme it is expected that more than one lakh youth would get better employment opportunities every year. Apart from this, ten new courses are being initiated based on the demands of the industries. There are a total of 1,713 ITIs in the State, out of which 270 are Government, 196 aided and 1,247 private ITIs with a total of about 1.8 lakh students. By upgrading 150 ITIs in the State, these institutions would be transformed into prominent training centres, it said. The duration of the agreement is ten years and nine months. During this period, Tata Technologies would modernise 150 ITIs, with new infrastructure, industry-oriented courseware, training and support for advanced equipment and software to benefit the students to get better employment opportunities. This scheme would be beneficial in developing Karnataka's ITIs into skill training hubs of global standards. Tata Technologies would strengthen training, counselling and placement cells to train, guide and create employment opportunities. Laboratories would be upgraded by setting up new machinery and technology. Action has been taken to plan appropriate syllabus based on the demands of Industry 4.0. Electric vehicles, agricultural machinery, aerospace and defence, horticulture and smart city are among the key sectors that would be the focus areas. As many as 300 trainers from Tata Technologies and associate industries would impart training in these 150 ITIs. Online training would also be provided in all government and aided ITIs in the State. Students of other ITIs, Polytechnics and Engineering colleges can also avail training facilities in these 150 ITIs. Upgradation of Peenya, Hosur road, Ballari, Mysuru, Dastikoppa and Shikaripura government ITIs of would be taken up in the first phase.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/karnataka-to-upgrade-150-govt-itis-at-cost-of-rs-46365-crore-with-industry-partners-912073.html

With hardly five months for the Assembly polls to happen, the local body elections could be considered as a run-up to the Assembly polls. As many as 21,865 wards will be going to the polls. Election in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, and Idukki district will be held on December 8, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad on December 10 and Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, and Kasargod on December 14. Counting will be on December 16. Kerala State Election Commission V Bhaskaran announced the election schedule on Friday. The term of the existing councils is ending on November 11. Owing to the Covid-19 scenario the polls were postponed. The polls would be conducted under strict COVID norms in campaigning to polling. Postal voting facilities would be offered to Covid-infected voters. Already all political parties have almost finalised candidates for many wards and even posters and banners have also started coming up. Though the left front generally used to get an upper hand in the local body elections, this time it is very crucial for the left front as the CPM-led government in the state, as well as the CPM leadership, were facing major allegations pertaining to nexus with gold smuggling and drug peddling rackets. The trends in the local bodies may have an impact on the Assembly polls. Meanwhile, the CPM has decided to unleash a strong campaign that the BJP was misusing central agencies against the left front for political gains. The BJP had noticeably improved its position at many local bodies in Kerala, especially Thiruvananthapuram corporation, in 2015 local body polls. Hence the saffron party is pinning high hopes this time. But the worsening factionalism in BJP in the state is a cause for concern for the party.

After kick-starting a students' rally to generate awareness among the people on the prevention of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases during the forthcoming Northeast monsoon, he told reporters that "Puducherry is a peaceful Union Territory." People mutually respect the religious beliefs and there is no space for any communal or religious violence, he said. But, he said, the 'Vel Yatra' was a clear move to incite communal violence and strife. Referring to the monsoon season, he said the territorial government has taken several steps to ensure that no havoc is caused. "We are keen to ensure no outbreak of ailments like dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases anywhere in Puducherry and outlying regions," he said while asking the people to cooperate with the government to take steps to prevent stagnation of water and accumulation of garbage and debris. The Health Department has been fully geared up to rise to any exigency. Control rooms were in place and separate wards opened in government general hospital to admit dengue patients. A meeting of the Disaster Management Department was held recently and an action-plan evolved to handle any public health issues during the monsoon, the Chief Minister said. Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao, officials of the Health Department in-charge of dengue management, and school teachers were present.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/pondy-cm-dubs-vel-yatra-as-move-to-foment-communal-strife-912125.html

Only valuables required for routine rituals are kept at temples. A stock taking of the valuables initiated in 2017 is progressing under the supervision of Kerala High Court. The gold stock is roughly estimated to be over 1000 kilograms, Devaswon Board sources said.  Devaswaom Board president N Vasu said that the stock taking of gold and silver was almost over the and it would be deposited in RBI bonds after obtaining court's permission. The interest from the money thus raised would be used for meeting the expenses of the temples. TDB sources said that since the gold received as offering was of different quality and forms, those were being melted and converted to bars for depositing in RBI bonds. The Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple had earlier deposited gold with RBI. Another additional revenue earning initiative of TDB is initiating various types of cultivation at around 3000 acres of land owned by various temples. Paddy, tapioca, fruit-bearing trees are flowers required for temple purposes are the key focus. The initiative is being carried out in association with agencies like Haritha Kerala Mission of Kerala government. Many temples under the board already initiated online booking for offerings. The Sabarimala Ayyappa temple also launched a facility for door delivery of prasadams of the temple, including the much sought after 'Aravana' (sweet), through Speed Post at any where in India. Bookings could be made at post offices for the prasadam kit prices at Rs. 450. The TDB was estimated to have suffered a revenue loss of over Rs. 300 crore so far.  Of the 1250 temples under the board,  many are having very low revenue only and are sustaining with the revenue earned from major temples like Sabarimala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-temples-monetise-precious-offerings-initiate-farming-to-tide-over-revenue-loss-912156.html

Appealing to party workers not to take the extreme step, Sanjay Kumar said nothing is achieved through suicides. It onlycauses agony to parents, he said. The party activists should keep up the fight and strive to herald in a "democratic Telangana", he said. The BJP worker had set himself on fire on Sunday, police said.

Rajasthan, Odisha and Delhi have banned firecrackers during the festive season, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and also air pollution, while Karnataka has decided to soon issue an order to this effect. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami had written to his counterparts of Rajasthan and Odisha to revoke the ban on sale and use of firecrackers, considering its impact on about eight lakh workers in Tamil Nadu. Industry sources said the pandemic has resulted in cracker manufacturers operating at only 60 per cent of their capacity and are worried that the ban may even result in some units shutting shop next year. "We were operating at about 60 per cent due to Covid-19 outbreak. Now with this ban we are worried how it is going to be next year. Some firecracker manufacturers may even shut shop when there is no business," a senior industry official told PTI. The industry, he said, was functioning with very few employees during the Covid-19 induced lockdown and slightly more numbers later when some restrictions were eased. Other problems they face was disbursement of salaries to employees and uncertainty whether the units would receive payment for stocks already sent to states like Rajasthan and Haryana before the ban was announced, another official said. He claimed that 30 per cent of the stocks are lying idle. The firecrackers industry is mainly focused in and around Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district in south Tamil Nadu. Following a 2018 Supreme Court direction, the state has only restricted bursting of green crackers to one hour in the morning and another hour in the evening on Deepavali day which falls on November 14, this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ban-on-firecrackerscovid-19-hits-fireworks-industry-in-tamil-nadu-hard-912179.html

The loss is not just for the multi-crore fireworks' industry but also lakhs of traders who sell them in every nook and corner of these states during Deepavali which falls, this year, on November 14. Rajasthan was the first state to ban the sale and bursting of firecrackers followed by Odisha, Delhi, West Bengal, and Karnataka, which had been issuing the licence to set up cracker shops till Wednesday. Karnataka accounts for 15 percent of the market share, insiders said, adding that the fireworks' manufacturers suffered a considerable loss when the state banned Ganesh Chaturthi festivities this year. Industry veterans scoffed at the state governments for imposing a ban “without any credible scientific evidence” on crackers aggravating the spread of Covid-19.   “Instead of every state banning the sale and bursting of firecrackers at the last minute, the government can direct us to shut our factories for good after waiving off all our loans. Why is the industry being targeted year after year by citing one reason or the other? What is the rationale behind the ban?” asked P Ganesan, President of Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA). Over 80 percent of the products that go out of the factories in Sivakasi carry the “green cracker” tag as they are found to reduce the emission of 2.5 particulate matter by 30 to 35 percent less than conventional crackers, he said. “Why is even green crackers being banned? Already we have lost 45 percent market share and with a week to go for Deepavali, we do not know how many more states will come out with a ban on the sale,” he told Deccan Herald. The loss for the industry due to the ban by five states and Mumbai city so far is estimated to be anywhere between Rs 800 crore to Rs 1,200 crore, besides the financial losses it suffered during the Covid-19 lockdown. The industry, which is estimated to be worth anywhere between Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore, has been in a state of perpetual crisis for the past five years.   The last-minute ban, which comes at a time when over 90 percent of the goods have reached the dealers, has put the fireworks' manufacturers and lakhs of labourers dependent on them in a fix. With over 45 percent of products sent by them stuck with dealers, the production for next Deepavali, which begins right after the festivities end, will not resume. If the production does not begin a few weeks after Deepavali, over four lakhs labourers who are directly benefited by the industry will be rendered jobless. Already, the labourers were put to severe inconvenience this year after fireworks' units downed their shutters for 55 days owing to the Coronavirus lockdown. Fireworks' manufacturers begin production based on orders from dealers across the country. “If dealers do not sell the stocks that they have, how will they pay us. Why will they place fresh orders when they have a huge stockpile? We cannot begin production unless we have orders,” a fireworks' manufacturer said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ban-on-firecrackers-by-five-states-robs-sivakasi-of-45-market-912188.html

The centre will be organising activities such as open-field precision farming of vegetables and flowers, production and distribution of quality planting materials to farmers, and also training programmes for farmers, entrepreneurs, and extension officers in the first phase, it said. "A tissue culture laboratory has been set up as part of the project for producing good quality planting materials. The centre will also explore possibilities in agri-horti tourism in the district. The idea is to transform Wayanad into a hub of floriculture,” the statement issued by the Indian Embassy at The Hague said. The CoE is a showcase and knowledge repository of the best Dutch technical practices as relevant to the Indian context, it said. It will be based in the Regional Agricultural Research Station of the Kerala Agricultural University at Ambalavayal in Wayanad district, according to the statement. The CoE for vegetables and flowers was inaugurated on Thursday by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a virtual conclave, it said. Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar presided over the function. Speaking after inaugurating the CoE, Vijayan said the centre would help rejuvenate the agriculture sector in Kerala and will complement the many innovative technologies in floriculture and vegetable cultivation the Netherlands has developed, according to the statement. Tomar said the centre will not only benefit Kerala but the entire nation. "This centre will mainly showcase the technological achievements of the Netherlands by activities such as production and distribution of quality planting materials and seeds to farmers. It will showcase post-harvest handling, storage and marketing of produce for farmers. It will offer training programmes for officers for enhancing income of farmers. The inauguration of this centre has much relevance in the Indian context," he said. The centre was set up at a cost of Rs 13 crore provided by the central and state governments, and technical assistance from the Dutch government, the statement said. This will be the second CoE being set up under the Indo-Dutch Joint Action Plan, it said. The first CoE for vegetables in Baramati in Maharashtra opened in 2017. In his keynote address, Jan-Kees Goet, Secretary-General, Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, said that the Centers of Excellence are the backbone of the cooperation between the Dutch and the Indian government. “Training farmers, and getting them acquainted with modern technology, will advance their position in the supply chain, to the benefit of the economy,” he said. Goet also commended Ambassador of India to the Netherlands Venu Rajamony for his tireless efforts to seal the plans for the centre and for being most active in advancing the interest of agricultural cooperation between the two countries, the statement said. He also mentioned that among the whole of the diplomatic corps in The Hague, Rajamony has easily distinguished himself as the most enthusiastic promoter of agricultural relations and said that the ambassador has become a Center of Excellence in himself, it said. Other dignitaries who participated in the function included V S Sunilkumar, Minister for Agriculture, Kerala, and Marten Van den Berg, Ambassador of the Netherlands to India. This CoE is set up as part of the Indo-Dutch Action Plan and in follow up to the letter of intent signed by the ambassador of the Netherlands to India and the minister for agriculture, Kerala, during the occasion of the Royal visit of His Majesty, King of the Netherlands, to Kerala in October 2019, the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/indo-dutch-centre-of-excellence-for-vegetables-flowers-opens-in-kerala-912211.html

The Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Temple in Ernakulam district, around ten kilometers from Kochi city, got a huge offer. The Cochin Devaswom Board that manages the temple has decided to seek the nod of Kerala High Court for taking forward the proposal owing to the huge amount involved. Gana Shravan of Gana Shravan (SwaamyG) Companies, who made the offer, told DH that he received many fortunes in life and business after he started visiting the temple regularly, and hence he was making the donation. Though the proposal was submitted almost one year back further steps were getting delayed owing to Covid-19 as well as other procedures involved owing to the big donation.  The Devaswom Board secretary V A Sheeja said that the board was yet to take a final decision on the matter and it was pending legal opinion. Sources in the Devaswom Board said that as per norms any development works above Rs. 20 lakh using the Devaswom Board's funds require the nod of a Devaswom bench of HC. Even as the donation would not come under its purview, the board decided to seek HC opinion to avoid any future legal issues owing to the huge donation involved. Shravan, who is now 46, said that he is a native of Chikkaballapur district and was basically in the music field for nearly 20 years. But there was not much fortune in his life. Four years back he visited the Chottanikkara temple as advised by his guru and thereafter he got much fortune in business. Shravan said that he was mainly into gold, diamond, and rare metals trading by associating with a Mumbai-based firm and was also setting up a jewel shop at Bengaluru. He was also into the construction and interior design business in Bengaluru.  The decades-old Chottanikkara Bhagavathy temple is one of the major worship centres in Kerala and it has many myths associated with it. Two-phase development work has been proposed. It included two 'gopurams', renovation of various mandapams, sewage treatment plant,s and construction of a guest house in the first phase. A detailed master plan and designs were also already prepared and submitted. The second phase included the development of the nearby area's roads also and hence it would require nod of the local body also, said architect Ajith who prepared the proposal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bengaluru-based-devotee-offers-rs-500-crore-development-work-for-kerala-temple-912290.html

Prior to the core committee decision, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, who inaugurated the BJP State Executive Committee meeting, said that the government would bring stringent laws to curb religious conversion under ‘love jihad’. Briefing reporters about the core committee decisions, BJP vice president Arvind Limbavali said that conversion activities in the guise of ‘love jihad’ should stop. “The core committee unanimously decided to introduce legislation against it. The committee has advised the government to discuss the law with officials, Cabinet ministers, and party leaders before implementing the law,” he said. There was a law introduced by the BJP government in 2008 against cow slaughter, which was withdrawn by the Siddaramaiah government, Limbavali said. “We have urged the government to revisit the law and add any more regulations if required. This is to ensure a strict law against cow slaughter,” he added. The legislation against ‘love jihad’ gained traction in the state after Uttar Pradesh announced a similar law following a ruling by the Allahabad High Court. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said recently that the government would study the laws introduced in other states before implementing similar legislation in the state. Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chauhan has been batting for a ban on cow slaughter and beef consumption in Karnataka since July this year, which was also taken up by the core committee during the day. Limbavali said that the core committee has shortlisted a few names to fill a Rajya Sabha seat from Karnataka, left vacant following the demise of Ashok Gasti recently. “We can only recommend names.

Under this project, industrial partnerships will be forged to meet the requirements with state-of-the-art technology to impart training and services to the ITI, polytechnic and engineering students,” Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa told reporters. Under the agreement, Tata Technologies will provide Rs 4,080 crore whereas the state government will spend Rs 556 crore. Three hundred trainers from Tata Technologies and associate industries will impart training in these 150 ITIs along with online sessions that students from other ITIs can attend. “Training by Tata and other companies will help students bag job opportunities across the globe,” the CM said. Yediyurappa added that the project complemented the state's investor-friendly climate. Karnataka has 1,713 ITIs - 270 government, 196 aided and 1,247 private - where some 1.8 lakh students are enrolled. Of the 270 state-run ITIs, 150 have their own building. The Karnataka Skill Development Corporation will spend Rs 105 crore from its own available funds to take up building repairs, additional electricity requirements and other works for the partnership. The agreement will focus on electric vehicles, agricultural machinery, aerospace/defence, horticulture, smart cities and other sectors, the government said in a release. Tata Technologies managing director and chief executive Warren Harris called it a ‘social project’ that would create a platform for students to be a part of the “rapidly transforming ecosystem and get exposure to latest machinery, hardware, software, courseware and training.” This, he said, would augment industrial growth and create self-employment. According to Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who heads the skills department, the project was expected to help more than one lakh youth get better employment opportunities every year. “Apart from this, 10 new courses are being initiated based on the demands of the industries.

The top court protected Goswami from arrest in the case related to privilege notice and summoned the Secretary personally before it. Taking up Goswami's plea against privilege notice to criticising Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde expressed anguish at the conduct of Vilas Athwale, Assistant Secretary of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. The court said, "it amounts to serious and direct interference into administration of justice". Athwale has shot off a letter to Goswami on October 13, questioning him how he produced the missives sent to him by the Speaker and Privilege Committee since they were confidential in nature. "No authority in the country can penalise someone for approaching this court. This is in teeth of Article 32 of the Constitution. How dare this officer wrote something like this in his letter," the bench asked senior advocate A M Singhvi, who appeared for the Maharasthra government. "How can someone be threatened like this? How can someone be stopped from approaching a court by extending him threats like this? We don't appreciate such conduct," the bench said. Singhvi expressed inability to justify the contents of letter as he appeared for the state government. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, noted though Assistant Secretary of the Assembly has been served with a notice on October 5, he hasn't entered appearance so far in the court but rather issued thr letter on October 13 to the petitioner. The court appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar as amicus curiae, before posting the matter for consideration on November 23. It also issued notice to the Attorney General. The court said the letter by the Assistant Secretary of the Assembly was "unprecedented and has a tendency to bring the administration of justice to disrepute." "The Assistant Secretary must know that right to approach this court under Article 32 is itself a fundamental right. There is no doubt that if a citizen is deterred from exercising his right under Article 32, it will amount to serious interference with the administration of justice," the court said. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Goswami, asked the court to protect him from any coercive action in the case. "He is in jail. He is being threatened and questioned. Case after case after case is being filed against this man. At times, constitutional courts have to see the reality and not just the smokescreen," he said. Goswami has been arrested on November 4 in a 2018 abetment to suicide case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-maharashtra-assembly-secy-for-threatening-arnab-goswami-912059.html

The issue of the 2021 state board exams figured in the weekly Cabinet meeting. “The examinations of Class X and Class XII conducted by the state board will not be held before May 2021,” state’s school education minister Dr Varsha Gaikwad said. Usually, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) usually conducts the 10th (SSC) and 12th (HSC) examinations in the months during February-March. "The current Covid-19 is likely to last for a longer period. We have discussed the issue of completion of syllabus and holding of exams… The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will not be able to conduct the exams of Class X and Class XII before May," Dr Gaikwad said. The statement assumes significance as there are fears of a second wave even as the Covid-19 cases have come down during September-October. She has also discussed the issue of how much curriculum can be omitted so that teachers can complete the remaining part. “We will have to cut at least 25 per cent of the curriculum," she added.

Prime Minister Modi will also interact with local users of the roll-on/roll-off passenger service (Ro-Pax) during the event, a Prime Minister's Office (PMO) statement said. He will inaugurate the Ro-Pax terminal at Hazira and flag off the service between Hazira and Ghogha on November 8 at 11 am through video conferencing, it said. This marks a big step towards the prime minister’s vision of harnessing waterways and integrating them with the economic development of the country, the statement said. Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani will be present on the occasion. The Ro-Pax Terminal being inaugurated at Hazira is 100 meters in length and 40 metres in width, with cost implications of approximately Rs 25 crore, the PMO said. The terminal has wide ranging facilities, including an administrative office building, a parking area, a substation and a water tower. The Ro-Pax Ferry Vessel ‘Voyage Symphony’ is a three-deck vessel with 2,500-2700 DWT and displacement of 12,000 to 15,000 GT, the statement said. It has a load capacity of 30 trucks (of 50 MT each) on the main deck, 100 passenger cars on the upper deck and 500 passengers plus 34 crew and hospitality staff on the passenger deck, the PMO said. There will be several wide-ranging benefits of the Hazira-Ghogha Ro-Pax ferry service and it will work as a gateway to South Gujarat and the Saurashtra region, the statement said. It will reduce the distance between Ghogha and Hazira from 370 km to 90 km. The reduced cargo travel time from 10 to 12 hours to about four hours will result in huge savings of fuel (approx 9,000 litres per day) and lower the maintenance cost of vehicles drastically. The ferry service, while making three round trips per day on the Hazira-Ghogha route, would annually transport about 5 lakh passengers, 80,000 passenger vehicles, 50,000 two-wheelers and 30,000 trucks. It will reduce fatigue of truck drivers and enhance their incomes by giving them more opportunity to do extra trips, the statement said. It will give an impetus to the tourism industry with ease of access to the Saurashtra region and lead to creation of new job opportunities. With the onset of ferry services, the port sector, furniture and fertilizer industries in Saurashtra and Kutch region will get a big boost, the statement said. Eco-tourism and religious-tourism in Gujarat, especially in Porbandar, Somnath, Dwarka and Palitana will grow exponentially, it said. The benefits of enhanced connectivity through this ferry service will also result in increased inflow of tourists in the famous Asiatic lion wildlife sanctuary at Gir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pm-modi-to-flag-off-ro-pax-ferry-service-between-hazira-ghogha-in-gujarat-on-nov-8-912100.html

A ministerial delegation comprising Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab of Shiv Sena, Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik of NCP, and Medical Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Amit Deshmukh called on Koshyari at the Raj Bhavan here. The delegation handed over a letter of Chief Minister, the resolution of the Cabinet, and a sealed envelope containing the 12 names. The names were discussed and finalized in the Cabinet meeting on 29 October, which was confirmed on 5 November. “We have handed over the details to the Governor, we expect that the Governor will do the needful,” said Parab. Asked about any time frame, he said: “There is no such thing….the Governor decides on it…we have done the necessary due diligence.” When pointed out reports that the Governor may not accept the list, Parab said: “We cannot answer in ifs and buts.” Malik said that everything has been done as per law. “We hope that the Governor will notify the names,” he said. The MVA ministers, however, refused to speak on the names that had been submitted to the Governor. The three parties have agreed on a 4-4-4 formula for the 12 vacant seats. The term of 12 legislators nominated to the Upper House from the Governor’s quota had expired in June. The Governor nominates 12 MLCs for a tenure of six years – based on the recommendations of the state Cabinet. According to Article171(5) of the Constitution: “(5) The members to be nominated by the Governor under sub-clause (e) of clause (3) shall consist of persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as the following, namely: literature, science, art, the co-operative movement, and social service.” The Maharashtra Legislative Council comprises 78 seats of which 12 are from the Governor's quota.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mva-submits-list-of-12-proposed-mlcs-to-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-912173.html

Following the November 4 tragedy near here, the AMC's Estate-Town Developmentand Solid Waste Departments initiated a special drive to identify industrial units and godowns where hazardous chemicals have been stored illegally, said a release from the civic body. During the drive on Friday, officials found half-a- dozen such units, having cumulative construction of 4,050 square metres, in Lambha ward on the city's outskirts, the release said. This is the same industrial belt where the blast took place. Since these units and godowns did not have permission or licence to store hazardous chemicals which they were found in possession of, the AMC sealed these facilities, said the release, adding the drive will continue in the coming days. Twelve labourers, including five women, were killed and 10 others injured after a portion of the godown located on Pirana-Piplaj Road on the city's outskirts collapsed on Wednesday morning following the powerful explosion. Primary investigations had revealed that hazardous chemicals stored in one part of a large godown exploded following some chemical reaction. The blast destroyed three to four adjoining godowns where labourers were packing garments. After the blast, the Ahmedabad police on Thursday lodged an FIR and arrested three persons - two godown owners and their tenant who had stored chemical drums - on charges of culpable homicide. Senior IAS officer Vipul Mittra, who is part of a two-member probe panel appointed by the Gujarat government, on Thursday asked the AMC to take action against godowns where hazardous chemicals have been stored in violation of rules.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-crackdown-on-illegal-chemical-units-post-godown-blast-912206.html
