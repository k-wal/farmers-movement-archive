21-11-2020||Comment||Crisis of Islam||Abhorrent caricature of Prophet Muhammad has led to another series of macabre terror attacks in France. French President Emmanuel Macron attributed the grisly violence to what he called the “crisis in Islam”, a characterisation borrowed from the title of a book published in 2003 in the wake of 9/11, The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror, by the doyen of the Western scholarship on Islam, Bernard Lewis. The word ‘crisis’ sparked off sharp reactions from a cross-section of Muslims, including such leaders as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and former Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad. This is surprising, because a similar word, ‘danger’ — as in the formulation, “Islam in danger” — has been a familiar device of religio-political demagoguery that projects Islam as besieged by a host of enemies who have been conspiring to destroy “the true religion.” The ‘danger’ theory has great psychological value inasmuch as it identifies the enemy in external factors while completely ignoring the internal faults, and thus obviating the need for introspection and self-correction; whereas ‘crisis’ points to internal decay, which calls for a course correction. The very thought that something could be wrong with one’s religion provokes an indignant reaction. The nuance that though there may be nothing wrong with a religion per se, it is wrong that many a thing that isn’t a part of it passes off as such, is missed. Nuance, in any case, is seldom the hallmark of religious discourse. Inherent in this crisis-danger binary is the notion of the clash of civilisations. Though this phrase is largely credited to Samuel Huntington for his 1996 book, The Clash of Civilisations And The Remaking of World Order, Bernard Lewis also contributed to this, for he was the one to posit a clash between Christianity and Islam in an article in the September 1990 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, titled The Roots of Muslim Rage.  But much before this post-Cold War thesis came into vogue, Islamic ideologues had been highlighting the irreconcilable opposition between Islam and the West. From Jamaluddin Afghani to Allama Iqbal, and from Syed Qutb to Maulanas Maududi and Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi, every ideologue presented Islam and Maghribiyat (Westernisation) and Jadidiyat (Modernity) as polar opposites in nearly the same vein as “...never the twain shall meet”.  This was a reflection of the centuries-old struggle between Christianity and Islam which, in the wake of colonial ingress, was paraphrased as the conflict between Islam and (Western) modernity. It engendered a cultural attitude that can be best described as Occidentalism, or the counter to Orientalism. Edward Said, in his 1978 masterpiece Orientalism had critiqued the Western episteme for projecting onto the Orient their own prurience which, in turn, constructed the East as an expendable ‘Other’ that could be subjugated and exploited without any qualms. Occidentalism is a pastiche of the Orientalist fantasy, which sees in the West nothing besides materialism and moral depravity. Other than Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, almost every Muslim intellectual found a perverse pleasure in painting a lurid picture of the West, and thus provided a rationale for denigrating and, if possible, vanquishing them. Imperialist geopolitics has not only been the axis of the Muslim attitude towards the West, but also an alibi for negating the need for introspection and correction in their own thought and practice. Accordingly, Islamic terrorism is seen as a logical corollary to a long series of wrongs that the Muslims have been suffering at the hands of the West. The list includes the Crusades, colonialism, oil politics, the Cold War, the Afghanistan War, and the support for Israel, etc. This saga of grievance was given academic gravitas by Mahmood Mamdani’s 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War and the Roots of Terror. Such a rationalisation of terror, while partly explanatory, misses the woods for the trees. Focussing on Western machinations in Muslim countries rather than on the motive force behind the acts of terror, it absolves the role of ideology in shaping a religious attitude for which violence is a rational response to a conflict. It also ignores the fact that the imperialist forces could weaponise an ideology, as in Afghanistan, because it already existed. They didn’t create it, they hired it. If an ideology is up for hire, its truth claims must be dubious. There is a bigger reason for the failure to acknowledge the role of ideology in the spread of terrorism than the exclusive emphasis on geopolitics — the inseparability of the ideological accretions from the religious core. The idea that the Muslims, being the followers of “the true religion”, have the divine mandate to impose their will on the world is at the root of Islamic supremacism. It has substantial theological resources at its back, and it is Islamic insofar as it is done by the Muslims, in the name of Islam, with credible religious arguments to support their claim. Thus, even though the bare act of violence might be condemned by Muslims, it’s hard for them to denounce the ideology behind it. So, they take recourse to such vacuous cliches as the literal meaning of the word ‘Islam’ being peace, and such verses of the Quran as “to you your religion and to me mine”, “there is no compulsion in religion”, and “to kill an innocent person is as big a sin as killing the entire humanity”. The refusal to own up the crime, and take corrective steps, comes from the inseparability of the power theology from Islam, the religion. Till the time such inanities as “...but the Prophet was also a politician and a military commander” are not questioned, the sacrilege of misattribution of terrorism to him will continue, and Muslims, in turn, will consider it blasphemy. The question, however, is whether committing acts of terror in the name of Islam, and naming terror outfits after Prophet Muhammad are blasphemy or not? How come such names as Lashkar-e Taiba and Jaish-e Muhammad don’t raise hackles among the Muslims? Isn’t it because of ideological conditioning that nothing amiss is perceived if the Prophet’s name and his teachings are used for wreaking violence? Is it even surprising that on the flag of an important Muslim country, a sword underlays the Islamic profession of faith? Herein lies the crisis of Islam, and the danger to it. Unless Muslims liberate Islam from politics, no redemption is possible, for “the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.” (The writer is an IPS officer)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/crisis-of-islam-918221.html
21-11-2020||First Edit||The fall and fall of Congress||The Congress party is where it was three months ago, and where it has been for years now, refusing to look at its broken image in the mirror. The issue, of course, is not about the image but about substance, and the party does not seem willing to recognise, much less confront, the issues that pose a threat to its existence. The poor performance in Bihar, where it not only lost most of the seats it contested but brought its ally also down with it, is the latest in a series of its failures. It is not capable of winning elections on its own in most states. It has also shown, after UP and now Bihar, that it cannot help other parties to win but can damage them, too. It has also been unable to retain the states it won, as Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh showed, and Rajasthan nearly did. The party has been losing MLAs, leaders and workers in every state.  Even in such a dire situation, it has not shown an inclination to make an honest examination of its failures and to address them. There have been demands within the party and dissenting voices that have sought action and a course correction from the leadership. The letter written in August by 23 leaders to the top leadership calling for such action had no impact. They were sidelined in the party. One of those who wrote the letter, Kapil Sibal, has again raised the same issues after the Bihar debacle. He was snubbed by two senior leaders and has been told to shut up or quit. Senior leader P Chidambaram has joined the ranks of those publicly airing concerns about the party’s organisational weakness. The reasons for the continued decline are not unknown. Congress is today more a collection of individuals attached to the Gandhi family, which wants to keep the reins of the party with itself, than a political party. Rahul Gandhi resigned as its president, but he is still the top leader, though even after many years he is still out of his depth in politics. The party’s organisation has frayed and weakened and does not exist in many parts of the country. There is serious ideological confusion and on many issues like the scrapping of Article 370, economic policies and national security matters, different views are expressed in public by different leaders. It does not always state its positions clearly and consistently, and sometimes gives the impression that it aspires to be a BJP minus Modi. It is internally dead, without dynamism and democracy. A party that is not taken seriously as an alternative to the ruling party or even as a credible opposition has much to worry about its future.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/the-fall-and-fall-of-congress-918140.html
21-11-2020||In Perspective||No country for humour, or tolerance||Aren’t we fast becoming a country of wry faced, sullen people averse to humour? The way Kunal Kamra is being hounded by a section of people for his brand of humour, it seems that humour is losing its place and space in our lives. Some weeks ago, the legendary batsman, our very own Sunil Gavaskar, faced mordant criticism from a very large section of netizens for his comment on Virat Kohli's rusty batting. In the mid-80s, no one had taken umbrage when the same Sunny Gavaskar opined quite caustically that “Indian films are made by the asses for the masses.” In fact, many actors congratulated him on this witty apercu! Alas, things have changed drastically in a little over three decades.  The question is, what makes Indians, even the very ‘erudite’ among us, so humourless and ready to take offence at the drop of a hat? British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, known for his acerbic wit, used to say, “Inability to take humour in a sportive manner is a sign of inferiority complex and having a nagging sense of guilt.” So very true. Only those suffering from a niggling sense of inferiority complex and an ingrained sense of wrongdoing are hateful of humour, because humour reveals the reality in an ostensibly casual manner.  In recent times, the treatment given by the ‘establishment’ to certain individuals on one side of the political and ideological divide has caused comedians like Kamra to comment on what they see happening in the country, sometimes in too comic a manner, perhaps, for some people’s taste. The man has the audacity to call a spade a spade, nay a shovel. And this very quality in an individual is a threat to the ‘establishment.’   Neurologists like Lucio Bini and Paul Robert Bing as well as linguists like David Crystal and Edmund Sapir, are of the view that humour acts as a euphemism. Its effect lasts longer than a direct or abusive statement. At the same time, the human brain tends to take humour as a revelation. And revelations are often explosive! That's the reason, the ‘establishment’ and its agencies are so apprehensive of comedians and always want to muffle and muzzle their voices. Our proclivity to take all things to heart and react impulsively have contributed to our aversion to humour and to our intolerance. Intolerance often stems from a sense of vulnerability or false supremacy. Somewhere, many of us have developed a false sense of ethnic and nationalistic supremacy in recent times. This concocted supremacy has made us vulnerable and intolerant to every word and statement we erroneously deem as an assault or an affront. Perhaps this needs some kind of elaboration. Till about the end of the last decade, even the Marathi people would refer to king Shivaji as Shivaji, but today, if you don't say ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’, you are liable to be driven out of Maharashtra. Amitabh Bachchan will vouch for that. Now, it's de rigueur in Bengal and in the company of Bengalis to use the honorific ‘Gurudev’ before Rabindranath Tagore and ‘Netaji’ before Subhash Chandra Bose. Otherwise, they'll be offended. This offence-taking is widespread and applies to people’s likes and dislikes across fields. If the great playback singer Mohammad Rafi is not called Rafi sahab, his countless admirers will take umbrage, Truth be told, yours truly is arguably the biggest fan and scholar on Rafi today, having earned a Doctorate on him from Lahore University, Pakistan. But I chose to call him Mohammad Rafi, with all due respect. Till about the turn of the century, all English and vernacular newspapers would write Muhammad just like Rama, Krishna, Jesus or Moses. Suddenly, Muhammad became Prophet Muhammad. Today, you dare write only Muhammad and rest assured, somebody will take grave offence. All these religio-ethnic perceptions of supremacy, especially in India and the sub-continent, have made us vulnerable and unnecessarily arrogant and delusional. That our particular religion or ethnic group is not just the best but the only way, is the latest mantra. So, community, ethnicity and religious banter have become a taboo and strict no-no. Even the Sikhs, who used to crack jokes on themselves, have become too conscious about their ethnic identity. Now, if you crack jokes on Sikhs or narrate Santa-Banta jokes, chances are that Sikhs will not take it lightly. The same has happened to Bengalis, Marathis, Tamils and other communities. Now, if you call a Bengali  ‘Bong’, a Marathi ‘Taant’ (after Tantya Tope of Sepoy Mutiny fame) or a Tamil ‘Tambi’ or ‘Madrasi’, the people of these communities will not be amused.  So, a kind of sudden and mindless ethnic and communal resurgence, triggered by extreme religiosity, can be adduced as a reason that has made us intolerant. And remember the words of American humourist Mark Twain, “An intolerant person is humourless, and vice versa.” We're witnessing the same in this country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/no-country-for-humour-or-tolerance-918220.html

Following a request by the state government, the union home ministry has approved the name change of the railway station.  Born into a family of freedom fighters in 1911 in Motebennur village of Havri district, Mahadevappa was hailed as 'Karnataka's Bhagat Singh' for his revolutionary acts against British Rule in Karnataka. Mahadevappa was the only representative from the then Mysore state who took part in the Dandi March and walked with Mahatma Gandhi. He was jailed for six months. Upon his return, he along with his revolutionary friends, Mahadevappa had attacked the railway station at Byadagi in Haveri. The Britishers had even announced Rs 300 reward to those who help capture Mahadevappa alive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/haveri-railway-station-named-after-freedom-fighter-mailara-mahadevappa-918314.html
21-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Covid-19 ushers in lifestyle changes||Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the health and financial condition of a majority of the people, across the globe. However, a section of the people in Mysuru feel that there are also positive impacts of the Covid effects. Some of them said that the Covid effects have ushered in some lifestyle changes, mostly positive ones. J Kumar, a chicken stall owner said, “I was tested positive and went into facility quarantine for 10 days. Earlier, I was busy with business and never had a holiday. Due to Covid, my business was hit hard and I suffered a financial crisis. But, the Covid crisis and my isolation gave me some precious time, for myself and my family members.” “Now, business has resumed and my financial problems have eased. Besides, the facility quarantine and later, home quarantine set my priorities right. It taught me time management, so that I can give time to my family members and myself. I am a happier person now.” V Nagaraju, a bank executive, said, “Facility quarantine taught me a few things. One of them is that fitness is a key to both physical and mental health. While under facility quarantine, I planned my time and activities to suit the routine there. One of them is the policy of ‘Early to bed early to rise’. It helps me a lot now, as I get a lot of day time, which I use productively.” K N Harish, an employee of a private firm, said that since the detection of his Covid infection, he adopted an active routine. “Earlier, I used to just relax at home, exhausted by office work. During facility quarantine, I started walking inside the Covid Care Centre. After discharge, I continued my walking habit. Now, everyday, I walk around 4 km in the morning and 4 km in the evening. Whenever I am free, I do some warm-up exercises. Some body pains, that I used to suffer earlier, have eased,” he said. Ayesha Sharief, a homemaker, said, “Since my husband was detected to be infected by Covid, he is stressing on fitness. Now, some trousers and shirts, which he had overgrown a few years back, are fitting him again. We buy and consume a lot of vegetables and fruits nowadays, compared to pre-Covid days. Our children indulge in a lot of outdoor games and sports, as they also have more time, due to online classes.” A S Saraswathi, a teacher said, “Due to Covid, we are not getting full salary, but our expenses on water, handwash, sanitiser, washing powder, soap, etc for cleaning purpose and power bill due to more dependence on electric kettle and steamer, have increased. “But, our travel and outings have reduced. Our expenses on junk food has reduced. We have learnt austerity. Despite, some financial problems, we have peace of mind,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-ushers-in-lifestyle-changes-918419.html

The government has decided to lease the factory for a period of 40 years on the lines of Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane (PSSK), which has been taken on lease by a company founded by MLA Murugesh Nirani. It has to be noted that earlier too, the government had planned to lease out the factory. But, it was dropped, due to severe opposition by the farmers. The government had decided to run the factory under Operation and Management (O&M) system. Even District In-charge Minister K C Narayana Gowda and MP A Sumalatha had said that the factory will be given on O&M system. The farmers allege that the government is favouring some industrialists. The government has constituted a sub-committee to over see the lease procedure. As per the order, the factory is leased to protect the interest of the farmers and to give a new lease of life to the factory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-government-finally-decides-to-lease-out-mysore-sugar-factory-918420.html

I’m ready to do whatever is required for their development. But it’s not right to call for a bandh. People will not appreciate it. I won’t allow any forced bandh anywhere,” Yediyurappa told reporters.  Pro-Kannada groups have called for a Karnataka Bandh on December 5 against the establishment of the Maratha Development Corporation. The groups have set a November 30 deadline for the government to withdraw this body.  “I’m observing the burning of effigies and such bad behaviour. We will have to take strict action. Let them protest peacefully, but the government will not tolerate attempts to give it a different turn,” Yediyurappa said, and appealed to pro-Kannada groups for cooperation.  “Our government is honestly trying to do justice to all sections of society. We’re not discriminating. Let them understand this and withdraw their bandh. I request them with folded hands,” Yediyurappa said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bs-yediyurappa-issues-fresh-warning-against-december-5-bandh-call-918222.html

The next morning, I came home and they gave me the summons. They’ve asked me to come on November 23,” he said. On November 19, Shivakumar’s daughter Aishwarya got engaged to senior BJP leader SM Krishna’s grandson and Cafe Coffee Day founder (late) VG Siddhartha’s son Amartya. Shivakumar said that he had requested the agency for permission to appear on November 25 instead of November 23. “Starting November 22, I’m travelling to Hospet (Ballari), Maski (Raichur) and then Basavakalyan (Bidar),” he said. On October 5, the CBI raided 14 locations across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai that were linked to Shivakumar in connection with alleged corruption cases against him. In a statement, the CBI said it had booked the former minister for allegedly possessing disproportionate assets worth Rs 74 crore. The CBI’s raids were preceded by a preliminary inquiry registered in March 2020, when Shivakumar was appointed as the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/disproportionate-assets-case-cbi-has-summoned-me-says-dk-shivakumar-918291.html
21-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Pralhad Joshi demands clarification from Congress on 'Gupkar Gang'||Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi has come down heavily on the 'Gupkar Gang', stating that it is involved in the anti-national activities, and demanded the Congress to clarify its stand on supporting this 'Gupkar declaration' which is hell-bent on restoring the Article 370. Speaking to media persons on Saturday, Joshi said, "The ‘Gupkar Gang’, an alliance of National Conference, PDP, CPI(M), Awami National Conference, and Jammu & Kashmir Pradesh Congress has openly stated that it will not hoist India’s national flag, and will take China’s help to restore Article 370 in J&K." The Congress is part of this alliance which is indulged in anti-national activities, he charged. “The AICC is trying to wash off its hands by claiming that joining the Gupkar alliance was the decision of the State unit of the Congress. This is double talk. Rahul Gandhi should clarify whether his party is for India’s integrity, or for the agenda of Gupkar Gang,” Joshi said. "Rahul Gandhi, who is presently in Goa taking care of his ailing mother, has to urgently call for a meeting of his party leaders and clarify the party's stand on supporting the 'Gupkar Gang' as it is a question of the integrity of the nation," said Joshi. "If the Congress fails to clarify its stand, it will be thought that this grand-old party which claims to be the guardian of the country, is with China and Pakistan, and not India," he added. Lambastes Abdullah, Mufti Lambasting NC President Farooq Abdullah, and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, Joshi said that these two leaders of Jammu & Kashmir have been provoking anti-nationals to revolt against the Indian Army, and are indirectly funding terrorist activities. "The objective of 'Gupkar gang' is to reinstate Article 370 so that they could rule the roost again," he added. He said, "Farooq Abdullah, who is using all means for the restoration of Article 370, has openly said that he would seek the support of China in this, while Mehbooba Mufti has issued a statement that she will not accept the national flag, and will bring back the J&K flag." He further said that the people who pelted stones on the Indian army were arrested, and were given amnesty while Mehbooba was the Chief Minister. "Thousands of such people were released and they have started to indulge in the same act now," he rued.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/pralhad-joshi-demands-clarification-from-congress-on-gupkar-gang-918374.html
21-11-2020||National||ED files money laundering case in fake TRP scam probed by Mumbai police||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a money laundering complaint in the alleged TRP rigging scam that is being investigated by the Mumbai police, official sources said on Friday. They said the central probe agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR) that is equivalent to a police FIR under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The ED complaint was filed after studying a Mumbai police FIR that was registered in October. The Republic TV channel, two Marathi channels and few other individuals are being probed by the police in this matter. Republic TV and other accused have denied wrongdoing and manipulation of the TRP (television rating points) system. Officials of the news channels and others named in the police FIR, apart from two former employees of Hansa research agency arrested by the Mumbai police in this case, will soon be summoned by the ED for questioning and recording of their statements, they said. The ED will probe if fake TRPs were generated and if the money earned through this was used to generate illegal funds and create illegitimate assets, they said. TRP is a tool to judge which TV programmes are viewed the most and also indicates the viewers' choice and popularity of a particular channel. It is calculated on the basis of TV channel viewership in a confidential set of households and measuring barometers are installed at such locations. The alleged scam came to light when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. Mumbai police had alleged that some channels were paying bribes to boost TRP fraudulently so as to increase advertising revenue. It was alleged that some families at whose houses metres were installed for collecting data of viewership were being bribed to tune into a particular channel. On October 8, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh had said that many people in whose homes these barometers were installed, accepted that they were getting monetary benefit for keeping their TV sets on even when they did not watch it. "We suspect that if this was happening in Mumbai then it could be happening in other parts of the country as well," Singh had said. The CBI, last month, also had registered an FIR into alleged manipulation of TRP on the basis of a reference from Uttar Pradesh Police. Sources the ED may also look at this case by filing a fresh case or including it in the present ECIR filed under the PMLA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-files-money-laundering-case-in-fake-trp-scam-probed-by-mumbai-police-918112.html

The state government has asked the schools to strictly observe the Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs) like thermal screening of students, hand sanitising, wearing of masks, social distancing in classrooms, they said. The government had decided to allow the schools to reopen from November 21 onwards for Classes 10 and 12 in the initial phase. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the education portfolio, had announced on November 4 that all the Covid-19 safety protocols would have to be followed by these institutions. Talking to PTI, a senior official of the state education department said, "Schools in Goa reopened on Saturday morning for Classes 10 and 12. The schools are adopting all the necessary SOPs to ensure that the classrooms are safe. The managements were informed in advance so that they can be ready to resume the classes." The education department had consulted all the stakeholders, including parents, teachers and management before deciding to reopen schools, he said. A senior office-bearer of a city-based school said, "We have installed thermal guns at the entry point of the school. We have made it mandatory for the students to sanitise their hands." "The strength of the classroom has been restricted, due to which we have to repeat the sessions. On the first day, the school attendance was thin as only half the students were asked to remain present," he said. "Rest of the students would be called from next week onwards," he said, adding that the teachers will have to teach the same part at least five times in order to cover the entire batch. The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (GBSHSE) had already announced that 30 per cent of the syllabus would be reduced for the current academic year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/goa-schools-reopen-for-classes-10-12-amid-covid-19-protocols-918216.html

With respect to contract labourers, the draft proposes that a contractor shall fix the wage periods which will not exceed one month. Contractors are bound to pay wages before the end of the seventh day after the day of the wage period. It has to be paid through bank transfer or electronic mode only. The draft also mandates that companies will have to conduct annual free health check-ups for every worker above the age of 45 years. It also states that a single electronic registration for licensing will be set up by the company.  The barrage of changes was made in light of the migrant crisis which saw lakhs of labourers struggling to get back to their home states during the nationwide coronavirus-induced lockdown.  The government faced criticism from all fronts after it was not able to provide data on how many migrants died or lost their source of income during the exodus where workers were forced to leave factories, business on foot in the absence of food, shelter and income. The draft rules come under the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Act, 2020, which deals with the safety, health and working conditions of construction workers, miners, inter-states migrant workers, audio-visual workers, journalists, salespersons, contract labourers and workers at the dock.  The ministry has sought objections and suggestions from the public on the draft proposals within 45 days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/employers-may-soon-have-to-pay-for-migrant-workers-trip-back-home-once-a-year-918240.html

Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist. Ramani had said the allegations against Akbar, made in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018, were her truth and were made for the public good. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey posed the query on Saturday as he started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case since the previous judge hearing the matter was transferred to another court on Wednesday. The court has asked both the parties to respond on the point of settlement and get back on November 24, the next date of hearing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/metoo-court-asks-if-there-is-chance-of-settlement-between-akbar-ramani-in-defamation-complaint-918244.html
21-11-2020||National||Canada to return statue of Hindu goddess stolen over 100 years ago from India||A Canadian university will soon return to India a unique statue of Hindu goddess Annapoorna that was stolen from a shrine in Varanasi over a century ago and found its way to the varsity's art gallery, in an attempt to "right historical wrongs" and help overcome the "damaging legacy of colonialism". The statue is part of the University of Regina's collection at the MacKenzie Art Gallery. The statue was part of the original 1936 bequest by Norman MacKenzie, the gallery’s namesake. Artist Divya Mehra brought attention to the fact that the statue had been wrongfully taken over a century ago while going through MacKenzie's permanent collection and preparing for her exhibition, the university said in a statement on Thursday. The statue will soon begin its journey home following a virtual repatriation ceremony held on November 19. University’s Interim President and Vice-Chancellor Dr Thomas Chase virtually met with High Commissioner of India to Canada Ajay Bisaria to officially repatriate the statue, it said. Representatives from the MacKenzie Art Gallery, Global Affairs Canada, and Canada Border Services Agency also attended the ceremony. "We are delighted that this unique statue of Annapoorna is on her way home. I am grateful to the University of Regina for their proactive engagement for the return of this cultural icon to India," Bisaria said. "The move to voluntarily repatriate such cultural treasures shows the maturity and depth of India-Canada relations," he said. When Mehra researched the story behind the statue, she found that MacKenzie had noticed the statue while on a trip to India in 1913. A stranger had overheard MacKenzie’s desire to have the statue, and stole it for him from its original location – a shrine at stone steps on the riverbank of the Ganges at Varanasi, India, the varsity said. Dr Siddhartha V Shah, Curator of Indian and South Asian Art at the Peabody Essex Museum, identified the statue as the Hindu goddess Annapoorna. She holds a bowl of kheer (rice pudding) in one hand and a spoon in the other. These are items associated with Annapoorna, who is the goddess of food and the queen of the city of Varanasi. She is celebrated by her devotees as one who nourishes and strengthens the body through food, and the soul through enlightenment, the statement said. "The repatriation of the Annapoorna is part of a global, long-overdue conversation in which museums seek to address harmful and continuing imperial legacies built into, sometimes, the very foundations of their collections. As stewards of cultural heritage, our responsibility to act respectfully and ethically is fundamental, as is the willingness to look critically at our own institutional histories," said Alex King, Curator/Preparator, University of Regina President's Art Collection. When the current administration at the University and the MacKenzie Art Gallery were alerted to the documentation which revealed the statue as an object of culture theft, both institutions committed to taking appropriate action, the varsity said. "As a university, we have a responsibility to right historical wrongs and help overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible," said Chase. "Repatriating this statue does not atone for the wrong that was done a century ago, but it is an appropriate and important act today. I am thankful to the MacKenzie Art Gallery, the Indian High Commission, and the Department of Canadian Heritage for their roles in making it possible," the Vice-Chancellor said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/canada-to-return-statue-of-hindu-goddess-stolen-over-100-years-ago-from-india-918246.html

But addressing a petroleum university's convocation, Modi said: "Work is being done to nearly double the country's oil refining capacity in the next five years". The convocation was also addressed virtually by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, whose Reliance Industries Ltd operates the world's biggest oil refinery in Modi's home state of Gujarat. Modi said India was also aiming to raise the share of natural gas in its energy-consumption mix by up to four times. The cleaner-burning fuel currently accounts for about 6% of the energy consumed in the country. India would achieve its targets of increasing renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts by 2022 and 450 gigawatts by 2030 ahead of schedule, Modi added. The country had a renewable energy capacity of about 75 gigawatts at the end of 2018.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-set-to-double-oil-refining-capacity-in-5-years-pm-modi-918255.html

Chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on health Ram Gopal Yadav submitted the report on 'Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its Management', to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu. This is the first report by any parliamentary committee on the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Underlining that healthcare spending in the country with a population of 1.3 billion is "abysmally low", the panel said fragility of Indian health ecosystem posed a big hurdle in generating an effective response against the pandemic. "The committee, therefore, strongly recommends the government to increase its investments in the public healthcare system and make consistent efforts to achieve the National Health Policy targets of expenditure up to 2.5 per cent of GDP within two years as the set time frame of year 2025 is far away and the public health cannot be jeopardised till that time schedule," the report stated. The National Health Policy 2017 has set a target of government expenditure on healthcare up to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025 from just 1.15 per cent in 2017. Stating that the public had to undergo trauma and distress due to absence of a dedicated healthcare system, the committee observed that the number of government hospital beds in the country were not adequate to handle the increasing number of Covid and non-Covid patients. "... Cost of health service delivery increased due to absence of specific guidelines for Covid treatment in private hospitals as a result of which patients were charged exorbitant fees," the committee noted in the report. Stressing on the need for better partnership between the government and private hospitals in wake of the pandemic and shortage of state-run healthcare facilities, the report said, "The Committee is of the view that arriving at a sustainable pricing model to treat Covid patients could have averted many deaths." The committee believes healthcare should never be limited to only those who can afford to pay but should move towards the noble vision of universal health coverage. For this happen, the government needs to be considerate and support the private health care sector, the report said. The committee was all praise for healthcare workers and doctors for being on frontline in handling of the deadly virus and said they should have defined working hours, predictably functioning reliever rosters and scheduled off-duty days. The doctors, who have laid down their lives in fight against the pandemic, must be acknowledged as martyrs and their families be adequately compensated, it suggested in the report.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pvt-hospitals-charged-exorbitant-fees-spending-on-health-abysmally-low-says-parliamentary-panel-on-covid-19-918287.html

According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), over 13.06 crore samples have been tested till November 20 with 10,66,022 being tested on Friday. The cumulative national Covid-19 positivity rate has declined and stood at 6.93 per cent as on date while the daily positivity rate on Friday was just 4.34 per cent. Higher volumes of testing eventually lead to low positivity rate, the ministry said. "An average of more than 10 lakh tests conducted daily has ensured that the cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels and is presently following a downward trajectory," the ministry underlined. The last one crore Covid-19 tests were conducted in a span of just 10 days. Twenty-four states and Union Territories have conducted more tests per million population than India as a whole. Twelve states have lower tests per million population than the national average and they have been advised to substantially ramp up the levels of testing, the ministry underscored. According to the the health ministry data updated at 8 am on Saturday, 46,232 people were found to be infected with Covid-19 in a span of 24 hours. "The daily positivity rate of 4.34 per cent point out that a comparatively huge volume was tested to detect these cases from the population. With a continuous surge in daily cases in European and the American countries, India is taking all cautionary steps to bring the trajectory of the disease under control. "In view of the increase in coronavirus cases of some of the north Indian states, the Centre has advised all states and Union Territories to ramp up testing," the ministry said. India's current active caseload of 4,39,747comprises 4.86 per cent of total cases. The country has registered 49,715 new recoveries in a day taking the total recovered cases to 84,78,124 which exceed active cases by 80,38,377. The recovery rate has improved to 93.67 per cent as on date. The health ministry said that 78.19 per cent of the new recovered cases was contributed by 10 states and UTs.

21-11-2020||National||India loses over Rs 70,000 crore annually in tax evasions: Study||India is reportedly losing over $10.3 billion, equivalent to over Rs 70,000 crore, annually owing to international corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion. Globally, countries lose $427 billion tax across continents due to such tax evasions.  Of the $427 billion tax evasions,  $245 billion was corporate tax abuse and the rest $182 billion was private tax evasion.  The data used by the researches was self-reported by various MNCs under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, spearheaded by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The MNCs avoid taxes by moving profit out of the country where it is generated to places where the corporate tax is less or does not exist. Companies managed to transfer such profit to the tune of $1.38 trillion. Individual tax payers, however, moved their financial assets of $10 trillion offshore, thus, evading taxes, the study said. The study further said that India suffers $10.3 billion tax loss annually, of which, a major chunk is corporate tax evasion and $202.15 million is offshore private tax evasion.  The study has also introduced a metric to identify the channels through which tax can be potentially evaded. For India, it is ‘outward foreign direct investments’ (OFDI) that stands with a vulnerability score of 66 per cent. Foreign countries that contribute to this vulnerability factor are Mauritius, Singapore and the Netherlands.  Major contributors to global tax loses are wealthy countries with high income, while the poor countries add just 2 per cent of the tax evasions. G20 countries alone involve in over a quarter of total global tax loses.  As for solutions, the study suggests taxes for excess profits made by the companies, such as digital companies that managed to make hefty profits even during the Covid-19 pandemic. It also suggests punitive wealth tax measures for opaquely-owned offshore assets. And, it also calls for a United Nations tax convention to set multilateral standards for taxation and greater cooperation between countries.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-loses-over-rs-70000-crore-annually-in-tax-evasions-study-918294.html
21-11-2020||National||False allegation of impotency amounts to cruelty, says HC; upholds couple's divorce||Levelling false allegation of impotence against a spouse amounts to cruelty, the Delhi High Court has held while upholding the divorce granted to a man, whose estranged wife had claimed that he was incapable of sexual intercourse. The high court agreed with the submission of the husband's counsel that the allegations levelled in the written statement filed by the wife were "grave and serious", and likely to impact the man's self-image and adversely affect his mental wellbeing. "Thus, having regard to the law on the subject, we find no infirmity in the findings and observations of the trial court that the allegation of the appellant (wife) in the written statement with respect to the impotency clearly falls within the concept of cruelty as defined under law," a bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula said. The high court's verdict came while dismissing the woman's appeal against a trial court order granting the husband's petition for grant of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. The estranged couple had got married in June 2012 here. While it was a first marriage for the woman, the man was a divorcee then. In the plea, the man had sought to declare the marriage null and void on the ground that it could not be consummated due to the woman's alleged impotency and that his consent was obtained by concealing several material facts related to her psychological disposition. Had he known them, he would not have consented for the marriage, it said. The woman, in her response, in turn alleged that the man was suffering from impotency (erectile dysfunction) which was the true cause of non-consummation of marriage, his parents were quarrelsome, they demanded dowry and she was cruelly treated and even badly thrashed by the man in front of his parents. Before the high court, the woman sought to set aside the trial court's order granting divorce decree and also prayed for restitution of conjugal rights, saying she was willing to save matrimonial alliance. The high court said the woman's allegation was rejected by the trial court on the basis of the testimony of an expert witness who after physically examining the man had found that he was normal with no problem of impotence. It said mental cruelty is primarily contextual, pertaining to human behaviour or conduct with respect to matrimonial duties and obligations and it is essential to see whether the conduct of the party is of such a nature, that a reasonable person would neither tolerate the same, nor be reasonably expected to live with the other party. The high court noted that the woman had been reinforcing the allegation of impotency throughout the litigation and these false accusations which could not be proved are bound to cause deep hurt and anguish to the man, who can reasonably apprehend that it would be perilous for him to live with her. "It is also abundantly clear that due to the mental pain, agony and suffering caused by the false accusations, the respondent (man) cannot be asked to put up with the conduct of the appellant (woman) and to continue to live with her," the high court said, adding there was an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. It also said that no party can be excused of recklessness in allegations made before the court of law and the consequences of false assertions have to follow. Allowing a person to get away with the consequences of false allegations, or treating them as trivial, would not advance the cause of justice, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/false-allegation-of-impotency-amounts-to-cruelty-says-hc-upholds-couples-divorce-918301.html

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy said the order by the single judge of the HC was all the more shocking because the stay on the investigation was granted without hearing the other side. "We are appalled to notice that, presumably, the single judge of the High Court was not conscious about the principle underlying statutory provision (Section 22) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which clearly comes in the way of granting interim relief of stay of the criminal trial concerning offences under Prevention of Corruption Act," the bench said. "More so, such drastic order could not have been passed without hearing the counsel for the State," the bench added. The top court quashed and set aside the HC's order of February 1, 2018, after hearing advocate Sanjay M Nuli on behalf of 76-year-old complainant V Hanumanthaiah. The petitioner here claimed he had purchased 7.8 guntas of land at Yelahanka Hobli in Bengaluru north in 2003. As some goons tried to stop his construction at the site, he approached police Inspector Ashok who allegedly demanded Rs 4 lakh and took Rs 2 lakh for protection. In 2017, on a complaint made along with the CD of telephonic conversation, a case was ordered to be registered against the police officers. On a plea for quashing the FIR, the HC in 2018 stayed the proceedings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-expresses-shock-at-karnataka-hcs-order-granting-ex-parte-stay-in-auradkar-corruption-case-918321.html

Siddiquee has also urged Akshay Kumar to withdraw the notice, failing which he would initiate "appropriate legal proceedings" against the actor. Kumar had on November 17 issued a defamation notice against Siddiquee seeking Rs 500 crore in damages for making "false and baseless allegations" against him in Rajput's death case. Kumar said Siddiquee on his YouTube channel FF News has published several "defamatory, libelous and derogatory" videos. Siddiquee, in his reply sent through his advocate J P Jayswal on Friday, said Kumar's allegations were "false, vexatious and oppressive and is raised with an intent to harass him". It added that following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, several independent reporters, including Siddiquee, covered the news as many influential people were involved and other prominent media channels were not providing correct information. "The news reported by Siddiquee was already in the public domain and he (Siddiquee) has placed reliance on other news channels as sources," the reply said. It further questioned the delay in the defamation notice sent and said the videos were uploaded in August 2020.

The cash incentives are given to all legally registered inter-faith Indian couples, said officials of the state Social Welfare Department. In cases of inter-caste marital marriages, one condition for availing the cash incentive is that one of the spouses should be from the scheduled caste as defined by Article 341 of the Constitution, they said. The amount given as inter-caste and inter-religious marital alliances can be extremely helpful in promoting the spirit of national unity, said Tehri's Social Welfare Officer Dipankar Ghildiyal said. The eligible couples can apply for the cash incentive till one year after the marriage, he said. The amount being given jointly to such couples was increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 in Uttarakhand in 2014 through an amendment in the Uttar Pradesh Antarjatiya/Antardharmik Vivah Protsahan Niyamawali, 1976 which had been adopted as it was when Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/uttarakhand-govt-paying-cash-incentives-to-inter-caste-inter-faith-couples-918328.html

Ambani, who is also the President of the Board of Governors of Gandhinagar-based Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay University (PDPU), said in his convocation address that he foresees an "explosive and exponential growth" in the Indian economy in the post-Covid era. The country will find a place in the top three economies of the world within a couple of decades, he said. "By the middle of the century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India's own per capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today," Ambani said. Therefore, he said that India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: to become an economic superpower, and to become a clean and green energy superpower. "To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in renewable energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen," he added. Further, Ambani said that the country needs great innovations in energy storage and utilisation. He was addressing the graduating students at the 8th convocation of PDPU organised via video conferencing, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief guest. To the graduating students worried about the uncertainties created by the post-Covid situation, he advised them to venture out with supreme hope and confidence. "The future is very bright for India. This is our ancient nation that has faced many adversities in the past and has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people and Indian culture. In the post-Covid era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy," the RIL chief said. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies of the world, he said. "The growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see amongst you as creators of successful start-ups," he said. Ambani said that the future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes, which are impacting the "future of humanity and our planet". He said that if Indian masters the synergy between the energy revolution and the fourth industrial revolution, it will surely become "one of the most prosperous nations of the world, an India that guarantees prosperity and well-being" for all Indians. "The most important question we face is this: can we produce growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment, without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations. We must be prepared to answer these questions with a very confident 'yes,'" he said. Ambani praised the leadership of Gujarat under Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and said that the state has always been a trailblazer and showing a pioneering spirit. He said the world acknowledges that the new Gujarat has paved a path for a new India, with the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Gujarat received being now available to the nation. He said that the PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhance the reputation of Gujarat and India in the energy sector. Ambani also advised students to continue the process of learning, as a "constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure". "A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge," he said. "The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dream with passion, purpose and persistent effort. Your dreams will indeed come true," he said. Around 2,600 students received their degree certificates at the convocation. More than 40 scholars received PhD degrees, and 77 students were conferred medals of merit. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire proceeding, including the inauguration of the facilities, were conducted via video conference.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-pursue-twin-goals-of-becoming-economic-and-energy-superpower-mukesh-ambani-918335.html
21-11-2020||National||From the Newsroom: India plans to double oil refining capacity in 5 years, says PM Modi||In your evening news brief, From The Newsroom, Farooq Abdullah objects to treatment meted out to Gupkar declaration candidates;  Narcotics Control Bureau questions celebrity couple Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa; Study says India is reportedly losing over $10.3 billion, annually owing to international corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion;  Prime Minister Narendra Modi says India plans to nearly double its oil refining capacity in the next five years; Karnataka Congress president D K Shivakumar says CBI had summoned him to appear on November 23.  Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and president of newly cobbled up People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) Farooq Abdullah on Saturday objected to the treatment meted out to the amalgam candidates, saying security is being used as a pretext to impede and customize democracy in the Union Territory. In a two-page letter to J-K Election Commissioner K K Sharma, Abdullah, who is at present a Lok Sabha member from Srinagar, said providing security to a select few and literally interning the rest is a gross interference in democracy. Continuing its swoop on the entertainment industry, the Narcotics Control Bureau(NCB) on Saturday questioned celebrity couple Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa on Saturday. Reports said that an unspecified quantity of ganja has been seized, however, there has not been any confirmation. After the raids, the duo was handed over the summons to appear at the NCB’s Zonal Unit. India is reportedly losing over $10.3 billion, equivalent to over Rs 70,000 crore, annually owing to international corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion. Globally, countries lose $427 billion tax across continents due to such tax evasions.  A study titled 'The State of Tax Justice 2020' led by Tax Justice Network, showed that countries are annually losing billions of dollars in tax evasion by various multinational companies and private wealth hoarders.  Of the $427 billion tax evasions,  $245 billion was corporate tax abuse and the rest $182 billion was private tax evasion.  India plans to nearly double its oil refining capacity in the next five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, offering a much more aggressive timeline than previously despite the coronavirus pandemic blighting the economy. The country's energy minister was quoted in June as saying India's oil refining capacity could jump to 450-500 million tonnes in 10 years from the current level of about 250 million tonnes. But addressing a petroleum university's convocation, Modi said: "Work is being done to nearly double the country's oil refining capacity in the next five years". Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said Saturday that the CBI had summoned him to appear on November 23 in connection with a disproportionate assets case. “It’s true that I have received the summons,” Shivakumar told reporters. “On November 19, the CBI officers came home, but nobody was there due to a personal event we were attending. The next morning, I came home and they gave me the summons. They’ve asked me to come on November 23,” he said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-india-plans-to-double-oil-refining-capacity-in-5-years-says-pm-modi-918344.html

In a swoop, the NCB carried out raids at the residence of Bharti and her husband Haarsh Limbachiyaa. The sleuths seized from their residence 86.5 gms of ganja. “Both Bharti Singh and Haarsh Limbachiyaa has accepted that they consumed ganja,” said NCB Mumbai unit’s Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede. The couple were summoned to the Exchange Building, the NCB’s Mumbai zonal office. While Bharti Singh has been arrested, her husband Haarsh is being examined. The couple were taken in separate vehicles to the NCB office. As Bharti entered the NCB office, she said: “….nothing….they have called us for some questioning”. Earlier in the morning, the NCB teams landed at their premises in Andheri, Lokhandwala Complex and Versova areas and carried out search operations. Bharti (36) and Haarsh (33) are among the leading couple in India’s TV industry and are currently hosting India’s Best Dancer on Sony Entertainment Television. Bharti has been part of numerous comedy shows – and is now part of The Kapil Sharma Show Season 2 and Funhit Me Jaari. Haarsh is a screenwriter and producer and has written the shows Comedy Circus Ke Tansen, Comedy Nights Bachao and Comedy Nights Live. He also wrote dialogues for the film PM Narendra Modi and lyrics for the title track of the film Malang. He has also created, produced and hosted Khatra Khatra Khatra and Hum Tum Aur Quarantine. The questioning of the couple by the NCB is part of the probe to unravel the entertainment industry-drug cartel nexus. Among the celebrities questioned earlier include Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone, Rakul Preet Singh, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan. The NCB is carrying out two investigations simultaneously - one into the drug angle vis-à-vis Sushant Singh Rajput and the another the larger Bollywood-drug cartel nexus. Nearly twenty persons, including Sushant’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik, were arrested. Subsequently, Rhea was granted conditional bail by the Bombay High Court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/comedian-bharti-singh-arrested-after-ncb-recovers-ganja-from-her-918350.html
21-11-2020||National||Private hospitals fleecing Covid-19 patients due to absence of guidelines: Parliamentary panel||Inadequate beds in government hospitals and absence of guidelines on treatment have resulted in private health facilities fleecing Covid-19 patients, while poor contact tracing and less testing appeared to have aided the surge in cases, a Parliamentary panel said on Saturday. In its report 'Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its Management', the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health headed by Samajwadi Party MP Ramgopal Yadav said several deaths could have been averted if the government had put in place a sustainable pricing model. The Committee was also not impressed with the existing coordination between the Centre and the states and emphasised the need for further strengthening the mechanism. The required infrastructure to imbibe the 5Ts -- Tracing, Tracking, Testing, Treating and Technology -- cannot be established overnight rather it demands adequate financial aid and specialized human resources, it said. The panel was of the view that the "fragility" of the healthcare system in the country posed a huge hurdle in bringing out an effective response to Covid-19 while noting that the spending on health was "abysmally low". "Cost of health service delivery increased due to absence of specific guidelines for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals as a result of which patients were charged exorbitant fees," the committee, which submitted the report to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, said. Interestingly, the report was submitted through a digital conference, a first in Parliament's history.  The multi-party panel said the lack of hospital beds and the inadequate ventilators facilities further complicated the efficacy of the containment plan against the pandemic. "As the numbers of cases were on the rise, a frantic search for vacant hospital beds became quite harrowing. Instances of patients being turned away from overburdened hospitals due to lack of vacant beds became the new normal," it said. Emphasising that healthcare workers had to work under huge stress due to shortage of PPE kits, the panel said many of them had to lose their precious lives. The Ministry needs to ensure that there is no shortage of PPE kits. Recommending an increase in expenditure on public health infrastructure, the report said the lack of investment in the sector has exposed the fragility of Indian health ecosystem which posed a big hurdle in generating an effective response against the pandemic. "The serious impact of the pandemic could have been minimized had the Government over the years increased its investment in the healthcare system. The Committee is pained to note the trauma and distress the public had to undergo due to absence of a dedicated healthcare system," the report noted. "A sustainable pricing model to treat Covid-19 patients could have averted many deaths...The number of government hospital beds in the country were not adequate to handle the increasing number of Covid and non-Covid-19 patients. In the wake of the pandemic and shortage of Government healthcare facilities, the Government should have strategised a better partnership with the Private Hospitals under PPP model," it said. The committee was worried about the use of less reliable diagnostic tests and batted for an increase in testing through reliable RT-PCR tests. The panel's contention was that though Rapid Antigen Tests may give faster results, large scale use of such tests with low specificity and sensitivity may end up giving misleading results and would derail the containment strategy. Supporting the proposal to set up a dedicated 'Indian Health Service' (IHS) on the pattern of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), it said this could help in streamlining the healthcare delivery as envisaged in the National Health Policy 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/private-hospitals-fleecing-covid-19-patients-due-to-absence-of-guidelines-parliamentary-panel-918352.html

As on Friday afternoon, they also performed the puja rituals at artificial pools prepared by civic authorities but did not play music, unlike the previous years, officials said. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had appealed to people to offer prayers at home or visit neighbourhood ponds to hold the puja following health protocols related to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Kolkata, the administration did not allow the puja in two lakes - Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar following court orders. The Supreme Court had on Thursday ruled that Chhath puja will not be allowed at the Rabindra Sarobar Lake, while the Calcutta High Court banned celebrations at Subhas Sarobar. The National Green Tribunal had passed an order in 2018, banning Chhath puja at Rabindra Sarobar. However, hundreds of devotees flouted the ban and broke open the gates of the lake in 2019 to perform the puja. An official of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority -- the custodian of the two lakes -- said that five gates of Rabindra Sarobar and several entry points of Subhas Sarobar remained locked since Thursday midnight, with personnel of the Kolkata Police guarding the premises. The gates were locked till 3 30 pm Saturday, the official said. The chief minister had also urged everyone to cooperate with the administration and honour the court orders. A spokesman of Bihari Samaj in the city said, "Thanks to everyone for following the directives of the court. Let's not flout Covid-19 guidelines."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/people-pray-to-sun-god-at-dawn-chhat-puja-celebration-concludes-918354.html

At present, the railways is operating 736 special trains, 200 services of the Kolkata Metro, over 2,000 Mumbai suburban services, and 20 special clone trains. Besides those, 436 festival special trains are being operated from October 20 to November 30. According to the railways, overall occupancy of the 736 special trains is around 92%. With Covid-19 cases rising in several parts of the country, the normalisation of passenger train services may be more delayed than expected. Normalisation services may happen only early next year, said an official in the railways. By next month, the government and railway ministry will assess the situation regarding Covid-19, after which a decision will be taken to increase the number of other mail and express trains. Even continuation of festival special trains from November 31 will be taken soon, said the official. The Railways, which had suspended all passenger train services since the beginning of lockdown in March 24, has so far earned Rs 3,322 crore as revenue from the segment, which is 90% less than what it earned during the same period last year. Freight loading has grown, compared to last year, and there has been a 9% revenue growth, which comes to Rs 869 crore more than last year. In the fiscal 2019-20, the railways passenger earning was Rs 56,000 crore. Due to the pandemic, the railways was able to earn only 10% of its total earning from passengers segment in the current fiscal. The railways has said due to the pandemic, it is looking at a loss of around Rs 40,000 crore in the current financial year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-hoping-for-normalisation-of-passenger-train-services-early-next-year-918370.html

In his address to the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) at India e-biz Expo 2020, MEA Secretary (CPV&OIA) Sanjay Bhattacharyya said Covid-19 was an unprecedented disruption, at all levels, across the world. "It was not only a health crisis but it also imposed socio-economic challenges. Global economy slumped, social interaction was curtailed and individuals were fearful. It was imperative for the global community to coordinate efforts in the fight against coronavirus," he said in his address on 'Leveraging Business Opportunities in a post-Covid Scenario'. India cooperated on repatriation of stranded citizens, in both directions and facilitated the return of over one lakh foreign citizens to their homes, he said. "Vande Bharat Mission, the largest repatriation exercise, which brought back 30 lakhs stranded citizens, was possible because of the active support from partners across the world," he said. India provided emergency medical supplies to several countries and deployed medical teams, emerging as the first provider of humanitarian assistance to Covid, Bhattacharyya said. "Thousands of Indian healthcare professionals went overseas to help them address the challenges of Covid. We strengthened cooperation in Covid research and testing. We stand ready to support in vaccine availability from India, as we will be the largest producers, once the vaccine is approved," he said. Bhattacharyya said that as business leaders give shape to India's economic engagement, the key opportunities will lie in, among other things, Atmanirbhar Bharat which provides a vision of India's plans to become a USD 5 trillion economy by promoting 'Make in India - Make for World'. "This will happen through our integration with the global economy. The thrust will be on joint ventures in infrastructure and manufacturing, integrating into supply chains and tapping sovereign wealth funds," he said. Bhattacharyya said new emerging technologies, especially in ICT, consultancy, fin-tech, logistics, edutech, healthtech, biotech and others also have enormous potential. Bhattacharyya asserted that Indian business must venture into less-explored markets, which can yield greater dividends. "High-level exchanges between India and our growing circle of partners have promoted deeper understanding and cooperation. This is an opportune moment for the business community to develop deeper links, based on each other’s national priorities and development plans," he said. "We are engaged in reforms and transformational changes in our economy, there is strong political understanding with foreign partners and traditional goodwill between the peoples gives more wind to the sails. This is the equivalent of a 'sweet spot' to change the nature and scale of our economic engagement, to new heights," the MEA official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/atmanirbhar-bharat-gives-vision-of-indias-plans-to-become-5-trillion-economy-mea-official-918381.html

Unlike in the last two years when senior BJP leaders were quick to distance themselves from controversial remarks of Giriraj Singh, which could annoy Nitish, no BJP leader has so far made remarks distancing from or disapproving of Singh's remarks. JD(U) Bihar President Bashishtha Narayan Singh was evasive on the issue when asked during a press conference in Patna saying it is not necessary that if someone gives a comment then there should be a discussion. Later, a JD(U) spokesperson dismissed the demand saying his party does not believe in dividing the society but taking all sections together and making  it clear that Nitish Kumar is not someone who will follow any other party's agenda. While Yogi said in a rally in Katihar, "Modi ji has found a solution to the infiltration problem in the form of the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act). And those infiltrators who try to undermine the sovereignty and integrity of the country will be thrown out," Kumar was quick to distance from the remarks in another rally in Kishanganj saying "some people are spreading propaganda. Who will get whom out of the country? No one has the power to throw anyone out as everyone belongs to India. We've always created an environment of harmony and tried to unite everyone." Both Kishanganj and Katihar are in Seemanchal region of Bihar, where Muslims have substantial population. The elections threw big success for BJP making it the second largest party in the state after RJD and the lead partner in state NDA with JD(U)'s tally substantially coming down, which has altered internal power equations within the ruling alliance, where Nitish Kumar was the big brother for the last over a decade. Bihar BJP leaders Giriraj Singh and Ashwani Choubey in past did not have the best of relationship with Nitish Kumar but they went slow after BJP realised that staying together with Kumar is the best option for it both in 2019 Lok Sabha polls and 2020 Assembly polls. It was after a long gap that Singh spoke on Friday on the contentious issue of love jihad urging Kumar to realize that issues like love jihad and population control had nothing to do with sampradayikta (communalism) but are about samajik samrasta (social harmony). Five BJP-ruled states Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh have already expressed inclination for such a law. UP government's Home Ministry has also sent a proposal in this regard to the Law Ministry. The row over love jihad comes soon after a newly-sworn in JD(U) Minister Mewa Lal Choudhary had to resign hours after taking oath as education minister as the Opposition had raised an uproar over his inclusion in the state cabinet citing corruption allegations against. BJP is reported to have prevailed upon the state government to now allow him to continue in the ministry. In 2016 when Mewa Lal was a minister in Nitish-led JD(U)-RJD-Congress government, BJP, which was in Opposition then, had even sought the arrest of Mewa Lal in a case. Aware that the past could come to haunt it, the BJP convinced Nitish Kumar to drop the minister. In the new Nitish government, Sushil Kumar Modi, who was close to Nitish was not included as Deputy Chief Minister even as the BJP has two Dy CMs in the state cabinet.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pinpricks-for-new-nitish-kumar-government-as-giriraj-singh-bats-for-law-against-love-jihad-918388.html
21-11-2020||National||Centre allows Ayurveda doctors to perform 'variety of medical procedures', including surgeries||The Centre has allowed post-graduate Ayurveda doctors to perform a variety of general surgical, ENT, ophthalmological and dental procedures, such as removal of appendix and gall bladder, excision of benign tumours, amputation of gangrene, and dental root canal, after receiving proper training on such procedures. The decision notified by the Central Council of Indian Medicine after receiving sanctions from the central government has drawn flak from the Indian Medical Association that described the move as equivalent to “corrupting the entire health system of the country.” Those pursuing an MS (Ayurveda) Shalya Tantra (general surgery) will be trained on 39 types of procedures whereas the PG students pursuing MS (Ayurveda) Shalakya Tantra (diseases of eye, ear, nose, throat, head and oro-dentistry) will receive training on another 19 procedures. Once they receive the degrees, they would be able to perform these procedures independently, said the notification. The surgical procedures on which the Ayurveda practitioners would receive training include excision of simple cyst, all types of skin grafting, ear lobe repair, all types of suturing, removal of metallic and non-metalic foreign bodies from non vital organs, operation for anal fistula and cataract operations besides multiple urological procedures. However, the IMA, India’s biggest association of doctors, condemned the notification describing the move as a retrograde step. “Such mixing of the systems will be resisted at all costs. All over India students and practitioners of modern medicine are agitated over this violation of mutual identity and respect. What is the sanctity of NEET if such shortcuts are devised?” it said. The notification comes at a time when many states witness severe shortage of specialist surgeons in rural areas and small towns. A 2015 health statistics report by the Union Health Ministry showed that out of the total sanctioned posts 74.6% posts of surgeons are vacant in the community health centres all over the country. But doctors are of the opinion that the route chosen by the CCIM is not the best way to bridge the gap. “Its a fraud being committed on the students. Let the two systems thrive independently instead of corrupting the entire health systems of the country. Why should anybody sit for the NEET if such shortcuts are allowed,” IMA national president Rajan Sharma told DH. Surgical disciplines of modern medicine have developed over the last half a millennium. "Corrupting modern medicine by mixing with other systems and poaching the disciplines through back door means is certainly foul play of first order," said IMA. Other public health experts, however, are not so dismissive of the move. "If they are trained well, they can play a bigger role in the public health system. But its a short-term measure and a change of medical education is required for an integration of the two systems,” commented public health specialist Meenakshi Gautham, a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Such surgical innovations, pointed out Gautham, were in practice in several African countries that experience a deficiency in the number of surgeons.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-allows-ayurveda-doctors-to-perform-variety-of-medical-procedures-including-surgeries-918391.html

An informal meeting of the WTO’s TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Council in Geneva on Friday saw Canada, Australia, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union strongly opposing the proposal submitted by India and South Africa to temporarily waive the intellectual property rules for the Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The proposal, however, received widespread support from the developing nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as international NGOs like Medicines sans Frontier and Amnesty International. India’s arch rival Pakistan too joined Kenya, Mozambique and Eswatini to co-sponsor the proposal. China too welcomed the proposal placed by India and South Africa before the WTO, but sought more time to assess legal and economic aspects, particularly on efforts by its own pharma companies for development of Covid-19 vaccines. So did Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, El Salvador, Turkey and Ukraine, sources in New Delhi said. The TRIPS Council will have another meeting on December 10 and a final decision on the proposal by India and South Africa will be taken by the WTO General Council on December 17. The opposition by the US and the EU and the others, however, already made the fate of the proposal uncertain. India and South Africa on October 1 last jointly sent a communiqué to the WTO, referring to reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products to the patients. The proposal by India and South Africa seeks a temporary waiver to be granted to all the WTO members so that they do not have to implement, apply or enforce certain obligations related to Covid-19 products and technologies under Section 1 (copyrights and related rights), 4 (industrial design), 5 (patents) and 7 (protection of undisclosed information) of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement – the global treaty that governs intellectual property rights. The proponents of the temporary waiver argued during the WTO TRIPS Council’s meeting on Friday that if the developing and poor nations did not get access to the Covid-19 vaccines, the pandemic would continue to wreak havoc in one part of the world, despite being brought under control in another. They underlined that the waiver proposed would continue only till the time widespread vaccination would be in place globally, and the majority of the population of the world would develop immunity from the SARS-CoV-19. “Beyond patents, other intellectual property rights may also pose a barrier, with limited options to overcome those barriers. In addition, many countries especially developing countries may face institutional and legal difficulties when using flexibilities available in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement),” the two nations noted, adding: “A particular concern for countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity are the requirements of Article 31 (of the TRIPS Agreement) and consequently the cumbersome and lengthy process for the import and export of pharmaceutical products.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-pakistan-support-indias-call-for-patent-free-covid-19-vaccine-at-wto-us-eu-oppose-918399.html

Referring to the encounter of four heavily armed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists in Jammu's Nagrota on Thursday, he credited the security forces' "high morale" in stopping them. "Four terrorists sent by our neighbour wanted to inflict huge damage. They were stopped. They were heavily armed and were killed in an encounter. The morale of the security forces are high under Modi," he said. "I want to thank those security forces who have risked their lives to make the country safe," Shah said in his address after dedicating a fifth reservoir for Chennai and laying the foundation stone for various infrastructure projects in the state. He said he was confident that the country's borders will be safe under Modi's leaership and it will also progress in the path of development.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/morale-of-security-forces-high-under-narendra-modi-says-amit-shah-918413.html

Government sources said that the Kumbh would be held as usual between January and April, but they are silent on the special arrangements that need to be put in place in order to organise such a mega-gathering in the middle of the pandemic. "I don’t think anyone has factored in the risks associated with the Kumbh. There are justifiable public health worries,” K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India told DH. “No doubt, its a tremendous challenge. The administration needs to devise special strategy and start preparations,” said IIT Kanpur mathematician Manindra Agarwal, who is a part of the government-backed panel that predicted that the epidemic would run its course by February 2021. Earlier this month, Uttarakhand government approved proposals worth nearly Rs 300 crore for the 2021 Kumbh at Haridwar including construction of a 150-bed hospital and a 1,000-bed Covid care centre. In addition, an extensive police surveillance system would be put in place by February 2021 for crowd management in a Covid-19 appropriate manner. The first Shahi Snan is scheduled on March 21 and the last Shahi Snan would be on April 27. In between millions would visit the temple town and adjoining places like Rishikesh, Roorkee and Dehradun. In fact the visitors will start pouring in from January 14 (Makar Sankranti). The rising Covid-19 numbers post Diwali adds to the public health concerns as warned by the Union Health Ministry last week. The number of new cases are on a rise since the last four days after dipping below 30,000 on November 17. The seven-day running average data maintained by the National Institute of Epidemiology too showed the beginning of a rising trend. In the last 24 hours, as many as 46,232 new cases were registered taking the tally to 90.5 lakh. The death toll stands at 132,726 out of which 564 were added in the past 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kumbh-mela-2021-the-next-big-covid-19-challenge-after-diwali-918415.html

"The CBI is conducting further investigation on the mandate given to it and its progress report is submitted to the designated court at Chennai. The further investigation spread over to different countries and its status have already been shared with this court," it said. In affidavit filed on November 20 to a plea by Perarivalan for his release, the CBI said the relief sought by him was an issue between him and the office of Tamil Nadu Governor where it was to be decided whether remission can be granted or not. "In so far as relief is concerned in the present matter, the CBI has no role," it said. The probe agency also pointed out that the top court had already on March 14, 2018 dismissed an application by Perarivalan for recall of May 11, 1999 judgement holding him guilty in the case. The petitioner had then relied upon confessions by the accused that he was unaware of about the purpose of 9 volt battery purchased by him and handed over to the prime accused Sivarasan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ongoing-probe-in-rajiv-gandhi-case-not-related-to-perarivalan-cbi-tells-sc-918431.html
21-11-2020||National Politics||BJP takes stock of ties with allies in Assam||As the BJP begins work on its strategy for the Assam Assembly polls, the state unit appears keen on staking claim to some of the seats held by its key alliance partner, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), while its ties are strained with another ally, Bodoland People's Front (BPF). The BPF's only Rajya Sabha member is set to join the BJP and the regional party is engaged in a bitter contest with the saffron party in the forthcoming Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) polls. Assam's present political situation was discussed on Friday night at a two-hour meeting attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president J P Nadda, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, BJP general secretaries B L Santosh and Dilip Saikia, state BJP chief Ranjit Dass, Assam Minister and North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor Himanta Biswa Sarma among others. Dass said since the assembly election is just four and half months away, the central and state leadership of the BJP have discussed various aspects of the polls and issues related to the government. “They also took stock of the organisational issues, the strength of our alliance partners AGP and BPF,” he said. The state BJP president said that during the meeting, the state leadership has briefed the central leadership that in some of the assembly seats presently held by the AGP, the BJP is growing strong. The AGP had contested 24 constituencies in 2016 assembly polls in the state and won in 14. The BJP currently has 61 MLAs. “We have also informed that in some seats, the AGP has become weak and in some seats it is strong. "In recent panchayat elections, in some of the AGP held assembly seats, the BJP performed better than the AGP. Many BJP candidates won in the panchayat elections in such assembly constituencies which are held by the AGP. So, we have apprised them of our stand,” Dass said. Asked whether the meeting discussed the continuation of relations with the BPF, Dass said they have informed the BJP's central leadership that the BPF is losing ground in the BTC area. “After the BTC polls, we will clear our stand. The BPF will also clear their stand. We have informed the central leadership that the BJP is popular in BTC,” he said. The BPF had fought in 12 seats in 2016, winning all. The AGP and  BPF have three ministers each in the Sonowal government. Himanta Biswa Sarma also asserted that the BJP is going to capture power at the BTC after the polls in the autonomous body. “Since we are winning the BTC elections, where is the question of alliance? The BJP will form the government at the BTC,” he said. The 40-member BTC is an autonomous body created under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. Its two-phased elections will be held on December 7 and 10. The BPF, headed by Hagrama Mohilary, has been in power in the BTC for the last 15 years. Sarma also said that BJP president Nadda has given his approval for the formal joining of the BPF's lone Rajya Sabha MP Biswajit Daimary into the BJP. Virtually shutting the doors to the BPF, Sarma said the BJP will contest in all 12 assembly seats, currently held by the Bodo party, in the next year's assembly polls. BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary had recently slammed Sarma saying his “bullying attitude” will not be entertained in the BTC region. Questioning the BJP government, Mohilary said the Centre was supposed to give Rs 1,000 crore to the BTC area, but it got only Rs. 600 crore. “Once the BTC election is over, we will form the government at BTC, and we will decide with whom we want to be with,” he had said. Dass said the BJP central leadership will talk to the leadership of the AGP and the BPF and take a final decision on the future of the alliance. He said BJP president Nadda will visit Assam on November 26-27 and hold virtual election meetings with party booth workers, MLAs, ministers, MPs, office bearers, district presidents and social media workers on the preparation for the assembly elections. Sources said Union Home Minister Amit Shah is also likely to visit Assam on November 28 and interact with party workers. Speculation is rife in Assam that the United People's Party Liberal (UPPL), another Bodo group, may join the BJP-led alliance after the BTC polls. Asked for his comments, UPPL leader and former Rajya Sabha MP, U G Brahma, said: “Right now our priority is the BTC elections, which we will win. We don't know about the future.” The UPPL is fighting in all 40 seats in the BTC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-takes-stock-of-ties-with-allies-in-assam-918311.html
21-11-2020||National Politics||AIADMK-BJP alliance to continue for Tamil Nadu Assembly elections||Tamil Nadu's ruling AIADMK on Saturday announced that the party's alliance with BJP stitched last year will continue for the Assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. The significant announcement was made by party coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami in the presence of Union Home Minister and BJP's election strategist Amit Shah at a government event here. Though Shah did not make any explicit announcement about the alliance, he indicated his endorsement by declaring that the Narendra Modi government will “stand like a rock” behind the AIADMK government. The Home Minister also utilised the occasion to send out a political message, saying the Assembly elections will witness the end of “dynastic parties”, referring to DMK and Congress. “I am duty-bound to announce through this meeting that the victorious AIADMK-BJP alliance will continue for the elections to be held in the future,” Panneerselvam said as Shah looked on. Endorsing his views, Chief Minister Palaniswami said the alliance stitched during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will continue, while expressing the confidence that the AIADMK government will score a hat trick by winning for a third straight term. The AIADMK-BJP alliance managed to win just one of the 39 Lok Sabha seats it fought in 2019. Though the announcement was not completely unexpected, many were surprised that the Chief Minister and his deputy chose a government function to make the declaration. That the AIADMK wanted to announce the continuation of the alliance with Shah by their side is the only explanation that can be given. It also comes amidst the Tamil Nadu government refusing to grant permission for state BJP's Vetrivel Yatra that triggered speculation whether the alliance might break. After the announcement, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam met Shah at a five-star hotel where he will stay for the night. Sources said broad contours of the alliance might have come up for discussion during the meeting. In his speech, Shah praised the Palaniswami government and listed Centre's assistance to Tamil Nadu, which he said, was much more than the Manmohan Singh government gave to the state in which DMK was a part. He also hit out at the DMK and Congress saying they have no “locus standi” to talk about corruption and asked them to “look within” before blaming others. “In the past six years after Narendra Modi assumed office as Prime Minister, we have been defeating family-based parties in several states, and now it's Tamil Nadu's turn. There is a dynastic party here as well. In the upcoming elections, when it is held, the dynastic party will bite the dust and democratic forces will emerge victorious,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/aiadmk-bjp-alliance-to-continue-for-tamil-nadu-assembly-elections-918315.html

Shah was also given a rousing reception, both inside and outside the airport, with supporters of BJP and ally AIADMK holding flags of their respective parties lining up along the route his cavalcade took. As Shah surprised all by getting out of his car and walked for a while, a man flung a placard at him. However, the placard did not hit him. Police said 67-year-old Durairaj has been detained for the same. Meanwhile, the Home Minister inaugurated a new reservoir that would meet the drinking water needs of Chennai, and laid the foundation stone for a slew of projects, including the ambitious phase-II of Chennai Metro Rail. The reception that Shah received at the airport was unprecedented, courtesy the Tamil Nadu government which walked the extra mile to bring smiles on the face of its alliance partner. Palaniswami, and Panneerselvam waited along with their cabinet colleagues at the tarmac for a few minutes to welcome Shah. Besides the duo, Ministers K A Sengotaiyyan, P Thangamani, S P Velumani, D Jayakumar, 'MaFoi' K Pandiarajan, P Benjamin, and AIADMK's lone MP in Lok Sabha, O P Raveendranath also welcomed the Home Minister. This is probably the first time that a Tamil Nadu Chief Minister has received the Home Minister at the airport. Shah, who will stay at Chennai overnight, will meet office-bearers of the BJP at a five-star hotel and discuss election strategy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tamil-nadu-cm-dy-cm-give-amit-shah-unprecedented-welcome-at-chennai-airport-918359.html
21-11-2020||National Politics||BJP central leadership’s bid to micromanage Bengal unit may benefit TMC||BJP’s recent decision to deploy a host of central leaders from outside West Bengal to steer the party ahead and during the Assembly elections next year makes it evident that its central leadership wants to take full control of the party’s operations in Bengal, leaving little for the state leaders to do. Modi-Shah duo's decision to micromanage the state unit may cost BJP dearly in the 2021 Assembly elections as it is creating an impression among voters that the central leadership do not have any faith in the state leaders. The fact that the five vote managers along with at least 30 other central leaders BJP deployed in Bengal are all non-Bengalis and from other states has made it easier for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to play the “outsider card”. This became evident as she recently said that the people of West Bengal did not have to fear “outsiders.” BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya tried to defend his party saying “what does she (Mamata) mean by outsiders? Are our leaders from China?” But this failed to blunt TMC’s attack. Minister Bratya Basu said that BJP thinks that outsiders who did not know about Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore can dictate terms to the people of Bengal. He dubbed BJP as “anti-Bengali.” Sources in the state BJP unit said that although the central leadership makes key decisions when it comes to elections but sending such large number of central leaders from other states might create an impression that they did not have any faith on state leaders. BJP’s decision to contest the 2021 Assembly elections without projecting anyone as it’s Chief Ministerial candidate means that the party has to fall back upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take on the formidable TMC supremo. Modi at best would be viewed by the people of Bengal as a national leader and being the Prime Minister lending weight to BJP’s campaign. But it is unlikely he would be able to also fulfil the role of BJP’s face in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-central-leadership-s-bid-to-micromanage-bengal-unit-may-benefit-tmc-918367.html
21-11-2020||National Politics||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar flays Gupkar alliance||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday hit out at the Gupkar alliance, accusing the Congress of siding with those talking in "anti-national language". Khattar criticised the Congress for "becoming part" of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration in Jammu and Kashmir. He said that the PAGD’s agenda is to restore the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution in J&K and said this has "exposed" the Congress. The Congress on Tuesday had asserted that it was not a part of the Gupkar alliance and was contesting the District Development Councils elections in J&K to "expose" the BJP through democratic means. Khattar also expressed his indignation against some leaders of the alliance who allegedly said that “Article 370 will be restored with the help of China”. "The agenda of all these people is to restore Article 370 but it will not be allowed under any circumstances,” he asserted. He also took a dig at the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, blaming him for "imposing" Article 370 in J&K. The PAGD is a conglomerate of J&K-based political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It was formed to seek the restoration of autonomy for the region under Article 370. “They all have gathered now and are speaking in the anti-national language. The Congress is also siding with them," Khattar further said. He said after 70 years of independence, a big step was taken by the Narendra Modi government to scrap Article 370. “Ever since this step was taken, the situation in Kashmir valley has been returning to normalcy,” he pointed out. “Article 370 was detrimental to the country's unity and integrity and it was rightly scrapped by the Modi government. But these Gupkar alliance leaders talking now about having it back is nothing but an anti-national act which everyone should condemn,” he said. “I am not surprised that parties based in the Valley have come together to form this alliance but what is surprising that the Congress too is providing support to them, he alleged. “A meeting was held at (former J&K Chief Minister) Mehbooba Mufti's residence recently which was attended by two Congress leaders. On November 13, Congress' J&K state unit said they will support the Gupkar alliance," he alleged. "In Delhi, the Congress leaders, however, are saying that they are not with them. These acts expose their doublespeak,” he said. About the District Development Council polls, Khattar said, “Now various statements are being made by the Gupkar alliance leaders before the polls.” Dubbing PAGD as an “unholy alliance”, the chief minister said various statements by their leaders will only embolden the “anti-national elements”. “But people are wise, they will reject this unholy alliance,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/haryana-chief-minister-manohar-lal-khattar-flays-gupkar-alliance-918418.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Marriage between first cousins illegal: Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has said that marriage between first cousins is illegal. The court said that marriage which petitioner man wants to perform with a girl, who is his first cousin, was also per se illegal. "...the submission in the present petition that as and when she (the girl) attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal," the judge said on Thursday while hearing the petition. The assertion came after a 21-year-old man moved the high court against the state of Punjab seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 366A (procuration of minor girl) of the IPC at police station Khanna City-2 in Ludhiana district on August 18. The state counsel, while opposing the bail plea, contended that the girl was a minor and her parents had lodged the FIR as she and the man were first cousins and their fathers were brothers. The man's counsel told Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan that the petitioner had also filed a criminal writ petition, along with the girl, for protection of life and liberty. The court file of the criminal writ petition was summoned during the hearing and as per its memorandum of parties, the girl was stated to be 17 years of age and the petitioner man had filed the petition with the submission that both of them were in a "live-in relationship". It was stated in the petition that the date of birth of the girl was August 2003 and on the date of filing the petition on September 3, 2020, she was of age 17 years and 14 days. Along with the petition, a representation was also annexed, in which the girl had stated that her parents loved their sons but ignored her, therefore, she decided to live with her friend (petitioner) and on that account, she was apprehending that her parents can harass them and disturb the peace of their mind. The court disposed of this petition on September 7. The state was directed to grant them protection if any threat was perceived to the man and the girl. However, the judge made it clear "that this order shall not be taken to protect the petitioners (man and the girl) from legal action for violation of the law, if any, committed by them". The judge, after hearing counsel for the parties in the present petition, said, "I find that in the present petition also, the petitioner has not disclosed about the fact that he is first cousin of the girl and, therefore, the submission in the present petition that as and when she attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal." While opposing the anticipatory bail plea, the state counsel argued: "that the girl was aged about 17 years and is a minor, therefore, her parents have got the FIR registered as the youth and the girl are the first cousins as their fathers are real brothers". "Hence the petitioner has concealed the fact in the petition that they fall in the prohibited 'sapinda' (which prohibits marriage between two individuals if they have a common ancestor) under the Hindu Marriage Act and cannot perform marriage with each other," the state counsel argued. "Once the petitioner and the girl are prohibited from performing marriage with each other, there is no question of their being in any live-in-relationship, which is per se immoral and not acceptable in the society,” it was argued. The counsel for the petitioner has sought time from the court to address arguments and the case was adjourned to January next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/marriage-between-first-cousins-illegal-punjab-and-haryana-hc-918177.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi records cold morning as minimum temp drops to 8.5 degree Celsius||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees celsius on Saturday, a day after the city witnessed its coldest November morning in 14 years. The minimum temperature was four notches below the normal, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the minimum temperature was likely to increase Monday onwards under the influence of a fresh western disturbance. At 7.5 degrees celsius, Delhi on Friday recorded its lowest minimum temperature in the month of November since November 29, 2006, when the city recorded a low of 7.3 degrees celsius. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. "However, for a small area like Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day," Srivastava said. Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees celsius in 2019, 10.5 degrees celsius in 2018 and 7.6 degrees celsius in 2017 in the month of November. The all-time record for the lowest minimum temperature in November is 3.9 degrees celsius recorded on November 28, 1938. Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury, and a similar situation will continue till Saturday. A fresh western disturbance is approaching northwest India on November 23. It is likely to increase the minimum temperature by a few notches, he said. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degrees below the normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-cold-morning-as-minimum-temp-drops-to-85-degree-celsius-918192.html

The Pakistan Army initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing from small arms and intense shelling of mortars along the LoC in the Lam area of Nowshera sector in Rajouri, a defence spokesperson said. “Two soldiers were injured in the firing and one among them a Havaldar ranked succumbed later on,” he said and added the Indian Army retaliated in a befitting manner. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC in J&K frequently. Six civilians and five security forces personnel were killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani army along the LoC in north Kashmir on November 13 while eight Pakistani soldiers were reportedly killed in the retaliatory action by the Indian army. On November 8, seven persons, including three army men, a BSF personnel and three militants were killed as security forces foiled a major infiltration bid near the LoC in Machhil sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Prior to that three army soldiers were killed and four others were injured on October 1 as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire along the LoC in Kupwara and Poonch districts. According to official figures, there has been around 75% jump in ceasefire violations by Pakistan in the first six months of 2020 along the LoC in J&K as compared to the same period last year. The Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating the ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. A number of infiltration attempts have been thwarted by the army along the LoC leading to the killing of several infiltrating militants in recent months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/soldier-killed-as-pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-918207.html

The first Pakistan drone (UAV) was seen flying inside (500 to 700 metres from IB) India's air space near Border Outpost (BOP) Chak Faqira while the second UAV came from Pakistan post, Chaman Khurd, opposite Chak Faqira Police Station in Samba sector. Border Security Forces (BSF), manning the border, fired towards the drones, but reportedly they managed to escape towards Pakistan's side. Sources said that soon after the movement of these drones was reported, a high alert was sounded by the BSF but no untoward trace like that of weapon dropping was seen. “In all likelihood, UAVs were a kind of surveillance drones which may have been sent for some sort of reconnaissance mission by the Pakistan army,” they said. On October 24, a surveillance drone of Chinese make was shot down by Army shortly after it crossed into this side of the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. In June, an attempt to drop weapons through a drone was scuttled by BSF personnel when they shot down a Hexa-copter along the International border in Kathua district. There has been a spurt in the use of drones from the Pakistani side over the past few months to smuggle arms and narcotics. A senior police officer told DH that airdropping of weapons and drugs using drones along the LoC and the IB is a wake-up call to the new emerging threat from Pakistan which is desperate to stir unrest in Kashmir, having failed to counter the abrogation of Article 370. “With India deploying more troops along the border, making it difficult for militants to infiltrate, Pakistan spy agency ISI is now resorting to the use of Chinese drones and it has become a matter of deep concern for the security establishment,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/movement-of-drones-along-jk-border-new-challenge-for-security-agencies-918229.html

They said Pankaj Singh told them that Rawat suffered gunshot injuries when a pistol went off accidentally. However, during the preliminary investigation, the four taken into custody said Rawat had brought the pistol along with him and had given it to another youth, Vinay, who was checking it when it accidentally went off, police said. But during the detailed investigation, it was found that the pistol belonged to Pankaj Singh and it went off during a playful scuffle between friends who had consumed beer, they said. Police said they have recovered the pistol along with cartridges. An FIR in the case is being lodged, they said. The incident took place in the government colony where houses are allotted to legislators, officers and journalists.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-man-killed-in-firing-incident-during-birthday-celebrations-at-samajwadi-party-mlcs-residence-918237.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||India summons Pakistan diplomat, protests over JeM's attempts to carry out major attacks||India on Saturday lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over the latest attempt by the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) – a terrorist organization based in the neighbouring country – to carry out a major attack in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The Chargé d'Affaires of the High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi was summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in South Block, where the senior officials conveyed to him that the Government of India was firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security in the fight against terrorism. New Delhi suspects that the terrorists had come from Pakistan to India to carry out a major attack. The MEA conveyed to the acting head of the High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi, Aftab Hasan Khan, that the initial investigation revealed that the four slain terrorists had been members of the JeM, and proscribed by the United Nations and several countries. New Delhi conveyed to Islamabad its serious concerns at continued terror attacks by the JeM against India. The JeM has been responsible for several attacks in India, including the February 14, 2019 killing of the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir. “The huge cache of arms, ammunition and explosive material indicate detailed planning for a major attack to destabilise the peace and security in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, in particular, to derail the ongoing democratic exercise of conduct of local District Development Council elections,” the MEA stated in a press release issued on Saturday. The senior officials of Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division of the MEA conveyed to Khan that the JeM’s plan for a major attack was only prevented from happening by the alertness of the security forces of India. They told Islamabad’s envoy to New Delhi that Pakistan must desist from its policy of supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from its territory and dismantle the terror infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries, including India. “India reiterated its long-standing demand that Pakistan fulfil its international obligations and bilateral commitments to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the MEA, said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/india-summons-pakistan-diplomat-protests-over-jems-attempts-to-carry-out-major-attacks-918242.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||India's first moss garden comes up near Nainital||India's first moss garden has been developed at Khurpatal in Nainital district, officials said on Saturday.  Approved in July last year under the CAMPA scheme by the Research Advisory Committee of Uttarakhand Forest Department, the moss garden, the first in the country, was inaugurated on Friday by renowned water conservation activist Rajendra Singh, Chief Conservator of Forest Sanjiv Chaturvedi said. The main aim behind developing the garden was to conserve the various species of moss and other bryophytes and to make people aware of its significance in the environment besides creating a recreation centre for tourists, Chaturvedi who heads the research wing of the state forest department, said. Moss Garden, Khurpatal houses around 30 different species of moss and certain other bryophyte species.  Two of the moss species found here i.e. Hyophila involuta (Cement Moss) and Brachythecium Buchanani figure in International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list, Chaturvedi said.  It has a moss trail of 1.2 km on which different moss species and scientific information about them is displayed, he said. It has an interpretation centre in which different aspects of moss are displayed through models including a First World War painting showing use of Sphagnum moss as a dressing for wounds as it absorbs liquids about three times more quickly than cotton, is cooler, softer, and less irritating than cotton, besides having antiseptic properties.  It also produces sterile environment by keeping the pH level around wounds low and thus inhibiting the growth of bacteria, the CCF said. The garden also boasts of a dinosaur model showing existence of moss since the Jurassic era, ornaments made of live moss which are very popular in Japan, moss terrarium depicting live moss ecosystem and nest of birds using moss for temperature regulation and antibacterial purposes. Poems and caricatures related to moss are also displayed at the garden. Moss are one of the most ancient flora on the planet, existing since Jurassic era.  They are the first plants to grow on rocky land and by breaking down the rocks and the soil. They help create a suitable environment for other plants to grow. Surfaces such as bare rock and thick volcanic ash are initially barren, nutrient-poor and often exposed to the sun and wind. Such surfaces are inimical to the growth of seeds of vascular plants but are readily colonized by moss species, Chaturvedi said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/indias-first-moss-garden-comes-up-near-nainital-918250.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi High Court grants interim bail to murder accused to get married||The Delhi High Court has granted interim bail to a murder accused, who is facing prosecution in various criminal cases, to get married and register land in his wife's name. The high court granted the relief to the accused, who is an alleged member of the notorious Rajesh Bawania gang, and said he shall be released on interim bail on November 23 and will have to surrender on or before November 27. Accused Shekhar is getting married to the widow of his cousin on November 25. Facing prosecution in various criminal cases in Haryana and Delhi, the accused was asked to furnish a personal bond of Rs 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount. Justice Vibhu Bakhru directed that the accused shall proceed directly to his village, Bhupania, in Haryana and confine himself there, and that he shall not move out of the place except for the limited purpose of registering the agricultural land in favour of his wife. Shekhar shall surrender to the jail authorities immediately on his return and not visit any other place, and he shall not contact any of the witnesses or family members of the victim, either directly or indirectly, the high court said. Advocate Amit Sahni, who is representing Shekhar, had filed the interim bail plea. "It is a prevalent custom in the community of the applicant (Shekhar) that in case one brother expires leaving behind a child, the widow (of the deceased brother) is then married to the unmarried brother/cousin in the same family," Sahni submitted. On a query raised by the court as to how the accused intends to support his proposed wife, the counsel said Shekhar owned agricultural land, which would be transferred to his wife at the time of his marriage. The interim bail plea was opposed by the prosecutor, who contended that he belonged to the notorious Rajesh Bawania gang and was involved in several cases under the Arms Act and on murder and attempt to murder charges under the IPC in various states, including Delhi and Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-high-court-grants-interim-bail-to-murder-accused-to-get-married-918251.html

I have said that earlier also,” he said. Singh lauded the healthcare and frontline workers of Punjab for their “excellent” work in handling the pandemic in the state. He assured full preparedness by his government to augment healthcare facilities to prepare for a possible second wave of the pandemic. Singh said while nobody knew when the second wave of infection would strike Punjab, the experience of the NCR and other states and regions showed it was almost certain. The chief minister expressed confidence that the health department will once again rise to the occasion to meet any challenge, a government release issued here said. It was the duty of the state government to support the healthcare and other frontline workers, many of whom have got infected and some have even lost their lives to Covid-19, Singh said. He also exhorted the people to actively help the state in the fight against the pandemic by strictly following all safety norms. “Mask hi vaccine hai” (mask is the vaccine), as a resolve for the next few months till a vaccine against infection finally is available, Singh said. The chief minister also launched 107 health and wellness centres to boost the healthcare infrastructure in the state and to provide health services to patients at their doorsteps in both rural and urban areas. He said these new centers would take the state's health infrastructure to a new level of efficacy amid the pandemic. Of the 3,049 centres planned in the state, 2,046 were now operational and 800 more would become operational in the next two months, with the remaining to be opened in 2021, Singh said. He said the state government was focused on strengthening healthcare facilities, especially levels two and three, with the aim to save lives through early testing and treatment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-ready-to-help-delhi-government-to-fight-covid-crisis-says-cm-singh-918263.html

The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) also released a report on the state of investigation into the case. The organisation demanded security for the family and their rehabilitation through the Nirbhaya fund. The whole family is in a way under house arrest conditions and their normal social life has been cut off, PUCL members Kamal Singh, Farman Naqvi, Alok, Shashikant and K B Maurya told reporters here. The victim’s family members fear for their lives after the CRPF protection is withdrawn, they said. The PUCL members said cases must be lodged against officials for a hurried cremation of the victim. Action should be taken against District Magistrate Praveen Kumar, SP Vikram Veer and the area SHO in this regard, they said. The 19-year-old Dalit woman died at a Delhi hospital a fortnight after her alleged rape by four men from her village in Hathras district on September 14. She was cremated in the middle of the night in her village. Her family members claimed that the cremation, which took place well past midnight, was without their consent and they were not allowed to bring home the body one last time. The PUCL members said action should also be taken against those responsible for “defaming” the woman’s family. They demanded that cases lodged for the alleged bid to incite violence in the name of the incident should be brought under the ongoing CBI investigation. Currently, these cases are being probed by the state STF, they said. Alok and Farman Naqvi alleged that the name of the Popular Front of India (PFI) has been dragged into the controversy to create a Hindu-Muslim chasm and divert attention. Kamal Singh said the PFI is not on the list of banned organisations but Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath calls it an extremist body. If that is so, then why a ban has not been imposed against it, he asked. Four people, said to be members of the PFI, were arrested in Mathura while on their way to Hathras last months. The Uttar Pradesh police had said the four, including a journalist, had links with the Popular Front of India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hathras-rape-victims-kin-living-in-conditions-akin-to-house-arrest-civil-rights-body-918290.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Security being used as a pretext to impede and customize democracy in J&K: Farooq Abdullah||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and president of newly cobbled up People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) Farooq Abdullah on Saturday objected to the treatment meted out to the amalgam candidates, saying security is being used as a pretext to impede and customize democracy in the Union Territory. In a two-page letter to J-K Election Commissioner K K Sharma, Abdullah, who is at present a Lok Sabha member from Srinagar, said providing security to a select few and literally interning the rest is a gross interference in democracy. "I am taking the liberty of writing to you about the upcoming DDC elections. A strange and a unique feature has come to the fore. Candidates put up by the PAGD are immediately whisked away to 'secure locations' in the name of security and confined to those 'secure locations'. They are not allowed to canvass, they are completely out of touch with those from whom they are supposed to seek votes," Abdullah said in the letter. He said the parties part of the PAGD have been in power in the past and have had the opportunity to head and run the government and are aware of the challenges posed in the realm of security in a place beset by violence. "These challenges are not new, but have been painfully persisting for the last three decades. But, the government had structures in place which ensured security for all contestants irrespective of the ideology they espoused or the parties they represented," he said. The Lok Sabha MP said the current state of affairs in the realm of security is "blatantly oriented" towards providing security to a select few and confining others. "This comes across more as an attempt to interfere in the democratic process than any real concern for the wellbeing of the contestants. Security cannot and should not be used as a tool or an excuse to interfere in democratic processes," he said. Asserting that the evolution of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir is distinctive compared to any other part of the country, Abdullah said this evolution is a "bloodied journey", soaked in the blood of thousands of political workers who have laid down their lives for the sake of democracy. "It is a desecration of those sacrifices when the very conflict that consumed their lives is used as an alibi to customize democracy. Democracy is still in a state of fragility in Jammu and Kashmir. "Governments come and go. No government has the right to alter the institutional foundations of democracy in J-K, nourished by the sacrifices of thousands of political workers," the letter read. He said while security is a challenge and it is for the government of the day to counter that challenge in a manner which is fair and transparent, "providing security to a select few and literally interning the rest is a gross interference in democracy". The PAGD president's letter to the State Election Commissioner comes in the backdrop of allegations of major political parties in the valley, including the NC and the PDP, of not having a level-playing field for the elections. The parties have accused the administration of locking up their candidates in accommodations at several places and not allowing them to campaign.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/security-being-used-as-a-pretext-to-impede-and-customize-democracy-in-jk-farooq-abdullah-918292.html

The decision was announced after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh held a meeting with leaders of 31 farmers’ organisations, who had blocked rail traffic since September 24, pushing the state on the brink of an economic crisis as thermal power plants were shut due to non-availability of coal. “Happy to share that starting 23rd Nov night, Kisan Unions have decided to end rail blockades for 15 days. I welcome this step since it will restore normalcy to our economy. I urge Central Government to resume rail services to Punjab forthwith,” Singh said after a meeting with farmers’ leaders in Chandigarh. Amid pleas from the state government and the industry, farmers’ organisations had shifted their protests from railway tracks to adjacent vacant land, allowing resumption of traffic for two days. However, Railway Board had suspended services again demanding that the protestors clear railway land and assurances of safety from the state government. The Punjab government had claimed that the industry in the state had suffered losses to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. “If the centre does not resolve our issues, we will block railway tracks again,” Buta Singh Shadipur, President, Bharti Kisan Manch, told the media in Chandigarh. Farmers in Punjab had been agitating against the three farm sector reforms passed by Parliament on September 24. The Congress-led Punjab government too shared the view that the farm laws were against the interest of the farmers. The Punjab government had ensured passage of four laws to negate the impact of the Centre’s farm sector reforms, which it claimed would end the minimum support price regime and APMC markets. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accused the Congress of misleading the farmers and asserted that the new laws passed by Parliament would not end MSP or APMC markets.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/punjab-farmers-end-two-month-rail-roko-for-15-days-passenger-goods-trains-to-resume-movement-918295.html

The central probe agency covered a total of seven locations-- six in Srinagar and one in Anantnag district-- as part of the searches conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED said it raided Mohd Ibrahim Dar, Murtaza Enterprises, Azad Agro Traders, M & M Cottage Industries and Mohd Sultan Teli who are "involved" in the hospitality and agro-based industries, civil construction and real estate businesses. "The searches resulted in the recovery of evidence of money laundering as the bank accounts have been found to be used for routing suspicious transactions," it said. The ED is probing the case after studying an earlier FIR filed by the CID of the UT Police in Srinagar against officials of J&K Bank, unidentified public servants, private persons and others for suspicious transactions in various bank accounts. Certain bank officials, in connivance with these public servants, deliberately omitted to raise the alerts as required under anti-money laundering norms, the ED said quoting the CID FIR. The central probe agency said its probe "so far has revealed that the transactions in many of these bank accounts maintained with J&K Bank were not genuine and these accounts were utilised for the purpose of laundering." ED sleuths are recording the statement of the people covered in the searches "to unravel the source of huge credits and debits in their accounts". "Recovered incriminating documents and soft data are also being analysed," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ed-raids-multiple-locations-in-kashmir-in-jk-bank-money-laundering-case-918300.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Uttar Pradesh Assembly bypolls turns reality check for Congress||A dismal performance in the recently concluded bypolls on seven Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh has forced the Congress to redraw its electoral strategy in the state. The grand old party, which had been nurturing hopes to not only replace the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BSP as the main opposition party in the state but also grab a seat or two, drew a blank in the bypolls. The only solace for the party was that it managed to finish runners up on two of the six seats it had contested. Its nominees Arti Bajpai and Kripa Shankar finished second on Bangarmau and Ghatampur Assembly seats surprising the political observers here. On the remaining four, the party candidates, however, lost their security deposits. The bypolls results came as a reality check for the party, which had undergone a major rejig a few months back. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was also in-charge of the state, had herself chosen the party candidates. Although several senior Congress leaders wanted the party to 're-visit' its electoral strategy, state party president Ajai Kumar Lallu said that he was 'satisfied' with the performance of the party in the bypolls. "We finished second on two seats and third on another....our vote percentage also increased," Lallu said. State Congress sources, however, said that a weak organisation and lack of winnable candidates were largely responsible for the poor performance of the party. "Despite all efforts by Priyankaji, we have not been able to strengthen the party at the grassroots level...we need to focus on it if we want to challenge the BJP in the next Assembly polls," said a senior state Congress leader here. The next Assembly polls in UP are due in little more than a year's time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-assembly-bypolls-turns-reality-check-for-congress-918342.html

"Analysis of cases emerging from entertainment areas, markets, workplaces and metro-like services should be immediately conducted to identify possible clusters and immediate containment measures should be initiated," stated the order issued last week. It stated that all cases of symptomatic negatives of rapid antigen tests should be re-tested with follow-up RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for Covid-19 testing. "Patients under home isolation should be regularly evaluated and physically visited by health teams to ensure proper adherence to isolation standards," the order stated said. According to the order, district authorities should identify more human resource such as civil defence volunteers and municipal sanitary inspectors and deploy them to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour. The Delhi government on Friday issued a notification, saying that spitting and consumption of tobacco in public places, violation of Covid-19 quarantine rules, not wearing of masks and not maintaining social distancing would attract a fine of Rs 2,000. The national capital recorded 6,608 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day taking the infection tally on Friday to over 5.17 lakh, while 118 more fatalities during the same period pushed the death toll to 8,159. The positivity rate was 10.59 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/visit-patients-under-home-isolation-ensure-they-follow-isolation-norms-delhi-govt-to-officials-918348.html

The national award-winning actor, who quit Bollywood in 2019, took to Instagram to make the request. "Hello everyone!! I want to just take a moment to thank each of you for the constant love and kindness you have showered me with. Y'all have been a constant source of love and strength, thank you for being there to support me through everything (sic)," she wrote. She said it was because of the care and consideration that all her fans have always shown that she had a little favour to ask from all of them. "I request you to please take down my pictures from your accounts and ask other fan pages to do the same," she added. Zaira, however, acknowledged that it was impossible to get her pictures removed from the internet. "It's obviously IMPOSSIBLE to get them off the internet but the least I can do is request your pages not to continue sharing them. I hope you could help and support me through this just like you've supported me through everything. "I'm trying to start a new chapter in my life and I could really benefit from your cooperation -- (like a lot!!). Thank you for being a part of my journey (sic),” she wrote. Last year, the actor announced her "disassociation" from acting, saying she was not happy with the line of work as it interfered with her faith and religion. Zaira, who was in her early teens when she appeared in "Dangal" opposite Aamir Khan, also worked in his 2017 production venture "Secret Superstar". Her last film was "The Sky Is Pink", opposite Priyanka Chopra and Farhan Akhtar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/take-down-my-pictures-from-your-social-media-accounts-zaira-wasim-request-fans-918396.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Soldier killed, three injured in Pakistani firing along LoC in Jammu and Kashmir||A havaldar in the Indian Army was killed and three others, including two women, were injured on Saturday as Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing on forward posts and villages in different sectors along the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. The casualties came barely a week after multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops along the LoC in north Kashmir left 11 people, including five security personnel, dead on November 13. Havaldar Patil Sangram Shivaji, who was manning a forward post, was critically injured in the Pakistani firing in the Lam area of Rajouri district's Nowshera sector around 1 am, the officials said, adding he later succumbed to injuries. Another soldier also sustained injuries and is currently undergoing treatment at a military hospital, they said. The officials said the Indian Army retaliated effectively to silence the Pakistani guns, and the cross-border firing between the two sides continued for quite some time. Taking to Twitter, the general officer commanding (GOC) of the Jammu-based White Knight Corps and all other ranks saluted the soldier and offered their condolences to his family. In a statement, a defence spokesman said Havaldar Shivaji, a resident of Nigave village of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, was a brave, highly motivated and sincere soldier. "The nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty," he said. Both the injured were evacuated to hospital amid shelling which started around 5.50 pm, the officials said, adding there were also firing in Malti and Dallan sectors in Poonch district. The defence spokesman said Pakistan also fired small arms and mortars in the Nowshera sector of Rajouri about 6 pm, prompting retaliation by the Indian army. The cross-border firing was going on when last reports were received, he said. The officials said Pakistani Rangers also resorted to unprovoked firing along the IB in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district. The firing on Satpal, Manyari, Ladwal and Karol Krishna border outpost areas started around 10 pm on Friday, prompting strong and effective retaliation by the Border Security Force, the officials said. Cross-border skirmishes continued till 5.25 am on Saturday, and there was no report of any casualty or damage on the Indian side, they added. Meanwhile, a rusted grenade was found by a police party during patrolling in the industrial area in Poonch district which was later defused by the experts of bomb disposal squad, the officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/soldier-killed-three-injured-in-pakistani-firing-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmir-918397.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality improves slightly but remains 'poor'||Delhi's air quality improved marginally on Saturday due to favourable wind speed, but remained in the "poor" category. Government agencies said that the air quality index (AQI) is likely to remain in the "moderate" to "poor" category on Sunday.  The city's 24-hour average AQI was 251 on Saturday. It was 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said that Delhi-NCR air quality is likely to remain in the "moderate" to "poor" category on Sunday. The predominant surface wind direction is likely to be northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 12 kmph on Sunday, it said. The central agency said that the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the "very poor" category between Tuesday and Friday as "unfavourable meteorological conditions" are predicted during that period. Around 1,264 farm fire counts were observed in Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Friday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR. Stubble burning accounted for 13 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Saturday. It was 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution could have been much higher on Saturday had there been calm winds.  The minimum temperature settled at 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday. It was 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday – the lowest in the month of November in 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 13,000 m2/s on Saturday and is likely to be 6,000 m2/s on Sunday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-improves-slightly-but-remains-poor-918398.html

The victim, Nisha Singhal's eight-year-old daughter and four-year-old son too were injured after being attacked with a knife by the accused identified as Shubham Pathak, they said. Pathak, who had robbed Singhal's house, was caught following an encounter at Kalindi Vihar area. He was shot in the leg, a police officer said, adding that the stolen cash and jewellery was seized from him. According to police, Pathak gained entry into Singhal's house in Kaveri Kunj Colony in Kamanagar on the pretext of recharging a TV set top box. He was identified after the police analysed footage retrieved from a CCTV camera installed in front of the house. Inspector General of Police A Satish Ganesh said that immediately after the murder, police teams were formed to crack the case and Pathak was arrested. Prima facie, it appears that the accused has executed the murder. Police is collecting evidence against him and legal action will be taken, an officer said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/agra-doctor-killed-inside-home-kids-injured-1-held-918405.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||BJP 'non-entity' in Punjab: Amarinder Singh||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday dismissed the BJP as a “non-entity” in the state and said it will not be able to win a single seat without an alliance partner in the 2022 assembly elections. During a function organised by a private TV channel here, the chief minister said the BJP is welcome to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in the state though the party would not be able to win a single seat without an alliance partner. BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh earlier this week had said that his party had started preparations on a war footing to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in Punjab. Nearly two months ago, the Shiromani Akali Dal, an old ally of the BJP, had quit the NDA over the Centre's farm laws. As per the seat-sharing formula which existed when the BJP and the SAD, the saffron party used to field its candidates on three of the 13 parliamentary seats and 23 of 117 assembly segments in Punjab. The rest were kept for the SAD. The Congress has, in fact, no challenge in Punjab, with even the Akalis and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) posing no threat, Amarinder Singh said, adding that none of the parties ever "talked about anything positive in the interest of the state". With elections in the state still around 18 months away, it is not possible to say which issue will dominate, Amarinder Singh said in a statement. The CM expressed hope that the Centre will resolve farmers' grievances soon. Farmers want the minimum support price to remain and the Government of India should take steps to ensure that, he said. The chief minister reiterated that corporates are welcome to buy foodgrain in Punjab as long as they follow the existing marketing system, built on close ties between farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents). He rejected the BJP charge that the Congress and other parties are misguiding farmers, pointing out that the entire Vidhan Sabha in Punjab had unanimously rejected the farm laws though some parties had subsequently made a “U-turn” due to political compulsions. On the issue of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elections, the chief minister said he had been demanding it for long but the Akalis did not want polls to the body, which they had been "using" for their own political gains. The CM said his government will not allow the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into his state without permission while citing the central investigating agency's “poor” track record in the Bargari sacrilege case. Pointing out that eight states, including Punjab, had withdrawn approval to the agency to enter without prior permission, the CM said the CBI is being increasingly “used to play politics”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-non-entity-in-punjab-amarinder-singh-918409.html
21-11-2020||North and Central||Minimum temps below normal in most parts of north India; Delhi record low of 8.5 deg C||Minimum temperatures in most parts of northern India remained below normal on Saturday with the meteorological department predicting a rise in night temperatures on Monday due to a western disturbance approaching the northwest part of the country. The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, a day after the city witnessed its coldest November morning in 14 years, while the air quality remained in the "poor" category recording a 24-hour average AQI of 251. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The minimum temperature was four notches below the normal, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the minimum temperature in Delhi was likely to increase Monday onwards under the influence of a fresh western disturbance. At 7.5 degrees Celsius, Delhi on Friday recorded its lowest minimum temperature in the month of November since November 29, 2006, when the city recorded a low of 7.3 degrees Celsius. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury, and a similar situation will continue till Saturday. A fresh western disturbance is approaching northwest India on November 23. It is likely to increase the minimum temperature by a few notches, he said. Minimum temperatures dipped across parts of Rajasthan on Saturday with Churu being the coldest in the plains at 5.5 degrees Celsius. The night temperature in Mount Abu, the sole hill station in the state, was 1 degree Celsius. Sikar, Pilani, Ajmer, Ganganagar, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaipur recorded their respective minimums at 6.5 degrees Celsius, 7.9 degrees Celsius, 9.5 degrees Celsius, 10.3 degrees Celsius, 11 degrees Celsius, 11.4 degrees Celsius and 11.6 degrees Celsius respectively. The night temperature was 12 degrees Celsius in Jaisalmer and 12.7 degrees Celsius in Barmer, according to the meteorological department here. The maximum and minimum temperatures stayed below normal levels in Punjab and Haryana, with the weather department predicting dry weather in the two states for the next couple of days. Chandigarh, the joint capital of the two states, recorded a high of 22.2 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. In Punjab, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded maximum temperatures at 22.2 degrees Celsius, 21.8 degrees Celsius and 23.3 degrees Celsius respectively, up to five degrees below normal. In Haryana, Ambala recorded a high of 21.9 degrees Celsius, five notches below the normal, while Hisar's maximum was 23 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal. Narnaul's maximum was 26.2 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperatures too hovered between 1 to 4 degrees below the normal at most places in the two states. The weather was dry in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday and is likely to remain so for the next three days. Cold conditions continued in Himachal Pradesh with the meteorological department predicting rain and snowfall in the state in the next few days. Manali, Keylong and Kalpa shivered at sub-zero temperatures while Shimla recorded a low of 5.1 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in Manali of Kullu district was minus one degree Celsius. Tribal district Lahaul and Spiti's administrative centre Keylong was recorded the coldest place in Himachal Pradesh at minus 3.8 degrees Celsius. Kinnaur's Kalpa recorded a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Kufri and Dalhousie were 3.4 degrees Celsius and 3.7 degrees Celsius, respectively.  Rain is likely in the mid hills and snowfall in high hills from November 22 to 25. Rainfall is also likely in isolated places of plains and low hills of the state on November 23. In West Bengal, the weatherman has forecast light to moderate rainfall in southern districts till Sunday as Kolkata experienced rainfall on Saturday morning, bringing down day temperatures considerably. Kolkata received 22 mm rainfall till 8.30 am. The minimum temperature, which was around 22 degrees Celsius on Friday, is likely to fall a few notches in the coming few days. Under the influence of a cyclonic circulation over equatorial Indian Ocean and adjoining Southeast Bay of Bengal, a low pressure area has formed over Equatorial Indian Ocean and adjoining central parts of South Bay of Bengal, the IMD said. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over Southwest Bay of Bengal during next 48 hours and reach near Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coast on November 25 bringing rain and thunderstorm in the region, the weatherman said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/minimum-temps-below-normal-in-most-parts-of-north-india-delhi-record-low-of-85-deg-c-918425.html

21-11-2020||North and Central||Will resume Punjab train services at earliest: Railways||The Railways said on Saturday it would soon resume goods and passenger train services in Punjab following the state government's communication that the tracks were clear for operations and hours after the protesting farmers decided to allow the services to operate. Goods trains have not entered Punjab for nearly two months, except for two days in October, due to the rail blockade by farmers over the contentious farm laws, leading to a shortage of essential goods, including fertilisers needed for sowing wheat and coal supplies for thermal plants. Sources indicated that the goods and passenger train operations would begin from Tuesday. "Railways has received communication from Government of Punjab for the resumption of both goods and passenger train services. It has been informed that tracks are now clear for train operations," the ministry tweeted. "Railways will take steps towards restoration of train services in Punjab at the earliest after undertaking necessary maintenance checks and completing other laid down protocols," it added. Earlier, the farmer bodies protesting against the Centre's farm laws decided to lift their blockade of trains for 15 days from Monday, in a move to bring relief to the state facing an acute shortage of essential supplies. However, they said the tracks would again be blocked if the government failed to resolve their issues. The train services have remained suspended in the state since September 24, when farmers launched their rail blockade against the Centre's recently-enacted agriculture-related laws. The deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Railways continued after the national transporter rejected a proposal by the protesters that only freight trains would be allowed to run in the state. The Railways' freight loading suffered losses due to cancellations of trains and many others -- carrying essentials for Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir -- getting stranded on the outskirts of Punjab. The Railways has said it suffered a loss of Rs 2,220 crore, including Rs 67 crore in passenger revenue, due to the blockade. The protests have affected 3,850 freight trains that could not be loaded. As many as 2,352 passenger trains have been cancelled or diverted so far. The Northern Railway, which caters to the region, incurred a revenue loss of Rs 891 crore, with an average daily loss of Rs 14.85 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/will-resume-punjab-train-services-at-earliest-railways-918445.html
21-11-2020||Opinion||Yes, your kids can play outside all winter||Every morning, between 9 and 10 a.m., my three-year-old hits his “go outside” point. It’s the moment when his energy overflows into the pull-the-dog’s-tail-and-get-a-timeout territory. If my husband and I can get his shoes on and shove him out the door in time, he transforms into an angel, running sprints through the park and digging in the dirt without a trace of that little miscreant. He’s happy, we’re happy. Our dog breathes a sigh a relief. In the age of Covid-19, getting outside has become even more essential as an antidote to lockdowns and as one of the safest ways to have play dates. And it’ll remain my No. 1 activity as this fall turns into winter. So if you’re staring down the barrel of the impending winter with dread, visions of cabin-fever-induced meltdowns dancing in your head, fear not. Yes, your kids can play outside in foul weather. And what’s more, they’ll love it. Don’t take my word for it. I tapped parents who endure the world’s harshest weather for a living to get their secrets around keeping kids comfortable and happy outdoors year-round. Only suitable clothing Start by embracing British guidebook writer Alfred Wainwright’s point of view: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing.” You know layering is the key to trapping body heat and keeping the elements out, but there’s more to it than just slipping a child into a puffy jacket and heading out the door. “Make sure the hands, head, heart and feet are covered; out of those, the feet are probably the most important thing,” said Pete Ripmaster, who won the 2018 Iditarod Trail Invitational 1000 on foot (a 1,000-mile winter ultramarathon that traces the route of the eponymous sledge dog race across Alaska). Based in Asheville, North Carolina, he started winter backpacking in the Great Smoky Mountains with his daughters, now 9 and 11, when the youngest was 5. Dry feet are warm feet, so think waterproof insulated boots or rubber boots paired with fleece or wool liners, plus cozy wool or synthetic socks (not cotton, which doesn’t wick moisture away from the skin and takes ages to dry). Speaking of socks: Pack an extra pair for each kid. Little hands are also prone to feeling cold quickly, said Jackson, Wyoming, resident Kit DesLauriers, the first person to ski down the tallest mountain on every continent (the Seven Summits) and a mom who took her daughter's rafting in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when they were 5 and 7 (they’re now 11 and 12). “I’ve learned from big winter expeditions that if my hands or feet are cold, I can ask for help — I’ve put my feet on my partner’s stomach,” she said. So when one of her daughters feels the chill, “you get to put your hands on mommy’s belly. You laugh about it, have a connection, and make it fun.” Mittens beat gloves for warmth; go for a pair with a waterproof outer layer, not fleece or acrylic that can soak through to the fingers and bring an end to any outing quickly. And mind the gaps, said Sune Tamm. The Reykjavik, Iceland-based father of a 2-year-old daughter has spent four years leading winter camping and mountaineering trips for scientists in Antarctica. “The main thing is, I make sure to seal the edges,” he said. Dress kids in gauntlet-style gloves or mittens that cinch over their jacket’s cuffs, and keep cold winds from sneaking down their necks with a gaiter. A jacket overlapping with bib snow pants will be warmer than shorter layers that can gape open when kids are off and moving. What if your child isn’t walking yet? Tamm strolled through blizzards when his daughter was an infant by popping her in a chest carrier, wrapping a blanket around her legs and zipping her inside his extra-large winter coat. The art of distraction A free-roaming kid is generally a happy kid, but whining will still happen. The key to keeping the happy vibes rolling in winter is a distraction, said Bekah Quirin, head of the outdoor education program Valley Forest School in Roanoke, Virginia, and a mom who hiked the entire Appalachian Trail with her daughter starting when she was 12 months old. “Things that keep them moving are the best distractions,” she said. “The more they move, the more they’ll stay warm.” Go out prepped with a few games in mind, like Red Light Green Light, tag or a scavenger hunt. And keep it simple: Kids aren’t likely to listen to complicated instructions while standing around in the cold. Ripmaster sets up a community treasure hunt for his kids, tipping off neighbours ahead of time that his daughters will be knocking on the door in search of, say, a pink paper clip. (This year, arrange for a distanced handoff.) “They’re on a mission,” he said. “By the end of the hunt, they might have hiked 2 1/2 miles, but they’re not thinking, ‘Oh, I have to go on a hike with Mom and Dad.’ All they care about is the next box they need to check.” He also takes his family on orienteering trips to a nearby park, where the kids practise using a map and compass to navigate from checkpoint to checkpoint. Good old snowman-building, sledding and snowball fights are classics for a reason, too. Even when the ground is bare, DesLauriers has set up a mini-igloo-building project for her kids by freezing ice blocks in old milk cartons. And Ripmaster swears by the novelty of cooking and eating outdoors, whether by campfire or camping stove. “Making a warm meal is always really rewarding in the cold,” he said. “We do a lot of burritos, potatoes and beans — things that are easy to make.” A just-add-hot-water dehydrated camping meal is even easier. And don’t forget the s’mores. Feed the beasts Keeping snacks on hand is doubly important in winter, as the effort of slogging through snow and simply being in the cold requires extra energy, said Eric Larsen, “and kids are getting dehydrated faster than you are.” Larsen — who lives in Crested Butte, Colorado, has skied to both the North and South Poles, and takes his 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son winter camping and mountain biking — chooses snacks based on how likely they are to freeze. No granola bars, heavy energy bars or fruit pouches, all of which tend to turn into bricks after a couple of hours. Instead, he goes for fig bars, freeze-dried fruit, trail mix, fruit snacks, “and I’m not opposed to throwing in treats, like potato chips.” As for hydration, sources agree that a thermos full of something hot is the way to go. Besides encouraging kids to drink up (hello, hot cocoa) and helping little ones feel warmer, several pros note the cozy power of a drink-based ritual. “It adds an element of feeling comfortable in the outdoors,” said DesLauriers, who packs tea for three on skiing outings. “Why not turn it into a little tea party?” Tamm embraces an outdoor version of the Swedish tradition of <em>fika, </em>a mindful break to share coffee or tea with others. “I always bring a blanket that’s water-resistant on the bottom and lay that out,” he said. For his daughter, he makes “tea — 5% honey-ginger tea and 95% milk — and we make a moment out of it.” Getting out the door Even the children of people who have skied from the summit of Mount Everest occasionally balk at leaving the couch in winter. DesLauriers convinced her young daughters to go to ski school by zipping each one’s favorite stuffed animal into her coat with its head sticking out at the neck. Now that they’re older, inviting a friend along provides plenty of incentive to get out. Or tell the kids to try playing outdoors for just 10 minutes: “What we see is 10 turns into 20, which turns into 30,” said Larsen. And it’s always worthwhile to make the effort. “My daughter is so much happier when she’s outside,” said Tamm. “She comes in windblown and tired, and she sleeps better.” There’s also the character-building benefits of braving a potentially uncomfortable situation, said DesLauriers. Getting out “teaches us a lesson in what we’re able to handle. Don’t shy away — if it feels like a stretch, challenge your perception.” So start small and build up to longer and longer outings. Besides, if you find yourself with a true meltdown on your hands, you can — and should — head back inside and try again tomorrow. “You don’t want to create such a negative experience that the kids don’t want to go out again,” said Quirin. “It’s OK for kids to be uncomfortable, but you don’t want them to be miserable.” This might be a winter unlike any other. But as long as we can get out and play, I know we’ll make it through. Better than that — I hope my son remembers this winter as one filled with rosy cheeks, hot cocoa breaks, snow forts and so much fun.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/yes-your-kids-can-play-outside-all-winter-918422.html
21-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Act your age||“You are already fifteen years old, going on sixteen. Be more responsible. Act your age. Your teacher e-mails me saying you are very poor in studies and that you do not submit home assignments before the deadline. You are not a child any more. Act your age.” My neighbour went on and on, shouting at her son at the top of her voice. Whenever she repeated the phrase ‘act your age,’ it felt like a slap on my face. I looked into the mirror that hung in front of me. Am I ‘acting’ my age? In a short answer, ‘No!’, screamed my jet black hair. I already had four grandchildren yet I was hopelessly trying to cover up my grey hair. Enlightenment dawned suddenly, after overhearing the choice words the mother had for her child, and I decided to act my age.  Hair dye bottle and other paraphernalia were handed over to the maid who was just two grandchildren old. The transition from jet black to grey was not smooth and had its awkward moments. Grey was growing millimetre by millimetre from the roots easing out the jet black gradually, making me look funny. Thankfully, the process ended and I shone with a rich silvery crown on my head. There were delectable moments when the pharmacist gave a discount on medicines unasked. In an overcrowded public transport, I was respectfully offered a seat. During the elections, I  was led to the booth and got to jump the serpentine queue. The rosy days, however, didn’t last long.  Our gardener who had called me aunty all along suddenly changed his opinion and called me ‘ajji’ (grandmother), prompting the whole neighbourhood to call me ‘ajji; much to my chagrin. As I was rolling in self-pity, the phone rang. It was the ninety-five-year-old aunty who was my mother’s schoolmate. Stone-deaf she was now shouting into the phone. “Hudugi (young girl)! How are you? Have you forgotten this old woman?” She went on and on punctuating each sentence with ‘hudugi’. My heart started singing. As they say, even darkest of clouds have silver lining.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/act-your-age-918141.html
21-11-2020||Second Edit||Vertical growth part of the solution||In the mid-80s, the then Karnataka Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde had envisioned a paradigm of vertical, rather than horizontal, growth for Bengaluru to ease the pressure on shrinking space and to protect the green belt on the city’s outskirts. Now, nearly four decades hence, after much of the damage has already been done, the government has finally notified draft rules that facilitate high-rise buildings around the metro rail corridor and the proposed peripheral ring road. Citizens will now be able to purchase at a special cost premium floor area ratio (FAR) which will enable them to undertake construction over and above what is currently permitted. FAR is calculated based on the dimension of the site and the road adjoining it. Currently, premium FAR is being sold only by Mangaluru City Corporation. According to the draft rules, which are applicable to the entire state, 50% of the charges thus collected should be utilised for acquisition of land for roads and the remaining for infrastructure development. As the population rises while the total habitable area available does not expand, it becomes imperative to envisage vertical development of our cities to meet the ever-growing demand for land. Building upward rather than outward will help contain a large amount of people in a smaller space, reducing the need to encroach upon the green cover bordering the city. Restrictive building laws are being relaxed across the world to ensure optimum land use. The availability of additional construction area could bring down real estate costs and make housing more affordable in Bengaluru. The Transit Oriented Development (TOD) spelt out in the plan will hopefully ease the traffic woes in many parts of the city as concentrated development is envisaged only around the mass rapid transit corridor, which will encourage use of metro rail, reducing the load on roads. The pressure on utility agencies to expand infrastructure, too, will be contained. If properly implemented, the new FAR guidelines can prove beneficial to the city, so long as it is not misused by the real estate and construction industries to make windfall gains and thereby worsen life in an already crumbling city. The scheme must be strictly confined to areas along the metro lines and the peripheral ring road. At the same time, government must pursue with greater vigour the idea of decongesting Bengaluru by developing towns and cities around it, an idea that hasn’t really taken off so far but one that holds potential to improve both sustainability and quality of life as well as productivity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/vertical-growth-part-of-the-solution-918139.html
21-11-2020||South||Oldest known human-made nanostructures discovered in Tamil Nadu||Scientists have discovered the oldest known human-made nanomaterials in the "unique black coatings" of ancient pottery shards -- dated to 600 BC -- unearthed from an archeological site in Keeladi, Tamil Nadu. The research, published recently in the journal Scientific Reports, revealed that these coatings are made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which have enabled the layer to last more than 2600 years, raising questions on the tools used during those periods to achieve high temperatures for making earthenwares. According to the scientists, including those from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) in Tamil Nadu, the coatings are "the oldest nanostructures observed till now." "Until this discovery, to our knowledge, the most ancient known nanostructures in human-made artifacts are from the eighth or ninth century AD," study co-author Vijayanand Chandrasekaran from VIT told PTI.  CNTs are tubular structures of carbon atoms arranged in an ordered manner, Chandrasekaran said, adding that coatings in ancient artifacts may not usually last this long due to wear and tear caused by changing conditions. "But the robust mechanical properties of the CNT based coating has helped the layer sustain more than 2600 years," he added.  Carbon nanotubes have superlative properties, including high thermal and electrical conductivity, and very high mechanical strength, explained nanomaterial scientist M. M. Shaijumon from IISER Thiruvananthapuram, who was unrelated to the study. "But the people of this time may not have intentionally added CNTs, instead, during the processing at high temperatures, these would have just formed accidentally," Shaijumon told PTI.    "If there is some processing of the potteries, which probably would have involved some high-temperature treatment, then it will add more justification to the findings," he added. According to Chandrasekaran, the closest scientific explanation for the finding is that some "vegetal fluid or extract" might have been used in the coatings of these pots which may have led to the formation of CNTs during high-temperature processing. Rajavelu S, Professor of History at Alagappa University in Tamil Nadu, who was unrelated to the study, told PTI that the people of this time may have added or coated something similar to plant-sap to the inside of the pots, and subject it to the nearly 1100-1400 degree Celsius high-temperature fire treatment as seen in kilns. "This fire treatment may have led to the formation of the coating which has likely strengthened the pot and made the coating durable," Rajavelu told PTI. "Normally with high-temperature processing of carbon, they form these type of tubular nano-structures, but until about the 1990s there were no sophisticated instruments available to characterise them. So these structures are already even present in nature and only now we are observing them," explained Shaijumon. Rajavelu concurred. He said the ancient people would not have known these as CNTs, but may have just had the need to make their pots have high durability, "and may have needed a certain colour out of their products on applying high-temperature firing." "They likely knew the technique to make these coatings practically, but may not have known this as a thesis with any kinds of formulae," Rajavelu added. Commenting on the significance of the research, Sharada Srinivasan, an expert in archaemetallurgy associated with the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) in Bengaluru, said nanotechnology has made strides since the 90s with the advent of advanced techniques like the scanning tunnelling microscopy. "But it is increasingly recognised from archaeological studies that past skilled artisans sometimes accidentally or empirically made nanomaterials -- such as the famous Egyptian Blue -- without being aware of the science of working at the nano-scale," Srinivasan told PTI. Based on their analysis, Chandrasekaran said the ancient Tamil civilization of this time were aware of, and mastered high-temperature processing, but added that the means and mechanism by which they produced these artifacts with carbon-nanotubes is not widely explored. "Black and red pottery ware associated with megalithic sites in southern India continues into Keeladi dated back to 6th century BCE. The fine black and red effect was achieved by high temperature firing temperatures at about 1100 degrees in the presence of carbon-rich matter and iron-rich red soils," Srinivasan said. "They do not look like normal pots, these have glazed finishes, and are made of high-quality clay," Rajavelu added. He said these earthenwares were likely used by the "sophisticated people of the time," adding that "a lot of the shards" have been found in Keeladi, "some dating back even as early as 900 BCE." "We have known for a long time that in iron smelting and manufacture, India was a world leader at the time. Even the Sangam ancient Tamil literature has noted about steel manufacture," Rajavelu said. "The technological skills of the Tamils in high-temperature manipulation of carbonaceous matter to make ultra-high carbon crucible steel known as wootz by about the mid to late centuries BCE was also reported by us, while carbon nanotubes were reported in medieval patterned 'Damascus' blades forged from such steel," Srinivasan explained.  She believes the findings expand the broader knowledge of the history of science and technology in India, and point to potential future applications of such nanomaterials as durable coatings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/oldest-known-human-made-nanostructures-discovered-in-tamil-nadu-918226.html
21-11-2020||South||Kerala governor signs controversial Police Act amendment ordinance||Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has signed the Kerala Police Act Amendment ordinance, envisaged by the Left government in the state to prevent cyber attacks against women and children which the opposition had alleged would curtail freedom of expression. A Raj Bhavan source confirmed that the Governor, who had come back to the official residence recently after recovering from the Covid-19, signed the ordinance which had triggered widespread row in the southern state. The opposition parties had alleged that the amendment would give more power to the police and also curtail the freedom of the press, the charge which was rejected by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan saying thedecision had been taken based on factors such asabuse of social media to tarnish the image of individuals. The state cabinet, last month, had decided to give more teeth to the Police Act by recommending addition of Section 118-A. It stipulates either imprisonment for up to five years or a fine of up to Rs 10,000 or both to those who produce, publish or disseminate content through any means of communication with an intention to intimidate, insult or defame any person through social media. Expressing concern over the rising crime graph, fake propaganda and hate speech on social media since the outbreak of Covid-19, the LDF government had said since cyber attacks are amajor threat to private life, it has been decided to amend the Police Act as the existing legal provisions were inadequate to fight such crimes. It said while the Supreme Court had repealed section 66-A of the IT Act and Section 118 (d) of the Kerala Police Act on the grounds that these were against freedom of expression, the Centre has not introduced any other legal framework. "In this scenario, the police are unable to deal effectively with crimes committed through social media," the government had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-governor-signs-controversial-police-act-amendment-ordinance-918245.html

Shah, who thanked the metropolis for its love, said it was "great" to be in Tamil Nadu. Shah is slated to attend a Tamil Nadu government event later in the day, where he will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone for projects worth over Rs 67,000 crore, including phase II of Chennai Metrol Rail. Soon after his arrival from Delhi, Shah was received by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, his deputy O Panneerselvam, senior cabinet members and BJP State President L Murugan among others, before proceeding to the city hotel where he will be put up. However, after exiting the airport, Shah's car suddenly stopped and the BJP veteran got out, before walking a short distance, waving at scores of BJP and AIADMK workers who had gathered to receive him with their respective party flags. Accompanied by BJP National General Secretary and party in-charge of poll-bound Tamil Nadu, CT Ravi, and Murugan, with his security detail in tow, the Home Minister warmly waved at the overjoyed supporters who had thronged the airport since the morning. A heavy security cover has been provided in the city following Shah's visit, during which he will meet state BJP functionaries and possibly discuss Tamil Nadu elections, due next April-May, before leaving on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, Shah took to Twitter to thank the city for its love and support. "It is always great to be in Tamil Nadu. Thank you Chennai for this love and support," he said in a tweet accompanying a video clip of his walk on GST Road. Shad had earlier been here in Augsut 2019 to release a book on Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu's two years in office then.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/amit-shah-springs-a-suprise-walks-on-chennai-road-to-greet-supporters-918267.html
21-11-2020||South||Former DMK MP K P Ramalingam perceived close to Alagiri joins BJP||Former DMK Rajya Sabha MP K P Ramalingam, who enjoys a good rapport with expelled party leader M K Alagiri, on Saturday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in the latest induction as part of the saffron party's massive recruitment drive to make inroads into Tamil Nadu. Ramalingam, who was removed as Farmers' Wing secretary of the DMK and suspended from the party earlier this year, joined BJP in the presence of general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu, C T Ravi. His joining came hours before Union Home Minister and BJP's election strategist Amit Shah landed in Chennai to participate in government functions and meet party leaders. The joining of Ramalingam is significant as it comes close on the heels of reports that Alagiri, the elder son of late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, may launch his own political party and align with the BJP. Ramalingam is considered close to Alagiri and is one of the very few DMK leaders who mustered the courage to meet the Madurai strongman days after he was suspended from the party by Karunanidhi in January 2014. After joining the BJP, Ramalingam said he will certainly speak to Alagiri about his new political innings and extended an invitation to join the saffron party. “Of course, I will tell him all the good things about BJP. I will certainly convince him to join the BJP whose leaders are giving much-needed direction to the country. I will do my part and the rest is in his (Alagiri's) hands,” Ramalingam told DH. The former DMK MP, who was with the AIADMK under M G Ramachandran before jumping the ship after his death, said Alagiri was “his brother” and he continues to enjoy “good rapport” with him. Ramalingam said he decided to join the BJP as he was not “matured enough” to accept anyone other than Karunanidhi as his leader in the DMK. “When MGR died, my mind did not accept Jayalalithaa as my leader. And now, after Kalaignar (Karunanidhi), I do not feel like accepting anyone as a leader in the DMK,” he said. On his joining the BJP, Ramalingam said he was impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership skills, and his economic policies. “I have been in politics for 45 years having been trained under MGR and Karunanidhi. I think it is time for me to join a national party and work for them,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/former-dmk-mp-k-p-ramalingam-perceived-close-to-alagiri-joins-bjp-918270.html

The idols, which were recovered in London, reached the temple on Saturday from Chennai. In 1978, four bronze idols - that of Lord Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman belonging to this 15th-century temple were stolen. Prayer police had registered a case and even arrested three people, but the idols couldn't be traced. Following the information from a Singapore-based voluntary organisation which monitors the trade of artefacts in the international market, three of the four stolen idols were recovered from an antique collector in London during September this year, authorities said. The Metropolitan Police in London handed over the three idols (Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita) to the Indian Embassy. The idols were brought to India and the Union Culture Ministry handed it over to the Tamil Nadu government early this week. On Friday, Chief Minister K Palaniswami inspected the idols in Chennai and formally handed them over to the temple executive officer Sankareswari. The idols reached the temple on Saturday from Chennai. Temple authorities said the idols would be formally reinstalled on November 25.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ancient-temple-gets-back-stolen-idols-after-42-years-918365.html

It was based on a recent statement of a bar hotel owner in Kerala, Biju Ramesh, that Chennithala as well as former ministers and Congress leaders V S Sivakumar and K Babu were paid bribe in 2014 for giving relations in then Congress-led United Democratic Front government's liquor policy, that a vigilance probe was being initiated. Chennithala was then Kerala PCC president, Babu was excise minister and Sivakumar was health minister. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was learnt to have given nod for the probe and it is awaiting nod of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan. While opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the fresh moves to launch an enquiry against him and other Congress leaders was politically motivated, CPM state secretary incharge A Vijayaraghavan said that the fresh moves were based on fresh allegations only. Chennithala said that already couple of teams of vigilance as well as the Lok Ayukta had found that the allegations against him were baseless. He also said that an audio clip provided as evidence by Biju Ramesh was found to be tampered one. It may be recalled that the bar owners had alleged in 2014 that former finance minister K M Mani took Rs 1 crore bribe, but the vigilance probe gave him a clean chit. Even as the court ordered further probe, the proceedings were closed in 2019 following Mani's death. Congress leaders said that the Left Front government was trying to divert attention from the serious charges against the government. The arrest of former minister V K Ebrahim Kunju in connection with the Kochi fly-over corruption case and Manjeshwar MLA M C Kamaruddin in connection with cheating investors of his jewellery business were also politically motivated ones to divert attention, the opposition alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/probe-into-six-year-old-allegations-against-congress-leaders-in-kerala-triggers-row-918373.html

21-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||1,000-yr-old Hassan temple's idol broken||The destruction of the idol of Dakshina Kali or Bhadrakali at Doddagaddavalli Chatushkuta Temple, which dates back to 1113 CE, in Hassan has prompted an investigation by the district police following allegations of foul play. Balakrishna D J, a Carnatic musician, who lives opposite to the temple in Doddagaddavalli, told DH that the idol was found broken in two pieces on Friday morning. "The idol was intact and my brother Venkatesh had performed pooja yesterday evening. Today (Friday), around 6.45 am, while lighting the lamp he saw the idol had fallen on its face and broken in two," he said. A shocked Venkatesh took the upper part of the face and placed it in an upright position. "It's a heavy idol made of Krishna Shile (black granite). We don't know what caused this. We did not hear any noise at night," Balakrishna added. Manoj G, archaeologist and Indology researcher said the temple has a special place in the culture and archeological history of the state. "It is the only Hoysala temple with four garbhagruhas (sanctum sanctorum). Unfortunately, it was not well protected. The Archeological Survey of India could have done better by installing steel doors to the temple," he said. The temple, he said, was built by Mallishetty, a trader, and his wife who visited Kolhapur in Maharashtra. "They dreamed of building a 'Dakshina Kolhapura'. We have lost a treasure of history and archaelology. It is time the officials wake up," he said. Archeological Survey of India's Bangalore Circle superintending archaeologist Shivakant Bajpai said the police have begun an investigation into the issue. Former minister C T Ravi said the 'desecration of the idol' needs to be investigated and urged the home minister to set up a special team. To a question, Hassan superintendent of police R Srinivasa Gowda said the temple had no guard and the doors were not locked. "As of now, we cannot comment on who destroyed the idol," he said. Balakrishna said an ASI official used to visit the temple but stopped coming about four months ago.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/1000-yr-old-hassan-temples-idol-broken-918122.html

One section of the BJP top leadership is of the view that the exercise should be held after  bypolls to the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency and Maski and Basavakalyan Assembly segments. These bypolls are yet to be announced.  “Some party leaders in Delhi believe that if Yediyurappa goes for a Cabinet exercise now, it will definitely lead to dissident activities by legislators who lose out in the ministerial race. This will impact the party’s poll prospects,” a senior leader told DH. “The party’s central leadership is keen on winning all the three seats in Karnataka to continue its victory march following success in the Bihar Assembly and bypolls in several states." Speaking to reporters, Yediyurappa said he had discussed with BJP national president J P Nadda “what needed to be done and how” and that he is expecting a response in two days. “I will prepare for the swearing-in of the new ministers in 3-4 days,” he said.  Amid the uncertainty on whether Yediyurappa’s Cabinet will be expanded or reshuffled, some brisk political activities took place during the day. Eight-time MLA Umesh Katti, a sulking ministerial hopeful, met Yediyurappa. In Delhi, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi reached out to BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh.  Apparently, Jarkiholi requested Santhosh to ensure the induction of MLC A H Vishwanath into the Cabinet. Vishwanath and Jarkiholi were among the 17 rebel MLAs who defected to help the BJP come to power last year.  Jarkiholi told reporters that his meeting with Santhosh was a courtesy call. “I have not discussed the Cabinet expansion," he said. “But I’ve been requesting the BJP high command to protect the interest of  leaders who joined BJP after quitting other parties. I’m confident that the leadership and the CM will not ignore the sacrifices of those leaders," he said. Yediyurappa’s Cabinet has seven vacant positions and there are over a dozen ministerial aspirants.  Asked about MLAs publicly airing their disgruntlement, including his political secretary MP Renukacharya, Yediyurappa declined to comment. “Such things keep happening. I don’t want to discuss them,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-confident-of-his-cabinet-plans-918124.html

Think X-Men, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Martian.  Speaking to DH, Biren Ghose, President ABAI (Association of Bangalore Animation Industry) highlighted a few issues, including the need for a new AVGC Policy 3.0, that could help spur growth in the sector, specially in Karnataka and create between 7,000 to 10,000 new jobs in a short period of time.  “We are not asking for cash benefits or subsidies. There are other steps the government can take, including taking a look at GST refunds, ensuring better credit terms and providing rental relief at government-owned tech parks,” Ghose said. Another issue highlighted was the charging of electricity at commercial rates instead of the industrial rate promised in Karnataka’s IT policy. “The AVGC industry is a power-hungry machine. To give you an example, the power bill of some companies in the sector is higher than their rental bills,” he said adding, “All the government has to do is work out a system to provide a benefit which is already promised.”  Ghose, who spoke at the Bengaluru Tech Summit on Friday, also made a case for a refresh of the AVGC policy, which was recently updated in 2017. “There are many new technologies which should be part of the policy. There is e-sports, Augmented Reality, Extended Reality (XR) all of which should be part of the new policy,” he explained. The animation industry, witnessing a growth of 18 per cent before the pandemic, has dropped its estimates to around 5-10 per cent this year and will now have to work hard to regain the lost growth. For this goal, Ghose suggested that the government look first at enabling larger companies to target growth and said that this would have a cascading effect helping smaller businesses as well. “We want the Government to invest in infrastructure, to bring in soft-touch policies, look at the possibility of a mega-hub for large scale exports.” On the post-covid scenario, Ghose said that the industry would adapt by deploying strategies like virtual production, real-time editing and other technologies to help overcome the challenges of Covid-19. “There is a massive skill shortage and by fast-tracking projects like Centre of Excellence, scholarships for students in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, we can catapult growth in the sector,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-s-avgc-sector-ready-for-a-refresh-asks-for-policy-support-918227.html
21-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Second wave of Covid-19 has hit India: Dr K Sudhakar||The second wave of Covid-19 infection has hit several countries including India. Reports of the second wave of this deadly infection are reported from Ahmedabad and Delhi, stated Medical Education, Health & Family Welfare Minister Dr K Sudhakar. On the possibility of another Covid-19 wave hitting Karnataka, the minister said it depends on how the people behave. If people continue to be cautious and follow the guidelines issued by the health ministry, there will be no problem. If people are reckless, then the possibility of another wave cannot be ruled out” he said. Speaking to media persons here on Saturday, Dr Sudhakar denied that the decline in positive Covid-19 cases in Karnataka is due to laxity in testing and claimed that till Saturday, one crore people have been tested for in the state. The minister said as many as 1.15 lakh people are being tested for Covid-19 per day in the state and the testing has been hiked in districts that have not seen a spike in cases. "Karnataka is on the top in handling Covid-19 effectively and the overall situation as of now in the state is improving, but that should not be the reason for complicity. I expect the vaccine to come out by the end of March. I also expect the Covid-19 curve to remain flat by that time” Sudhakar said. On college students getting infected, the minister said that 120 students have contracted the infection. However, youths have immunity to fight against this infection. It is also the responsibility of the government to shape the educational career of the students and hence, permission has been given to open the colleges. If in case, there is a spike, the colleges will be shut once again, he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/second-wave-of-covid-19-has-hit-india-dr-k-sudhakar-918379.html

21-11-2020||West||India has set target of cutting carbon footprint by 30-35%||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the country was moving forward with the goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 30 to 35 per cent. He also said that efforts were on to increase the use of natural gas by four times in this decade and to double the oil refining capacity in the next five years. The prime minister said this while addressing the eighth convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) here via video conference. "Today, the country is moving forward with the goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 30 to 35 per cent. When I told this to the world, it expressed surprise and wondered if India could achieve this," he said. "Our effort is to increase the share of natural gas in our energy needs by four times in this decade. Work is also on to nearly double the oil refining capacity in the coming five years," he added. He also expressed confidence that the country will achieve its renewable energy generation target "before time". "Today, per unit cost (of solar power) has come down to less than Rs 2 from Rs 12-13 earlier. Today, solar power has become the country's priority. We have made a commitment to generate 175-gigawatt renewable energy and I am confident that we will achieve this before 2022," he said. "Also, our renewable energy target of 450 gigawatt by 2030, a big aim, will be achieved before time...I am confident of that," he said. Modi said that the oil and gas sector will see an investment of crores of rupees in this decade, which will create opportunities for the graduating students of the university in the fields of research, manufacturing and others. He also said that work is underway to strengthen the start-ups ecosystem related to the energy security sector, and a special fund has been allocated for the purpose. "If you have any idea, product or any concept which you want to incubate, then this fund will be a good opportunity for you, and a gift from the government," he said. The PM said that despite the hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the graduating students should remember that their strength and capacities are much bigger than the challenges, and asked them not to lose confidence. "What is more important than problems is your purpose, preference and your commitment. This is not that you are facing a challenge for the first time in your life, or that this is the last challenge. It is not the case that a successful person does not have problems. But those who accept the challenges and defeat them are the ones who succeed," he said. He asked the students to recall the period of the country's Independence movement and how people sacrificed their lives for it. He asked them to similarly become a soldier for 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'. He said that those who succeed in life possess a sense of responsibility. "There is a lot to do for the country, but your commitment, your aim should not be fragmented. You see that only they become successful in life who do something with a sense of responsibility...Failures are those who live with a sense of burden. The youth of the 21st century should go ahead with a clean slate. The concept that 'nothing will change' will have to be cleaned...," he said. The PM asked the students to take sustained efforts as it will bring about positive results. He said the 'Clean India' programme was an example of this and said small efforts of crores of people turned it into a movement. During his address, he also recalled how his decision to segregate domestic and agriculture feeders made it possible for the households to get 24-hour electricity in Gujarat. Modi inaugurated five state-of-the-art facilities to mark the eighth convocation of the PDPU. The facilities he unveiled at the university are a 45 -MW production of a monocrystalline solar photovoltaic panel, a tech business incubator, a sports complex, and a Translational Research Centre at the PDPU, as well as an Indo-EU bilateral project under Horizon 2020 'India-h2o' for industrial waste and desalination. Modi also suggested the state government to change the name of the Petroleum University to Energy University. "Looking at the requirement of the country and the world, and the way the university has taken its shape, I would request the state government to, if required, change the law, to better convert its name as an Energy University. Its expansion as Energy University will benefit the country a lot," he said. "I would request you (the state government) to consider associating the entire energy sector with this university in place of only the petroleum sector," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/india-has-set-target-of-cutting-carbon-footprint-by-30-35-918228.html

This is one of the steps being considered by the state government to curb the spread of the virus, he said. "Various measures are being discussed in order to curb the virus spread in the state, and suspension of train and flight operations to and from Delhi is one of them," Principal Secretary Sanjay Kumar told PTI. "However, no decision has been taken so far on this," he added. Sources said that during a meeting held recently in Mumbai it was discussed that steps need to be taken to prevent the spread of infection from people entering Maharashtra from the states that have been witnessing a spike in the number of cases. Maharashtra's Covid-19 tally on Friday went up to 17,68,695 with the addition of 5,640 cases during the day and the death toll reached 46,511. The national capital recorded 6,608 fresh coronavirus positive cases on Friday, taking the infection tally to over 5.17 lakh, while 118 more fatalities during the same period pushed the death toll to 8,159. The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-maharashtra-eyes-suspension-of-trains-flights-to-delhi-918241.html

Former Goa Chief Minister and educationist Laxmikant Parsekar, who heads the 27-member-committee, said five expert groups have been formed to work independently on the roadmap to implement the NEP. The groups will be turning in their reports by the end of this month, after which the committee will meet to decide on the final report, which will be submitted by March 2021, he said. Under the NEP, education has been divided into six phases, right from foundation level to doctorate studies, he said. The committee is likely to suggest that at least one year of each of the phases should begin from the coming academic year, so that the entire policy gets implemented in the next four to five years, Parsekar said. While the committee has no powers to amend the NEP, it will instead advice the state government on its smooth implementation considering various local factors. The NEP 2020 will replace the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-government-panel-to-submit-final-report-on-nep-by-march-2021-918252.html

The police said all three accused have been arrested, while the victim is recuperating at a hospital and her condition is said to be stable. The police said the victim, in her early 20s, works as a casual labourer with her husband at the farm owned by one Bharat Rupalia, located at the border of Virnagar village, Jasdan taluk. About two months ago, the couple was called to work as labourers by one of the accused Mukesh Katara, who happens to be the brother of the victim. At the farm, the couple joined several other close relatives who worked as casual labourers and lived in a temporary settlement together. The couple belongs to Santrampur taluk of Mahisagar district. According to the FIR, on November 18 around 9 pm, Mukesh's brother Nilesh came waving his arms, sat beside the victim and said his "power as Bhuva (witch doctor) was snatched by the woman" and if he didn't take it back, she would finish off everyone. The FIR said the victim was punched in her face several times and later the accused lit residue of maize and threw them at her. "The victim is under treatment and her condition is stable. She has suffered nearly 50 to 60% burns. We have arrested all the accused in the case," Balram Meena, Superintendent of Police, Rajkot district, told DH. Highlighting the incident, labour rights organisation Majur Adhikar Manch, in a press note, said the victim's husband was forcefully shut inside the house when the incident happened. The organisation has demanded a separate law in the state to address incidents like this. It said such cases are prevalent in rural areas but the state doesn't have special laws for such offences unlike Bihar, Rajasthan, Karnataka, among other states, and demanded the government to ensure the safety of migrant women workers at such remote places.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/tribal-woman-set-on-fire-on-suspicion-of-witchcraft-in-gujarat-918312.html

Speaking to reporters on Saturday, state Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said he has written to the state health secretary asking him to consult his counterpart in Maharashtra about steps taken for people arriving from Delhi. "We don't have to take harsh steps, but we have to see what SOPs are put in place at airports. We need to see whether an additional facility is required at the airport and how people coming from Delhi can be managed," the minister said. A workable and smoothly monitored system needs to be in place, he said. The coastal state is preparing for the tourist season, as the Christmas and New Year festivities are just a month away. The state government will also have to frame an SOP to monitor migrant workers who will arrive in the state after Chhath Puja, the minister said. "We need to put an SOP in place for migrant workers so that there is no spike in infections," the minister said. While SOPs can be introduced at the airport, the state government is still clueless about how the movement through trains can be monitored, Rane said. The minister further said that the Central government has sought details of the isolation kit programme that was implemented by the Goa government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-goa-govt-to-study-sops-to-monitor-travellers-from-delhi-918345.html

The whitepaper has also urged a need for Goa to re-invent its tourism sector offerings and diversify its bouquet of experiences to compete with rival outbound tourism destinations like Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, etc. "A dedicated team needs to be appointed for attracting brands like Disneyland, Universal Studios, Magic Kingdom, etc. These are large tourist magnets and will add another incentive for high paying tourists to travel to the state. It is hard to imagine large companies starting their businesses in Goa, given the current conditions. A short – term plan with all the required infrastructure can appeal to these brands," the whitepaper titled 'Accelerating the Goan Economy - A Whitepaper' recommends. "Industry numbers suggest that tourists are traveling to other destinations in India and outside India to countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka etc. One of the common success factors of all these competing countries is diversification of their tourism market. Goa’s focus has been mostly on highlighting its tropical beaches, alcohol, parties and casinos, and needs a relook," it also states. The document has examined the "pain points" of the Goan economy and suggested actionable interventions from the state government keeping in mind budget and resource constraints. The whitepaper also says that poor transportation, inconsistent commission practices by industry stakeholders, unregistered hotel and lodging facilities were deterring both the long term as well as short term prospects of Goa as a tourism destination. It has also recommended streamlining of the permissions required to start tourism activities, stating that bureaucratic delays were common with no accountability attached. "Implementation of a single portal interconnect to all required licences will be a big boost for ease of doing business. To reduce the delays and have accountability for the delays, an auto approval system can be mooted. Yearly renewals of regulatory approvals are a cumbersome activity with no value addition," the whitepaper states. Goa is billed as a top beach and nightlife tourism destination in the country and attracted nearly eight million tourists last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/setting-up-disneyland-universal-studios-will-boost-tourism-in-goa-cii-918355.html

Ian Jones was bitten by an Indian cobra in rural Jodhpur district and admitted to hospital in Jodhpur city, about 350 kilometres (220 miles) from the regional capital Jaipur. "Jones came to us last week after a snake bite in a village in the region. Initially, it was suspected that he is also Covid-19 positive (for the second time) but he tested negative for that," doctor Abhishek Tater, who treated him at the local Medipulse Hospital, told AFP on Saturday. "While with us, he was conscious and had snake bite symptoms including blurring of vision and difficulty to walk, but these are generally transient symptoms," Tater added. Jones was discharged earlier in the week. "We feel that there won't be any long term effects. If he hasn't already improved, he'd do so within next few days," the doctor added. He said snake bites were not uncommon in the rural parts of the region. "Dad is a fighter, during his time out in India he had already suffered from malaria and dengue fever before Covid-19," his son, Seb Jones, said in a statement on a GoFundMe page set up to help pay his medical bills and travel back to the Isle of Wight in southern England. "He had not been able to travel home due to the pandemic and as a family, we understood his desire to continue to support the many people who relied on him," he added. Jones works with traditional craftsmen in Rajasthan and through his charity-backed social enterprise, Sabirian, helps import their goods into Britain to help them escape poverty.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/after-malaria-and-covid-19-british-man-survives-cobra-bite-in-india-918400.html
