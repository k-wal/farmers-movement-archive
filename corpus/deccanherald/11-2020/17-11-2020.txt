17-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Colleges, universities reopen with thin attendance||The colleges and universities in and around Mysuru opened with thin attendance, after a long Covid-19 vacation, almost nine months on Tuesday. Joint Director for Collegiate Education R Mugeshappa said, "Only 5% to 10% of the students appeared in colleges in the Mysuru region. The institutions have been reopened by strictly following the Covid-19 guidelines.” In most of the institutions, no classes were held on the reopening day. Orientation was provided to students on wearing masks, use of sanitisers and maintaining social distance. While only those who brought Covid negative reports were allowed to enter the institutions, Covid tests were also held for others. All staff of the institutions have undergone Covid tests. The attendance of students in even premier institutions like Maharaja’s College, Yuvaraja’s College, Maharani’s College and in major private institutions was very thin. In Maharani’s Commerce and Management Colleges, there are 936 students in final year BCom and BBM, but only 12 students turned up. As the hostels have not opened, outstation students have stayed away. Parents are also apprehensive about sending their wards to colleges. Ashwini, a student of Maharani’s Science College, said, "Physical classes are always better than online classes. Thus, I was eager to attend the college." Principal of Sarada Vilas College M Devika said, "We have 340 students in final year undergraduate courses, but only 12 of them turned up. We hope, the attendance will improve in the coming days.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/colleges-universities-reopen-with-thin-attendance-916811.html
17-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Mysureans call for complete ban on firecrackers||Even as the three-day festivals of Naraka Chaturdashi, Deepavali and Balipadyami are over, albeit in a toned down manner, compared to previous years, due to the Covid-19 crisis, a section of the citizens call for a complete ban on firecrackers. Despite the government passing an order that only 'green crackers' should be sold and lighted, people, in and around Mysuru city, have burst all kinds of crackers. Further, a section of the people will celebrate all Mondays of the current Karthika month of Chandramana calender. Tulasi Puja will also be celebrated on November 26. The crackers will be burst on all these days and also throughout the Karthika month. Next season will be Christmas and New Year. Citizens concerned about the environment and also aggravation of Covid-19 symptoms, due to air pollution and smoke, are unhappy over the lethargic implementation of the ban on firecrackers. “Did the government have the wherewithal or mechanism to implement its order?” asked K A Chandrahas, an employee of a private firm. As per the guidelines, 'green crackers' are those, which are manufactured as per the formulation developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research - National Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (CSIR- NEERI) lab. The product approval of Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) and their packing can be confirmed by the distinct green logo of CSIR-NEERI and PESI, as well as a Quick Response (QR) code. “While the traders sold whatever crackers they had, as ‘green crackers’, there is no account of old stock with shopkeepers as well as people, from previous years. Does the government – Mysuru City Corporation, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and Police department – have a mechanism and human resources, to check each and every household. Besides, crackers are not burst only by those who celebrate Deepavali for religious reasons. People of other faiths also burst crackers for fun and revelry,” said S S Pankaja, a teacher. A section of the citizens are for a complete ban on firecrackers, whether normal or green. There should be a ban on both production and sales of all kinds of crackers. Otherwise, both traders and people will find loopholes, to violate the restrictions, they said. Dr Chandrasekhar, an elderly physician, “In Kannada, there is a proverb, ‘Athiyadare Amruthavu Visha’ meaning, excess of even elixir is poison. When there were no electric lights, lighting of lamps at the doorsteps of the houses was science, to trap insects, that see a huge surge during the month of Karthika. Now, electric lights in our houses, doorsteps, and on the streets are hundreds and thousands of times brighter than the traditional oil lamps. They distract the insects long before they can be trapped. Even crackers were not widespread, just a couple of decades ago." "Now, almost everybody can afford crackers. When crackers were burst in limited quantum, they also checked the attack of insects. With almost everybody lighting crackers now, the effects are immense, negatively. There should be an end to everything. The time for crackers seems to have come,” said Dr Chandrasekhar, an elderly physician.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mysureans-call-for-complete-ban-on-firecrackers-916814.html

In response to a comment of Sumalatha, against him, that he is a ‘Pete Rowdy’ (town ruffian), he said that he would be inspired by her husband’s portrayal of the character of Jaleela in is debutant film ‘Nagarahavu’. Sumalatha had commented in response to a reaction of Simha, in which he tells over the phone to some person, “She will not let others to work and she will also not work. If you need any support come to me”. Its video was in circulation on the social media. Simha said that he is not a star and no fan will vote for him blindly. “Thus, only my work will fetch me votes. I believe in the philosophy of Basavanna, ‘Work is Worship’, and follow it in principle. Democracy is not for dominance under the guise of influential background. A cobbler’s son became the President of the USA, a tea vendor has become our Prime minister. So, even a common man like me could become MP,” he said. He said, "The people of Mandya asked him about the progress on the works of the 10-lane Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. They had anxiety about connectivity across the highway, as some of the villages are spread on both sides of the highway." "I assured them that flyovers and underpass would be constructed wherever necessary. The highway will help the progress of the people of Mandya and Ramanagara districts too. So, I was giving clarification and was assuring the people about the works,” he said. In response to Sumalatha’s comment on the roads in Kodagu, Simha said, "The Mandya MP should know which roads comes under the concern of the MP, MLAs, ZP members, Taluk Panchayat members and Gram Panchayat members, before issuing such statements."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/simha-ignores-statement-of-sumalatha-916818.html
17-11-2020||National||Mumbai, Delhi differ on Covid-19 testing strategy: Officials||Despite Mumbai and Delhi having almost the same positivity rate, civic officials here on Monday said the city does not require to increase its daily number of Covid-19 tests like in the national capital, which is witnessing a fresh wave of the infection. Testing strategies between the two cities also differ, the officials said, pointing out that while Delhi has adopted random testing methods, Mumbai is focusing on those showing symptoms or ones who are suspected to have come in contact with Covid-19 patients. They said currently Mumbai is logging less than 1,000 cases daily, while Delhi is witnessing a third wave with over 6,000-7,000 coronavirus cases on single days. Probably, this is because Mumbai followed a more cautious unlock strategy, wherein its lifeline - suburban trains - continues to be off-bounds for a majority of commuters more than eight months on as against Delhi's "liberal" attitude towards easing of curbs, said the officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Also, unlike the higher proportion of rapid antigen tests done in Delhi, Mumbai has relied largely on RT-PCR tests which are time-consuming but considered more accurate, they said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said currently they are conducting over 10,000 tests per day, mainly RT-PCR, and they have adopted a targeted testing strategy. "We have been doing targeted testing instead of random testing since the beginning. "We are testing those who have Covid-19-like symptoms and those who are exposed to the virus (like health workers and transport staff)," Kakani said. Kakani said they have set up at least 10 free testing centres in each of the 24 civic wards and people also have an option of undergoing tests at private labs. "We cannot force people to undergo Covid-19 tests, unless they have any symptoms or they are exposed to the virus," he said. Mumbai has seen 16,85,287 Covid-19 tests so far as against 49,91,585 tests conducted in Delhi, according to BMC's dashboard. While rapid antigen tests (RATs) detect viral protein, the RT-PCR tests detect viral RNA or its genetic material. Low -cost RATs give results in 30 minutes. RT-PCR tests are more expensive and time-consuming than antigen tests. Mumbai has so far clocked a tally of 2,69,130 cases, while 10,555 patients have succumbed to the infection. On the other hand, Delhi has recorded 4,85,405 infections and 8,900 fatalities till now (as on November 15). According to the BMC's dashboard, Mumbai has per million tests of 1,29,562, whereas Delhi has 2,62,715, but both cities have a positivity rate of 15 per cent. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the Maharashtra government-appointed Covid-19 task force, Delhi has conducted more than 21,000 tests per day of which more than 50 per cent are antigen and the rest RT-PCR. Mumbai has mainly focused on RT-PCR tests, he said. "Testing is based on positivity rate and what is important is to do RT-PCR tests, which is the gold standard. "RT-PCR should be the general norm, while antigen should be reserved for people with very typical symptoms of Covid-19. If they test negative in antigen, then RT-PCR should be repeated on them," Pandit said. Dr Shashank Joshi, another member of the Covid-19 task force, said at present, Mumbai's daily count has dropped after witnessing a major peak in May and a minor high in September, while Delhi is witnessing its third peak. "There has been a surge in cases in Delhi as compared to Mumbai as the national capital has harsh winter and high pollution levels," Joshi said. Gradual unlocking process has also proved helpful for the financial capital, he said. Joshi said though the number of tests done in Mumbai is less compared to Delhi, overall Covid-19 cases are also low in the western metropolis. However, Joshi warned of the possibility of a surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai in the next 2 to 3 weeks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mumbai-delhi-differ-on-covid-19-testing-strategy-officials-916397.html

The lungs were removed to perform black magic, believing that it will help a woman give birth to a child, they said. The girl had gone missing on the night of Diwali from the Ghatampur area. The killers -- Ankul Kuril (20) and Beeran (31) -- who were arrested on Sunday, had removed her lungs and delivered those to key conspirator Parshuram Kuril to perform black magic, ASP (Rural) Brajesh Srivastava said. Parshuram was arrested on Monday and his wife was also detained due to the apprehension that she knew about the incident, but did not talk about it to anyone, the officer added. Parshuram initially tried to mislead the police, but facing intensive interrogation, broke down and confessed to his crime, the ASP said. Parshuram told the police that he got married in 1999 but had not had a child so far, he said. He persuaded his nephew, Ankul, and his friend Beeran, to kidnap the girl and remove her lungs, the ASP said. Ankul and Beeran, who were heavily drunk, abducted the girl while she had gone out of her home in Bhadras village on Saturday night to buy firecrackers, he added. They took her to a nearby jungle, where they raped the girl before killing her. The accused have been charged under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Kanpur's Deputy Inspector of General of Police Preetinder Singh had said forensic experts and sniffer dogs were pressed into service to gather scientific evidence to confirm if the girl was killed in an act of black magic. The girl had gone missing on Saturday evening while her family was preparing for Diwali prayers. The family looked for her in the nearby areas, including the jungle, using flashlights, but failed to locate her during the night, Singh had said, adding that her body was found by some villagers passing through the jungle on Sunday morning, the DIG said. The girl's belongings, including her slippers and clothes, were found near a tree. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has taken note of the heinous crime and directed officials to take strict action against the accused. He has also directed the officials to extend a financial help of Rs five lakh to the victim's family. The chief minister has said the case would be heard in a fast-track court so that the accused are punished at the earliest||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/6-year-old-girl-found-dead-in-kanpur-was-gang-raped-lungs-taken-out-916453.html
17-11-2020||National||In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, says Barack Obama||Former US President Barack Obama has said that modern-day India can be counted as a success story in many respects, despite bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and corruption scandals. The 44th US president, in his latest book, says the transition to a more market-based economy in the 1990s unleashed the extraordinary entrepreneurial talents of Indians, leading to soaring growth rates, a thriving technology sector, and a steadily expanding middle class. In his book "A Promised Land", Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. “In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, having survived repeated changeovers in government, bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and all manner of corruption scandals,” Obama writes. As the chief architect of India's economic transformation, (former) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed like a fitting emblem of this progress: a member of the tiny, often persecuted Sikh religious minority who had risen to the highest office in the land, and a self-effacing technocrat who had won people's trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt, says Obama, who had visited India twice as president in 2010 and 2015. Referring to his November 2010 India visit, Obama says he and Manmohan Singh had developed a warm and productive relationship. “While he could be cautious in foreign policy, unwilling to get out too far ahead of an Indian bureaucracy that was historically suspicious of US intentions, our time together confirmed my initial impression of him as a man of uncommon wisdom and decency; and during my visit to the capital city of New Delhi, we reached agreements to strengthen US cooperation on counterterrorism, global health, nuclear security, and trade,” Obama writes. “What I couldn't tell was whether Singh's rise to power represented the future of India's democracy or merely an aberration,” he said. Obama writes that Singh at the time was worried about India's economy, cross border terrorism and the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments. During a conversation without aides and note-takers, Singh told him: "In uncertain times, Mr President, the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it's not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else." “I nodded, recalling the conversation I’d had with Václav Havel (Former President of Czechoslovakia) during my visit to Prague and his warning about the rising tide of illiberalism in Europe. If globalisation and a historic economic crisis were fueling these trends in relatively wealthy nations—if I was seeing it even in the United States with the Tea Party —how could India be immune?” he said. Across the country, millions continued to live in squalor, trapped in sunbaked villages or labyrinthine slums, even as the titans of Indian industry enjoyed lifestyles that the rajas and moguls of old would have envied, Obama writes. “Expressing hostility toward Pakistan was still the quickest route to national unity, with many Indians taking great pride in the knowledge that their country had developed a nuclear weapons program to match Pakistan’s, untroubled by the fact that a single miscalculation by either side could risk regional annihilation,” he says. Obama writes Manmohan Singh’s elevation as prime minister, sometimes heralded as a hallmark of the country's progress in overcoming sectarian divides, was somewhat deceiving. He hadn't originally become prime minister as a result of his own popularity. “In fact, he owed his position to Sonia Gandhi — the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the head of the Congress Party, who'd declined to take the job herself after leading her party coalition to victory and had instead anointed Singh. More than one political observer believed that she'd chosen Singh precisely because as an elderly Sikh with no national political base, he posed no threat to her forty-year-old son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to take over the Congress Party,” he said. In his book, Obama, referring to his meeting with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi at the dinner table, said that the Congress president listened more than she spoke, careful to defer to Singh when policy matters came up, and often steered the conversation toward her son. “It became clear to me, though, that her power was attributable to a shrewd and forceful intelligence. As for Rahul, he seemed smart and earnest, his good looks resembling his mother’s. He offered up his thoughts on the future of progressive politics, occasionally pausing to probe me on the details of my 2008 campaign,” he wrote. “But there was a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who'd done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” Obama said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/in-many-respects-modern-day-india-is-counted-as-a-success-story-says-barack-obama-916456.html

"On reaching home, after embracing his family members, he cried a lot in immense happiness and said he made a big mistake by going to Pakistan," said Circle Officer (Seesamau) Tirpurari Pandey. Shamsuddin reached his home in the city's Kanghi-Mohal here on Sunday morning, where his family and people welcomed him with garlands. He told reporters that migrants are not treated well in Pakistan and Indians are taken as ”enemies”. Shamsuddin had moved to Pakistan with an acquaintance in 1992 on getting a 90-day visit visa and then settled there after getting the country's citizenship in 1994. In 2012, the Pakistan government arrested him on charges of espionage and locked him up at a jail in Karachi. Shamsuddin reached India through the Attari-Wagah border on October 26 and served the required quarantine period in Amritsar amid the COVID-19 outbreak. At the city's Bajaria police station, Circle Officer Tirpurari Pandey welcomed him with garlands and offered sweets. Police then took him to his house at Kanghi-Mohal. People had gathered there waiting for his arrival. The crowd surrounded him and hugged him with garlands. He was congratulated for returning home after decades. Shamsuddin told mediapersons that Indians are “treated very badly” in Pakistan. "They are treated like enemies. There is a lot of bribery and corruption in Pakistan," he said. He said after the end of the visa period, people stranded in both countries should be allowed to return home.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arrested-for-spying-in-pakistan-70-year-old-kanpur-man-returns-after-28-yrs-916463.html

An Instagram slideshow, featuring the brightly colored maximalism that is the Indian designer’s signature, depicted Arora with assorted friends sampling traditional Indian snacks. Days later, he introduced a high-profile fashion collaboration with Amazon India, alongside three more of India’s most celebrated designers: JJ Valaya, Ashish Soni and Suneet Varma. Arora is also currently a member of the advisory council for the International Woolmark Prize, one of the most prestigious fashion awards in the world. At first blush, such ventures would seem like savvy lifestyle brand extensions for Arora, a former creative director of French fashion house Paco Rabanne and the first Indian designer to make it big in Paris. His aesthetic defined Indian-fusion style for Westerners in the late aughts, with a riotous palette and Indian craft methods like embroidery and appliqué. But Arora’s brand partnerships it turns out, seem to be more like belated attempts to save a business beset by years of chaos and financial troubles than an indication of success. And his messy downfall has also been particularly disappointing for those who had hoped he would help bring international attention to the quieter but vital layers of the Indian fashion industry — like the anonymous artisans (called karigars) who are responsible for much of the meticulous and beautiful handwork that goes into the garments. “Fifteen years ago, Manish was almost seen like a god here for being the first Indian fashion designer to break into the global luxury market,” said Sunil Sethi, president of the Fashion Design Council of India. European high fashion, after all, is famously white and set in its ways, and until recently known more for appropriating ideas from other cultures rather than embracing and celebrating ethnically diverse designers and artisans. “Big international brand names wanted to collaborate with him,” Sethi said. “We were just so proud. And as the international fashion industry looked at Indian talent in a new light, we wondered whether more Indian designers would follow in his footsteps to the catwalks of Europe.” Instead, today, Arora’s brand has been felled by business deals gone bad, unpaid wages lawsuits and vendor disputes that started at least three years ago, long before the coronavirus dealt the final blow. Earlier this year, Arora, who is in his late 40s, parted ways with his business partner of several decades, Deepak Bhagwani. Currently, the Manish Arora website is shut for maintenance. The brand’s last runway show, for spring 2020, was shown a year ago, and pieces that are available to buy are largely discounted, from past seasons and on sale via small, independent boutiques in the Middle East and Asia. The Manish Arora store in Paris has closed, and in messages seen by The New York Times, employees who asked the company about unpaid wages in October were told none would be forthcoming because the company was now in liquidation. According to Bhagwani, 43, the French holding company for Arora’s Indian subsidiary went into liquidation in July. Arora, reached by email in mid-October, declined to discuss the particulars of the situation. He said there was “acute disappointment” among all parties” and that he did not want to comment “on what went wrong given we are in liquidation and also the matter is in court.” “We expanded and hoped to reach the world with our unique sensibility and we tried. Sincerely,” Arora wrote. “Unfortunately things went wrong. The markets shrunk. Expenses mounted and we soldiered on to the best of our capabilities.” For the moment, he added, he was “reassessing the way forward.” That does not help, however, those he has left behind. The Fashion Hope of India Arora started out with big, global ambitions. But the same forces that have strangled other independent designer businesses — chronic discounting from retailers, outrageously expensive fashion shows, overproduction of items nobody wanted — also affected him. And instead of prioritizing responsibilities to longtime employees, it seemed Manish Arora management opted to chase profits and keep up appearances. Then the pandemic began to ravage India’s fashion industry. As Western retailers canceled orders and the Indian government abruptly locked down the country March 24, Arora and his partners had started closing their business. It also came at a time when consumer attitudes toward fashion businesses that fail to pay workers are changing — and employees are increasingly willing to speak up, said Sanchita Banerjee Saxena, executive director for the Institute for South Asia Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. Historically, India’s vast network of highly skilled embroiderers and leather workers has been overlooked compared with peers in France and Italy, despite decades of European luxury brands quietly sourcing work to India. Arora’s success in the West was seen as a potential turning point for these karigars, an Urdu word that means “artisans.” “That never came to pass,” Sethi said, who added that he never thought that spotlighting Indian heritage craft was a priority for Arora. “Under all the drama of Manish, frankly, that got lost.” Also tangled up in the mismanagement at Manish Arora were middle-class professionals in office jobs. In seven interviews with The New York Times, those professionals, along with karigars and vendors, all told a nearly identical story. Arora founded his label in 2001 with his friend Bhagwani, who steered the finances. In 2005, Arora made his international debut in London. He became creative director of Paco Rabanne in 2011 and moved into a high-end apartment in Paris a year later. He produced two seasons for the brand before leaving to focus on his own label, which soon diversified into eyewear, home wear and cosmetics. Beyond his flamboyant, critically acclaimed runway shows, Arora also received growing media attention thanks to high-profile collaborations with companies like Nespresso, Swarovski, Swatch and Reebok, a first for a homegrown Indian brand. From the start, he appeared to understand that his power lay in refashioning distinctively Indian aesthetics for white audiences. “All Indian designers need to understand the fact that in order to excel in the international market, we all have to focus on the modernity of the garment and not on the Western look,” Arora told critic Suzy Menkes in 2009. “This means that we have to take Western ideas and use Indian sensibilities to make it a global product.” At its peak, Manish Arora was sold by retailers like Printemps, Yoox, Saks Fifth Avenue, Selfridges, Neiman Marcus and Galeries Lafayette. The Delhi-based production arm, incorporated as a separate company called Three Clothing Private Limited, employed 200 people. Behind the Gilded Curtain While Arora’s business appeared to flourish abroad, however, it struggled to grow at home, according to former office staff and artisans. In 2012, Indian fashion company Biba took a 51% stake in order to help Arora expand Indian by Manish Arora, which, among other lines, included a neon-colored couture bridal collection for the domestic market. But former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared it would make it difficult to find future jobs, said that the move toward wedding collections, with a different type of clientele and lower prices, failed to excite Arora. Biba did not respond to an email requesting comment for this article. By mid-2017, Indian by Manish Arora had shut down. According to Aftab Alam, 45, a master leather worker and former employee, and Omveer Singh, 40, who worked in accounting and marketing, it was also the year that everything started falling apart. Partnerships with important stores started to dry up. According to Alam and Singh, employees’ began to be paid late, first by a few days, then a few weeks. By the end of 2017, pay was delayed by two to three months, Alam and Singh said. Alam, who later went on to sue his employer for unpaid wages, described 18-hour days without overtime pay, adding that vendors, couriers and partners also stopped receiving timely payments. If they were paid at all. According to Alam’s suit, he “sent numerous reminders to the operational debtor and visited them personally at their office for settlement of outstanding dues.” His requests, say the lawsuit, “fell on deaf ears and nothing has been done to arrange for his legitimate dues, despite the operational debtor clearly admitting his liabilities towards outstanding dues.” In a response dated June 2019 and seen by The New York Times, the company said it didn’t have the cash to pay Alam: “We are agreed to pay March and April 2019 salary, leave encashment and also his gratuity. But due to insufficient funds, we cannot currently pay this amount. We are trying to resolve it ASAP.” Unpaid interns began doing the work formerly handled by seasoned employees, like managing important photo shoots and production orders, as management struggled to balance the books and repay debts, according to a former intern, who declined to go on the record because they work in the Indian fashion industry. “They owe a lot of money to us,” said Jaf Jafri, owner of Brave Models, an Indian modeling agency that worked with Manish Arora for almost six years and took over the production of photo shoots after the brand closed its own studio. “I wrote them almost a hundred emails. No replies.” Former employees in India were told Oct. 10 that the company was in liquidation. In an email, Bhagwani said he knew that there were vendors who were still owed money. Empty Promises Artisans and production workers unionized in 2016. But before office staff had been paid, former employees said, Arora would ask for money transfers to his personal account to pay for his vacations on top of his salary and the cost of his apartment and living expenses. According to Alam, Arora also had the artisans make up to a dozen elaborate Burning Man outfits for him, a task Alam said took three artisans up to 20 days, at a time when they were still owed considerable sums for regular work and knew that the business was in trouble. In late 2017, Arora and Bhagwani left to go on their annual New Year’s jaunt to Goa, a beachside party destination on the west coast of India, posting their exploits on their Instagram stories, which were watched by their employees. Salaries were several months late. Arora denied that he asked for money transfers to his personal account to pay for vacations and living expenses, writing in an email: “For my part, I have never misused my position in the organization or wasted funds on personal expenses.” In another email, Bhagwani said that employees were always paid, and the problems in 2016 and 2017 “might have been a small cash flow issue” related to the financial output required for runway shows. In early 2018, the company stopped paying into the Provident Fund accounts, a compulsory retirement savings plan similar to Social Security, of at least a dozen employees. By the time, Intrend, a Chinese fashion holding company, and Gulshan Jhurani, an accountant whose bio on his website says he has experience in turning around troubled companies, had taken stakes in the Manish Arora business. Intrend and Jhurani did not respond to emails requesting comment for this article. In a video filmed and sent to The New York Times in August, 10 recently laid-off production workers said they were owed several months’ wages, and have not had funds deposited in their Provident Accounts for two years, despite sending a signed notice to the Indian government asking for an investigation, also viewed by The Times. All salary questions started being referred to Jhurani. “If you called Deepak, he would say to talk to Shivam in accounts,” Alam told The Times. “Shivam would then say Gulshan will help. I would then again talk to Deepak and say that they are not doing anything. Then he will say talk to them again. I said, ‘If you will do this, how will my wife and children survive?’” The company’s headquarters used to be in the industrial neighborhood of Noida, outside of Delhi, before it moved its offices and sampling studio to Dhan Mill, the poshest part of Delhi. In February 2018 the company hosted a lavish opening party. Just days later, 15 employees including Alam stated their intention to quit unless they received what they were owed. When Alam left, in April 2019, he wasn’t paid his back wages until December, after serving Manish Arora and Bhagwani with a lawsuit. Alam estimated he is still owed 263,000 rupees ($3,570) for his legally required reward for long service and vacation days not taken, and that up to 20 former workers were also owed wages. “I was the creative head and there were business heads who managed the rest, including money and administration,” Arora wrote in the email he sent to The Times about Alam’s situation and other claims by former employees. Arora declined to address specific issues but said he was “happy” to discuss “matters which I am aware of as a creative director.” He did not respond to follow-up attempts to contact him. Bhagwani said that the company had outsourced production in 2018 after receiving new investment and paid off almost 200 workers’ wages including Provident fund payments. Although he is no longer with the company, he confirmed there are workers who stayed after the consolidation with outstanding payments. In January 2020, four months after the last Manish Arora show was hosted in Paris — a celebration of LGBTQAI rights and “dreamers that defy dogma and definition,” according to the show notes — a lawyer for Jafri of Brave Models tried to serve a legal notice to partners. There was no one at the office or their homes to receive it, he said. “Our lawyers said it would be a waste of money to continue,” Jafri said, adding that he would have to spend more than half of the half a million rupees he was owed. “The lawyers told us they don’t have assets, nothing.” ‘What Happened ... We Do Not Know’ In his email to The Times, Arora said he was “taking time off to examine what I now want out of life and a career.” The next generation of Indian designers are producing wares that bear few of the hallmarks of Arora, with his neon hearts and sparkling stars. Some, like Rahul Mishra, have made the leap to Paris, and Ruchika Sachdeva of Bodice won the International Woolmark Prize in 2018. But according to Supriya Dravid, an author and former editor-in-chief of Elle India, the designers behind Bodice — and newer labels like Yavi, Two Point Two and Lovebirds — are “creative pragmatists,” with efforts directed toward slowly and steadily building the foundations of a global brand, and not necessarily a distinctively Indian one. “Their goals are more about engaging with a newer, diverse community of global aesthetes,” Dravid said. “It’s about the power of the right kind of influence and how that might translate into commercial success.” Arora has defended the creative vision on which he made his name. “People often call my work kitschy, which it isn’t,” Arora told Grazia India in July. “Kitsch refers to design in poor taste, often from another time, thereby questioning its relevance.” To his former employees, Arora became a dreamer who appeared to exist in a world as fantastical as the vividly dreams he put on the runway. “When I was working with them all — and with Manish — he was a big international name,” former employee Singh said. “Now what happened, what they did, we do not know.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/for-fashion-designer-manish-arora-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold-916500.html

The apex court said high courts have all the power to strike down Central Acts, like the Epidemic Act, and the petitioner should go there first. “What kind of petition you have filed Mr Mirashi (petitioner). Don't you have the Bombay High Court to challenge the Epidemic Act?

You withdraw it from here and file in the high court,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee. The apex court observed that the contention of the petitioner that high courts do not have the power to strike down a Central Act is “totally misconceived”. “The high court has all the powers to do this,” the bench told the petitioner who had raised an issue regarding the Covid-19 quarantine policy of the Maharashtra government.

17-11-2020||National||Tourists start arriving in Kashmir gradually after twin lockdowns||After facing severe hit due to twin lockdowns since last August, tourist have begun arriving in Kashmir in recent weeks, though not in high numbers. Since last August, the Valley did not see much tourist arrivals first due to the lockdown imposed after the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 and then due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March this year. According to official figures, the Kashmir tourism industry suffered a whopping Rs 1166.81 crore from August 2019 to August 2020. However, tourism players are optimistic that in the winter season, the Valley will be an attractive destination for domestic tourists in view of the barred international travel due to Covid-19. “Enquires (from tourists) have started to take place for the winter months and the numbers are far better than they were during the past one and a half months,” said Farooq Ahmad Kuthoo, President of Travel Agents Association of Kashmir (TAAK), a representative of more than 100 tourism agencies. He termed these enquiries as “breaking the ice.” “We expect numbers at the year end. Tourists want to see snow. A good number of inquiries come from Gujarat and Maharashtra. We hope that numbers will be better as restrictions are still on international travel. Domestic tourists will prefer Kashmir for its scenic beauty,” Kuthoo added. Director Tourism, Kashmir, Nisar Ahmad too is optimistic saying tourist arrivals have started to pick up in the past weeks. “More than 600 tourists arrived in the Valley by air on Sunday. This is just the beginning and we are getting good enquiries too,” he said. Ahmad said the Department is putting in all efforts to facilitate tourist arrivals in Kashmir. “We are aware people belonging to the industry are suffering. Be it a Shikara wallah, a taxi wallah, a hotel owner or travel agent — all of them are suffering,” he said. Aijaz Ahmad, a senior manager at one of the five star hotels in Srinagar, feels the current Covid-19 situation across the world may attract some domestic tourists to Kashmir around new year as there is a bar on international travel. “The number of enquiries by tourists is a positive sign. People are showing interest to visit Kashmir and it has generated some hope,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tourists-start-arriving-in-kashmir-gradually-after-twin-lockdowns-916558.html

"Some of these funds were once again, directly or indirectly, through structured transactions, and some of the structures set up by me were routed into investments in India." In his statement, he also mentioned a company named Pristine River Investments which is linked to Kamal Nath’s son, Bakul Nath. He said, “We (another accused Sushen Mohan Gupta and himself) received bridge funding through Pristine River Investments, a company managed by John Docherty for Bakul Nath, son of Kamal Nath. Thus, indirectly funds from Interstellar Technologies and Global Services were used to repay the loans from Pristine River Investments.” However, both Kamal Nath and Salman Khurshid rejected these claims saying that there were no documents or bank accounts that would prove Saxena's claims. “As far as my son, Bakul Nath, is concerned, he is an NRI based in Dubai. I had heard about him being described as the Beneficial Owner of Pristine River and when I spoke to my son, he said he knew nothing about the company. There are no documents or bank accounts which prove a connection to him. Anyone can open an offshore account and put a name of someone as Beneficial Owner and not even inform him. He may not even know about it,” Nath told the publication.  Recently, the CBI has sought sanction to prosecute former defence secretary Shashi Kant Sharma, who later became Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in connection with the VVIP chopper deal. Agusta Westland deal A proposal for new helicopters as an alternative to the IAF's Soviet-era Mi8s to ferry VVIPs -- the President, the Prime Minister, the Vice President, and the Defence Minister -- was put forth in 1999. The IAF had pitched for high altitude flying helicopter. Since Agusta Westland's helicopters did not meet the 6,000-meter ceiling parameter of the IAF, it was out of the list. The CBI has alleged that the then IAF chief S P Tyagi played a role in recommending a reduction in the operational ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 meters to 4,500 meters which opened a way for Agusta Westland to join the race. This, according to the CBI, was allegedly done at the behest of Finmeccanica and Agusta Westland top executives who engaged the services of three middlemen -- Christain Michel, Guido Haschke, and Carlos Gerosa. They allegedly paid bribes to Tyagi and his cousins Rajiv, Sandeep, and Julie.  The agency has also alleged that Michel's firms received about 42.27 million euros, approximately seven per cent, from the companies to swing the Rs 3,600 crore deal in their favour.  The bribes were allegedly routed through companies of Michel and an advocate, Gautam Khaitan, in the form of multiple contracts through layered transactions to camouflage them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/key-agusta-westland-accused-names-kamal-naths-son-salman-khurshid-in-statement-report-916559.html

The active caseload which now stands at 4,53,401 comprises just 5.11% of all cumulative cases. "India has been recording around 30,000 daily new cases of Covid-19 for the last two consecutive days. The country has also seen less than 50,000 daily new cases being registered continuously for the past ten days.  "While this signifies the wide adoption of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among the population, it also assumes significance in view of the high number of daily cases being continuously reported in many countries in Europe and America," the ministry said.

17-11-2020||National||Digital divide between ‘have devices’ and ‘have not’ deepens – and so does student despair||One smartphone, three siblings equals zero online classes. The stark equation by Mohit Ahirwar, the son of a labourer, explains not just his own learning predicament but that of millions of students on the other side of the digital divide. The yawning gulf between the ‘have-nots’ and ‘haves’ with access to devices and stable internet connections needed for an online education, be it pre-school or post grad, became that much wider with LSR student Aishwarya Reddy ending her life at her Hyderabad home this month because her parents couldn’t afford a laptop or a smartphone. Her father G Srinivas Reddy -- an auto mechanic who mortgaged his home and discontinued his younger daughter’s education so Aishwarya could go to the prestigious Delhi college -- said she required a device to attend online classes and had even reached out for help. But the worries, including over fees and scholarship, mounted and the 19-year-old was found hanging in her home on November 2. As the spotlight swivelled to a crisis of ever-growing magnitude, 16-year-old Ahirwal, a Class 10 student at a government school in Jammu, wondered how he will cope. He is not aware of the term “digital divide” but is good in Maths and has come up with his own calculation to underscore the hopelessness of his situation. "One smartphone, three siblings is equal to zero online classes. My father is a labourer. We own one smartphone which he takes with him when he is out for work. So my 12-year-old sister and I can’t attend online classes. My brother has already dropped out of school because of this and is now learning carpentry,” he told PTI. “I asked my father if we could us another phone. He said he would try,” the teen added in a matter of fact tone. Speaking with the maturity of one much older, Ahirwar said his father earns between Rs 15,000-20,000 a month, barely enough to make ends meet -- and certainly not to buy an gadget. The lack of devices is not the only obstacle. Low internet speeds is another. Like him, many students are fighting the multiple challenges of education in the pandemic era which has forced schools and colleges across the spectrum to shift from physical to online classes since March. Competing with siblings and parents for ‘gadget time’, struggling with poor internet connections, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir where 4G is banned and in remote areas, and frequent power outages are among the many hurdles on their way to quality learning. Across the country, only one in 10 households has a computer, desktop, laptop or tablet, according to a 2017-18 National Statistical Office (NSO) report. Besides, only 23.8 per cent households have access to the internet and 12.5 per cent of the country’s 35 crore students access to smartphones, it added. The digital divide exists even in India’s most elite colleges and is driving a rift that deepens as Covid-19 continues its spread. The uncertainty over a situation that doesn’t show any signs of ending is creating its own set of problems. A digital survey conducted by LSR — to which 1,450 of the college's 2,000 students sent their response — showed nearly 30 per cent of its students did not have a laptop of their own while 40 per cent said they were attending online classes without a proper internet connection. Over 95 per cent of students said online classes had affected their mental and physical health. One of the students who had participated and flagged her concerns about the online classes in the survey was Aishwarya Reddy. It’s a brutal ‘online’ world out there, as Reddy learnt and Ahirwar is learning. The names of Devika Balakrishnan, the daughter of a daily wage labourer in Kerala, Shibani Kumari, whose father is a truck driver in West Bengal, don’t ring a bell for Ahirwar. Both the girls were Class 10 students and ended their lives because they didn’t have phones to attend their online classes in June, just three months into the nationwide lockdown. But Rajni Gupta, Ahirwar’s teacher at the Government Higher Secondary School in Jammu, knows about them and worries about what the future holds. The stories are many, some resulting in desperate students ending their lives in frustration and others about parents, barely making enough to feed their families, selling what little they own to buy that precious smartphone. "I have over 100 students in my class. But my zoom classes so far have not seen attendance beyond 20. Most of the parents are low income people who toil hard. How can we expect them to get their children a computer, laptop or smartphones?” Gupta asked. The issue of internet availability only widens the gap. According to the 2017-18 National Sample Survey report on education, only 24 per cent of Indian households have internet facility. While 66 per cent of India's population lives in villages, a little over 15 per cent of rural households have access to internet services -- for urban households, the proportion is 42 percent. The situation is worse for Class 10 and 12 students. All their learning content is now available online only and they need one GB data per hour, which is very difficult, argued Sant Ram, district secretary (West A) at Government School Teachers Association (GSTA), Delhi. "Only 25 per cent of government school children have access to mobile phones -- and those are not personal devices -- they usually belong to their parents, and they take the phones with them when they leave for work. These students are increasingly developing an inferiority complex because they are lagging behind in their education," he added. The result – an alarming number of dropouts. A survey by the NGO Save the Children revealed that children in 62 per cent of Indian households have discontinued their education since the coronavirus pandemic. It surveyed 7,235 families from 15 states in India between June 7 and June 30. Many institutions are coming forward with different solutions to help students and their parents in these tumultuous times. The NGO ChildFund, for instance, is following what it calls a "blended approach" -- a mix of offline and online -- across 2,500 government schools in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi. It is organising "neighbourhood classes" following social-distancing norms, distributing books, making phone calls and even visiting homes to keep the learning going. "Our blended approach is more tilted towards offline solutions like story books, conversation charts, workbooks, worksheets as well as ensuring a component of contact…,” said educationist Aekta Chand who works with ChildFund India. "Going ahead, we feel that slowly reopening schools is the only way even if it means having children come in very small groups just once a week," she added. While states like Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh or Maharashtra have allowed the reopening of schools -- in some cases restricted to the higher classes only -- many, including Delhi and Odisha, have so far have decided against it. The Tamil Nadu government has revoked its decision of reopening schools and colleges from November 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/digital-divide-between-have-devices-and-have-not-deepens-and-so-does-student-despair-916576.html

India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said this on Monday while speaking in the UN General Assembly on ‘question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council’. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UN Munir Akram, in his speech, made references to the Line of Control as he voiced opposition to India’s UNSC membership. “I do not wish to waste the time of this Assembly by responding to the irrelevant and irresponsible remarks made by the representative of Pakistan, which becomes 'Pavlovian' whenever India is mentioned," the Indian envoy said, referring to Islamabad's automatic or predictable reactions in the past. "This is a forum for serious debate, not frivolous allegations,” Tirumurti said. At present, the UNSC comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent member countries which are elected for a two-year term by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the United States and these countries can veto any substantive resolution. There has been a growing demand to increase the number of permanent members to reflect the contemporary global reality. India, Brazil, South Africa, Germany and Japan are strong contenders for permanent membership of the UNSC which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-becomes-pavlovian-whenever-india-is-mentioned-india-at-unga-916587.html

The two chief ministers were supposed to visit the temple on Monday after attending the portal closing ceremony at the Kedarnath shrine. However, the visit had to be put off due to heavy snowfall at Kedarnath. Rawat and Adityanath spent the night at Gauchar and reached Badrinath in a helicopter around 9.30 am, Dharmadhikari of Badrinath temple Bhuvan Chandra Uniyal said. Traditional musical instruments of Uttarakhand were played to welcome Adityanath, he said. Accompanied by Rawat all along, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister spent around 15 minutes at the Himalayan shrine and prayed for everyone's happiness by chanting the Vedic hymn "Sarve bhavantu sukhinah". After offering prayers, the two chief ministers left for the foundation stone laying ceremony of a guest house being built by the Uttar Pradesh government in Badrinath. The guest house will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 11 crore in traditional Garhwali style using eco-friendly technology. It will have 40 rooms. Later, Rawat and Adityanath visited the last Indian village on the India-China border and spoke to Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel deployed there.

The technical education regulator had in 2017 published a gazette notification regarding major or core branches of engineering and their appropriate courses leading to degree in Engineering or Technology for recruitment in teaching positions. “In spite this, the council receives a large number of grievances from faculty members and requests from governments, Directorates of Technical Education (DTEs) pertaining to eligibility for faculty positions in the AICTE approved institutions,” an official order said. “In view of the above, it is to clarify that, AICTE will not be providing equivalence to the qualifications obtained from council approved institution and departments at any level for higher education purpose as well as for employment purpose. It is up to the employer to decide the suitability for a particular post in case of employment purpose and it is up to the institution for higher studies in case of academic purpose,” it added. The council had in August notified that queries on equivalence or relevance of nomenclatures for different engineering and technology branches for recruiting faculty should be resolved at the state level “The list comprises all nomenclatures which AICTE had approved for their institutions to run. However, it is beyond the scope of AICTE to include and update from time to time the nomenclatures offered by various IITs, NITs, universities as these institutions are empowered to start courses with the approval of their board of governors or academic council without the knowledge of AICTE,” member secretary Rajive Kumar had said. "Hence making an exhaustive list of nomenclatures to give further clarity is not practical for AICTE nor it is necessary," he had added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aicte-not-to-provide-equivalence-of-nomenclatures-for-different-engineering-tech-branches-916602.html

This is the second year the ministry has hired private agencies for a pilot study of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing data collection in agricultural areas of 100 districts for assessing gram panchayat level under the PMFBY. "Since harvesting in selected 100 rice growing districts is in full swing currently and will be completed shortly as per the crop season, we have requested the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to give approval for flying drones over selected regions," the official told PTI. A letter in this regard has been written to the DGCA seeking permission for agencies such as AMNEX, Agrotech, RMSI Pvt Ltd and Weather Risk Management Services Private Ltd to operate drones for two months till December 31, he said. The official mentioned that the drone-based images are one of the important inputs in the models for crop yield estimation and validation. The shortlisted agencies have already started the study in their assigned regions as per the time schedule. The drone-based images will be captured in 10 states -- Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. On benefits of using drones for the PMFBY, the official said crop damage valuations have traditionally been difficult to make as it is carried out manually after an insurable event such as floods, drought or pest infestation. However, the remote sensing data captured through drones will help get the accurate information on crop conditions and losses to farmers, and shorten timelines for crop insurance claims, he explained. "After the success of pilot studies, it will be scaled up," the official added. As per the official data, about 241.7 lakh hectare farm land has been insured in the 2020 kharif season.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/crop-insurance-agri-ministry-seeks-dgca-nod-to-take-drone-based-crop-images-in-100-districts-916605.html
17-11-2020||National||59% of Information Commissioners appointed so far are retired officials||Retired government officials have occupied more than half of the Information Commissioners’ posts so far, though the RTI Act prescribes broad criteria for selection, while women find it very difficult to get a seat in Information Commissions across the country. A study by Satark Nagrik Sangathan and Centre for Equity Studies shows that 59% of the around 400 Information Commissioners appointed so far and for whom background material is available are retired government officials. The next to follow are those with a legal background with 17% -- 13% lawyers and 4% retired judges. Journalists (10%) , academics and social workers (4% each) form the other chunk. The proportion is skewed further when one analyses the background of 122 Chief Information Commissioners as 84% of them were retired government officials, which included 65% former IAS officers. When it comes to gender parity, the country’s Information Commissions appear to build a wall – only 10% of the Information Commissioners appointed so far are women. Fourteen states, including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh, have never appointed a woman as Information Commissioner since its inception. Among the heads, only 7% are women so far and currently, not a single woman heads the Information Commission. "One explanation could be that these posts are sought after by retired and retiring civil servants, who often enjoy political patronage and are perhaps seen as being more pliant by the political masters," the 'Report Card of Information Commissions 2019-20' said. Among the 29 Information Commissions, including the Central Information Commissions, three of them -- West Bengal, Sikkim and Meghalaya have never appointed an Information Commissioner who was not a government servant. Gujarat's 93% commissioners were former officials while 90% in Assam, 88% in Assam and 86% each in Maharashtra and Mizoram were drawn from the government sector.  More than half of the Information Commissioners appointed in 16 Commissions so far were retired government officials. In Karnataka, this figure was 54% while neighbouring Tamil Nadu has 58%, Andhra Pradesh (43%), Kerala (38%) and Telangana (14%). Interestingly, lawyers and journalists were the other groups who found more space in these Commissions. In Goa, 33% of the Information Commissioners were lawyers while in Jharkhand, 36% were former judges. Uttar Pradesh and Telangana had 43% each Information Commissioners with journalism as their background. Madhya Pradesh was another state with a higher proportion of journalists as Information Commissioners at 28%. The government has recently appointed senior journalist Uday Mahurkar in the Central Information Commission. The report said the Information Commissions need to be better-balanced bodies having greater gender parity and a mix of former civil servants, legal professionals, social activists, academics, journalists and other professionals. "Even if decisions are taken by individual members, diversity would strengthen the working of Commissions by providing Commissioners opportunities to discuss cases with other Commissioners from different backgrounds, so that the final orders are a manifestation of all the experience and expertise that a Commission, with a varied membership, would be privy to," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/59-of-information-commissioners-appointed-so-far-are-retired-officials-916613.html

Areas that were not previously considered by working professionals are now experiencing greater demand, it said, citing latest data. Potential homebuyers were earlier researching best localities to buy a house near their workplace. But data from the platform shows how it has all changed since the onset of the pandemic. Earlier, proximity to workplace took the topmost spot among homebuyers' considerations. "But ever since the Covid-19 outbreak triggered the new normal and work from home became the norm, the demand in areas other than the ones located near IT hubs has been increasing," it said in a statement. In Bangaluru, localities such as Whitefield, Marathahalli, HSR Layout, and Electronic city which were sought-after in pre-Covid times, have experienced a decrease in demand. Localities that are attracting greater interest from homebuyers post May 2020 include Horamavu (32 per cent), Yelahanka (56 per cent), RT Nagar (42 per cent), and Hebbal (36 per cent), according to its data. The prices in areas that are not strategically located around IT hubs are more affordable and living conditions are better as they experience less traffic. The NoBroker portal has registered a growing demand for bigger houses like three and four BHKs. A similar pattern is being observed in Chennai as well. The platform has received more queries for localities such as Ambattur (46 per cent), Perambur (105 per cent), Kolathur (77 per cent), Mylapore (31 per cent) and Valasaravakkam (26 per cent). Only a few months ago, the more popular and in demand areas were Velachery, Madipakkam, Pallikaranai, Porur, and Choolaimedu. The data on the platform also indicated a similar trend in Hyderabad where areas such as Malkajgiri (26 per cent), Kothapet (18 per cent), Nagole (19 per cent), Toli Chowki (nine per cent) and Ramachandra Puram (12 per cent) are more in demand than ever before. In Delhi-NCR, some of the regions that are experiencing a spike in demand in the post-pandemic landscape include Rohini (126 per cent), Dwarka (73 per cent), Vaishali (69 per cent), Okhla (53 per cent), and Indirapuram (53 per cent). In Pune, the regions that homebuyers are showing keener interest in include Baner (28 per cent), Ambegaon BK (16 per cent), Wadgaon Sheri (31 per cent), Hinjewadi (68 per cent), and Wagholi (25 per cent), it was stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-work-from-home-norm-spikes-housing-demand-in-suburbs-916616.html

The ancient education system in the country used to focus on developing holistic and well-rounded personalities and taught people to live in harmony with nature and respect all, he said. "Our education was practical, wholesome, and complementary to life. In fact, education was seen as a continuous process of learning," Naidu said, addressing virtually the 13th convocation of National Institute of Technology (NIT) at Agartala from here. "The New Education Policy is underpinned by the same vision. It aims at making India a global knowledge super-power and seeks to bring a paradigm shift in the entire education system," he said. Urging the higher education institutions and universities to make India a thriving hub of knowledge and innovation, Naidu advised them to take up cutting edge research in various fields, establish synergy with industries and other similar institutions and turn campuses into exciting centres of creativity and research. Recalling the advice of former president late A P J Abdul Kalam to the youth to dream big, the Vice-President asked the students to set a goal and strive hard to achieve it. He opined that it was time for the universities, IITs, NITs and other higher education institutions to fully reorient their teaching methods and equip the teachers with new pedagogical skills in tune with the 21st-century requirements. Naidu urged the corporate sector to identify key research projects in various sectors and fund them under CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiatives. Noting that about 65 per cent of the countrys population comprised youth, Naidu called for fully channeling their energies and creating the right ecosystem for promoting entrepreneurship among them. He lauded NIT Agartala for being ranked within 100 best engineering institutions under the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-education-policy-aims-at-making-india-a-global-knowledge-superpower-venkaiah-naidu-916630.html

A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde expressed strong displeasure over an affidavit by the Union government, referring to a self-regulatory mechanism like News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA). "We want to know the mechanism employed by you and this affidavit has nothing on it. Why should we refer to NBSA etc when you have the authority to look into it. If it does not exist then you create an authority else we will hand it over to an outside agency," the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The law officer said the NBSA is a self-regulatory body. "The Centre has ample powers to regulate the content of TV channels but takes a very cautious approach as a right to free speech as a fundamental right is available to media," he said. "What is shown in TV channels is of great consequences for the country," the bench said, asking Mehta the Centre to tell what mechanism it has under Cable TV Network Regulation Act and what action taken against fake news in three weeks. Mehta agreed to file an elaborate affidavit. The court was hearing a petition by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind, alleging "communal headlines and bigoted statements" by a section of media on Tablighi Jamaat participants in Nizamuddin Markaz here in March 2020. It said Section 20 of the Cable TV Network Act, provided the remedy in case of bad reporting.  The government had earlier in August told the court that an “attempt to seek a blanket gag order against the entire media” would meddle with freedom of Indians to know about various sections of the nation and the right of the journalists to ensure an informed society". The court had in October said freedom of speech is one of the most abused freedoms in recent times.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-centre-to-create-mechanism-to-deal-with-fake-news-916631.html

Demanding answers from the Congress leadership, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that from the Jeep scandal, the Bofors scam to the submarine scandal and several more, Congress leaders for their benefit made a "mockery" of national security. Citing a media report on the key accused in the chopper deal mentioning the names of senior Congress leaders like Salman Khurshid and Ahmed Patel, and Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri, he said, "Whenever you think of a kickback in a military deal, think of some Congress leaders." "No defence deal without a loot, no defence deal without a kickback and no defence deal without some Congress leaders becoming beneficiary of it has been the go-to policy of Congress leaders," the BJP leader said at a press conference. The Congress president and "the prince of the party" have to answer to the people, Prasad said. In 2010, there were talks of buying AgustaWestland helicopters for VVIPs like the president and the prime minister at a cost of Rs 3,600 crore, Prasad said. Two years later, media reports revealed that kickbacks had been given in the deal, the Union minister said. Though the Manmohan Singh-led UPA-2 government had ordered a CBI inquiry but no progress was made until the BJP-led NDA government was formed in May 2014. Thereafter, arrests were made in the case, Prasad said. Now, the key accused in the case, Rajiv Saxena, has mentioned the names of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri and son Bakul Nath, along with names of other Congress leaders Salman Khurshid and Ahmed Patel in his statements before the Enforcement Directorate (ED), he said. "The BJP demands that the Congress party not maintain silence on this grave issue. The nation is awake and listening," Prasad said and asked "why do we always get names of Congress leaders whenever a defence deal is referred to an investigative agency".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/whenever-you-think-of-kickback-in-defence-deal-think-of-congress-leaders-bjp-916633.html

Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Rural Development Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and UP Minister for Industrial Development Satish Mahana paid a visit to the family of Pintu Nishad (25), who had died in the incident. They handed over a cheque for Rs 5 lakh to the victim’s kin, District Magistrate Alok Tiwari said. Taking note of the incident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday had instructed that the accused be booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA), which allows preventive detention for up to a year. Two policemen were removed and sent to the Police Lines for their alleged laxity. On Monday, police had arrested Anjum (36); Mohammad Mohsin (27); Sarfraz Alam (23) and Meraj (21), all residents of Jajmau's Wajidpur. SP Raj Kumar Agarwal had said Pintu Nishad and his friend had Sandeep had accidentally stepped on a water pouch lying on the road.

The high court also asked AWBI and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) to find out what happened to the missing animals. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar directed the AWBI and CZA to file an affidavit disclosing the status of the circus animals registered with the Board and listed the matter for further hearing in January 2021. The direction was issued after the court was informed by the Federation of Indian Animals Protection Organisation (FIAPO) that according to the survey report filed by AWBI, around 740 circus animals were registered with it, but in the survey only 28 were found. "It is a serious issue. Out of 740 registered with you (AWBI), you have only 28 to answer for. What happened to the rest of them," the high court asked AWBI during the hearing. It further said, in its order, that "One shocking state that has been revealed is that of the 740 animals registered with AWBI, information is available only available with regard to 28, leaving a massive gap.." It asked AWBI and CZA to indicate in their affidavits the status of all the circus animals registered with them and also why the Board only inspected 19 out of the 28 circuses in the country. It also directed the Board to inform the court how many circuses are operational and what happens to the animals in circuses which have been shut down. During the hearing, an official from CZA told the bench that animals of closed down circuses and those not registered with AWBI are the concern and responsibility of the respective state wildlife authority. The high court was informed that the authorities were in the process of withdrawing recognition of the Great Golden Circus in Gujarat, the only circus in the entire country which is recognised under the Wildlife Protection Act. Action is being taken against it for alleged violation of the provisions of the Act with regard to maintenance and display of captive elephants, the CZA told the court. The high court was hearing the PILs filed by the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and FIAPO for protection of animals in circuses stranded across the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic. PETA India, represented by advocates Aman Hingorani and Swati Sumbly, has claimed in its plea that due to the Covid-19 outbreak and resultant lockdown, circuses are finding it difficult to feed the animals which at various stages of starvation. It has sought a direction to the Centre to immediately notify the Performing Animals (Registration) Amendment Rules of 2018 which expressly prohibit training and exhibition of performing animals in circuses and "mobile entertainment facilities".   FIAPO, which is a group of 100 organisations and works towards the protection of animal rights for over a decade, has challenged the constitutional validity of sections 21 to 27 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act so far as they permit exhibition and training of animals in relation to circus acts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/circus-delhi-hc-shocked-by-huge-gap-in-animals-registered-with-awbi-and-those-found-in-inspection-916646.html

The major highlight of the four-day exercise is participation of Indian Navy's Vikramaditya carrier battle group and the Nimitz strike group of the US Navy. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship. The first phase of the Malabar exercise took place in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and featured a number of complex drills including anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations. The Australian Navy has deployed its HMAS Ballarat, an Anzac-class frigate while the Japanese Navy has sent its leading destroyer JS Murasame for the exercise. The mega exercise is taking place at a time India and China are locked in an over six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh. This exercise is involving coordinated operations of increasing complexity among the navies of the four countries which are part of the Quad or Quadrilateral Coalition, officials said. "The two carriers, along with other ships, submarines and aircraft of the participating navies, would be engaged in high-intensity naval operations over four days," the Indian Navy said on Monday. A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships. The Navy said the exercise will include cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz. Apart from Vikramaditya and its fighter and helicopter air-wings, the Indian Navy is also deploying destroyers Kolkata and Chennai, stealth frigate Talwar and fleet support ship Deepak in the exercise. The Indian contingent is being led by Rear Admiral Krishna Swaminathan, Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet. Last month, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad which is primarily focusing on containing China's military expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region. China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the 'Quad' member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/second-phase-of-malabar-exercise-begins-in-northern-arabian-sea-916664.html

Addressing the summit of five-nation grouping BRICS via videoconferencing, the prime minister also said there was a need to tackle the problem of terrorism in an organised manner. The 12th BRICS summit, hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, was also attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. "Terrorism is the biggest problem the world is facing. We have to ensure that the countries that support and assist the terrorists are also held guilty," the prime minister said. Though, Modi did not name any country, his reference is seen as directed at Pakistan.  The BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) is known as an influential bloc that represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world's population. The BRICS countries have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion. In his address, Modi also underlined the need for reform of the United Nations Security Council as well as multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund. Talking about the Covid-19 crisis, Modi said India's vaccine production and delivery capabilities will work in the interest of humanity. The Prime Minister also highlighted reform initiatives undertaken by his government under the 'self-reliant India' campaign. "We have started a comprehensive reform process under the 'Self-reliant India' campaign. The campaign is based on the belief that a self-reliant and resilient India post-COVID can be a force multiplier for the global economy and make a strong contribution to the global value chains," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/terrorism-biggest-global-problem-countries-supporting-terrorists-need-to-be-held-guilty-says-pm-modi-916667.html

The Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) is expected to meet soon to take a decision,” a member of the CCPA told DH. Currently, Delhi is witnessing a third surge in Covid-19 cases with more than 6800 cases being reported on an average every day between November 1 and November 13. Delhi has so far seen more than 4.89 lakh infections since the outbreak of the pandemic of which 7,713 have succumbed to the disease. Four Parliamentarians have succumbed to Covid-19 – Union Minister Suresh Angadi, Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar, Tirupati MP Balli Durga Prasad and Rajya Sabha member Ashok Gasti. Usually, the Winter Session of Parliament begins in the third week of November and continues December 23. There have been instances when the Winter Session was convened in December and had continued till early January. The monsoon session of Parliament had been summoned from September 14 to October 1 with sittings also scheduled on Saturdays and Sundays amid special measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19 during the period. However, the session had to be cut short by eight days as 40 members and a large number of support staff in Parliament tested positive for Covid-19 during the session period. The Budget Session of Parliament begins on January 31 with the address of President Ram Nath Kovind to the joint sitting of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, followed by the presentation of the Union Budget on February 1. Parliament did not have winter sessions in 1975, 1979 and 1984. According to the Constitution, there should not be a gap of six months or more between two sessions of Parliament.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/parliaments-winter-session-unlikely-amid-covid-19-surge-in-delhi-916668.html

Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, accompanied by his wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas, visited the historic Shivaji Park at Dadar and paid tributes to late Balasaheb. Later speaking to the media, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the party stands by the ideals of Balasaheb and the path he has shown.  “We were, we are, and will always be Hindutvawadi… We don’t play Hindutva politics like them. Whenever the country needs us, Shiv Sena will always come forward wielding the sword of Hindutva," he said. Raut, a Rajya Sabha member and executive editor of Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, said in an apparent reference to the BJP that Shiv Sena does not want any certificate from any party on its Hindutva credentials. This was an apparent reference to BJP, its former saffron ally, with which Shiv Sena broke ties and joined hands with the Congress-NCP combine to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “Last year on this day, the process of government formation was on… this year Uddhavji is paying tributes as a chief minister… it was Balasaheb’s wish to see a Shiv Sainik occupying the chair of the chief minister,” he said. “Balasaheb took up the issues of sons-of-the-soil and unemployment 55 years ago. Today, the same issue is the mainstay of all social and political movements… you would have seen these were the two main issues in the recently-concluded Bihar polls,” he said. Raut also targeted the BJP for its demand for renaming New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to Swami Vivekananda. It may be recalled that last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda on the JNU campus. “Yes… there could be a big international university named after Swami Vivekananda… we must build one... the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru cannot be undone… he will remain the pride of the country,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shiv-sena-doesnt-need-certificate-on-hindutva-from-any-party-raut-916681.html

A decision has also been taken to increase house to house surveillance of active cases in containment zones and other vulnerable pockets for which 7,000-8,000 teams will be put on this exercise, an increase from the existing 3,000 teams that are currently involved. Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said Delhi was testing very less in June at around 5,776 tests per day and that number rose to over 50,000 in September which after it plateaud out and the recent spike of Covid-19 cases may be because many positive cases escaped the net. "In the last two days, decision of urgent actions taken by the government included an increase in overall beds, including ICU beds, doubling testing to 1-1.2 lakh per day, right mix of RT-PCR and antigen tests, strengthening and augmenting home care support, mobilising doctors and nurses, enforcing quarantine of contacts, containment zone SOPs and Covid appropriate behaviour," he said. Elaborating further, NITI Aayog member V K Paul who heads Covid-19 national taskforce said the ICU bed capacity will be increased from 3,523 to over 6,000 in the next few days in hospitals across Delhi. "The capacity, which was 3,523, we will increase it to over 6,000 ICU beds in the next few days. Arrangement of over 537 new ICU beds have been made at the 1000-bed Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Covid facility operated by DRDO. The Delhi government is making arrangements for 2,680 ICU beds, and big hospitals under the Centre like Safdarjung and Lady Harding, in these also 45 beds will be increased. We have a plan to increase ICU bed strength by 80 per cent," he said. On increasing the testing capacity, Paul said that arrangements would be put in place to enable ICMR and central government laboratories to do 10,000 more tests a day. Besides that, 10 mobile laboratories will be deployed in the national capital. "We will utilise the capacity of science and technology research institutes for testing too," he said. "If cases go up higher, we plan to ramp up the capacity to monitor 35,000 to 40,000 active cases in home isolation at any given time. We have a plan along with the Delhi government on that," he said. Paul further said that private sector has been a very important part of the government's efforts. "In order to improve coordination 10 multidisciplinary teams have been constituted which will visit private health facilities in Delhi to see whether they are following COVID-19 protocols and also help them serve the people better," he said. "We can also take help of railways to provide quarantine beds. And in this regard 800 beds have been made available," he said. Giving an overall picture, Bhushan said over 12.65 crore Covid-19 tests have been conducted so far and the cumulative positivity rate has come down to 7.01 per cent "Ten states and UTs, including Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala and West Bengal, account for 76.7 pc of the total active cases of COVID-19 in the country. We believe that effects of elections, Durga Puja, Diwali etc are still to be played out in full and may be seen in the coming weeks. We have to keep watching the new cases very carefully," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/doubling-testing-capacity-adding-icu-beds-among-steps-taken-to-tackle-spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-centre-916686.html

It said its policy gave a choice to the viewers either to see all or any sides of a particular view or to choose a particular side on any events, issues and happenings across the world. "News reports and other articles in this (Tablighi Jamaat) context have reflected multiple viewpoints of the stakeholders related to the events, and predominantly stuck to a balanced and neutral perspective," the Information and Broadcasting Ministry said in an affidavit. On any particular issue, there could be several views and perceptions in the public domain. As a matter of journalistic policy, any section of the media may seek to highlight different events, issues and happenings across the world as per their choice, it added. However, access to different sections of the media, with varying journalistic polices enables the viewers or readers to know various sides, social, economic, health or even religious issue thereby providing a choice on the source of knowledge or opinion, it said. The Ministry opposed a plea filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind against media coverage, saying there were wide-ranging views and opinions on media platforms, which were not communal in nature. However, it also pointed out in exercise of the statutory powers under the existing regime, central government has issued several directions to prevent dissemination of fake news leading to abrogation of communal harmony. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has been issuing advisories from time to time to TV channels to adhere to the programme code. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has power to issue directions for blocking of information by public under section 69A of IT Act 2000, and Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of information by Public) Rules, 2009. With regard to tackling false or fake news appearing on digital and electronic media, it said the Press lnformation Bureau (PIB) already has a unit which looked at such matters. During the month of March and April, 2020, the PIB social media handle has done Covid-19 related fact-checks in 119 cases appearing in the media, including 83 on social media, seven on television, three in print media, 15 on WhatsApp, and 11 on online news portals, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-defends-media-reporting-on-tablighi-jamaat-says-most-reports-were-not-communal-in-nature-916692.html

In this regard, the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence proposes an Oversight Body.         "The oversight body must play an enabling role under the following broad areas: research, technical, legal, policy, societal issues of AI," the draft document said. The oversight mechanism may serve in an advisory capacity and it must interface with existing regulators across sectors.           "Technology easily blends across other technologies and must not be viewed in silo. Ethics should be seen as not just limited to AI but also other emerging technologies such as AR (augmented reality),VR (virtual reality) etc," it said.               The draft document also noted that the government may support research on the impact of AI in the Indian context and fundamental research to advance 'Responsible AI' by prioritising funding opportunities and fellowship programs           "International alliances may be leveraged to facilitate exchange of multi-disciplinary talent, data, and consolidation of research efforts, especially in areas of social good," it said. It also said an ethics committee may be constituted for the procurement, development, operations phase of AI systems and be made accountable for adherence to the Responsible AI principles.             The Aayog has invited comments on the draft document by stakeholders by December 15.         The Niti Aayog had in June 2020 released a draft paper titled 'Towards Responsible#AIForAll' and had said there is a potential of large scale adoption of AI in a variety of social sectors.             "The government may fund specific research projects in responsible Artificial Intelligence and introduce ethics of AI into the university curriculum as the new-age technology is expected to boost India's annual growth rate by 1.3 per cent by 2035," the draft document had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/niti-aayog-proposes-setting-up-oversight-body-for-ai-916699.html

Here is the top news of November 17, 2020: AirAsia Group Berhad has given its strongest indication to date that it could exit India, saying on Tuesday it was reviewing its investment in a joint venture airline there. The group said in a statement that its operations in India, like those of its now-shuttered Japan business, have been draining cash and adding to the group's financial stress. "Cost containment and reducing cash burn remain key priorities evident by the recent closure of AirAsia Japan and an ongoing review of our investment in AirAsia India," it said.   After sharply cutting India’s economic growth forecast to a 14.3% contraction barely two months ago, American Brokerage firm Goldman Sachs Tuesday revised upward it estimates to -10.3% in 2020-21 on the back of announcement of effective vaccines that could allow containment policies and mobility. It also projected India’s GDP to rebound to a 13% growth in the next financial year (2021-22). This marks the second such upgrade in India’s growth estimates after Moody’s last week revised upward the GDP forecast.   Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths arrested former Mayor R Sampath Raj, an accused in a case of August 11, DJ Halli and KG Halli riots, on Monday late night. He was on the run for over a month.  Sampath was reportedly arrested from his hideout in Benson Town in North Bengaluru on Monday late night by a team headed by assistant commissioner of police (ATC), CCB, Venugopal. Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), confirmed his arrest and said, further details about him would be shared after questioning him.   Asserting that terrorism is the "biggest problem" facing the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said there was a need to ensure that countries supporting and assisting terrorists are held guilty, in an oblique reference to Pakistan. Addressing the summit of five-nation grouping BRICS via videoconferencing, the prime minister also said there was a need to tackle the problem of terrorism in an organised manner. The 12th BRICS summit, hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin, was also attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the Uttar Pradesh government for its Covid-19 management strategy terming it as a good example for other states to follow, an official statement said here on Tuesday. "The UP government's strategic response to Covid-19 by stepping up contact tracing efforts is exemplary and can serve as a good example for other states," Roderico Ofrin, WHO Country Representative, said in a statement issued by the state government.    A handful of countries are using the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) as a “smoke-screen” and stopping progress on reforming the Security Council, which has become “impaired”, India has said, asserting that it is time for a “decisive movement” to achieve the long-delayed reform of the powerful UN body. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T S Tirumurti, speaking in the UN General Assembly on ‘Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council’, lamented that nothing has moved for more than a decade in the IGN except hearing passionate statements on the need for reform.

Abdul Latif Mir (22) and Mohd Ashraf Khatana (20) were apprehended by Delhi Police's Special Cell from south Delhi's Sarai Kale Khan in the late hours of the intervening night of November 16 and 17 allegedly with two semi-automatic pistols of .32 calibre and ten live cartridges. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav claimed that the arrests came following an input that a group of newly recruited JeM terrorists would be coming to Delhi for their onward journey to UP for basic training. "Manual surveillance was mounted through various sources and information was further developed. The input was developed through sources and physical surveillance was mounted in which movements of these operatives were closely and discreetly monitored," Yadav said. The arrest came as investigators identified Mir and Khatana and that they would come near Sarai Kale Khan and then go to Nizamuddin where they would stay for a short period before they head to UP. A Class V drop-out, Mir's father is a court munshi in Sopore. Khatana, whose father is a retired government employee, is a Class VII dropout. According to Yadav, Mir has a Facebook account in which his display picture is that of JeM founder Maulana Masood Azhar. Mir used to listen to Azhar's speeches on social media as well as speeches by others. He, along with Khatana, had tried to cross over to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for training but could not succeed. Four months ago, Yadav claimed Mir came in contact with one Aftab Malik, a resident of Pakistan's Lahore, through Facebook Messenger. Malik allegedly sought his WhatsApp number and then contacted him through that. When Malik asked Mir about why he was using Azhar's image as a display picture, Yadav said, Mir told him that he worships the JeM leader and that he has done a lot for Kashmir fighting against Indian forces. He also told Malik that he and Khatana had tried to enter PoK but failed due to the tight vigil at the Line of Control. "Later, they came in contact with Pakistan-based JeM operatives through Malik, who could help them in crossing the border. They were directed to come to Delhi where they would meet one person who would help them for a short stay in UP for imparting basic training and arrange their crossover to Pakistan," Yadav said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/two-kashmiri-youths-with-alleged-links-to-jaish-e-mohammed-arrested-in-delhi-916720.html

It said the missile "accurately and successfully" neutralised an airborne target. It was the second successful test firing of the missile in the last five days. "The flight test, second in the series, was conducted today at around 1542 hours from the integrated test range, Chandipur, off the coast of Odisha. "The test was carried out once again, against the high-performance jet unmanned aerial target called Banshee, which simulates an aircraft," the ministry said. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO scientists on the successful test-firing of the missile. "Congratulations to @DRDO_India for two back to back successful test trials of Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missile. First launch test on 13th Nov proved the Radar and Missile capabilities with direct hit. Today’s test demonstrated the warhead performance on proximity detection," he tweeted. The successful test-firing of the QRSAM, having a range of around 30 km, paves the way for its commercial production, officials said. "The flight test was conducted in the deployment configuration of the weapon system comprising of the launcher, fully automated command and control system, surveillance system and multi-function radars," the ministry said. "The QRSAM weapon system, which can operate on the move, consists of all indigenously developed subsystems. All objectives of the test were fully met. The launch was carried out in the presence of the users from Indian Army," it said. In the last two months, India has test-fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and an anti-radiation missile named Rudram-1.

In a letter to the FSSAI chairman, SJM co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said bringing in GM foods clandestinely into this country is illegal and is against national legislation. Since GM food crops are not allowed to be cultivated in the country, so processed food made from these crops should also be banned, Mahajan said. Different agencies are required to clear such imports if any, that too after a comprehensive safety assessment, he said. These agencies include the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, as well as the FSSAI, Mahajan said. He said many exporting countries such as the US, Australia, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand are also contending that GM food products sold in the global market are as safe as conventional products, but the FSSAI should not allow such products. SJM, in fact, believes that the import permissions given by GEAC in the past for GM soybean oil and GM canola oil should also be withdrawn by the regulatory body in light of the correct approach being adopted by FSSAI, he said. There is no undue burden on exporting countries as is being argued by some WTO members in this implementation mechanism being put in place by FSSAI, the SJM said. Those countries which have traceability and segregation mechanisms in place can very well certify the non-GM status of a product. In most of these countries, a mechanism does exist to certify for non-GM status in their domestic markets.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fssai-should-ban-import-of-processed-food-products-made-from-gm-crops-sjm-916730.html

On Monday, Delhi recorded 3,797 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.89 lakh, even as 99 new fatalities pushed the toll to 7,713. These relatively low number of fresh cases came out of the 29,871 tests conducted on Sunday. The active cases tally on Monday stood at 40,128. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sought power from the Centre to impose lockdown in those markets which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots, and decided to withdraw an order allowing 200 guests to attend wedding functions. Kejriwal said the Delhi government has sent a proposal to Lt Governor Anil Baijal to allow only 50 people to attend wedding ceremonies against the earlier limit of 200.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-delhi-sees-1-lakh-new-cases-1200-deaths-94000-recoveries-since-nov-1-916736.html
17-11-2020||National||India pins hopes on locally tested Covid-19 vaccines given Pfizer constraints||India hopes five locally tested vaccines will help it to control Covid-19, as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna may not be available to it in big quantities soon. The five candidates include Russia's Sputnik-V whose "Phase-II going to Phase-III" trials in India will start next week in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Vinod Paul, the head of a committee advising the prime minister, said. The other experimental vaccines are the one being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India; Bharat Biotech and the Indian government's COVAXIN; Zydus Cadila's ZyCoV-D and lastly one being developed by Biological E. Ltd alongside Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp. Paul told a news briefing that AstraZeneca vaccine's last-stage trials in India had gone well and had almost been completed. The country of 1.35 billion people has reported 8.87 million infections, second only to the United States, and 130,519 deaths as a result of Covid-19. "We are very hopeful that we will be successful with the five vaccines," Paul said on Tuesday. "They are easy platforms, availability of doses is very high. They will be able to control our pandemic in terms of the numbers of doses required." Paul said the government was also watching the progress of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which have said interim results of last-stage trials of their candidates showed that they were more than 90% effective. Unlike Pfizer's vaccine which must be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, Moderna's can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it more suited for poorer countries such as India where cold chains are limited. "This obviously will be a very big hindrance to scale up the vaccine," Paul said of Pfizer's, adding that if India finds itself needing to do so it will pursue this option. "If we are required to form our strategy on this particular vaccine, then we will proceed with it. Though, even if we get it, we will get it in a few months only. But talks are ongoing."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pins-hopes-on-locally-tested-covid-19-vaccines-given-pfizer-constraints-916737.html
17-11-2020||National||SC reserves order on anticipatory bail plea of ex-DGP of Punjab in alleged murder case||The Supreme Court Tuesday reserved order on the plea by former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini seeking anticipatory bail in a 1991 case of alleged murder of a junior engineer, and sought to know if his custody was needed at all in the 29-year-old matter. The top court had on September 15 granted interim protection from the arrest to Saini and sought the state government's reply on his plea challenging the Punjab and Haryana High Court order refusing to grant him anticipatory bail in the case of alleged murder of Balwant Singh Multani. The interim relief to him against any coercive action will continue. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah reserved order after hearing arguments from senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Siddarth Luthra and K V Vishwanathan who represented Saini, the state government and the brother of deceased respectively. Rohatgi said Saini had been a “decorated” officer, who rose from the ranks, and was a prime target of terrorists for his ruthless handling of the menace in Punjab and the present case is an example of political vendetta as some FIRs were lodged against the present Chief Minister by him when he was the police officer. However, Luthra, appearing for the state government, opposed the plea saying the grant of anticipatory bail to Saini at this stage would hamper the probe. The bench asked as to why the custody of Saini would be needed when the almost 30 years have passed since the alleged offence was committed. Rohatgi narrated the sequence of events in the case and said that Saini retired in 2018 and just after that he was granted relief from the Punjab and High Court that he would be given seven days prior notice in case of any coercive action is contemplated by the state. He said Saini was also granted anticipatory bail from the trial court judge and once the relief was granted, it should have continued till the end of the trial. On September 8, the high court had dismissed Saini's two pleas including the one on anticipatory bail in the alleged murder case. Besides, Saini had also filed a petition in the high court seeking that either the case be quashed or transferred to the CBI. Saini was booked in May in connection with the disappearance of Multani in 1991 when he was working as a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation. Saini had approached the high court after a Mohali court dismissed his bail plea in this case on September 1. The Punjab police on September 3 had claimed that Saini had “absconded” while denying his wife's claims of withdrawal of his security cover. A Mohali court had on August 21 allowed the Punjab police to add a murder charge against him in this case. This came after two former Chandigarh police personnel, former UT police Inspector Jagir Singh and former ASI Kuldeep Singh, who are also co-accused, turned approver in the case. Multani, who was a resident of Mohali, was picked up by police after a terrorist attack on Saini, who was then the senior superintendent of police in Chandigarh, in 1991. However, the police had later claimed that Multani had escaped from police custody of Qadian police in Gurdaspur. Saini and six others were booked on the complaint of Multani's, Palwinder Singh Multani, who is a resident of Jalandhar. The case was registered against them under sections 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causes hurt) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at Mataur police station in Mohali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-reserves-order-on-anticipatory-bail-plea-of-ex-dgp-of-punjab-in-alleged-murder-case-916747.html

It will be the first stand-alone summit meeting between India and Luxembourg in the past two decades, the MEA said. "The leaders will discuss the entire spectrum of bilateral relationship, including strengthening of India-Luxembourg cooperation in the post-Covid world. They will also exchange views on international and global issues of mutual interest," it said. India and Luxembourg have continued to maintain high-level exchanges in the recent past. The two prime ministers have met previously on three occasions. Luxembourg is one of the most important financial centres globally. Several Indian companies have raised capital by issuing Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Several Luxembourg-based investment funds hold substantial banking and asset management market share in portfolio investments in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-his-luxembourg-counterpart-on-thursday-916748.html
17-11-2020||National||Greenpeace India writes to NITI Aayog on post-Covid-19 green recovery plans||Environment think tank Greenpeace India on Tuesday sent to the NITI Aayog a plan to help build a climate-proof, equal, sustainable and resilient India as it emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. In its recommendations to government's policy think tank NITI Aayog, Greenpeace India stressed on the need to promote a decentralised model of renewable energy which will not only help to get universal energy access but it can also help mitigate climate crisis by replacing fossil fuel-based energy production. "The government needs to support rooftop solar and other forms of decentralized renewable energy solutions that reduce the demand for coal-based electricity. Moving our energy generation sector from fossil fuels to renewables will help to prevent premature deaths and vast savings in health costs. Provide support to clean technology businesses affected by the crisis to help them sustain and grow," the environment think tank recommended. Binu Jacob, Executive Director at Greenpeace India, said, "Green recovery would promote a sustainable and just society better than return-to-normal stimulus measures. NITI Aayog has advocated for sustainable development goals in the past, we are hopeful that the think tank body would seriously consider the green recommendations endorsed by citizens of the country. The recommendations also called for promotion and increase in demand of electric vehicles, stating that as it will take some time to remove the fear of using public transport amongst people, who would prefer using their own vehicles, this is an opportunity to promote e-bikes and e-scooters. It also suggested developing safer public transport to rebuild trust among people by providing clear guidance for safety and implement sanitation measures like cleaning regimes; issuing PPEs to drivers and staff; mandating face coverings for passengers; and increasing trips to account for limiting the number of passengers per ride. "These recommendations reflect collective hope and confidence that the government will consider these areas seriously to turn this crisis into an opportunity and set the direction firmly towards building a climate-proof, equal, sustainable and resilient India as we emerge from this pandemic," Greenpeace said. Besides promoting public transport, it also called for active and carbon-neutral vehicles like cycles and suggested that public transport be made free for all. "Due to Covid-19, socially and economically marginalized people are the worst hit by economic slowdown and most of them can't afford the expensive mode of transportation. Public transport is a vehicle for mobility justice and public welfare at large. Therefore, once Covid safety measures are fully in place, public transport should be made free for all. This will help us to discourage the use of personal automobiles," the NGO said. The NGO said that besides the pandemic, India is also witnessing extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, droughts and earthquakes. "The pandemic has hit the world hard. We can understand that the government is trying to promote economic growth, better healthcare and repair the losses that occurred. At the same time, India is also witnessing extreme weather events in the form of cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes et al at an increasing rate in the past few years. "Even in the midst of the pandemic, the country experienced cyclone Amphan which has displaced thousands of people in West Bengal and Odisha. We have seen that while all get impacted by climate change and Covid-19 pandemic, the poor in the society are more vulnerable," the Greenpeace said. It said the question to the society is how should the development trajectory shape post-Covid-19 and added that Greenpeace India along with 29,174 citizens across the country reimagined a future which is environmentally resilient, socially just and economically equitable. It said that it has been collating the recommendations since June 2020 as part of an initiative called "#TowardsBetter" in consultation with various stakeholders that include farmers, workers, urban dwellers and issue experts. The NGO suggested boosting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in the Covid-19 recovery plans, by helping farmers build structures and capacities to increase SOC content in agricultural fields by up to two per cent by the end of 2030. "This will also help achieve the 2030 commitment of restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land," it said.  Greenpeace also recommended incentivising protection and enhancement of biomass to stop crop residue burning. "Burning of crop residue and cattle dung for cooking and farm cleaning purposes have huge health and environmental consequences. To positively restrict these unhealthy practices, the government should proactively invest in creating infrastructures that help farmers in converting these biomass residues into nutrient-rich organic fertilisers. "The subsidies on biogas plants for cooking purposes should be increased upto 75 per cent for general farmers and 90 per cent for small and marginal farmers. This will significantly reduce the existing load on fossil fuels and the emission levels," it said. Greenpeace India also expressed its desire to engage with the NITI Aayog as and when they require more research and development of the ideas mentioned in the green recommendations. Greenpeace looks up to policymakers to drive these recommendations into concrete policies, it said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/greenpeace-india-writes-to-niti-aayog-on-post-covid-19-green-recovery-plans-916751.html

During the meeting here, the chief minister discussed various issues such as increasing telecom facilities in Naxal-affected regions and deployment of two more CRPF battalions in Bastar.  The home minister assured immediate action on the same, an official statement from the state government said. Bhagel said iron ore is available in abundance in the Bastar region and if the ore is made available at 30 per cent discount to steel plants to be set up in Bastar, then investment of hundreds of crores of rupees and thousands of direct and indirect employment opportunities will be created.  He also said that grid power has not yet reached large parts of the region due to difficult geographical areas. With the establishment of a large number of solar power plants, it is possible to meet the energy needs of the people and their economic development, the chief minister said. Bhagel requested a grant to make cold chains for arranging the processing and sale of minor forest produce, forest medicines and horticultural crops.  The chief minister demanded a sum of at least Rs 50 crore each year for development of livelihood in all the seven aspiring districts of the Bastar region of the state. Baghel also urged Shah not to privatise NMDC, to which the home minister assured that he will consider the request. He also discussed issues related to livelihood development, development of banks, roads and infrastructure in Naxal-affected areas. A meeting of officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs and officials of Chhattisgarh in Raipur has also been scheduled soon to discuss various issues, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chhattisgarh-cm-urges-amit-shah-to-increase-job-opportunities-in-bastar-to-end-naxal-problem-916760.html

The CBI faced the wrath after its public prosecutor sought more time for the investigation. Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal made the observation about the corruption case against controversial meat exporter Moin Akhtar Qureshi, in which the probe agency's former directors – Ranjit Sinha and A P Singh – are among those under the scanner. “Four years have passed. In four years, no investigation has been done. How many more years will you take? Seven to ten more years? CBI director is the accused, and the agency is itself investigating the case? I am surprised. This is violation of principal of natural justice,” the judge said. The agency informed the court that four of its recent orders have been challenged before the Delhi High Court. Following the submission, the trial court adjourned the matter for November 24 for further hearing. The CBI had lodged the case of alleged bribery against Qureshi in 2017. During the investigation in the case the names of Sinha and Singh also came up and their alleged roles are being probed. Qureshi was accused of collecting money from individuals directly or through Hyderabad-based businessman Sathish Sana Babu and using it to influence CBI probes. The court, during the last few hearings in the case, has pulled up the CBI for lack of progress in the case and had posed a series of questions to the agency. It had also asked the investigating agency to file a status report on the probe. Besides, it had summoned the Joint Director who is heading the probe against Qureshi, to appear on November 17 but he did not appear before the court. The judge had also pulled up the agency for not questioning the two former CBI directors and asked as to why CBI was dragging its feet in a case involving their roles, which may lead to an inference that it is not very keen to pursue investigations with respect to them.    The probe agency was further asked if the alleged role of another of its ex-director, Alok Verma, was being investigated. Verma allegedly stalled or did not allow the investigations to reach their logical end during his tenure.    The CBI had submitted before the court that 544 documents had been collected and 63 witnesses were examined. On being asked what action has been taken against the public servants for whom Qureshi was allegedly acting as a middleman, the agency had said that the investigation was being conducted and the role of such public servants is being probed. The probe agency had further told the court that many CBI officers have been examined in connection with this case, including some public servants from the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate.

His remarks assume significance as last year after India had decided not to join the RCEP, the Congress had claimed victory, saying its forceful opposition ensured that the BJP government backs out from bartering the interests of farmers, dairy producers, fishermen and small and medium businessmen. "India's decision of not joining Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is unfortunate and ill advised. It is in India's strategic and economic interests to be a part of the process of Asia-Pacific integration," Sharma said. "Withdrawal has negated years of persuasive negotiations for India to be accepted as part of RCEP," he said. "We could have negotiated safeguards to protect our interests. Keeping out of the RCEP is a backward leap," said Sharma, who had been closely involved in RCEP negotiations in his capacity as the commerce and industry minister in the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh. On November 4 last year, India walked out of mega free trade agreement RCEP as negotiations failed to address New Delhi's outstanding issues and concerns. The remaining 15 member countries have signed RCEP agreement and have stated that the pact would remain open to India. Former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also aired his views on India not joining RCEP on Tuesday, but said he would give a final view only when his party has taken a considered position on the issue. "My guarded tweet yesterday on India not being member of RCEP has been noticed by many. Every English language newspaper that I read has carried an editorial today that India would be better off by being a part of RCEP," he tweeted. "I would reserve a final view until the Congress party has taken a considered position on the issue," Chidambaram said. He also expressed dismay over the remarks of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar at the Deccan Dialogue on Monday, saying the minister "railed against trade agreements and praised the virtues of protectionism". "Mr Jaishankar is speaking in the language and in the words that I heard in the 1970s and 1980s!" Chidambaram said in a series of tweets. On Monday, Chidambaram had tweeted, "RCEP born, it is the world's largest trading body. 15 nations in our region are members of RCEP, India is not among them." There are pros and cons to India joining RCEP, but the debate has never taken place in Parliament or among the people or involving the Opposition parties, he had said. "It is another bad example of centralised decision-making unacceptable in a democracy," Chidambaram had stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-decision-to-not-join-rcep-ill-advised-backward-leap-anand-sharma-916775.html

The government further said a national scheme on Covid-19 vaccine distribution is in its final stages of preparation. At a press briefing, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul, who also heads the National Task Force on Covid-19, said sufficient doses of the vaccine, as required for the Indian population, will not be available, but the government is looking at the possibilities and will work out a strategy for its procurement and distribution in case it gets the regulatory approvals. Paul, however, reminded that the arrival of the Pfizer vaccine in the country might take some months. "The arrangement of cold-chains for storing the vaccine developed by Pfizer at a low temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius is a big challenge and it will not be easy for any nation. But then, if at all it has to be obtained, we are examining what we need to do...and will work out a strategy," he said. As for both the vaccine candidates of Moderna and Pfizer, Paul said, "We are watching the developments. They have announced the preliminary results and have not got the regulatory approvals." The official expressed hope on the success of the five vaccines that are under different phases of trial in the country. The doses of these vaccines will be available in sufficient numbers. Giving an update, he said the phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started. Another indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Zydus Cadila has completed the phase-2 clinical trial, Paul said. Dr Reddy's Laboratories will soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India. Also, Biological E Limited has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE last week said their vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19.  Moderna on Monday said the independent National Institutes of Health-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against Covid-19, found it to have an efficacy of 94.5 per cent. Asked if the government is working on a draft scheme on Covid-19 vaccine distribution, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said one of the mandates of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 is to have a time-bound scheme to ensure the fulfilment of the commitment that the prime minister made to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, where he said the citizens will be inoculated as soon as the vaccine becomes available. "A document in this regard is in its final stages of preparation. We have shared it with the state governments and have taken their inputs. We are also in the process of finalising the database of the priority population groups, who will be administered the vaccine if and when it becomes available, and there also, we are in collaboration with the states and other central ministries," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/storage-of-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-challenge-for-most-nations-india-examining-possibilities-government-916783.html
17-11-2020||National||Govt will leave no stone unturned to make India preferred global investment destination: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said his government will leave no stone unturned to make India a preferred global investment destination as he pitched for foreign investment to modernise urban centres, offering a business-friendly climate, and a huge market. As the nation rebuilds post pandemic, Modi said Covid-19 has given governments the chance to accelerate the "process of making cities more liveable for people". "We are looking at a future where a major chunk of education, healthcare, shopping may happen online. Our cities need to be ready for the convergence of the physical and digital worlds," he said in his speech at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. Noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has posed enormous challenges before the world, Modi said he thinks the historic reconstruction efforts after the two world wars can give "us several lessons". Post world wars, the entire world worked on a new world order. New protocols were developed and world changed itself. "Covid-19 has also given us a similar opportunity to develop new protocols in every field. This opportunity should be grabbed by the world if we want to develop resilient systems for the future. We should think on post Covid requirements of the world. A good starting point would be the rejuvenation of our urban centres," Modi said. Highlighting Indian cities have presented an extra-ordinary example during these tough times, Modi said: "There were world-wide incidents of resistance against the lockdown measures. However Indian cities meticulously followed these preventive measures. This is because, for us, the biggest building block of our cities was not concrete, but the community." The Prime Minister said the pandemic has re-emphasised "that our biggest resource, as societies and as businesses, is our people". The post-Covid world, he stressed, has to be built by nurturing this key and fundamental resource. The Prime Minister said it has been the endeavour in India to build urban centres, which have the amenities of a city but the spirit of a village. Pitching for foreign investment, he said India has exciting opportunities for investment in urbanisation, mobility, innovation and sustainable solution. These opportunities come along with a vibrant democracy, a business friendly climate, a huge market and a government which shall leave no stone unturned to make India a preferred global investment destination, he said. Modi further said India is well on its way towards urban transformation. "I have no doubt that with the help of all stakeholders, the civil society, academic institutions, industry and most importantly the citizens and communities, we will achieve the dream of resilient and prosperous global cities," he said. In his address, Modi emphasised cities cannot prosper without availability of affordable housing, and talked about the 'Housing for All' programme launched by his government in 2015. "We will deliver more than one crore or 10 million houses to aspiring families in urban areas before the targeted deadline of 2022," he said. He also told the gathering that looking at the conditions created by the pandemic, the government also introduced an affordable rental housing initiative. He also said the Real Estate Regulation Act has transformed the dynamics of the real estate sector. This has made it more customer-oriented and transparent, the Prime Minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-will-leave-no-stone-unturned-to-make-india-preferred-global-investment-destination-pm-modi-916788.html

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot laid out the party line when he hit back at Sibal for going public with internal issues, while a six-member panel formed to assist Congress president Sonia Gandhi went into a huddle to discuss the party’s campaign on the farm laws, the upcoming elections and the Bihar debacle. Taking a cue from Gehlot, Congress leaders launched a broadside against Sibal, questioning his contribution in building the party organisation in his Chandni Chowk constituency after his loss in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. “Sibal should stop giving sermons sitting in AC offices. He should have proven his mettle in the campaign for the Bihar assembly elections or the bypolls in Madhya Pradesh,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha told DH. Former Union Minister Salman Khurshid described Sibal’s outburst as “periodic pangs of anxiety” that appears every time the Congress underperforms in elections. “Our real redemption might be found in understanding the mind of the contemporary citizen. So the constant refrain of some persons should not be of aimless introspection but for reaffirmation of fundamental principles we believe in,” Khurshid said. Barring Vivek Tankha, a lawyer-turned-Rajya Sabha member, not many of the group of 23 letter writers are standing with Sibal. Soon after Gehlot’s remarks, Youth Congress president Srinivas B V and Delhi Congress president Anil Choudhary targeted Sibal. “Congress has seen various crises including 1969, 1977, 1989 and later in 1996 – but every time we came out stronger due to our ideology, programmes, policies, and firm belief in party leadership,” Gehlot said. “We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed the UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Sonia ji, we shall overcome this time too. There are various reasons for electoral losses. But each time the rank and file of the Congress party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out stronger and united after every crisis,” Gehlot said. Srinivas hit out at Sibal saying that his questioning of the Congress leadership is akin to helping the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kapil-sibals-criticism-throws-congress-into-a-turmoil-916794.html

With the issue likely to come up during a meeting of the WTO’s TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Council on Friday, and the United States and the European Union reluctant to support the proposal, New Delhi turned to Beijing, Moscow and Brasilia. China, too, proposed cooperation with India and South Africa on clinical trial and distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines developed by its companies. “India and South Africa have presented a proposal for granting exemption to Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines from the protections of the agreements on intellectual property rights,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, participating in the virtual summit of the BRICS. “We hope that other BRICS nations will also support it.” The five-nation BRICS – comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – had its annual summit through video-links on Tuesday. Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired the virtual meeting. Modi reiterated during the summit that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity would be put to use to help the entire humanity in fighting this Covid-19 crisis. “Chinese companies are working with their Russian and Brazilian partners on phase-III clinical trials of vaccines, and we are prepared to cooperate with South Africa and India as well,” Chinese President Xi Jinping said, participating in the BRICS summit. India and South Africa on October 1 last jointly sent a communiqué to the WTO, referring to reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products to the patients. “Beyond patents, other intellectual property rights may also pose a barrier, with limited options to overcome those barriers. In addition, many countries, especially developing countries, may face institutional and legal difficulties when using flexibilities available in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement),” the two nations noted, adding: “A particular concern for countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity are the requirements of Article 31 (of the TRIPS Agreement) and consequently the cumbersome and lengthy process for the import and export of pharmaceutical products.” India and South Africa placed the proposal before the WTO as the US and other wealthy western nations made moves to clinch deals with pharmaceutical companies to buy as many Covid-19 vaccines as they would be able to produce till the end of 2021. They are likely to argue during the WTO TRIPS Council’s meeting on Friday that if the developing and poor nations did not get access to the Covid-19 vaccines, the pandemic would continue to wreak havoc in one part of the world, despite being brought under control in another. They will seek the waiver to continue until widespread vaccination would be in place globally, and the majority of the population of the world would develop immunity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-seeks-support-from-china-russia-at-wto-to-exempt-covid-19-drugs-vaccines-from-patent-protection-916796.html

Founder of the Centax Publications and editor of the Excise Law Times, Jain had complained against all the national parties that were not abiding by an order of the full bench of the Central Information Commission (CIC), which had brought them under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act. "First it was Covid-19, then non-COVID complications, which resulted in multiple organ failure on Monday evening," Jain's son Navneet told PTI. A full bench of the commission had brought six national parties -- Congress, BJP, NCP, CPI, CPI(M) and BSP -- under the ambit of the RTI Act on June 3, 2013 on the plea of another activist, Subhash Agrawal. But these parties did not adhere to the commission's directives and respond to RTI applications filed by Jain and Agrawal. Jain (70) had filed a complaint against these parties with the CIC. Not getting a hearing, he had approached the Delhi High Court, which had directed the CIC to complete the hearing within six months, but the matter is still pending. Jain had also filed a number of RTI applications related to the excise and customs departments and contested these cases in the CIC. Agrawal and another activist, Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd), expressed grief over Jain's sudden demise. Batra said it is a big casualty to the RTI community. Agrawal expressed shock and disbelief over the news. Former information commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said it is a big loss to the transparency advocates' community. "He was one of the few serious experts of the RTI Act. He had developed his own software to keep a track of his applications, appeals and complaints. Jain was an important contributor to information jurisprudence with some very important cases brought by him and in a number of others, he appeared," he said. Jain was a strong supporter of bringing political parties under the ambit of the RTI Act but unfortunately, that case could not reach culmination, Acharyulu said. "Very sad to hear about his sad demise. A great fighter. Very outspoken and upfront without being abrasive or hurtful. We fought so many appeals and complaints together in the CIC and secured some important orders. Hearings used to be always followed by a meal at a dhaba in Bhikaji Cama Place. Will miss him as a great friend and advisor," Hyderabad-based activist CJ Karira said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rti-activist-rk-jain-succumbs-to-covid-19-other-ailments-family-916799.html

We need to keep a close watch on the number of new cases this week and next week,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. Continuing its nine-week long fall, the number of fresh cases recorded in the last 24 hours was 29,163 taking, India’s cumulative tally to 88.74 lakh. But with an average of more than 7,000 daily cases till two days ago, the national capital poses a fresh challenge on countering the pandemic. The new steps being taken by the Centre to counter the surge includes ramping up the tests and making provisions for more ICU and oxygen beds in Delhi hospitals to tackle the rising caseload. Currently around 57,000 tests are being conducted in Delhi out of which 20,000 odds are RT-PCR tests even though the national capital has a capacity of 27,000 such tests daily. “The plan is to increase the level of testing to 1-1.2 lakhs per day using the government facilities, research establishment and private sector,” said Vinod Paul, NITI Aayog member and a former professor at AIIMS. In addition, there would be 10 mobile testing vans. “As a Covid-19 appropriate behavior, people are now encouraged to go for testing if they are having any symptoms. Since testing-on-demand is available, don’t be hesitant to get tested,” said Bhushan. With Delhi facing a shortage of ICU beds, arrangements have been made to create another 3,200-plus ICU beds in government’s Covid-19 facilities. The DRDO unit will have 537 new ICU beds, whereas 2,680 such beds will be set up in Delhi government hospitals. In addition, there would be 45 new ICU beds at central government run hospitals. Asked about the progress in vaccine development, Paul said that the trials of all the three Indian vaccines were on course and clinical trials for Russian origin Sputnik-V vaccine would start next week. An early trial has commenced for a fifth vaccine candidate from Biological Evans. “But vaccines will only complement other tools. Vaccine alone will not end the pandemic,” he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fresh-covid-19-cases-drop-below-30000-but-worries-remain-on-account-of-bihar-polls-and-festivals-916839.html

"As vice president, we dealt with him. I happened to be the ambassador during the last phase of the Obama administration. We’d known him earlier when he was in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as the ranking Democratic member and then as the chairman," Jaishankar said. The external affairs minister was speaking at an online discussion organised by leading think-tank Gateway House. "He (Biden) is very much part of this period when Indo-American relations underwent a radical transformation, which I reasonably date back to (Bill) Clinton’s visit," Jaishankar said. Jaishankar said President-elect Biden is “not a stranger" to India or to the relationship between the two countries. "I am very confident that we will pick up where we left off, we have done that over the last four administrations. "I think that will be the case as well here and I also say that because within the American politics, it’s not just that we deal with the administration of the day, we also tend to deal with the Congress," Jaishankar said.

We are discussing if we have to launch our own party or should we just declare our support to a party,” the politician told the publication. Brushing aside rumours of him supporting the BJP, he said, “Those are cooked up stories. No one from the BJP has spoken to me. Why would the Home Minister meet me?” Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Chennai on November 21, when he is expected to guide the state’s BJP wing on a strategy to contest in the Assembly polls. A DMK source told the website that they were “not perturbed” about the possibility of Alagiri meeting Amit Shah.  Alagiri’s new political party may be called ‘Kalaignar DMK’ or ‘KDMK,’ as per the report.  “If there is no change in Shah’s planned visit to Chennai, the idea is to announce the new party in Madurai in the presence of about 100-200 close aides of Alagiri. And Alagiri may be meeting Shah the next day,” a source told the website. DMK has witnessed sibling rivalry between Stalin and Alagiri for about two decades now as Karunanidhi actively groomed the younger brother, Stalin to be his political heir with at one point in time even appointing him as Deputy Chief Minister. Stalin headed the youth wing of DMK for several years before being appointed Treasurer of the party, as Karunanidhi’s health deteriorated, Stalin was given the post of Executive President. After the patriarch died, Stalin became the party president.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/karunanidhis-elder-son-m-k-alagiri-to-start-new-political-party-join-bjp-led-alliance-reports-916446.html
17-11-2020||National Politics||Congress to hold AICC panel meeting today: Report||It added that the committee will likely be discussing internal conflicts and the performance of Congress in the Bihar Assembly election 2020.  The meeting assumes significance as it comes a day after several senior Congress leaders called for reform and accountability for the Bihar polls debacle. Yesterday, Kapil Sibal publicly criticised the Congress leadership. His remarks that the time of introspection was over and people no longer saw the party as an effective alternative invited quick rebuttals from the party including Ashok Gehlot. Sibal's open call for reform in the Congress come on the heels of 23 party leaders writing to party president Sonia Gandhi for a leadership change and organisational overhaul in August. Sibal himself was part of the group of 23 leaders. The Congress won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar as part of the RJD-led grand alliance. The opposition alliance ended up with 110 seats, while the NDA retained power, bagging 125 seats in the 243-member assembly. Several poll analysts have stated that the Congress dragged the Grand Alliance down in the Bihar Polls as it fell short of the majority mark, with the NDA under Nitish Kumar's leadership emerging victorious in the polls by a narrow margin. Backing Sibal, Congress Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha also said it is time to act now, else it will be too late. He also said that for democracy to survive, the Congress has to survive. Tankha was also a part of the 23 leaders who had sought overhaul in the party. Senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar also acknowledged Congress's failure in Bihar and said that the Congress must learn from it and complete alliance formalities well in advance for upcoming assembly polls. In September, In a major reshuffle of the party, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had removed Ghulam Nabi Azad, Motilal Vora, Ambika Soni, Mallikarjun Kharge as AICC general secretaries, and reconstituted CWC with new regular members. The six-member special committee was formed to assist Sonia Gandhi in organisational and operational matters following the controversial letter by the G-23.

Shah's comments on Twitter came as the BJP stepped up attack on the seven-party alliance, which includes National Conference, PDP and Congress and opposed the abrogation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir. "The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia-ji and Rahul-ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India," he tweeted. The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang ? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India. Shah said the Congress and the Gupkar alliance want to take Jammu and Kashmir back to the era of terror and turmoil while alleging that they want to take away rights of Dalits, women and tribals that the BJP has ensured by removing Article 370.  "This is why they’re being rejected by the people everywhere. Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it," he added. The Gupkar alliance was formed this year on the occasion of Gupkar declaration anniversary. The parties that have formed the alliance had come together on August 4 last year, a day before the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked, to oppose any move to scrap Article 370. Shah's attack on the Gupkar alliance comes against the backdrop of the election to the District Development Council (DDC) elections in Jammu and Kashmir that will be held in eight phases from November 28 to December 22. Earlier, NC patriarch Farooq Abdullah had landed in controversy after suggesting that China could help the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the restoration of special status. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti also attracted criticism after she said that she would hoist tricolour if the separate flag of Jammu and Kashmir is not restored. The BJP has been targeting Congress and the Gupkar alliance for the past few weeks with the party on Monday fielding Law Minister Ravishankar Prasad to target the grand old party, asking them to clarify the party's stand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gupkar-gang-is-going-global-amit-shah-slams-congress-over-unholy-gathbandhan-916540.html

Addressing an event in Pune via video-conferencing, Gadkari said to achieve self-reliance, there is a need for knowledge, entrepreneurship, science, technology, research and successful practices. "...while taking the country on the path of development, we need to emphasise on scientific advancement. We need to acquire the number one position on the basis of knowledge to make our country a world power," he said. "But while doing this, we are not expansionist. There are some countries, which are driven by expansionist desires, but we believe in the welfare of the world. We believe in 'Vasudev Kutumbakam (the world is one family)," said Gadkari. He said the speech given by Swami Vivekanand in Chicago is our inspiration. Stressing the need to make education available for everyone, he said "it should reach the last man standing". "But, at the same time, we need to ensure that quality education is provided," he added. Gadkari said knowledge -as power- should not be the only goal and thrust should be given on imparting value-based education to create ideal citizens. To become "atmanirbhar" (self-reliant), there is a need to lower imports and increase exports, said Gadkari, who is also the minister for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). "In my department, I am collating the information about things that are imported. I appeal to everyone that we need to produce import-substitute things," he said. "We have all the capabilities to create world-class universities and we can do that, the only thing needed is willpower and ambition," he said. The minister rued the fact that the pace of development of people working selflessly in elevating the standards of education is slow, but on the other hand, those who have done commercialisation of education, their pace of progress is faster. "The pace of the progress of people who have done commercialisation is equal to (that of) bullet train, but those who are doing selfless work in education, they are moving at the pace of a passenger train," he said. The event was organised by the Maharashtra Education Society, which runs several educational institutions in Pune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-not-expansionist-believes-in-welfare-of-world-nitin-gadkari-916551.html

Taking a veiled dig at the newly formed Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party, Omar said, "I can understand the frustration behind this attack by the Hon'ble Home Minister. He had been briefed that the People's Alliance was preparing to boycott elections. This would have allowed the BJP and newly formed King's party a free run in J&K. We didn't oblige them." He said that only leaders in Jammu and Kashmir can be detained and called anti-national for participating in elections and supporting the democratic process. "The truth is all those who oppose the ideology of the BJP are labelled 'corrupt and anti-national'," he tweeted. Shah had earlier called the alliance of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir as 'Gupkar Gang', saying it is an "unholy global gathbandhan" against the country's national interest. In a series of tweets, Shah also questioned Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi whether they support the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), formed to demand the restoration of Article 370, scrapped last year. "Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy 'global gathbandhan' against our national interest.

17-11-2020||National Politics||Amit Shah's remarks on Gupkar alliance appropriate: BJP||The BJP on Tuesday termed Union Home Minister Amit Shah's remarks on the Gupkar alliance as appropriate and said after the abrogation of Article 370, a number of pro-people central laws came into force in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Shah on Tuesday termed the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a conglomerate of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, an "unholy global alliance" and alleged that it, along with the Congress, wants to take Jammu and Kashmir back to the era of terror and turmoil. The senior BJP leader in a series of tweets also asserted that Jammu and Kashmir has been and always be an integral part of India. The conglomerate of regional and national political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Jammu and Kashmir was formed defending the restoration of the Article 370, scrapped last year. Welcoming Shah's statements on the Gupkar alliance, BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference that his remarks are appropriate as PDP's Mehbooba Mufti had made it clear that she will not raise the national flag until the separate flag of Jammu and Kashmir is restored. Prasad also claimed that NC leader Farooq Abdullah had once stated that he will seek China's support for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Centre on August 5 last year had abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Unlike these leaders, the people of the Jammu and Kashmir have started benefitting from pro-people central laws that have been brought into force in the Union Territory after the abrogation of special status, Union minister Prasad said. Prasad citing various laws said that women were earlier deprived of property rights in Jammu and Kashmir if they married outside, and anti-corruption laws, reservation for disadvantaged sections of society and various other "humanist" central laws were not implemented in the region. On August 4 last year, a day before abrogation of Article 370 was announced, political parties in Kashmir, except the BJP, met at Abdullah's residence on Gupkar Road in Srinagar. They had also issued a joint statement defending Article 370. The constituents of the conglomerate besides the NC and the PDP also include the CPI-M, the Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference and the Awami National Conference. The Congress recently announced that it will have a seat-sharing arrangement with the PAGD for the forthcoming elections to District Development Councils in Jammu and Kashmir. Abdullah is the PAGD's chairperson and PDP chief Mehbooba its vice-chairperson. Veteran CPI-M leader M Y Tarigami is the alliance's convenor while People's Conference leader Sajjad Gani Lone is its spokesperson.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/amit-shahs-remarks-on-gupkar-alliance-appropriate-bjp-916675.html

17-11-2020||National Politics||Not a part of Gupkar Alliance: Congress after Amit Shah's attack||Facing a sharp attack from Home Minister Amit Shah, Congress on Tuesday made it clear that it is not a part of the Gupkar Alliance but is contesting the district development council elections in Jammu and Kashmir to expose the BJP through a democratic process. Congress's statement came after Shah accused the People’s Association for the Gupkar Declaration of wanting foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir, asking Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi whether they supported such plans. “Congress is not part of the Gupkar Alliance or People’s Association for Gupkar Declaration,” AICC General Secretary and chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said. The Gupkar Alliance was formed this year on the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution that granted special status to J&K and bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories. Seven regional parties of J&K are partners of the Alliance, whose declared objective is to restore Article 370 and Article 35A and the statehood of J&K. The Alliance announced recently that it would contest the District Development Council elections in J&K. Congress too has announced that it would contest the elections, but on its own symbol. However, the Congress has said it will be open to local level adjustments with “like-minded, secular parties, who have decided to contest the DDC elections”. Surjewala accused Shah of “deliberately spreading lies and creating a mirage” by making mischievous statements and ignoring his original mandate of ensuring internal security in the country. Congress leaders Tariq Anwar and Ajay Maken hit back at the Union Home Minister questioning his moral authority to make such statements and reminding him that it was the BJP that was running an alliance government with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir until recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-a-part-of-gupkar-alliance-congress-after-amit-shahs-attack-916758.html

Ravi, who was recently made as the party incharge General Secretary for Maharashtra, Goa and Tamil Nadu, made the demand just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a statue of the 19th-century spiritual leader on the JNU campus. Established in 1969, the university is named after India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga, National BJP spokesperson Aparajita Sarangi, and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari also supported demand by Ravi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/c-t-ravi-demands-jnu-be-renamed-after-swami-vivekananda-days-after-pm-modi-unveils-statue-on-campus-916759.html

Senior Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said it is not proper on the BJP's part to change the name of an existing university and it should instead set an example of creating a good new varsity. "We do not believe in changing names of existing varsities by replacing one name with another icon's name. It would be better if the BJP creates a new university in the name of Swami Vivekananda, which should be good and bigger than the JNU. Renaming an existing university is not development," he told reporters when asked about the row. BJP general secretary CT Ravi had suggested renaming the JNU in Delhi after Swami Vivekananda. The varsity had seen a row erupt in the campus after Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually unveiled a life-sized statue of Swami Vivekananda at the JNU campus last Thursday, with students lodging their protests. In November 2019, the JNU administration had filed a police complaint saying the statue, which was covered by a saffron veil, had allegedly been defaced and messages were written "targeting a political party".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-should-create-better-bigger-varsity-in-vivekanandas-name-instead-of-renaming-jnu-congress-916840.html
17-11-2020||North and Central||Congress should come clean on pro-China, pro-Pak statements by NC, PDP: J&K BJP||The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the BJP on Monday said the Congress should come clean on whether it supports the "pro-China" statements of the NC and the "pro-Pakistan" stands of the PDP, and hit out at the opposition party for its "double-faced" approach on the issue. "The Congress has adopted one stance in Jammu and another in Kashmir and has been befooling the gullible population," Jammu and Kashmir BJP's chief spokesperson Sunil Sethi said. He said the parties in the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) are nothing but power hungry, which is very clear from the fact that they have so eagerly come to contest the District Development Council (DDC) polls, in spite of issuing statements earlier that they will not contest any election. The parties in the alliance are afraid of their corrupt deeds that they have done earlier, the BJP leader said. Many influential leaders of these parties have grabbed prime land and later, got it regularised and these facts are forcing them to unite against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he added. Sethi claimed that infighting has already started in the PAGD and many senior People's Democratic Party (PDP) leaders are leaving the party as it is playing second fiddle to the National Conference (NC) in the alliance. "The same is true for the NC. It is true for every party in the Gupkar group," he said. Sethi also hit out at the Congress, asking the party why it has not cleared its stand on the "pro-China" statements of the NC and "pro-Pakistan" statements of the PDP when it claims to be a major participant in the freedom movement. The BJP leader said Jammu has always taken a nationalist stand and in the DDC polls, these parties will be taught a lesson in Kashmir too.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-should-come-clean-on-pro-china-pro-pak-statements-by-nc-pdp-jk-bjp-916398.html

17-11-2020||North and Central||Arvind Kejriwal seeks power from Centre to impose lockdown in markets which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots||Amid rise in number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital, Delhi government has sent a proposal to the Centre seeking powers to shut down local markets that may emerge as hotspots besides seeking to restrict the number of guests at marriage functions at 50. The proposals came against the backdrop of rising cases during the festival season with cases crossing 8,000 mark. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government had earlier allowed 200 guests at marriage functions based on the Centre's guidelines. "Earlier, this number was 50 but considering the recent spike in the number of Corona cases, the Delhi government has decided to withdraw this relaxation. Only 50 people will be allowed in the marriage ceremonies in the capital considering the spike in the number of Covid cases in Delhi. I have sent the proposal to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in this regard, for his approval,” he said during a digital address on Tuesday. He said another proposal by the Delhi government, to allow local lock-downs at market places which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots in Delhi, has been sent to the Centre. This decision was taken as Delhi witnessed massive crowds in some of the popular markets of Delhi before Diwali where no social distancing was followed, he said. "In the last order passed by the Central government, it was noted that permission to impose local lockdowns in the state should be taken from the Centre. In view of the recent situation and considering the last order of the Central government, we have requested the Centre to permit shutting down market places if necessary," he said "I do believe that such harsh measures would not be required. But, if any marketplace has become a Covod-19 hotspot due to the non-following of guidelines such as no social distancing or wearing masks, we would have to impose a local lockdown in those areas as a precautionary measure. I have already sent this proposal," he said. Kejriwal's proposal was opposed by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which said the move may prove to be "counterproductive" as lakhs of livelihoods are at stake and urged the Centre to consult traders before taking any such decision. Health Minister Satyendar Jain had on Monday said there was no chance of reimposition of lockdown in the national capital since the third wave of the coronavirus has peaked out in the city. The Centre on Sunday had decided to add more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, double the RT-PCR tests, deploy doctors and healthcare professionals from paramilitary forces and set up a dedicated team to study the bed availability in private hospitals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/arvind-kejriwal-seeks-power-from-centre-to-impose-lockdown-in-markets-which-may-emerge-as-covid-19-hotspots-916535.html
17-11-2020||North and Central||SC says not satisfied with Centre’s affidavit on pleas over media reporting of Tablighi congregation||The Supreme Court Tuesday expressed displeasure over the Centre's affidavit in the case related to media reporting of Tablighi Jamaat congregation here during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, and said the government should consider setting up a regulatory mechanism to deal with such contents on TV. Observing that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's affidavit did not deal with the applicability of Cable Television Network Act (CTNA) in the case, the apex court said the government has the power to put a regulatory mechanism in place and it cannot be left to an outside agency like NBSA (News Broadcasters Standards Authority. “We want to know the mechanism employed by you and this affidavit has nothing on it. Why should we refer to NBSA etc. when you have the authority to look into it. If it does not exist then you create an authority. We can also hand it over to an outside agency,” said a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde. The top court, which was hearing the pleas filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind and others alleging that a section of the media was spreading communal hatred over Tablighi Jamaat congregation during the onset of pandemic, asked the Centre to file a fresh affidavit dealing with mechanism to regulate electronic media under the CTNA. The congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in the national capital in March, attended by thousands of Indian and foreign nationals, was cited as being responsible for accelerating the spread of coronavirus or COVID-19, with its attendees allegedly carrying the infection to different parts of the country. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, referred to the freedom of speech and expression of the media and said that NBSA is a part of the self-regulatory mechanism. The apex court however asked the Centre to consider creating a regulatory mechanism and apprise it on the issue. It said the government should also inform as to what steps have been taken under the CTNA. “First you did not file a proper affidavit and then you filed an affidavit which did not deal with the two important questions. This way it cannot be done Mr Mehta,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told the law officer. “Mr Mehta, we are not satisfied with your reply. We wanted you to tell as to what actions you have taken under the Cable TV Network Act,” said the bench, also comprising. The top court said further said: “We want to know what is the mechanism to deal with these contents on television. If there is no regulatory mechanism then you create one. Regulation cannot be left to organisations like NBSA.” Mehta told the bench that several actions have been taken under the Act. “You have to tell us how you have acted under Cable TV Act in some prior incident,” the bench said, questioning Mehta as to why the Centre has not created a body to regulate these things. The bench said it had asked the Centre to specify how CTNA could be used to control the content of cable TV network and also about steps which could be taken to deal with such complaints but the affidavit is silent on these aspects. The top court has posted the matter for hearing after three weeks. The I&B Ministry affidavit said a majority of leading national newspapers have carried “largely factual reports” on the issue. “Online news portals such as The Print and The Wire have also undertaken objective reporting, through news reports, and analysis, through opinion and editorial articles of events concerning the Tablighi Jamaat. "By and large, issues relating to health, law and order and the action taken by the central government and the various state governments for handling the pandemic have been discussed,” the affidavit said. It also said that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has issued orders for blocking fake or misleading content related to the issue of coronavirus on social media. On October 8, the apex court had observed that freedom of speech and expression is the “most abused right” in recent times and pulled up the Centre for its "evasive" and "brazen" affidavit on media coverage of the Tablighi Jamaat event earlier this year. The top court was irked over the fact that instead of I&B Secretary, an Additional Secretary filed the affidavit which contained “unnecessary” averments with regard to media reporting in Tablighi Jamaat issue. In August, the Centre had told the apex court that a Muslim body's attempt to obtain a blanket "gag order" on the entire media to prevent them from reporting of the Nizamuddin Markaz issue would effectively destroy the freedom of the citizenry to know and the right of journalists to ensure an informed society. The government had said that in the absence of any specific information about any objectionable news published or aired by a specific news channel/agency, the Constitution and the applicable statutes do not give it any authority to unilaterally pass any censure order under the CTNR. The Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind plea sought directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of "fake news" related to the Nizamuddin congregation and take strict action against those responsible for it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-says-not-satisfied-with-centre-s-affidavit-on-pleas-over-media-reporting-of-tablighi-congregation-916538.html

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said he is sending a proposal to the Centre to give power to Delhi government to impose lockdown in market areas which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots. Reacting to the proposal, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) urged "Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal to consult the traders before taking any such decision as the livelihood of lakhs of traders and their employees and other people are at stake". CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that such a proposal shows "utter failure" of the Delhi government in handling the Covid situation. He said although Covid spread is certainly a major concern among the people of Delhi but the issue needs to be handled in a strategic way and not in a piecemeal manner. "The pros and cons of shutting the markets must be examined. The traders and Trade Associations of Delhi stand fully in solidarity with the government to tackle the Covid situation. However, without consulting the traders, any step taken by the government will be counterproductive," Khandelwal said.

Tyagi, popularly known as Computer Baba, was earlier arrested in preventive action when the administration was removing encroachment from a government land in Jamburdi Hapsi village near Indore on November 8. "When we demolished Tyagi's illegal ashram in Jamboori Hapsi, we seized an SUV from there, and although Computer Baba was using the vehicle, it was registered in the name of Ramesh Tomar," additional district magistrate (ADM) Ajaydev Sharma said. There are 19 cases related to criminal conspiracy, cheating, extortion, manhandling, among others registered against Tomar, he said. "During our probe, we found that Tomar had built a few houses in Musakhedi area without the Indore Municipal Corporation's (IMC) permission," the official said, adding that these were demolished in the presence of police. In the same area, he had also leased out a plot to three telecom companies for setting up mobile towers, which are also being removed, Sharma said. Meanwhile, IMC building inspector Nagendra Singh Bhadoria said illegal constructions undertaken by Tomar are spread over 15,000 sq ft area and included four permanent structures and two vacant plots. He had also illegally occupied a land earmarked for a park, which was also taken over by the administration, it was stated. Tyagi (54), who was once accorded the status of minister of state by the both BJP and the Congress governments, was arrested under section 151 of the CRPC as a precautionary measure during the demolition at his ashram.

The 980-bed hospital, which is the largest municipal hospital in Delhi, was designated as a coronavirus facility on June 14, when the city was under the first wave of the spread of the infection.

The Centre after a high-level meeting here recently had announced a slew of steps, including making available 300 additional ICU beds, doubling the number of daily RT-PCR tests and a house-to-house survey in the national capital, to check the spiralling numbers of cases in Delhi. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said that some of the hospitals under the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.  The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh Covid-19 cases per day, taking into account winter-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. Delhi recorded 3,797 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.89 lakh, even as 99 new fatalities pushed the toll to 7,713, authorities said. The highest single-day spike till date here -- 8,593 cases -- was recorded on November 11 when 85 fatalities were also recorded. Delhi has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Wednesday. On Thursday, 104 deaths, the highest in over five months, were recorded in the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/as-cases-surge-hindu-rao-hospital-likely-to-be-made-covid-19-facility-again-916645.html

"The UP government's strategic response to Covid-19 by stepping up contact tracing efforts is exemplary and can serve as a good example for other states," Roderico Ofrin, WHO Country Representative, said in a statement issued here by the state government.      The global health body appreciated the efforts made by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his government for the management of Covid-19, especially in tracking high-risk contacts, an official spokesperson of the government said. Over 70,000 front-line health workers worked across the state to reach out to high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive cases, he said.      Acknowledging contact tracing as an essential public health tool for controlling the pandemic, Ofrin stated, “Systematic tracking of contacts through a proper mechanism is the key, along with a well-trained health workforce to implement the surveillance activities.”           “The WHO team provided technical support to the state government to boost contact tracing efforts and strengthen the capacity of field teams through training. Field monitors assessed the quality of contact tracing of 58,000 Covid-19 positive cases in 75 districts and found that 93 per cent of the high-risk contacts were traced and tested,” said Madhup Bajpai, Regional Team Leader, Uttar Pradesh Region, WHO-NPSP (National Police Surveillance Project).        In the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases, the state government has also issued an alert to all the districts and special precautions are also being taken in view of the upcoming Chhath Puja, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/who-praises-uttar-pradesh-government-for-covid-19-management-916653.html
17-11-2020||North and Central||Mehbooba hits back at Amit Shah over his 'Gupkar Gang' remarks||Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday hit back at Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his 'Gupkar Gang' remarks, saying such comments were aimed at diverting people's attention from rising unemployment and inflation. Mehbooba said the "BJP's stale tactic of dividing India by projecting themselves as saviours and political opponents as internal and imagined enemies is far too predictable now." "Love jihad, tukde tukde and now Gupkar Gang dominates the political discourse instead of (issues) like rising unemployment and inflation," she said. The PDP chief also wondered whether fighting elections in an alliance is also anti-national now. "BJP can stitch as many alliances in its hunger for power but somehow we are undermining national interest by putting up a united front," she said. "Old habits die hard. Earlier BJP's narrative was that the tukde tukde gang threatened India's sovereignty and they are now using 'Gupkar Gang' euphemism to project us as anti-nationals. Irony died a million deaths since it's BJP itself that violates the constitution day in and day out," she tweeted. She was reacting to a series of tweets by Shah calling the alliance of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir as 'Gupkar Gang'. Shah also said it is an "unholy global gathbandhan" against the country's national interest and questioned Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi whether they support the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), formed to demand the restoration of Article 370, scrapped last year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mehbooba-hits-back-at-amit-shah-over-his-gupkar-gang-remarks-916673.html

He had been briefed that the People’s Alliance was preparing to boycott elections. This would have allowed the BJP & newly formed King’s party a free run in J&K. We didn’t oblige them,” he added. Taking his response further, the former CM in another tweet asked Shah: “Only in J&K can leaders be detained & called anti-national for participating in elections & supporting the democratic process. The truth is all those who oppose the ideology of the BJP are labelled “corrupt & anti-national.” Mehbooba Mufti, who is president of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), while reacting to Home Minister’s remarks, tweeted: “Old habits die hard. Earlier BJPs narrative was that the tukde tukde gang threatened India’s sovereignty & they are now using ‘Gupkar Gang’ euphemism to project us as anti nationals. Irony died a million deaths since its BJP itself that violates the constitution day in & day out.” Questioning the BJP's criticism of the alliance partners of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), she said fighting elections in an alliance “is also anti-national now.” “BJP can stitch as many alliances in its hunger for power but somehow we are undermining national interest by putting up a united front,” the PDP chief added. The BJP’s stale tactic of dividing India by projecting themselves as saviours and political opponents as internal and imagined enemies was far too predictable now. “Love jihad, tukde tukde & now Gupkar Gang dominates the political discourse instead of like rising unemployment & inflation,” Mehbooba observed. Earlier Shah in a tweet said: “The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India”.  The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang ? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India.

17-11-2020||North and Central||Chhattisgarh CM seeks central nod to convert surplus paddy into ethanol||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel called on Union Petroleum and Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday and urged him to grant permission for the production of bio-ethanol from surplus paddy purchased from farmers in the state. He also demanded increase in the quota of kerosene oil for dwellers in forest areas. During the meeting, the chief minister said that 80.38 lakh metric tons of paddy was purchased in the Kharif marketing year 2018-19 in Chhattisgarh and 83.94 lakh metric tons of paddy in 2019-20, resulting in surplus production of rice which exceeded the required quantity of central pool of rice and the state pool under the public distribution system. The state was forced to take additional quantity of rice by milling surplus paddy, he said. Baghel informed the Union minister that the state government has made necessary provisions in the Chhattisgarh's industrial policy 2019-24 for setting up ethanol plants. Chhattisgarh has requested permission to produce ethanol from about 6 lakh metric tonnes of paddy, an official statement said. Baghel demanded permission for producing bio-ethanol from surplus paddy purchased from farmers in the state in addition to FCI. The chief minister informed that an estimated 6 lakh tonnes of surplus paddy will be made available by the state government to ethanol plants. The chief minister drew the Union minister's attention towards more requirement of more kerosene oil by dwellers in forest areas and requested him to increase the quota of kerosene.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chhattisgarh-cm-seeks-central-nod-to-convert-surplus-paddy-into-ethanol-916687.html
17-11-2020||North and Central||Rain, stronger winds help clean up Delhi's air, AQI in 'moderate' category||The air quality in the national capital improved significantly on Tuesday as rainfall, along with stronger winds, helped clean up pollutants, authorities said. According to Central Pollution Control Board's mobile application SAMEER, the air quality index (AQI) was recorded in 'moderate' category at 171 in the evening, while it was 168 in the morning, much better than the city's AQI on Monday which stood at 221 in 'poor' category. The city's 24-hour average AQI was 435 on Sunday and 414 on Saturday (Diwali). An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor SAFAR, the overall air quality of Delhi was in the moderate category as of Tuesday morning. "Surface winds are west-southwesterly and energetic, very favourable for pollutant dispersion. Rainfall along with stronger winds under the influence of Western disturbance helped to clean the build-up of pollution in the Indo Gangetic Plain,” it said. It also said that effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are significantly reduced and are around 98. "Boundary layer wind direction is north-northwesterly, however, since the fire-related emissions have significantly reduced, a significant impact is not expected. Stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi's air is almost negligible and estimated at a marginal three per cent for today,” SAFAR said. It, however, said that the significant AQI improvement is short-lived. The AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate to the 'poor' category on Wednesday. "AQI is forecasted to further deteriorate to the higher end of the 'poor' to lower end of the 'very poor' category on 19th and 20th November,” it said. In Delhi-NCR, the levels of PM2.5 -- which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases -- were 73.7 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 5 pm. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3. PM10 level stood at 130 µg/m3 at 5 pm. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India and 500 µg/m3 is the emergency threshold. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (172), Ghaziabad (166), Greater Noida (186), and Noida (178) recorded their AQI in “moderate” category. They recorded 'poor' AQI on Monday and braved “severe” air quality on Saturday and Sunday. Gurugram's AQI improved marginally but remained in the 'poor' category at 204. It was 246 on Monday. Delhi had recorded the worst pollution levels on Diwali in the last four years due to the combined effect of stubble burning, firecrackers and unfavourable meteorological conditions. The air quality on the day after Diwali was also the poorest since 2016. In a special report released on Sunday, the Central Pollution Control Board had said that almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali this year as compared to 2019. It could be attributed to bursting of firecrackers, higher share of stubble burning and unfavourable meteorology during the festival season, the CPCB had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rain-stronger-winds-help-clean-up-delhis-air-aqi-in-moderate-category-916690.html

The minor victim, who had suffered extensive burn injuries, died at a hospital in Delhi on Tuesday night. While the police claimed that the victim had immolated herself, her parents alleged that she was set ablaze by the family members of the accused. Three cops, including two sub-inspectors, were suspended on charges of laxity in the matter while a circle office (CO) was shunted out of the district, official sources here said on Wednesday. Police said that the minor, a resident of Jahangirabad area in the district, had allegedly been raped by a man, who hailed from her village, a few months back. A case was lodged in this connection and the main accused was arrested. The parents of the victim had approached the cops on many occasions alleging that the family members of the accused had been threatening them with dire consequences if she did not withdraw her complaint but the police did not taken any action. They said that the victim was set ablaze by four people, who were acquaintances of the accused, when she went out to dispose of garbage on Tuesday morning. Police, however, said that the victim had herself told them that she had immolated herself. Seven people were so far arrested in this connection, police said adding that several teams had been formed to nab the other accused persons. The incident comes close on the heels of alleged 'gangrape' and brutal murder of a teen in  Hathras district in the state. Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav lashed out against the UP government saying that it had failed to ensure safety of the womenfolk in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-rape-victim-dies-after-allegedly-being-set-afire-by-kin-of-accused-three-arrested-916691.html

17-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi plans coronavirus curbs as infections rise, critical-care beds run short||As India's capital battles its worst phase in the coronavirus pandemic, authorities drew up plans on Tuesday to reinstate some curbs, such as lockdowns of some markets, if necessary, although elsewhere in the nation new infections are falling. India added 29,163 cases over the past 24 hours for its lowest such increase since at least mid-July, government data showed, taking its tally of infections to 8.87 million, second only to the United States, and a death toll of 130,519. Both infections and deaths have fallen from a mid-September high but the situation is different in Delhi, a city of 20 million swathed in air pollution, where crowds thronged markets for last week's Hindu festival of Diwali. With his palms joined together during a live broadcast on Twitter, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pleaded for people to wear masks and maintain social distancing. "If...we see that social distancing and mask-wearing is not being followed in any bazaar and there's a possibility of those areas becoming a hotspot, we should be allowed to close them down for a few days," he added. Kejriwal said he had written to federal authorities for permission to impose the curbs. Since the middle of May, the capital has gradually opened markets and public transport shut during the early phase of the pandemic. Delhi, which recorded its highest infections and deaths last week, reported on Monday a fall in new infections to 3,797, but federal authorities have warned it to be ready for as many as 15,000 cases a day. As a popular time of year for weddings nears, Kejriwal's government has also asked federal officials for a further cut in the number of guests at such celebrations, to 50 from 200. The Delhi government's online tracker showed just 116 beds available, from a total of 1,327 in intensive care units equipped with a ventilator. Federal officials have promised to make hundreds more available soon. Delhi's air has high levels of tiny pollutants of the size known as PM 2.5, which doctors say can enter the nose to weaken the inner lining of the lungs and help the coronavirus spread.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-plans-coronavirus-curbs-as-infections-rise-critical-care-beds-run-short-916709.html

The overall objective of the project is to improve the learning outcome of public schools and bring them at par with private schools, they said. A dedicated team has been constituted for the planning, implementation and monitoring of the project, to be completed within six months at a cost of Rs 6 crore, they said. Under the project, a part of the Jammu and Kashmir government's 'Back to Village' programme, the administration will upgrade infrastructure of these schools and improve learning outcome through a range of interventions, including capacity building of teachers. Some of interventions being made are refurbishing of buildings where required, upgrading of furniture and equipment, round-the-clock power and water supplies, and establishment of libraries, science laboratories, IT labs and smart classes, the officials said. They said other highlights of the project are HR management, capacity building and training of teachers, continuous evaluation and society involvement, sporting infrastructure and games, skills labs, and innovation grant. Before embarking on upgrade of the 180 schools -- 120 in urban areas and 60 in rural areas of the district -- the administration conducted a pilot project and modernised 25 schools during the last fiscal. At a review meeting here, Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said the project was close to his heart and added that everything necessary would be done for modernising the schools. "The district administration is keen on equipping these schools with the latest facilities and transforming them on modern lines...the aim being to improve the learning outcome in the public school domain," Choudhary said. The work has been started in around 100 of these schools located in both urban and rural areas of the district, he said. The meeting was informed that funds have been released in favour of 25 schools located in urban Srinagar. Another 70 schools, which have already been partly equipped with modern facilities under the centrally sponsored Samagra Shiksha scheme, will receive the required funding in due course, the officials said. Headmasters of 25 schools that were upgraded under the pilot project attended the meeting and shared their experiences and feedback, the officials said.

"The success of Haryana's white revolution can be gauged from the fact that milk production of the state in the year 2013-14 was 74.42 lakh tonnes which has increased to 107.26 lakh tonnes in the year 2018-19 and the per capita availability of milk has increased from 800 grams to 1,087 grams, placing the state on the second position in the country," Dalal said. He also said that geographically, Haryana is best suited to meet the needs of daily requirement of fruits and flowers, vegetables, milk, eggs, meat etc, of about 5 crore population in and around Delhi. Haryana has taken the initiative to move forward and has prepared new schemes so that the state's farmers can derive the benefit of this market. Haryana is implementing new schemes due to which not only the milk production and per capita milk availability is continuously increasing but the fish production has also been given a boost, he said.  Dalal, in a statement, further said Haryana has also performed remarkably in fish farming. Under fish farming in the year 2013-14, there was a production of 1,05,266 metric tonnes on 16,450 hectare area which has increased to 1,73,316 metric tonnes on 17,216 hectares in the year 2019-20.  He said that during this period, the number of ponds for fisheries has increased from 7,486 to 10,416.  Dalal said the Pashu Kisan Credit Card Scheme has been implemented on the lines of Kisan Credit Card to provide affordable loans for dairy and fish farming.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/annual-milk-production-in-haryana-rises-to-10726-lakh-tonnes-agri-minister-j-p-dalal-916779.html

If we got adequate seats in any tip-up before the 2022 assembly polls, we can form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, Shivpal told reporters here. "To defeat the BJP, our outfit will ally with like-minded parties," Shivpal Yadav said. On Saturday, Akhilesh Yadav had hinted at a possible electoral tie-up with his estranged uncle Shivpal’s party. "Adjustment will be done with smaller parties but there will be no alliance with larger parties," Akhilesh had told reporters. On Shivpal Yadav, he said, "We will adjust that party too. Jaswantnagar is his seat and the Samajwadi Party vacated it for him.

The classes will run with certain restrictions like maintaining social distancing, using hand sanitisers, thermal scanning and other facilities, according to the government order. Additional Chief Secretary, Higher Education, Monika Garg has issued a detailed order to all the state and private universities, district magistrates and registrars, the spokesperson said. The classes will be run in a phased manner and it has been made mandatory for teachers, students and employees to wear identity cards, he said. The institutions have been asked to prepare an academic calendar and run classes as per rotation with 50 per cent students. The UGC had last week notified guidelines for reopening of universities and colleges across the country which have been closed since March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. For central universities and other centrally-funded higher education institutions, the decision for reopening of campuses has been left to the vice-chancellors and heads. However, for state universities and colleges, the respective state governments were asked to take a call.   The universities and colleges were asked to plan the opening of campuses in a phased manner, with such activities that adhere to Covid-19 norms, including social distancing, use of face masks and other protective measures. As per the UGC guidelines, students and staff are advised not to visit areas falling within containment zones.   Universities across the country were closed on March 16 to contain the spread of coronavirus infection. A nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-govt-allows-opening-of-higher-education-institutes-from-november-23-916790.html

On his maiden visit to the Kashmir valley after being appointed the party's national general secretary and its incharge for Jammu and Kashmir, Chugh said the dreams of PAGD will never be realized. "This Gupkar gang is exploiting and misleading the people of Jammu and Kashmir. They are daydreaming and their dreams will never be realized. Article 370 will never be restored, and neither China nor Pakistan can dare challenge India now," Chugh said addressing the party workers here. He said the party will not allow the alliance to succeed in their "nefarious designs". The BJP leader said the central government will audit all the "misdoings" of the regional parties in Jammu and Kashmir and it is committed to provide justice to the people of the UT. "Regional parties in J-K have to answer each and everything they did during the past seven decades and the BJP is committed to it. We will provide justice to Kashmiri mothers, brothers and sisters whose rights have been snatched by the so-called leaders," he said. Chugh said both Abdullahs and Muftis have lost democratic space in the region as no one was interested in dynastic rule again. "All things will be discussed now in front of the public. Some of the leaders have made properties in foreign countries and all will be investigated," he said. He also reviewed the party's preparedness for the District Development Councils (DDC) polls and said the BJP has always been in favour of strengthening democracy in the DDC elections as it would empower people at the grassroots level. "There are others who are misleading the people on (Article) 370 restoration and other things, but people understand their hunger for power," Chugh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/article-370-will-never-be-restored-gupkar-alliance-exploiting-misleading-jk-people-bjp-leader-tarun-chugh-916795.html

Earlier, the family had suspected a failed rape bid after the bodies were recovered from the pond in the Asodhar area of Fatehpur on Monday. Superintendent of Police Prashant Verma on Tuesday said a panel of doctors conducted the girls’ autopsy, which was videographed. There are misleading reports in social media that hands of the girls were tied and their eyes were damaged, he said, rejection apprehensions of rape. “In the post-mortem report, it came to the fore that they died due to drowning,” the SP said. The victims' father, however, alleged that injuries to their eyes indicated that they were thrown into the pond after murder. “We want that an FIR be registered and the matter be probed by the CBI. I am not satisfied with the post-mortem report," he said. When asked whether any complaint was given by the victim’s father, Asodhar SHO Ranjit Bahadur Singh said, "I have not got any complaint in this regard." Earlier in the day, the SP had said that both girls, aged 12 and 8, had gone to the pond to fetch 'singharha' (water caltrops) and seemed to have drowned there. The girl's mother said the bodies were pulled out of the pond by their uncle with the help of three to four other people. The girls' uncle had alleged that when he was informing the district magistrate about the incident over the phone, a police constable came to him and told him not to speak about this to anyone. He claimed that the people who helped him pull out the bodies from the pond have been detained by police so that the truth does not emerge. He alleged that the girls were raped and then killed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/fatehpur-kin-of-dead-minor-girls-allege-rape-seek-cbi-probe-autopsy-points-to-drowning-916807.html

While inspecting Shahdara Labour Office, Sisodia expressed satisfaction over registration and successful disposal of applications, and stressed on the need to further streamline internal processes, a Delhi government statement said. "The Delhi government has made comprehensive plans to help the labourers, especially during the trying times of corona crisis. The government has directed that the amount from welfare schemes such as for their child's education, medical treatment, disability, marriage, or maternity reasons should reach the workers' bank account within 72 hours," Sisodia said. "Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia directed the labour officials to ensure the city workers receive the benefits of various labour welfare schemes within 72 hours of their application," the statement said. He asked the officials to speed up application processing timeline by improving on internal procedures, especially during the coronavirus crisis, to ensure the workers are able to avail the benefits in time. The deputy CM inquired about disposal of the applications received in the office, and checked the records of pending applications and files. "He discussed reasons for the two-year-old pending cases with the officials. The officials said that the delay in the approval process stemmed from the headquarters," the statement said. Sisodia added that the execution of all files should be done on a "first-come, first-serve basis". "If there are cases where selective files are being forwarded or favoured against others, strict action will be taken against the officers engaging in such activities," he warned. He also directed officials to put up notice boards outside the office to inform the workers about the benefits of schemes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ensure-workers-get-benefits-of-schemes-within-72-hrs-of-submitting-applications-manish-sisodia-to-officials-916870.html

Any attempt to do away with this system will not work, he asserted, adding that his government had brought in Bills in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha to negate the impact of the central farm laws and had also taken up the issue with the Prime Minister, the Union Home Minister, among others.        “We have to ensure food security, what is plenty today may not be there tomorrow,” he pointed out, adding that while India was currently exporting wheat it did not mean that the surplus foodgrains will remain forever.        The country has to keep its reserves, he said at the virtual inaugural session of the USA-Punjab Investors' Roundtable 2020, an official release said. Appreciating the "growing interest" of American companies in Punjab, which contributes 3 per cent to India's GDP with just 1.5 per cent of the country's land area, the Chief Minister said his government wanted agriculture to become more high-value now, with greater growth in the overseas market. Inviting the investors to enjoy the state's business-friendly culture that "promoted entrepreneurship", he pointed out that the US was the top export destination -- USD 685 million amounting to approx. 12 per cent of Punjab's total exports in 2019-20.       At the outset, the Chief Minister congratulated the US on the completion of its electoral process and on the election of Joe Biden and Kamla Harris as President and Vice President elect, respectively.       He hoped this would usher in a new era of cooperation and friendship between the the US and Punjab.       Underlining the role played by the large Punjabi NRI population in the US, the Chief Minister said they were working hard to bring success to their countries, with Taranjit Singh Sandhu, currently serving as the Indian Ambassador to the US, a prime example of the synergy that exists between the US and Punjab.     Noting that Punjab was the "preferred landing place" for several American and other foreign investors coming to India, the Chief Minister pointed out that Pepsi and Walmart started their Indian operations in Punjab, and more than 30 American firms, such as Amazon, Walmart, Quark, Cargill, Tyson, Schreiber, Pepsi, Coca Cola currently have operations in Punjab. Referring to the "sweeping changes" made by his government in the industrial and business policy, the Chief Minister said it was an all-encompassing policy that provides attractive incentives to large units, MSMEs and start-ups across both, manufacturing and service sectors. In response to a question on the sports industry in the state,  Amarinder said Punjab's industry is largely constituted of MSMEs. Punjab ranks 1st in India in production as well as exports of bicycle and bicycle components, along with 29per cent share in India's Tractor production and ranks 2nd in export of Tractors from India. Punjab contributes to 25 per cent of India's secondary steel market, No. 1 in Hand tools and Machine tools production in India, he noted.          Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India's ambassador to the United States, said the lives of people across the globe had changed significantly since the pandemic, with the world becoming a reality. Pointing out that both India and US thrive on technology, he said he was encouraging US investors to consider Punjab, which was India's pride in more ways than one, as their next destination.        He cited the growth in Punjab's food, woollen, stitching machine, bicycle production, sports equipment sectors, among others, and pointed to the state's excellent economic growth rate of 10 per cent in the last decade.         There was immense scope for expansion into education, food procession and education sectors, etc, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/not-against-corporates-but-need-to-protect-farmers-punjab-cm-amarinder-916876.html
17-11-2020||Opinion||Covid-19 is a desperate cry from the suffering natural world||Mink are native to North America, but they are farmed by the millions around the world, including here in the United States. (Let’s be clear: “Farmed,” in this context, means the animals are kept in cages until they are killed and skinned for the fur industry.) Few people come into contact with mink, so the news about Covid-19 on mink farms hasn’t elicited the kind of public terror that would no doubt ensue if dog parks became potential superspreaders. It’s not news that life on earth is out of balance. We already know that human behavior — not just in burning fossil fuels but also in food production, wilderness fragmentation, habitat degradation and overpopulation, among other planetary depredations — has imperiled everything from global biodiversity to the actual weather. In the general public, however, warnings from scientists and environmental activists have fallen mostly on deaf ears, even when those depredations come with a cost to us. We have known for decades what happens when we put pressure on wild animals by degrading their habitats, interrupting their ecosystems, keeping them in cages or otherwise failing them. H.I.V., Lyme, bubonic plague, anthrax, Ebola — all are among the many animal pathogens that now infect human beings. The coronavirus pandemic is just the most recent example of what nature has been telling us all along. The conversation around conservation traditionally pits people who care about the natural world against people who say that nature is great so long as it doesn’t interfere with their plans to build a new subdivision or buy a cheap hamburger or drive a giant SUV or eat raspberries year round. So long as it doesn’t inconvenience them in any way. Our mistake was only partly in believing that the natural world was ours for the taking. Our mistake was also in failing to understand that we ourselves are part of the natural world. If this pandemic has taught us anything it’s that we cannot escape the world we have shaped. We must begin right now to make preserving biodiversity a priority, to make protecting wildlife habitats a priority, to make living in closer harmony with our wild neighbors a priority. Keeping ourselves safe from a future of ever-renewing pandemics will mean completely reframing the way we think about the natural world. “Animals don’t exist in order to teach us things, but that is what they have always done, and most of what they teach us is what we think we know about ourselves,” the British naturalist Helen Macdonald writes in her transcendent new essay collection, “Vesper Flights.” For far too long, human beings believed they’d been given dominion over all the Earth. Now the slaughtered minks in Denmark — and all the creatures who are dying in this human-wrought and rapidly accelerating extinction — are teaching us what we need to do to save them and ourselves, too: We must change our lives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/covid-19-is-a-desperate-cry-from-the-suffering-natural-world-916389.html
17-11-2020||Opinion||A yearning for human dignity in times of Covid-19||“Human dignity is the same for all human beings: when I trample on the dignity of another, I am trampling on my own” – Pope Francis What is the intrinsic value of being a human? Which is the guiding principle for moral values and civic virtues that we are supposed to follow? On what do human rights, bioethics and social justice discourses rest on? What do the Constitutions of nations supposedly strive to preserve? The answer common to all the questions posed above is the idea called ‘human dignity’.  Every person is worthy of honor and respect no matter who they are in this world. This is normative. But the reality is something entirely different. We live in an unjust and a stratified world. Human dignity crowns only a select few people. Not everyone is equally treated. If at all the inherent dignity of human beings was respected, vital resources, such as health and education for realising the fullest potential of the human beings, would not be unequally distributed. Not only are material resources unfairly distributed, even the honor of life is unequally assigned. It appears some lives matter less than the others. The current pandemic has only foregrounded pre-existing social inequities and also brutally revealed the extent to which human dignity is compromised. In the world’s largest democracy, India, stories of human dignity being trampled upon, especially during the pandemic have become common. We have seen hapless migrant workers walking all the way to their hometowns from big cities, instances of spraying of insecticide on labourers, poor living conditions in quarantine facilities, stigma and violence against frontline health workers, improper handling of dead bodies of Covid-19 infected individuals, use of police force and publicly shaming lockdown violators to name a few examples. All this shows clearly how respect for human dignity was tossed out of the window during the pandemic.  In the name of curbing the pandemic and ensuring public health what we see is that humans are stripped of their dignity. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which India is a signatory, says, “No one shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment.” Some provisions of the declaration can be suspended in view of public (health) emergencies like the one we are facing now.  However, the restrictions that are imposed on the individual’s rights in a democratic society even during the emergencies should consider caveats. The Siracusa principles propagated since 1985 say restrictive measures should be legitimate to achieve a social purpose, that it should be absolutely required in order to achieve the social cause, that the measures taken should be minimally intrusive and the least restrictive option should be chosen, the restrictive measure should be supported with scientific evidence, that it should not be applied arbitrarily or discriminatively, it should be subjected to review and most importantly, it should respect human dignity.  More empathy, not less  The harsh unplanned nationwide lockdown that was imposed on 1.2 billion Indian citizens is a case in point that illustrates the extent to which human dignity was affronted in India. Many have lost their livelihoods. Some children are not able to access online education. Destroying livelihoods and poor access to education means loss of resources for leading a dignified life.  It's high time we realise that respect and human dignity should be center stage in our response to the pandemic. In fact, human dignity lies at the heart of solving all social problems we face today. The Covid-19 pandemic is cruel, it has taken a toll on the lives of the people especially the poor and marginalised. There is more reason now to be empathetic towards each other. We are no less human during the Covid-19 crisis. We should not forget that.  At this moment, it is good to recall the African ubuntu ideal: “I am because we are”. As a nation we fail morally when our fellow citizens are harassed, embarrassed and when their dignity is denied in any form. Afterall, the idea of a democratic nation is built with the expectation that it will uphold our worth as a human being.  Solidarity and responsibility are key for preserving human dignity which is the very foundation of our lives and societies. In that spirit, the state's measures to affirm human rights and social protection is pivotal. The State is obligated to preserve it for everyone and not just reserve it for some in the society. That will be gross injustice to humankind as a whole if we were to ignore this basic dictum of what it means to be human.  (Meena Putturaj is a health policy and systems researcher and a PhD scholar exploring the institutional dimension for implementing patient rights) Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author’s own.

Palaniswami, while pointing out that more 4,500 Haj pilgrims from Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states used to go for Haj pilgrimage over the years from here to Saudi Arabia, said it was not the case for the year 2021. In a letter to Modi, the Chief Minister said the Haj Committee of India has informed Tamil Nadu that due to Covid-19 pandemic, the number of embarkation points in India have been reduced from 21 to 10 for Haj 2021 and Chennai has been left out. "The Haj pilgrims from Tamil Nadu have been assigned Cochin as their embarkation point. It will be logistically challenging for Haj pilgrims, who are mostly senior citizens to travel from various locations of Tamil Nadu to Cochin for boarding the flight. These pilgrims have represented to me about the hardship and difficulties they are likely to face while embarking on Haj pilgrimage from Cochin," Palaniswai said. Considering their hardship and inconvenience, Palaniswami requested that Chennai may be designated as an embarkation point for Haj 2021, as in earlier years. He also said Tamil Nadu would follow all prescribed Covid-19 protocols for ensuring the safety of the pilgrims.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/designate-chennai-as-an-embarkation-point-for-haj-2021-tamil-nadu-cm-to-pm-modi-916384.html
17-11-2020||South||Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation election to be held on December 1||Elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation are announced to take place on 1 December, two months ahead of the normal course. The Hyderabad civic body polls are crucial as the area encompasses 24 constituencies out of the total 119 MLA seats in the Telangana assembly. The polls are expected to offer the public perception of the K Chandrasekhar Rao government, which completes two years of its second term in December. The TRS, which had become unbeatable in the assembly, civic body and bypolls has suffered a humbling defeat last week when the BJP wrested the Dubbaka assembly seat from the ruling party. Buoyant by the victory, the BJP has avowed to repeat the success in the GHMC polls. The advancement of the Hyderabad polls, is believed by analysts, would aid the TRS in preempting the opposition especially the BJP strategies to gather strength attracting leaders, cadres and launch a sustained attack on the TRS over issues like recent floods in Hyderabad. While some colonies remained inundated in water for over a week, in several affected areas, locals protested that they did not receive the Rs 10,000 relief per family announced by chief minister Rao. State BJP chief Bandi Sanjay has accused Rao of “confining to his bungalow, when the poor were suffering in neck deep trouble.” In an apparent move to appease the voters ahead of the polls, minister for municipal administration KT Rama Rao has, on Deepawali day, announced a 50 percent relief for property tax payers, hiked salaries of the sanitation workers and offered a remedy for those denied the flood relief. The 2 February 2016 GHMC elections were dominated by the TRS and the AIMIM, which are on friendly terms politically. The TRS had then swept the polls claiming 99 out of the total 150 wards, while Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM was elected in 44 wards. The BJP was confined to four seats, Congress 2 and TDP 1. The GHMC, spread over Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy districts, has close to one crore population and has over 75 lakh voters. As per the schedule released by the Telangana State Election Commission on Tuesday, the last date for filing nominations is 20 November. The Mayor seat is reserved for Women (General). Elections this time would be in the ballot paper mode, instead of the Electronic Voting Machines.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/greater-hyderabad-municipal-corporation-election-to-be-held-on-december-1-916491.html

Tamil Nadu has made substantial progress in containing the spread of Covid-19 as the total number of new cases have been brought below 2,000 for the past few days. However, the number of people tested has also come down, raising concerns in various quarters. The state's tally stood at 7,59,916, including 7,32,656 recoveries and 11,495 deaths on Tuesday morning. The active cases were 15,765.  “Though it is attributed to festivals, rains and holidays still we need to be extremely careful in the coming days and ensure that public don’t take the case reduction as a basis for not following the SOPs and masks and avoiding testing. Kindly ensure that focussed sample collection and SARI and ILI monitoring and setting up fever camps in areas is not brought down,” Radhakrishnan said. He also asked the district collector to keep treatable beds, Oxygen, and ICU beds ready so that they are prepared to meet any increase in cases in the next 10 days to a fortnight. The Health Secretary also told the collectors not to “hastily close” any created or identified infrastructure and focus on areas that show a spurt in case. Unless testing is increased to pre-festival levels, there is likelihood that emerging hot spots and clusters can be missed, he said, adding that next 14 to 28 days are important. Since most states do antigen tests, Radhakrishnan asked district collectors to alert for travel related clusters as well. He also brought to the attention of district collectors the emergence of two clusters – one in Thanjavur and another in Chennai – and asked them to ensure that tracing and containment is done effectively.  Contending that enforcement of masks is extremely poor in public places, he also asked district collectors that meetings with traders associations are arranged and government agencies should demonstrate action by imposing fines. “Present alarming situation in Europe and the USA also is a forewarning for all. Let us not fritter away all the good work done at each level in the corporation and districts by all the departments and focus the next few days to ensure that focussed testing and fever camps and containment are again ensured in full vigour as done before the festival holidays,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/increase-testing-numbers-to-pre-festival-levels-tamil-nadu-health-dept-tells-collectors-916525.html

In a WhatsApp message on Monday night, Bedi said she had received complaints from a 'whistleblower' alleging that some women in a village here were receiving pension meant for the destitute, without being eligible for the monthly assistance. Women living with their spouses were getting the pension from the government department. The Lt Governor said she had asked the Secretary to the Social Welfare Department to go into the complaints and verify whether the benefit of monthly pension meant for destitute women was being enjoyed by ineligible persons. At the end of verification, it was found that 60 per cent of households were getting pension without being eligible for a long time. "Payment of pension for these ineligible persons has been stopped forthwith and steps were also underway to recover the amount they had received. The verification of records would also confirm for how long they were getting the pension, which is Rs 2000 a month for each destitute woman," she said. According to the Lt Governor, the deception was going on for long under the protection of some 'influential persons'. "The Secretary to Social Welfare Department would soon devise a method by which regular surveys would be conducted by official teams on a random basis to save government funds so that really needy persons could be helped," Bedi said. "All welfare measures should therefore be regularly verified to ascertain whether the benefits of the schemes reached the really eligible persons," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/60-puducherry-households-availed-benefits-without-eligibility-916561.html

Kandararu Rajeevaru, the head priest of the hill shrine here, formally launched the present year's initiatives at 'Sannidhanam', the temple complex, on Monday. Soon after the inauguration, a group of police personnel and volunteers led by Inspector General (IG) of police P Vijayan, who conceptualised the programme, cleaned the 'bhasmakulam', a temple tank and its premises, police sources said. Inaugurating the initiative, Rajeevaru said the young generation should give more priority to keep the ponds and sacred groves waste-free. He also urged to extend the drive to more places. Kerala High Court judge justice P Gopinath, who took part in the function, said there is no other sacred activity than cleaning the premises and removing garbage. Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president, N Vasu launched the updated version of the "Punyam Poonkavanam" website during the occasion. 'Punyam Poonkavanam' means the divine grove of Sabarimala Lord Ayyappa. According to police sources, the ultimate objective of the programme is to promote the culture of Responsible and Conscious Pilgrimage to all centres of worship and not just Sabarimala. In the long run, the same would be extended to all possible places of worship and promote eco-sensitive pilgrimage, they said. Besides the police, Departments of Devaswom, Health, Forest and Fire and Rescue along with voluntary organisations like Ayyappa Seva Sangham and Ayyappa Samajam also actively take part in the drive every year. Since 2011, the High Court has appreciated this project in more than eight judgements and directed the state government and Departments of Devaswom and Police as well as devotees to work for the success of the same. Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned this project in his monthly broadcast programme 'Mann ki Baat' and the Centre has listed this as a 'model project' under the prestigious 'Swachch Bharat Abhiyan'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/keralas-mass-cleanliness-drive-underway-in-sabarimala-916578.html

The meeting is expected to drop hints of the BJP's plans for Tamil Nadu vis-a-vis alliance for the crucial assembly polls due in the first half of 2021. Shah, who will be in Chennai on a day-long visit to lay the foundation stone for phase-II of Chennai Metro and a new reservoir to meet the water needs of the city, will interact with allies in an “informal set-up” on November 21. He will meet leaders of AIADMK – Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam – PMK, DMDK, and other allies who fought the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under the banner of National Democratic Alliance. “He (Shah) will be meeting all our allies in an informal set up. It is not a formal meeting, but a courtesy call since he is coming to Tamil Nadu after a long time,” a senior BJP leader, who is aware of the Home Minister's itinerary, told DH. Asked whether politics will be discussed during the meetings, the source said informal discussions will take place whenever political leaders meet. However, the leader added that Shah will not meet Tamil superstar Rajinikanth, who last month dropped hints that he may not take the political plunge, and expelled DMK leader M K Alagiri, elder son of party patriarch M Karunanidhi. “They were mere speculation. And meeting with Alagiri may take longer than we expected,” the leader said. The party is said to be keen roping in Alagiri, who was expelled from DMK by Karunanidhi, in 2014, which would certainly embarrass DMK President M K Stalin. Shah meeting alliance partners is also an indication that the BJP may want to continue with the coalition cobbled up for the 2019 polls though it might invite a few more parties to its fold. The BJP has been making a concerted effort to cobble up a formidable front against the DMK, which has indicated that it may fight the polls with the existing alliance. Shah's meeting with Palaniswami and Panneerselvam assumes significance as it comes amidst a tug of war between AIADMK and BJP over the latter's Vetrivel Yatra. It also comes at a time there is speculation that AIADMK might go it alone in the assembly polls. Sources in the AIADMK said it was “pre-mature” to talk about alliance as elections are nearly seven months away in Tamil Nadu. BJP sources said after meeting leaders of alliance partners, Shah will also interact with office-bearers of the state unit of the party and members of the core committee on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/amit-shah-to-meet-leaders-of-alliance-partners-during-tn-visit-916595.html

The special court dealing with Prevention of Money Laundering Act case (PMLA) here rejected the plea moved by the former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. The court had on November 12 posted the plea to Tuesday for orders after hearing arguments of the prosecution and the defence in detail. The officer, arrested by the ED on October 28 in connection with the 'money laundering' aspect in the gold smuggling case, is now lodged in a jail here after the court remanded him to judicial custody till November 26. Sivasankar had on Monday submitted an argument note in the court alleging that he was arraigned as an accused as he had refused to name a few political targets of theED's choice. He had described as "without any basis" and "trumped up" the ED's claim that he accepted in his statement to the agency on October 15 that he had spoken to a senior customs officer and made a request to clear cargo addressed to UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram as per wishes of Swapna Suresh, a key accused in the gold smuggling case. The ED, probing the money trail in the case, had earlier alleged that Suresh in a statement claimed that Sivasankar and his team in the CMO were fully aware of the smuggling of the precious metal through the diplomatic channel. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold worth Rs 15 crore from diplomatic baggage of the UAE Consulate at Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. The ED has alleged that Sivasankar had intervened to get the diplomatic baggage containing smuggled gold cleared without examination by the Customs. The IAS officer was suspended after his links to Suresh surfaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/court-denies-bail-to-suspended-ias-officer-sivasankar-in-ed-case-linked-to-gold-smuggling-916659.html

'Sandhesham' (message), a popular Malayalam film released in 1991, that sarcastically tells the story of a family with two brothers active workers of opposite political parties has now become relevant in the state now. The Edamulackal gram panchayat in the eastern parts of Kollam district is witnessing contest between mother and son, while many wards in the state are witnessing contest between brothers and close family members. Sudharma Devaraj is the NDA candidate at Panachavila ward of Edamulackal grama panchayat, abut 30 kilometres from Kollam city. She had contested in the last elections, but came second to CPM's Radhamani B. Hence NDA fielded her again with high hope of winning the ward by highlighting the plights of the ward. But the left-front played the trump card by fielding Sudharma's son Binu Raj against her. Binu told DH that he was not contesting against his mother, but her political ideology. But Sudharma strongly feels that it was a trick of the left front to field her son against her. Even as both of them were actively campaigning against each other, they say that there was no politics inside their house. Maruthathoor, at Neyyattinkara, on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram; Puttingal in Kollam, and Mathilakom in Thrissur are among the wards witnessing fight between brothers. Elder brother Purushothaman Nair is the left front candidate at Maruthathoor, while Sanal Kumar is the Congress candiate. At Puttingal siblings Sujiraj and Sudheer Kumar are taking on each other for CPM and Congress respectively. Mathilakom is witnessing bothers E K Biju and E K Baiju contesting each other for CPM and Congress. Todupuzha municpality in Idukki district is witnessing wives of two cousins, Cini Shaji and Sajima Shimnaz contesting against each other for Congress and CPM respectively. While all these candidates are taking the contest against family members politically, it is their relatives who would be caught up in a confusion while heading towards the polling booths.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/contests-between-families-mark-kerala-local-body-polls-916674.html

The state Election Commissioner V Bhaskaran issued an order freezing the symbol as both the fighting factions, one led by Rajya Sabha MP and son of late party supremo K M Mani and the other one headed by MLA and former minister, P J Joseph, claimed ownership of the symbol. With this, both the factions cannot use the symbol in the upcoming local body polls. The poll body's action would be subject to the verdict of two existing cases in this regard at the Kerala High Court, EC sources here said. Based on their request, the symbol of 'chenda' (drum) was allotted to the Joseph faction and 'table fan' to the Jose faction to contest in the local body elections, they said. After severing its three-decades-old ties with the opposition Congress-led UDF, the Jose K Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) had joined the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF recently. The Jose faction's issues with the UDF leadership aggravated in June this year after it was "ousted" from the Congress-led Front in connection with the tussle over the Kottayam district panchayat chief post.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ec-freezes-two-leaves-symbol-of-kerala-congress-m-916702.html

Ramesh Kumar, the SEC, said that the commission is encouraged by the success of Covid-19 containment measures in AP, “whereby daily infections after touching a high of 10,000 cases have drastically come down to a low of 753 as today (Monday).” However, on Tuesday, 1,395 new cases were registered, when 66,778 samples were tested. 753 cases, the SEC quoted, were corresponding to only 43,044 samples tested on Sunday. The Panchayat and municipal body polls, scheduled originally in March 2020, were suspended by Kumar in the wake of the Covid-19 spread in the state. The SEC decision led to the removal of Kumar, a retired IAS officer, from the post in April by the Jaganmohan Reddy government. CM Reddy had then even accused the SEC as functioning unilaterally and in a partisan manner. After a bitter legal confrontation which even reached the Supreme Court, Ramesh was reinstated in July on the directions of the Andhra Pradesh high court. Interestingly, Kumar now attributes the significant fall of daily new Covid-19 cases to the "successful measures of Andhra Pradesh government," and dedication of the health care givers. "After due consultation with all the stakeholders and the government, (and) with reference to the prevailing ground situation of elections already successfully held in several parts of the country; (we) have taken a well considered decision in principle to hold elections to Gram Panchayats in the state tentatively in the month of February. It may be noted that there are no legal hurdles to hold GP elections which are held on a non party basis,” Kumar said in a statement. The SEC informed that all safeguards would be enforced learning from the best practices “including in neighboring Telangana's GHMC elections.” The schedule for the 1 December Hyderabad civic body polls was declared on Tuesday by Kumar's Telangana counterpart C Parthasarathi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-panchayat-polls-planned-in-february-state-election-commissioner-916741.html

"The pollution caused by the company on groundwater has been continuous, and has proven to be irremediable and irreversible along with the continued operation," it said. The government maintained that the Madras High Court has in its judgement on August 18 considered the matter in this factual backdrop, and correctly concluded that permanent closure was the only proportional and adequate response to the grave transgressions by the company. "Such an order, passed to protect the environment, and in consonance with the environmental jurisprudence of this court, brooks no interference," it said. In an affidavit to a plea by the company to allow the reopening of the plant, the state government said the High Court, after satisfying itself as to the bona fides of the decision-making process, has not supplanted any contra view to the feel of the expert authorities on closure.  "Equally, the court has chosen not to supplant its view as against the technical and administrative aspects of the matter, in consonance with the theory and principle of the separation of powers," it said. The state government further said that its Environment and Forest Department exercised its powers under section 18(1)(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 read with Article 48A of the Constitution in “larger public interest” to endorse the TN Pollution Control Board’s directions “and also” to “direct” to “seal the unit and close the plant permanently.”  "In doing so, the State Government took a policy decision to close the unit permanently," it said. In a separate detailed affidavit, the TNPCB stated among other grounds that a policy decision could only be interfered with by the court if such decision was shown to be patently arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-government-defends-its-decision-of-shutting-down-vedanta-plant-916746.html

In their plea, the candidates have sought directions from the tribunal to quash the selection process and initiate fresh proceedings in accordance with law for the selection.

Yediyurappa belongs to this community.  Yediyurappa’s decision comes just days after he ordered the formation of the ‘Maratha Development Authority’, a move that had the upcoming bypoll to the Basavakalyan assembly constituency in mind. The Marathas are said to be large in number there.  While Yediyurappa allocated Rs 50 crore for the Maratha authority, there is no mention of how much money will be set aside for the Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Board.  “Veerashaiva-Lingayats form a large community in the state, many of whom are economically, socially and educationally backward," Yediyurappa said in a note to Chief Secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar. The Board, which will work for the overall development of the community, will come into existence with immediate effect, the CM said.  Several Lingayat BJP legislators, including Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Housing Minister V Somanna and Agriculture Minister BC Patil, raised the issue with Yediyurappa after he created an authority for Marathas.  Former ministers MB Patil (Congress) and Basavaraj Horatti (JDS), both Lingayats, also raised the issue. In fact, Patil has demanded 16% reservation for the Lingayats on the lines of what Maharashtra has done for Marathas. “Instead, creation of a body by giving Rs 100-200 crore will just be an eyewash,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/now-bs-yediyurappa-orders-separate-body-for-veerashaiva-lingayats-916520.html

Where is (the evidence) that the Congress is involved? There’s a clear attempt to target the Congress and bring a bad name to our party,” he said. He declined to comment when asked why Raj was held if there was no evidence.  The Bengaluru police apprehended Raj early Tuesday morning. The former mayor was said to be absconding for nearly a month. “He didn’t run away. He was not feeling well, is all,” Shivakumar said.  Raj has been accused of inciting the attack on Congress’ Pulakeshinagar legislator Akhanda Srinivas Murthy’s house during the August 11 rioting in DJ Halli and KJ Halli. Murthy’s house was completely gutted in the violence. The legislator has publicly accused Raj of being involved in the attack.  On Tuesday, Murthy thanked Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and others for “ensuring justice”. Speaking to reporters, Murthy said Raj would not have escaped from hospital if he was not guilty. “Why did he run away? If he’s not guilty, he could have cooperated with the police,” he said.  Shivakumar, while not abandoning Raj’s side, said the party was also with Murthy. “Who said I’m not with Murthy? Our leaders and I visited his house, we mounted pressure on the police and we’ve done whatever we had to,” he said, adding that Murthy was free to meet him personally to discuss “internal party matters.” Raj’s arrest is a “big development” in the probe into the riots, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said, adding that the government had a strong case and “it will stand in court.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/dk-shivakumar-defends-congress-after-former-mayor-s-arrest-916546.html

Speaking to media persons, Eshwarappa said some media houses are projecting that only Vijayendra was responsible for the party's victory in Sira ignoring the efforts of party workers and other leaders. They are glorifying Vijayendra, son of the chief minister, with regard to the party's victory in Sira assembly constituency, dominated by Vokkaligas. But this is not fair as former MLA Suresh Gowda, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol and party workers also worked towards Rajesh Gowda's victory in the bypolls. Revenue Minister R Ashoka, Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan and party workers too worked for the party nominee's victory in the by-poll to R R Nagar assembly constituency, he said. "It is not fair to attribute party's victory in bypolls to an individual."

17-11-2020||State||KSRTC resumes bus services between Mangaluru-Kasargod||The State Road Transport Corporations of Karnataka and Kerala have resumed inter-state bus services between Mangaluru and Kasargod from Monday. Passenger bus services between Karnataka and Kerala remained suspended for eight months following the Covid-19 pandemic since mid -March. Local residents had echoed concerns that the suspension of the regular buses had affected their employment and commercial activities in both the districts. The people from border areas were dependent on the neighbouring states for their livelihood. Inspite of the envisaging of the Unlock 4 and 5, the bus services had not resumed. Following uproar from the daily commuters, KSRTC buses used to drop passengers at the border area of Talapady since September. Passengers bound for either direction had to get down at Talapady and board the bus of another State to reach their destination, which had caused a lot of inconveniences to the children and senior citizens along with daily commuters. From Monday, both Karnataka SRTC and Kerala SRTC resumed services between Kasargod and Mangaluru by deploying 20 buses each. Both corporations are expected to have 120 single trips each per day, said KSRTC Mangaluru Divisional Controller S N Arun to DH. Both the corporations were operating 40 buses doing 240 single trips each prior to the Covid-19 induced lockdown between Mangaluru and Kasargod. More than 15,000 people were travelling between two districts daily. Mangaluru-Kasargod is the profitable route for both the road corporations. The corporation had not incurred any loss prior to the lockdown, according to officials.   The full-fledged operations of buses will commence gradually as per the demand of the passengers, said Divisional Controller. The response has been good for the KSRTC bus service to Kasargod. The Puttur KSRTC division is yet to commence its bus services to Kasargod. “A meeting will be convened by the Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday to decide on the same,” said sources in Puttur KSRTC division.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ksrtc-resumes-bus-services-between-mangaluru-kasargod-916612.html

According to the SoPs issued by Government of Karnataka, all teachers, students and non-teaching staff members of colleges, hostels, universities should produce a Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report, which is done within 72 hours before the day of joining. Majority of the students are still waiting for their report and could not attend the classes, said a professor of Mangalore University. “I have given my swab for testing on Saturday morning the report is still awaited. Hence, I could not attend my class,” said a student. Colleges and universities remained closed for students since mid-March following the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no enthusiasm among the students fearing the pandemic. Only about 30% of the students attended colleges. A few parents too decided to wait and watch before giving their consent letter for students to attend classes. Teachers were seen issuing guidelines on Covid-19 for the students in the classes. Only those with covid-19 negative certificates were allowed inside the classes. At a degree college in Car Street, one student was seen sitting in one bench each, as a social distance method. The college authorities had sanitised the classrooms as a preventive measure.   The health department had also made arrangements to collect swabs of college students.

According to the Chief Minister's tentative tour programme, released by his office, Yediyurappa will be leaving for New Delhi by a special flight at 11:30 am on November 18 and reach there by 2:30 pm. It said the CM is scheduled to have meetings with various Union Ministers, before leaving for Bengaluru at 8:30 pm by a special flight. Though the Chief Minister's official itinerary does not mention any other meeting, official sources say, he is likely to meet BJP central leaders including National president J P Nadda and discuss the cabinet exercise. Yediyurappa had recently said a decision will be taken on whether to go for cabinet expansion or reshuffle after his discussion with the BJP central leadership, Political activities have intensified within the ruling BJP camp in the state, after Yediyurappa on November 10 indicated cabinet reshuffle was on the cards, soon after the party's victory in bypolls to two assembly constituencies. The Chief Minister had said he will soon be travelling to New Delhi to discuss with the party's central leadership and get their approval, as he hinted about reshuffle by dropping or inducting some Ministers. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are many aspirants. While several of the old guard like 8-time MLA Umesh Katti are waiting for a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP come to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will also have to keep space for Munirathna, following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the bypoll, and also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced. The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/cm-yediyurappa-to-visit-delhi-on-nov-18-likely-to-discuss-cabinet-exercise-916806.html

17-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Benglauru violence: Shivakumar accuses ruling BJP of trying to defame Congress||Defending the Congress following the arrest of former mayor Sampath Raj in connection with the Bengaluru riots, its Karnataka unit President D K Shivakumar on Tuesday accused the ruling BJP of 'misusing' the law to defame his party. "Every one has to respect the law whether it is Sampath Raj or D K Shivakumar. We are seeing that a section is misusing the law. Sampath Raj will definitely respect the law..," Shivakumar said. Terming the arrest as a "big development," Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said based on the evidence already collected and what we will get from this arrest, will give a clear picture regarding those behind the violence. Speaking to reporters here, Shivakumar said those in power, those in BJP are misusing the law and are purposefully making efforts to defame Congress party. "Definitely this is an attempt to target Congress, where is the evidence to prove that Congress men are involved. I have also seen the chargesheet. They (BJP) are doing it, they have a tradition to trouble Congress leaders and they are at it," he added. Sampath Raj, a the Congress corporator, was arrested early this morning for allegedly inciting the attack on party's Pulakeshinagar legislator Akhanda Srinivas Murthys house during the August 11 rioting in DJ Halli, KJ Halli and nearby areas. While Murthy's house was completely gutted in the violence, a police station, several public and private properties were damaged. Asked whether Sampath Raj has been arrested for not committing any mistake, Shivakumar merely said the matter was before the court and did not want to comment on it. Seeking to know how one could say that Sampath Raj was absconding, he said, "he (Sampath Raj) was not feeling well, lets see, I have not met him for about two months. Responding to a question on Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy's statement that he wants his party chief to stand by him, Shivakumar said he has not discussed anything with me in this regard, he may be speaking to media. "We cannot come to a decision based on individual opinion. Investigation process is on... what they have done with the probe and the politics behind it, we are aware... lets talk about it in the days to come," he said. Shivakumar further said that he stands by all Congressmen who are law abiding. "It may be his (Srinivas Murthy) opinion, but soon after the incident happened, along with our leaders I visited the spot, put pressure on the police (for fair probe)...," he added. Reacting to Murthy's demand for action against Sampath Raj, Shivakumar said not in front of media, let him come and talk to me. Earlier, responding to the arrest of Sampath Raj, Murthy told reporters that he was hurt that his party did not stand by him. "I am surely hurt. My party should stand by me because I am an MLA," he said. Murthy further said he had met Shivakumar and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah the very next day of the incident and would meet them again on Wednesday and demand justice. On August 11 night, around 4,000 people went on a rampage, setting ablaze the houses of Murthy and his sister over an alleged inflammatory social media post uploaded by his nephew. The angry mob also torched Devara Jeevanahalli and Kadugondanahalli police stations over suspicion that the nephew was present there. Three people were killed in police firing while another person died due to abdominal injuries suffered in the violence. Thanking Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and others for "ensuring justice", the MLA said Sampath Raj would not have escaped from the hospital if he was not guilty. "Why did he run away? If he's not guilty, he could have cooperated with the police," he said. Sampath Raj had allegedly escaped from a private hospital where he got admitted for Covid-19.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/benglauru-violence-shivakumar-accuses-ruling-bjp-of-trying-to-defame-congress-916689.html
17-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Colleges in Karnataka reopen to lukewarm response||Several colleges in Karnataka reopened on Tuesday with Covid-19 protocols in place, after remaining shut for eight months due to the pandemic but the attendance was thin. The state government had ordered reopening of colleges and resumption of offline or regular classes from November 17, stipulating conditions including production of a negative RT-PCR test report. Deputy Chief Minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan, who holds the higher education portfolio, had told reporters earlier that regular classes were necessary as the online classes would not suffice and students would miss out many lessons in the absence of good internet connectivity, lack of proper gadgets and the requirement for practical classes. However, there was thin attendance in colleges, sources said. The government had said a negative RT-PCR test report confirming no coronavirus infection was mandatory for the teachers, administration, staff and students. Students will also have to submit a no-objection certificate by their parents, permitting their wards to attend regular classes. Sanitisation of the classrooms, hand sanitiser, face masks and social distancing will be mandatory for the teachers and the students. The St Joseph College, Maharani College and RV College, were among those in Bengaluru which resumed regular classes, saw thin attendance, according to sources. Many colleges did not open as they were waiting to complete certain procedures like sanitising classrooms and obtaining the RT-PCR test report of teachers and students. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar appealed to the college administration and students to adhere to precautionary measures. "Be sure to wear mask, clean hands, and maintain physical distance. No need to panic but be cautious.

NCP president Sharad Pawar, whose party is an alliance partner in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government, and several state ministers also paid homage to the Shiv Sena's founder. The chief minister, accompanied by his wife and sons Aaditya Thackeray and Tejas Thackeray, visited the Shiv Sena founder's 'smritisthal' (makeshift memorial) at the Shivaji Park in Dadar area here. State NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal, a former Shiv Sena leader, also visited the site to pay homage to the late leader. The Shiv Sena earlier appealed to its workers to ensure physical distancing, in the wake of the COVID-19 situation, while visiting the memorial site, which is otherwise thronged by scores of party men on this day. Bal Thackeray died on November 17, 2012. "The pain that Balasaheb is not among us will be there forever. But we are sure he is always with us and will always be there with us and inspire us," Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said after paying tributes to the party's founder. "...his ideology, soul, Hindutva, and his Marathi pride will always be there with us forever," he said. Raut noted that the country's politics continues to revolve around the key issues of "sons of the soil and unemployment" which were flagged by Bal Thackeray 55 years ago. To drive home his point, the Rajya Sabha member also referred to the recently-held Bihar Assembly polls, in which the issue of employment was highlighted. Earlier in the day, politicians, including NCP president Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, paid glowing tributes to Bal Thackeray.

The accommodation was allocated to him as a former chief minister. Koshyari, sitting Governor of Maharasthra, in the petition, filed through advocates Ardhendhu Mauli Prasad and Pravesh Thakur, has sought a stay on the high court order. The plea cited Article 361 of the Constitution which gave protection to President and Governors from invoking any such proceedings. The plea also contended that the market rent was exorbitant and it has been computed without any rationale. The process of determination of market rent has been arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of principles of natural justice, he said. He also said the order by the HC was passed without hearing him in the matter. On October 26, the Supreme Court had already stayed the contempt proceedings against Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank initiated by the high court for occupying the government bungalow after demitting office as chief minister, without rent. The HC had on May 3, last directed the former CMs to pay market rent for the period they occupied the government bungalows after demitting office. A PIL was first filed by Uttar Pradesh-based NGO 'Lok Prahari' in the top court which led to a verdict on August 1, 2016, against the allotment of bungalows to ex-CMs in Uttar Pradesh||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-governor-koshyari-moves-sc-against-contempt-proceedings-over-rent-payment-916624.html

However, on the submission of Rao's counsel Indira Jaising that the report "did not shed any light on Rao's neurological condition and the urinary tract infection he is said to have developed while at the Taloja prison", the HC directed the government to file a "complete report detailing the type of medical exam conducted through video conferencing, and all other findings". Rao, 81, is currently lodged as an under-trial in the Taloja prison in neighbouring Navi Mumbai. Rao had filed a bail application and a writ petition seeking he be shifted to Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai immediately, owing to his "diminishing neurological and physical health condition". The high court will hear both pleas of Rao on Wednesday. Jaising told a bench of Justices SS Shinde and Madhav Jamdar that the state government's report was an "eyewash" as it is "silent on Rao's dementia". Jaising told the bench that doctors at Nanavati Hospital who had examined Rao on November 12 via a video link, had also suggested that further tests, including a complete blood count and sonography of the abdomen, be done on him. "The state has yet to get the tests done. Besides, the doctors examined Rao through the video link only for 15 minutes. He needs to be examined by specialists. A neurologist needs to examine him physically and these tests can't be done at the Taloja prison hospital," Jaising said. "...Rao was not examined by a specialist so how can the video examination tell this court whether he needs to be shifted out of the prison to the hospital?" she said. Jaising also said the state government should apprise the HC about Rao's complete medical condition in light of his application seeking bail on medical grounds. The HC then directed the state government to submit a complete report, detailing the "type of medical exam conducted through video conferencing, and all findings". The HC will now hear both the pleas filed by Rao via a physical hearing on Wednesday to avoid any further delay and technological hindrances, after Jaising faced issues with the audio arrangements during the day's hearing conducted via video link. "We know the seriousness involved in this matter and that is why we will hear it physically tomorrow itself," the bench said. Jaising sought the HC's directions to the state government to submit details of Rao's current neurological condition too, but Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, who appeared for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), told the court that it could "examine the issue tomorrow itself. Since his arrest in June 2018, Rao has been in and out of the government-run JJ hospital in the city. On July 16, he tested positive for coronavirus, after which he was shifted to the Nanavati hospital. He was discharged on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison, Jaising said. Last week, Jaising had urged the high court to direct the state government to shift Rao to Nanvati Hospital immediately in view of the apprehension that "Rao might lose his life while in prison". Jaising had said "Rao had dementia, had lost control of his bladder, was in diapers, and that his condition was deteriorating with each passing day". Jaising had alleged that the state government had been negligent in taking care of Rao in prison, "and if he died, it would be a case of custodial death". Following the submissions, the HC had ordered the video examination while giving the Nanavati doctors the liberty to examine Rao physically at the prison if needed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/varavara-rao-is-fully-conscious-and-oriented-maharashtra-government-tells-hc-916683.html

Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who is also the health minister, took stock of the situation on Monday and visited the civil hospital in Ahmedabad where he said that "Due to festivity, we are anticipating peak of the infection and for that purpose, we are devising plans to keep the logistics in Covid-19 hospital ready."  Last week, the government eased the timing of shopping and food joints till midnight in view of the festivity. Earlier, such activity was restricted to 10 PM. Before such decisions, Ahmedabad was reporting nearly 150 new coronavirus cases daily which increased to over 200 within a week of relaxation. Patel also announced that considering the infection surging again, creation of an ICU ward at the civil hospital in Ahmedabad for covid-19 patients. "We are witnessing a sharp rise of people lining up outside the testing camps across the city which mostly have rapid antigen testing kits. There were reports of asymptomatic persons lining for the test which compelled the civic body to change its testing policy. Now, only those with symptoms will be tested while asymptomatics will have to reveal that they came in touch with any infection person," said a health officer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/with-covid-19-guidelines-eased-cases-surge-in-gujarat-916761.html
