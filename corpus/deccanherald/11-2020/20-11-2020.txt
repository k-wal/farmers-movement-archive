20-11-2020||First Edit||Kashmir polls should signal new beginning||After the farcical Block Development Council elections held last year under lockdown and the sham Panchayat elections in 2018, Jammu & Kashmir will hopefully have a more meaningful electoral exercise with elections to the District Development Councils (DDC) to be held later this month and in December. Under a recently amended law, 280 constituencies were created for 20 districts where elections will now be held. Elections may mean a return of politics to the Union Territory after a prolonged break. The government had taken steps to ensure that there was no political activity, with the detention of all leaders of the main parties and other restrictions. Some of them have been released but some others are still in jail. These parties, including the National Conference, the People’s Democratic Party, the CPM and four others, have decided to contest the elections under the banner of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PUGD). It is likely that the government had thought that these parties would boycott the elections, as they have done in the past, and give a walkover to the BJP. There is also a view that the DDC elections were a ploy to avoid politics at the Assembly level, limit it to the districts, and make state leaders redundant and irrelevant. It is not a secret that the government wanted to politically nullify leaders like the Abdullahs and Mehbooba Mufti who have opposed the series of actions beginning with the scrapping of Article 370 in August last year, and then to create a new congenial politics in the UT. But the decision of the Gupkar Alliance to participate in the elections may have put paid to those plans, if they existed. There is also the possibility of these parties winning the elections and claiming that they have popular support. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has attacked the alliance, describing it pejoratively as the “Gupkar gang’’, a la the “tukde tukde gang’’. He has also flayed the Congress for being a part of it. Congress has distanced itself from the alliance but seems to have entered into seat adjustments with it. The government should have actually welcomed the wide participation of parties in the elections as a step to normalise the situation in Kashmir. Instead, these parties are being dubbed as anti-national and traitorous. Since all important parties are involved and since it is the first major election after the scrapping of Article 370, it will be keenly watched. It is the responsibility of the government and the election authorities to ensure that they are held in the most free and fair manner.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/kashmir-polls-should-signal-new-beginning-917663.html
20-11-2020||In Perspective||Sentiment should not dictate strategy||Indian strategic thinking has been dominated by sentiment rather than cold forecasting of possible events and relationships with countries. This is in contrast to China, which is at the other extreme. China uses sentiment as strategy and changes its attitudes depending on its assessment of situations. We can trace this back to the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru. He was strongly influenced by the success of the Soviet government in improving the conditions of life for its people and wanted to do the same for India. He was strongly against the wealth-owning rich and was all for sharply reducing inequalities. He saw that the US and Europe were exploitative in relation to poor countries like India and that they were responsible for the situation that developed in Africa and their support for the rulers in the Middle East. Nehru was the first leader in the world to accept and recognise the suzerainty of China over Tibet. The decision displayed a lack of vision in terms of what China’s control over Tibet could mean, for India would now be sharing the border with China from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. The consequences have become more and more visible since. I still recall Nehru at the Ram Lila Grounds in Delhi in 1956, holding Chou en-Lai’s hand and raising it in front of the hundreds of thousands who had come to hear them speak, and shouting together “Hindi Chini bhai bhai.” Around the same time, the Chinese premier must have been carefully planning to cross the border with his troops. This sentimentality, which was a result of Nehru seeing China as an old civilisation and neighbour of India and therefore not a threat, influenced his defence strategy. It was not tailor-made to deal with possible and unanticipated threats. It did not take account the very mountainous border with China and the need for Indian soldiers to be equipped to protect those borders. When China struck, India was thoroughly unprepared. Sadly, this sentimental approach to foreign policy and defence strategy continued in subsequent Indian governments led by Indira Gandhi and others. Even the present BJP government under Narendra Modi, which boasts of a muscular approach, did not do much to strengthen these muscles till more than four years after coming to power. As it happens, changes in the world and a less sentimental approach have begun to transform Indian strategies both in external affairs and defence. This began with the fall of Communism and the decline of Russian power, and the increasingly visible desire of China to be among the most powerful countries in the world. The recognition of these events and the consequent changes in American foreign policy, all of which have influenced India, can be seen in the last two years or so. A change is also visible in America’s approach and strategy. There is great criticism, both in the US and elsewhere, of President Donald Trump’s approach to foreign policy. His strategies have been overshadowed by his unfortunate personal characteristics. But what he has started doing is obviously a very significant change in direction for the US. Trump’s insistence that Europe should bear a great deal more of the expense of European defence has resulted in a demotion of NATO’s significance. His approach only recognises that Communism is dead and that Russia is desperately struggling to bring its economy up to match with its military capability. He saw the huge impact of China on the American economy. China was quietly using its government resources to subsidise its exports, which led to many products that had for long been made in the US now being imported from China. Trump has also been criticised for his hard line against immigration from Latin America. His attempt to stop Latin American children from being exported to the US to ensure a better future for them is against the American interest. Even in domestic economic policy, he has demonstrated a lack of sentiment. He has sharply reduced taxes for the wealthy and the better off and thus substantially increased inequality of income in the country. One can find other examples of his policies, but the essential point is that he has no sympathy for the poor and downtrodden, whether in the US or elsewhere. It has even been alleged that some of his economy policies were intended to help his own and his family’s personal situation. The important thing to note is not the personal character of Trump but that his policies have had much more selfishness than sentiment behind them. The selfishness reflects not only in the personal dimension but in his approach to America’s relationships around the world. Of course, Trump will be replaced by a new president. But what he has done is to change the mindset and approach of millions of Americans, as was seen in the numbers voting for him this election. We can expect many of the changes Trump brought about to outlast him. This would almost certainly apply to the US’ willingness to spend money on the defence of other rich countries. It would also be seen in America’s support for countries that could hold back the imperialist desires of China.

The department is collecting an entry fee of Rs 50 per month from the fitness freaks visiting the stadium. It has drawn flak from the visitors, who claim that the stadium is a public property. Defending their move, the officials said, “The decision was taken by the district administration a few years ago, in the interest of the stadium.” Mahesh Kumar, a senior citizen said that he has been visiting the stadium for morning walk since a decade and it is not fair to collect entry fee from them. “We would not use the stadium if we have alternative place. We pay tax and the stadium is developed in people’s money. It is not right to collect additional fee,” he said. Indramma, a teacher said that hundreds of people visit the stadium to maintain good health as the stadium is convenient. “We hardly spend an hour in the stadium and the strollers do not use any equipment. Let them charge for using equipment, but, it is not good to impose fee on walkers,” she said. However, a section of the people welcomed the move and claimed that the authorities can collect a nominal fee, maintain transparency and also ensure safety of the visitors. Shashank, an engineer, opined that the authorities have invested a huge money on the stadium and it is not wrong to collect a nominal fee. But, the authorities should ensure safety of the visitors. An officer said, “The decision was taken by the district administration a few years ago, but could not be implemented. Now, we are implementing the order.” The department has invested Rs 4 crore on developing the synthetic track, which is used by the public. The department has been spending a huge amount on the maintenance of the stadium and Rs 50 is nominal, he defended.  The stadium also have other facilities and equipment for exercise. The public can also utilise the facilities by paying the monthly fee.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/entry-fee-for-chamundi-vihar-evokes-mixed-response-918035.html

Stone quarrying is underway on Survey No 21, under Kalenahalli limits. A private company has taken the contract of quarrying and more than 100 trees have been felled so far. Using excavators, eucalyptus, hercules and taraguni trees have been uprooted. Several excavators are uprooting the trees and compressors are used to dig the soil. Huge boulders are being exploded. Mining is reported on around 20 acres of land, it is alleged. Tejaswi, a resident of TM Hosuru village said, "Survey No 21 comprises 473 acres and six guntas of forest land. The Revenue department had transferred the land to the Forest department in 1982, where thousands of plants were grown." "Trees are being felled and animals like deer are running away from the forest, fearing explosions. Though, a complaint was lodged to the Forest department, no action is taken so far. Suitable action should be taken against those involved in this," he urged. Marigowda of Kalenahalli said, "Heavy explosions are heard, affecting houses in the village. The stone dust is affecting crops and livestock. The Revenue department officials are threatening the farmers, if we complain." DFO Ravishankar said, "A case has been filed against the private contractor, who is involved in mining without Forest department's permission. As per 2014 report, out of 473 acres on Survey number 21 in Kalenahalli, 323 acres belong to the Forest department and 125 acres are with the Revenue department." "The private company claims that they have permission for quarrying on seven acres. The government has not given any permission and they are into illegal mining activity. A written complaint is submitted to the DC in this regard," he explained.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/animals-flee-as-trees-felled-for-mining-in-srirangapatna-918036.html

20-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Wait continues for cabinet expansion in Karnataka, Dy CM says decision by next week||As the wait continues for expansion or reshuffle of the cabinet in Karnataka, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi said on Friday the high command is likely to communicate their decision in about a week's time. "CM (BS Yediyurappa) has made national president J P Nadda aware about all related matters here. Nadda Ji has informed the CM he will discuss with the Prime Minister and Amit Shah (Union Home minister) and will convey the decision..It will come in four to six days," Laxman Savadi told reporters at Kalaburagi. Responding to a question on some ministerial aspirants meeting BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, he said, "they (MLAs) have the freedom to express their feelings with the president and the Chief Minister. They have expressed their opinion and the CM and the president will look into it." Yediyurappa after his meeting with Nadda in Delhi yesterday on the cabinet exercise, had said the party national president has sought a couple of days time to consult other leaders on the matter. Developments in Delhi on Wednesday was a repetition of sorts for Yediyurappa, as he was sent back with a similar reply by Nadda, when the Chief Minister had gone with a proposal to take up cabinet expansion exercise in September, ahead of the monsoon session of the state legislature. Political activities have intensified within the ruling BJP camp in the state after Yediyurappa on November 10 indicated that cabinet reshuffle was on the cards after the party's victory in the bypolls to two assembly constituencies. The Chief Minister had then hinted about reshuffle by dropping or inducting some Ministers. The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for Yediyurappa, considering that there are too many aspirants. Several legislators have openly declared their aspirations and political hobnobbing is also taking place within the BJP circles. A few aspirants had met BJP state president Kateel on Thursday, apparently aimed at securing their place during the cabinet exercise this time. On the other hand, 8-time MLA Umesh Katti, who has been sulking on being denied a chance earlier, met Yediyurappa on Friday. Meanwhile in what is being dubbed as related development, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has met BJP national general secretary B L Santosh in New Delhi. According to party sources, Jarkiholi is said to have lobbied for Congress-JD(S) rebels who joined the BJP along with him last year and helped the party come to power. Recently some BJP legislators had met at Jarkiholi's residence and reportedly discussed cabinet exercise. While several of the old guard like Katti are awaiting a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, Congress-JD(S) rebels like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and M T B Nagaraj, who helped the BJP come to power and are now party MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. As per the agreement, Yediyurappa will also have to keep space for Munirathna, following his win from Rajarajeshwari Nagar seat in the bypoll, and also for Pratap Gowda Patil who needs to win the Maski bypoll that is yet to be announced.

"Regarding cabinet expansion, I have discussed with our (BJP) national president J P Nadda on what to do, how to do it, in what way changes have to be made. According to me, in two days he will confirm and in three-four days, a programme will be planned for the swearing-in of new ministers," Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters here, he said within three days everything will be finalised. Responding to a question about a few aspirants pitching for their induction into the cabinet by dropping some incumbent ministers and their holding separate meetings, Yediyurappa said, "such discussions keep happening. MLAs will express their opinion, I would not like to discuss about it." As the wait continued for the cabinet exercise, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi earlier in the day said at Kalaburagi that the BJP high command was likely to communicate its decision to the CM in about a week's time. Yediyurappa had met Nadda in New Delhi on November 18 to discuss the cabinet exercise, following which he had said the party national president has sought a couple of days time to consult other leaders on the matter.

A few MLAs had met BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Thursday. If Katti is inducted, Belagavi district's representation in the cabinet will increase to five and legislators from other regions are opposed to it, and have reportedly put pressure on the leadership to drop one or two ministers from the district, if the senior legislator is inducted. According to sources, some senior MLAs have demanded that the party's old guard who have been elected as legislators successively be inducted this time. Meanwhile, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has met BJP national general secretary B L Santosh in New Delhi. According to party sources, Jarkiholi is said to have lobbied for Congress-JD(S) rebels who joined BJP along with him last year and helped the party come to power.

Terming the meeting as casual, Jarkiholi said, "I had earlier too said that those who had sacrificed and come (to BJP) should not face injustice, but CM and leadership will take final decision...we have made a request and we will abide by party decision."

20-11-2020||Main Article||General Consent | CBI: Centre vs states||Many non-BJP-ruled states -- Punjab, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and now Kerala -- have shut their doors to the CBI by withdrawing the general consent accorded by the state governments to the central agency to investigate cases in their territories. Now, the CBI will need permission from these states to investigate cases in their jurisdictions. Under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, all states except Delhi and the Union Territories have the option to give their consent to CBI to investigate a case in the state because law and order is a state subject and the CBI cannot investigate in a state as a matter of right. The decisions raise the larger issue of Centre-state relations. The CBI owes its origins to a special order passed by the colonial government in the early stages of World War II (1941). A Special Police Establishment (SPE) under a deputy inspector general in the then Department of War was created with the mandate to investigate cases of bribery and corruption in transactions with which the War and Supply Department of the pre-Independence Government of India was concerned. Later, the activities of the SPE were extended to the Railways, and in 1946, the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act was passed, which led to the establishment of the Central Bureau of Investigation by a resolution dated April 1, 1963. Though the Director of the CBI is appointed on the recommendation of a high-power committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India, successive governments have used the agency to intimidate their political opponents. As per Section 6 of the DSPE Act, CBI needs consent of the state government to investigate a case. The CBI manual provides, “The central government can authorise CBI to investigate such a crime in a state but only with the consent of the concerned state government. The Supreme Court and High Courts, however, can order CBI to investigate such a crime anywhere in the country without the consent of the state.” When a state government gives its general consent to the CBI for investigating cases, the CBI is not required to seek fresh permission from that state for each case it is tasked with investigating. But when a state government withdraws its general consent to the CBI, the agency requires the state government’s consent each time it wants to probe a case there. This will affect the functioning of the CBI, which investigates several sensitive cases in different parts of the country, and thus requires an urgent dialogue between the Centre and the states. However, the manual provides that the CBI can still investigate cases in such states even without receiving their consent if the Supreme Court or a High Court directs the CBI to do so. In State of West Bengal &Ors. vs The Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal &Ors., a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court observed that the Supreme Court and High Courts, in exercise of their power of judicial review, can direct the CBI to take up the investigation within the jurisdiction of the state. The power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution cannot be taken away, curtailed or diluted by Section 6 of the DSPE Act. The restriction imposed by Section 6 on the powers of the Union cannot be read as a restriction on the powers of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The court further observed: “A direction by the High Court under Article 226 to investigate a cognisable offence alleged to have been committed within the territory of a state without the consent of that state will neither impinge upon the federal structure of the Constitution nor violate the doctrine of separation of power and shall be valid in law.” Being the guardian of civil liberties, the Supreme Court and the High Courts have not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to protect the fundamental rights, guaranteed by Part III zealously and vigilantly. The Supreme Court, however, cautioned that this extraordinary power must be exercised sparingly and with utmost care. In so far as the question of issuing a direction to CBI to conduct investigation in a case is concerned, although no inflexible guidelines can be laid down to decide whether or not such power should be exercised, time and again it has been reiterated that such an order is not to be passed as a matter of routine or merely because a party has levelled some allegations against the local police. This power must be exercised in exceptional situations where it becomes necessary to provide credibility and instil confidence in investigations or where the incident may have national and international ramifications or where such an order may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights. This makes it clear that the constitutional courts can direct the CBI probe in any case without receiving the consent of that state. The constitutional courts are not bound by Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act. In extreme situations, courts can also take suo motu notice and direct the CBI probe and the states will be duty-bound to cooperate with the CBI in such cases. Needless to say, the courts should exercise this power carefully as the CBI has limited manpower and resources. In many cases, the Supreme Court has overruled the decisions of the High Courts pertaining to the CBI probe in different cases. So, the states which have withdrawn their general consent to the CBI cannot say ‘no’ to the CBI if directed by the Supreme Court or the High Courts.

The senior officials of India and the European Union (EU) on Thursday exchanged views on stepping up cooperation to counter radicalisation and violent extremism, combating the financing of terrorism and use of the internet by the terrorists. The 12th India-EU Counter-Terrorism dialogue on Thursday saw the two sides agreeing to strengthen cooperation in combatting terrorism. They discussed sanctions as a tool to combat terrorism, including designations of certain terrorist groups and individuals, ways to deepen cooperation between the law-enforcement agencies of India and counterparts in Europe, including the Europol, which is the law enforcement agency of the 27-nation-bloc. Mahaveer Singhvi, Joint Secretary for Counter-Terrorism at the Ministry of External Affairs, led the Indian delegation and Joanneke Balfoort, Director for Security Policy at the European External Action Service, led the EU side. They referred to the on-going negotiations on a working arrangement between Europol and the CBI to support Indian and EU law enforcement authorities in preventing and combating organised crime and terrorism. The India-EU counter-terrorism dialogue took place at a time, when the 27-nation-bloc renewed focus on dealing with the menace in the wake of the recent attacks in Paris, Conflans-Saint-Honorine and Nice in France, Dresden in Germany and Vienna in Austria. “India and the EU strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including the use of terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism,” the two sides stated in a joint press release after the meeting. India condemned the recent terror attacks in the member states of the European Union and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The EU reiterated its condemnation of terrorist attacks in India, including the ones in Mumbai, Pathankot and Pulwama. The bloc reiterated its support for the people and the Government of India in the fight against terrorism. “India and the EU emphasised the need for strengthening international cooperation to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner. They reaffirmed that it is crucial that perpetrators of violence and terrorism are brought to justice,” the two sides stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/talks-on-cbi-europol-pact-to-fight-terror-gain-momentum-after-attacks-in-france-germany-austria-917714.html
20-11-2020||National||DH Radio | The Lead: The status of Urdu in today's India||In this episode of The Lead from DH Radio, professor and head of Department of Urdu in New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia Dr Shahzad Anjum talks about Urdu and its status in today's India.  Ahmed Shariff: Every year November 9 is celebrated as Urdu Day. But what about the language which embraces the aura of romanticism and mystic. What about it in today's India.  I had spoken about this to Dr Shahzad Anjum, who is the professor and head of Department of Urdu in New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia. Listen in to the conversation. Welcome to DH Radio, Professor. Shazad Anum: Thank you. Ahmed: Professor, my first question to you is can you chart us the history of Urdu language? Prof. Shahzad:  Urdu is India's language. It originated in the Deccan and spread throughout the country. Earlier, Persian was prominent and the language which resulted when Persian synergized with others is Urdu. Urdu has elements of all other languages from English to french and southern Indian languages. Ahmed:  During the partition period, there was a divide. Urdu took a more purist version with Persianate influence and Hindi tilted towards Sanskrit. How has that affected the Urdu of the 21st Century? Prof. Shahzad: Urdu's script is Farsi and that of Hindi is Devanagari. Before partition, there were many irrespective of religion, who were literate in Urdu. I have been hearing that the language will cease to exist but the language is growing. Though there are Persian words in Urdu, it's grammar is the same as Hindi. Language is not bound to any religion; it's independent.

20-11-2020||National||Questionable testing belies drop in India's Covid-19 infections||By Muneeza Naqvi and Chris Kay   India’s daily coronavirus infections have been cut in half since a peak of more than 97,000 in mid-September, but the significant drop has raised fresh questions over the nation’s testing regime and whether it reflects the true state of its epidemic. As the country on Thursday surpassed the grim milestone of 9 million total infections, the official daily numbers appear to show a marked slowdown in the spread of the disease. Once poised to overtake the US as the nation with the highest caseload, India for weeks has been reporting fewer than 50,000 new cases a day, while infections are skyrocketing across America. Rather than showing India is gaining control over Covid-19, the slowing momentum may largely reflect spotty testing levels and a heavy reliance on questionable kits. Daily testing in the country of 1.4 billion people has picked up since the early days of the pandemic -- currently at about 1 million -- but it’s still much lower than most countries with high infections. Just as significant, nearly half come from less-reliable quick antigen tests, which can report false negatives as much as 50% of the time. The result is that India’s Covid-19 cases are likely much higher than the national numbers. Health experts fear new infection waves as the country gathers to celebrate a season of weddings and Hindu festivals amid a smoggy winter in the densely populated north. Rapid antigen tests “are not very reliable, not sensitive and the patients are not getting treatment at all,” said Harjit Singh Bhatti, president of the Progressive Medicos & Scientists Forum who has been working on the front lines in a suburban Delhi hospital since the epidemic began. “The coming months will be very dangerous.” Most other countries with big outbreaks, such as the US and UK, use RT-PCR tests that take longer to generate more reliable results by detecting the genetic material of the virus. Experts say rapid antigen tests can help countries with surging outbreaks quickly detect where the worst hit areas are. But for an accurate understanding of the spread these should be followed up by RT-PCR tests. False negatives “Rapid antigen tests can have very high false negative rates -- you’re supposed to follow up with RT-PCR, which is almost not done” in India, said T. Sundararaman, a New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement. As of last week, 49% of India’s daily tests were rapid antigen -- up from about 25% to 30% in mid-August, according to the most recent federal data. Yet some of the country’s most populous states don’t regularly publish detailed testing data. That makes it hard to pinpoint the worst affected areas or assess their testing strategy. “How many cases you can identify depends on how effective your testing is,” said Rijo M. John, an adjunct professor at Rajagiri College of Social Sciences in Kochi. “We do have reasonably good data on tests and cases in city centres and more urban districts, but a similar kind of data is missing in rural areas.”  Bihar, an eastern state with a population of over 100 million, may turn out to be the most vivid example of how low overall testing and even lower high-quality tests could be obstructing a clear picture of India’s pandemic. As many as 88% of all tests in the impoverished state are the rapid antigen variety. It also held an election this month, India’s first major vote since Covid-19 struck. Hundreds of thousands of people crowded together at campaign rallies, with few wearing masks. Any potential spike has so far been muted in official data. On Thursday, Bihar added only 604 new infections over the previous day, despite its huge population. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with over 220 million people, more than twice as many as Bihar, reported over 2,500 new cases. In comparison, New Delhi, with an estimated 16.8 million people, added more than 6,900 new infections. It publishes testing numbers every day, including information about the kind of tests used. Still, its regime -- tilted heavily in favor of rapid antigen tests -- has come under criticism over the last two weeks when new cases have soared amid cooler temperatures, high pollution and poor social distancing. With hospitals in Delhi filling up again, some health experts believe the situation will only be worsened by unreliable testing. “We are clutching at straws,” said Sundararaman.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/questionable-testing-belies-drop-in-indias-covid-19-infections-917773.html

Gandhi may shift to either Goa or Chennai for a few days, they added. The sources said she was likely to shift out Friday afternoon and would be accompanied by either Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Sonia Gandhi has been under heavy medication pursuant to her discharge from hospital in August, and doctors are concerned about her consistent chest infection, which has not gone on account of Delhi's pollution, the sources said. The air pollution in Delhi has aggravated her asthma and her chest condition, and she has been advised by doctors to briefly shift out from here, they said. She is going at a time when demands for introspection over the Bihar election loss are being raised by a section of party leaders, including some of those who had written a letter to her seeking an organisational overhaul. Sonia Gandhi was admitted to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi on July 30 evening. Later on September 12, she went abroad for a few days for her routine medical check-up, and Rahul Gandhi had accompanied her during the visit. The two leaders had also missed the Monsoon session of Parliament which was held under special conditions during the pandemic from September 14 to 23. The Congress president had shifted to Goa for some time in January last year where her pictures of cycling had gone viral on social media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sonia-gandhi-advised-to-briefly-shift-out-of-delhi-in-view-of-her-chronic-chest-infection-917775.html

Justice Yogesh Khanna, while issuing notice to the CBI and seeking its stand on Gandhi's plea, also put on hold the special court's February 4 order to the extent it directs the agency to place the material it has before the sanctioning authority for her prosecution. According to the graft case lodged against the BJP leader and two others in 2006, they had allegedly sanctioned Rs 50 lakh as a grant to a trust in a fraudulent manner. The special CBI court had said it was of the prima facie opinion that there was criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct by a public servant and had directed the probe agency to investigate the case further. CBI had filed a closure report in the case in 2008 as well and the special court had also rejected it then and ordered further investigation. Thereafter, it again filed a closure report which was rejected by the special court in February this year, the high court was informed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-seeks-cbi-stand-on-maneka-gandhis-plea-against-order-for-probe-in-graft-case-against-her-917805.html

The new technology will slowly be adopted by all of Apollo group’s 100 clinics and 75 labs. The test, matching the accuracy level of the 'gold standard' RT-PCR test, will be done by collecting a swab sample from which RNA will be extracted and amplified. The sample will then be run under a paper strip barcode with Cas-9 protein of the Crispr system, which will recognise Covid-19’s genetic material. The entire process will take 45 minutes.  Dubbed TataMD Check, the test will use an AI-based application to take a picture of the test and give the result.  “RT-PCR tests have to be conducted in a batch and then every result has to be validated by a trained person, which takes time. In this, smaller number of samples can also be tested and the AI-based system means that the test can be quickly read and uploaded,” the CEO of Tata MD Girish told the publication. While the company hasn’t named a price yet for the test, they said the price will be in compliance with “government capping” for other tests like RT-PCR, CBNAAT or TrueNat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-covid-19-test-kits-feluda-will-be-available-in-these-8-cities-report-917810.html

The newspaper, 'Tejas', he claimed to represent, had closed down in 2018, it alleged. The Uttar Pradesh government led by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that it had no objection to the Kerala Union of Working Journalists, New Delhi sending a lawyer to meet Kappan for signature on the 'vakalatnama'.  However, it questioned the locus standi of the association which filed a habeas corpus petition in the matter. The state government also said the family members of Kappan were immediately informed about his arrest but no member of his family has come to meet him in jail. He, in fact, had a telephonic conversation with them. It also maintained that Kappan is not in illegal custody or confinement but is in judicial custody following the valid judicial order passed by the competent court. The state government claimed that the petitioner has "resorted to falsehood and has made several false statements on oath only to sensationalise the case". "Following the investigation conducted so far, the evidence of the accused having links with banned organisations has emerged," it further claimed. A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the association, to go through the affidavit by the Uttar Pradesh government and respond to it.  Before posting the matter for consideration next week, the court pointed out that there has been unfair reporting in the matter when it was adjourned on the previous date of hearing. In its applications, the association claimed there was a violation of fundamental rights, human rights, rule of law, creating "a lot of helplessness among the journalistic fraternity in discharging their duty fearlessly considering the fate of the present detenue".  It had sought orders for the immediate release of Kappan and allowing his lawyers and family members for a regular meeting with the detenue, and visit by district judge to New Mathura jail to enquire on the violation of human rights as well as Covid-19 guidelines. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have arrested Sidhique and three others, Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Alam on October 5 for they allegedly had links with the Popular Front of India, and tried to disturb peace and foment communal disharmony in the state. The association, for its part, claimed Kappan was then on his way to Hathras for the coverage of the gang-rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/siddique-kappan-was-going-to-hathras-under-garb-of-journalist-to-create-trouble-up-govt-tells-sc-917827.html

The terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Nagrota were planning something big on the anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, the agency reported quoting sources. The local police said the four terrorists were on their way to the Kashmir valley to disturb the District Development Council polls from November 28, which will be the first election in Jammu and Kashmir since the Centre abrogated Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year. The eight-phase DDC polls, which will conclude by December 22, will select candidates for 280 DDC seats besides filling vacancies in 12,000 Panchayat seats as well 230 vacant seats in urban bodies. National Conference and PDP, which had boycotted the 2018 local bodies polls, are participating in the election this time under the banner of Gupkar Alliance. The Union government also hopes the completion of such a democratic exercise will lead to emergence of a new leadership at the micro level in the valley, thereby blunting the edges of terrorism at the grassroots. Addressing an election meeting in Balahama in Srinagar, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Friday said that after several decades, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have become equal partners in transparent democratic and development processes. He also claimed that the Modi government will rid Jammu and Kashmir of the "corruption of clan", a dig at the NC and PDP. The four JeM terrorists were killed in the encounter with the police after a truck carrying newly infiltrated militants was intercepted in Nagrota. Two policemen were also injured in the gun battle. The same modus operandi of terrorist movement was recorded earlier also when three Pakistani JeM terrorists were killed in January this year. Even then the security forces had intercepted a Srinagar-bound truck.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nagrota-encounter-slain-jem-terrorists-planned-terror-attack-on-26/11-anniversary-pm-meets-officials-917854.html

Love Jihad is a word manufactured by BJP to divide the Nation & disturb communal harmony. Marriage is a matter of personal liberty, bringing a law to curb it is completely unconstitutional & it will not stand in any court of law. Jihad has no place in Love.1/ His comments came as ministers in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana announced that they would enact laws to curb 'love jihad' marriages. Some Karnataka BJP leaders and ministers also have mooted the idea, saying it would curb such practices. The Hindutva groups allege that Muslim youth are actively wooing Hindu girls into marriage for converting them into Islam, a claim which has not found any evidence so far. Becoming the first Congress Chief Minister to unequivocally oppose the BJP move, Gehlot said bringing law to regulate marriage in this way was completely unconstitutional. "Love Jihad is a word manufactured by BJP to divide the nation and disturb communal harmony. Marriage is a matter of personal liberty, bringing a law to curb it is completely unconstitutional and it will not stand in any court of law. Jihad has no place in love," he said in a series of tweets. The senior Congress leader said the BJP was creating an environment in the nation where consenting adults would be "at the mercy" of state power. "Marriage is a personal decision and they are putting curbs on it, which is like snatching away personal liberty...It seems a ploy to disrupt communal harmony, fuel social conflict and disregard constitutional provisions like the state not discriminating against citizens on any ground," Gehlot said. Deo said love jihad was an "exhaustingly bigoted term" coined by BJP carried forward through the media propagandists has now reached levels of severity. He said marriage is a personal and domestic matter, affecting chiefly the two parties concerned and partly their families and that Jawaharlal Nehru had the most practical analysis for the sacred institution, which is now being compartmentalised with bigotry and hatred towards a certain sect. "Marriage is and has always been a personal choice for consenting adults - socially and constitutionally. Try all they can to attack the sovereignty of India, we shall stand strong to uphold the integrity of our constitution and this great nation," Deo said. The recent push by the BJP for a law came after Allahabad High Court observed that conversion just for the sake of marriage could not be encouraged. Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia criticised Gehlot, claiming that his statement reflected “petty vote bank politics”. "It is hard to believe that the chief minister will get so rattled by the plight of the Congress nationwide. We all know that marriage in the tradition of India is a religious and socially recognised rite, and is not limited only to freedom of the individual. I think the way they have accused the BJP is baseless,” he was quoted by PTI as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/love-jihad-a-term-coined-by-bjp-to-divide-nation-ashok-gehlot-917873.html

The Centre had on Thursday rushed high-level teams to districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Manipur to support these states’ efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing and efficient clinical management of coronavirus positive cases. In a statement issued on Friday, the Health Ministry said the Centre is also contemplating sending such teams to other states and UTs that are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 positive cases. "The Union government has advised the State/UT governments to adopt aggressive and widespread testing to ensure that the missed out and undetected positive Covid-19 cases are promptly identified for timely and effective tracing, containment and subsequent treatment," it said. The ministry on Thursday had said with the spike in daily new Covid-19 cases and fatalities in Delhi, the spillover effect is being observed in the NCR regions and within Haryana and Rajasthan where the number of coronavirus positive patients is on the rise. On Friday, the total number of coronavirus cases in India mounted to 90,04,365 and the death toll to 1,32,162, with the infection claiming 584 lives in a span of 24 hours, as per the health ministry data updated at 8 am.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-may-send-high-level-teams-to-states-uts-reporting-rise-in-covid-19-cases-917877.html

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is the only leader who is part of all the three party panels while the controversial letter writers Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor and Veerappa Moily found spots in one each. None of these leaders have been appointed as Convenor of the panels Committees on economic affairs, foreign affairs and national security. Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, senior Congress MPs Mallikarjun Kharge and Digvijay Singh are members of the finance panel which has Rajya Sabha Chief Whip Jairam Ramesh as its Convenor. Sharma and Tharoor are a part of the foreign affairs panel which also has Saptagiri Ulaka as its member. However, AICC foreign affairs department Chairman Anand Sharma or former Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor were not chosen as Convenor of the panel, which went to another former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid.  The national security panel has Azad, Moily and V Vaithilingam as members apart from Vincent H Pala, who is the convenor. "The Congress president has constituted three committees to consider and discuss issues and policies related to the subjects of economic affairs, foreign affairs and national security," an official statement from AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said. The dismal performance by the Congress in Bihar had once again brought to fore the demand for an organisational shake-up with senior MP Kapil Sibal, who was also part of the 23 letter writers, once again pointing fingers at the leaders. On Thursday, Kharge lashed out at those leaders who were targeting the leadership, accusing them of weakening the party from within. "We have to fight unitedly. It has pained me that some senior leaders have spoken against the party and its leadership," he said while speaking at an event to mark the birth anniversary of former prime minister Indira Gandhi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-dissenters-among-sonia-gandhis-panels-on-economy-foreign-affairs-and-national-security-917882.html

With cases still rising, the Centre said it was contemplating sending high-level multidisciplinary teams to states and union territories that are reporting more Covid-19 cases, a day after sending four such teams to Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Manipur. Amid cases in Delhi rising, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also directed senior officials to maintain special vigil in districts adjoining the national capital. Adityanath has asked senior officials to maintain vigil in Meerut, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad besides Lucknow, Kanpur Nagar, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur while  Bareilly administration has already deployed mobile vans at its borders to test all those coming here from Delhi. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the country tested 10.83 lakh Covid-19 tests in the past 24 hours taking the total number to 12.95 crore. It said the widespread testing has ensured that the cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels and is presently following a downward trajectory. The cumulative national positivity rate stood at 6.95%. On October 31, the positivity rate was 7.48% and has been decreasing with the ministry saying higher volumes of testing eventually lead to low positivity rate. Thirty-four states and union territories are testing 140 daily tests per million, as suggested by the World Health Organisation. Twenty-states are reporting a cumulative positivity rate lower than the national level with Bihar (1.81%) and Uttar Pradesh (2.95%) having the least positivity rate. With the addition of new cases, the Ministry said, the present active caseload of 4,43,794 comprises 4.93% of India’s Total Positive Cases, and has been sustained below the 5% mark. In the past 24 hours, it said the country witnessed 44,807 new recoveries taking the total recovered cases to 84,28,409. The recovery rate has improved to 93.60% and the gap between recovered cases and active cases is steadily increasing and presently stands at 79,84,615. Among the recoveries, 78.02% is contributed by ten states and union territories. Kerala had the highest number of 6,860 persons recovering followed by Delhi (6,685) and Maharashtra (5,860).

The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) is a conglomerate of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir. The amalgam, which has political parties like the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was formed to seek restoration of Article 370 in J&K, scrapped by the Centre last year. "What should I call it...? Gupkar sangathan or guptachar (spy) sangathan. These are people spying for China and Pakistan, Chouhan told reporters here. This is not an alliance....these leaders of Gupkar sangathan have grabbed land worth more than Rs 25,000 crore in Jammu and Kashmir, he alleged. "Be it the National Conference or the PDP, children of their leaders have studied abroad. They gave stones to the children of Kashmir. "They lived a luxurious life and had freedom to loot Kashmir, the BJP chief minister alleged. Asked about the BJP's alliance with the PDP in the past, Chouhan said his party cant stay with people having an "anti-national" outlook and that is why it walked out of the coalition. The BJP and the Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP had joined hands to form government in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, but their alliance later collapsed. They pushed Jammu and Kashmir into darkness. They all have gathered and are speaking anti-national language. The Congress is also with them, Chouhan further alleged. Earlier this week, the Congress had said it was not a part of the Gupkar alliance. The CM also targeted India's first prime minister Pandit Jawaharal Nehru. "Honourable Pandit Jawaharal Nehruji accepted the bifurcation of the country for the lust of power. He divided the country. "It was honourable Nehruji who imposed Article 370 in Kashmir...It was Pandit Nehru who took the Kashmir issue, which is our internal matter, to the United Nation and even talked about referendum," Chouhan added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/shivraj-singh-chouhan-equates-gupkar-alliance-with-intelligence-outfit-917909.html

It is an indication of our future, not a throwback to the past. Only those harbouring a Cold War mindset will see such intentions,” the External Affairs Minister said. He was delivering a speech during a webinar on “Indo-Pacific and the Covid-19 crisis”. Jaishankar almost echoed the words of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who last month said that the Trump Administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy was “to trumpet the old-fashioned Cold War mentality to stir up a confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition, in a bid to maintain the dominance and hegemonic system of the United States”. The Indian Army has been over the past six months resisting the aggressive moves by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector. The stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA in eastern Ladakh renewed focus on India’s strategic convergence with Australia, Japan and the United States in Indo-Pacific over the past few months. India already had a military logistics sharing agreement with the US. It signed similar agreements with Australia and Japan in June and September. It had several naval drills with the US and Japan during the past few months. New Delhi of late also invited the Australian Navy to take part in the Malabar 2020 naval exercise, which remained an annual drill by the navies of India, Japan and the US till last year. The Malabar 2020 added a military heft to the ‘Quad’ – hitherto an informal coalition of India, Japan, Australia and the US – amid growing belligerence of China, not only in eastern Ladakh but also in Taiwan Strait and the disputed waters of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. India, however, remained cautious and carefully avoided to be seen moving into the orbit of influence of the US. The remarks of the External Affairs Minister on Friday indicated that India was also keen to ensure that its strategy for Indo-Pacific, unlike that of the US, did not turn overtly adversarial to China.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/s-jaishankar-almost-echoes-chinese-foreign-minister-to-slam-cold-war-mindset-on-indo-pacific-917922.html

He had earlier granted a similar nod for contempt against Kamra for other tweets. The A-G's consent is a statutory requirement for filing a contempt petition. The A-G's consent came to a request made by advocate Anuj Singh in respect of tweet posted by Kamra on November 18. In response, Venugopal said, "The depiction of two fingers, with the legend that he means the middle one, is to deliberately insult the Chief Justice of India, which would equally be an insult to the Supreme Court of India itself, which the CJI heads". Granting consent under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, he said, "the said tweet is grossly vulgar and obnoxious and I have no doubt that it would tend to lower the authority of the Supreme Court of India as well as undermine the confidence that the litigant public have in the institution of the SC itself."

The top ten states which have registered the highest consultations through eSanjeevani and eSanjeevani OPD platforms are Tamil Nadu (2,59,904), Uttar Pradesh (2,19,715), Kerala (58,000), Himachal Pradesh (46,647), Madhya Pradesh (43,045), Gujarat (41,765), Andhra Pradesh (35,217), Uttarakhand (26,819), Karnataka (23,008) and Maharashtra (9,741), the ministry said in a statement. It said eSanjeevani's both variants of telemedicine -- doctor to doctor (eSanjeevani AB-HWC) and patient to doctor (eSanjeevani OPD) -- are consistently growing in terms of users on both sides -- patients or health workers on the one end and doctors on the other. The Union Health Ministry launched the eSanjeevani AB-HWC in November 2019 and it is to be implemented at 1,55,000 Health and Wellness Centres under Ayushman Bharat Scheme in 'Hub and Spoke' model by December 2022. "eSanjeevani AB-HWC is functional at over 4,700 Health and Wellness Centres and over 17,000 doctors and health workers have been trained on its use. eSanjeevani OPD, the second variant of this ambitious initiative, was rolled out on April 13, 2020 during the first lockdown when OPDs across the country were closed to prevent Covid-19 infections," it said. The Union Health ministry said eSanjeevani is having a significant impact among the section of populace where the travel distance, time and cost have been barriers in seeking outpatient services. "It has served as a viable and preferred option for consulting a doctor. So far 16 districts have registered more than 10,000 consultations and over 100 districts have registered more than 1,000 consultations," it said. Over 7,500 doctors have been trained and on boarded to provide telemedicine services on over 220 online OPDs on eSanjeevani OPD, it added.   Over 100 telemedicine practitioners have completed more than 1,000 teleconsultations and a few of them have logged over 10,000 consultations, it said. As regards to patients, over 20 per cent patients use eSanjeevani to consult with doctors more than once. As many of these are small districts, it reflects that eSanjeevani is having equal or more impact in smaller districts, the ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-telemedicine-initiative-esanjeevani-completes-8-lakh-consultations-917955.html

A bench presided over by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde upheld the Allahabad High Court judgment, which held that nobody can be prosecuted upon declaration of acquisition or possession of exotic wildlife species between June and December, under the amnesty scheme. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, dismissed a petition against the HC's judgement passed in July. With the court's judgement, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, got a go ahead with its ‘Voluntary Disclosure Scheme’. The amnesty scheme envisaged streamlining the process for import and possession of exotic live species in India by way of registration and creating a database at state and centre level. It gave an option to all citizens to voluntarily declare their stock of exotic species within six months from the concerned date in June, 2020. According to the government’s notification, the scheme would also enable it to introduce a further regulatory as well as penal regime after giving the window of six months for voluntary disclosure. However, there was no clarity as to whether those making such disclosure could be subjected to any investigation and prosecution by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the officers of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau over manner of acquisition or possession.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-allows-centre-to-go-ahead-with-scheme-to-protect-owners-of-exotic-animals-917963.html
20-11-2020||National||Let’s dial down anger: UK author of book on India-Pakistan partition||UK-based author Marina Wheeler, whose new book set against the backdrop of Partition in 1947 hits the shelves in India on Friday, wants to promote a better understanding of different perspectives of a difficult chapter in the shared British and Indian history. In ‘The Lost Homestead: My Mother, Partition and the Punjab’, Wheeler, the former wife of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, covers the complex subject of Partition as a very personal memoir of her Sikh mother’s journey from Sargodha, now in Pakistan, to India and eventually to the UK. After years of her own research on both sides of the border and some very intimate conversations with her mother, Dip Singh, who passed away earlier this year, Wheeler says she hopes the book will open up some new discussions. “But on one condition, which is that people just need to slightly dial down the anger,” Wheeler said, during a Zoom interview with PTI. “What I want people to take away from this is to make more of an effort of understanding the different perspectives. The India-Pakistan conflict doesn't seem to be reducing, on the contrary it seems to be ratcheting up,” she said, adding that she wants her book to be seen as a “plea for better understanding”. “It's quite an angry time, maybe to do with the Twitter kind of atmosphere. It would be good to move into just a slightly more measured, calmer way of discussing the world and relating to each other,” she said. She admittedly tried very hard not to be drawn into the political aspect of the India-Pakistan conflict, instead hoping to offer a sort of cross-national perspective from someone who is half British and half Indian, with roots in Pakistan. Her father is the late acclaimed journalist Sir Charles Wheeler, who met her mother Dip during his posting as the BBC’s South East Asia Correspondent based in Delhi. Drawing on her mother’s oral history and accounts from her Indian family based in Delhi and Mumbai, Wheeler has tried to untangle the many interwoven threads of migration, belonging and learning from our history. “What I've tried hard to do is try and understand the different perspectives. So, I hope that Indian readers will find that illuminating and interesting,” she reflects, as she notes that not only in the UK but also in India the younger generation don't always know the detail of the events leading up to India’s Independence, Partition and the creation of Pakistan. “I am very interested in that whole debate and I do feel that it is time for a more nuanced, balanced discussion about Empire that people embark upon without a preconception,” she says, in reference to the need for the British Empire to be incorporated in UK school curriculum. “It's very important to have that, particularly as the diaspora in this country from the Indian subcontinent is huge and from all over the Empire. That's something, as I see it, to celebrate,” she adds. While her research for the book involved two visits to Pakistan, the trips to India were multiple as she tried to cram in work on the sidelines of family weddings and functions. The germ of the book was sown in 2017, when the 70th year of Indian independence was being widely celebrated, and with her elderly mother’s frailty in mind, Wheeler decided to embark upon a journey which inevitably became an exploration of her own roots. The writing process came at a time of considerable personal turmoil for the very successful and busy 56-year-old constitutional and human rights lawyer, including battling a cancer diagnosis and the collapse of her marriage to Boris Johnson, then UK Foreign Secretary. “I was a little bit sneery initially when my publisher referred to this as ‘my journey’ but actually in the end I found absolutely that is what it was. Doing the book and being able to reach back into my past and my family was very grounding. It was a healing experience,” she reflects. And, about probing her mother to dig deep into her past, including the traumatic memories of being displaced from her childhood home for good, Wheeler feels that ultimately her mother was able to derive a lot of joy out of reliving the happier memories from her youth. “She was very good at drawing the line in a way. At times she'd light a cigarette if she wanted me to leave the room, put on the radio or something. She was 85 when I started and I thought, I respect that; she had every right to determine how much delving around to allow of her life,” she recalls. With the lockdown having scuppered all travel plans for book tours to India, Wheeler is now looking forward to the virtual Jaipur Literary Festival in the new year, during which she hopes to interact more directly with some readers in India. Meanwhile, she hopes ‘The Lost Homestead’, which is published by Hodder & Stoughton, will highlight how the human stories mirror each other so much on both sides of the India-Pakistan border. “Politics is a kind of messy business but underneath it all we are all just the same human beings who feel those raw things in exactly the same way,” she notes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/let-s-dial-down-anger-uk-author-of-book-on-india-pakistan-partition-917965.html

This concerns pre-clinical studies on four oral interventions which have already been taken up for clinical studies, the AYUSH ministry said. In a statement, it describes the study as one of the most sophisticated research projects in the country in the Covid-19 context. The clinical studies are being pursued through another collaboration of the Ministry of AYUSH, the partner in this one being the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The collaboration relating to the animal study (in-vivo) arose from an MoU signed between the National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) of the Ministry of AYUSH and the DBT. It is based on the concept of reverse Pharmacology (PH) which explores the scientific reasoning behind established medical practice like those of Ayurveda, the statement said.  The study was being held at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute of DBT located in Faridabad. The sophisticated BSL-3 level laboratories of THSTI were housing these studies, being held on hamsters. "This is a proud moment for both Ministry of AYUSH and Department of Biotechnology that this collaboration is leading to land mark research in India," said AYUSH Ministry Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/1st-animal-study-in-india-on-coronavirus-moves-to-its-final-stage-ayush-ministry-917973.html

The agency, officials sources said, will initiate a fresh round of questioning of the suspects. They said the agency has unearthed some mobile phone communication between some senior office bearers of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, and it will seek clarifications from them. "The ED is investigating financial links between PFI and Bhim Army on the basis of credible evidence recovered from senior PFI officials," the agency tweeted. The tweet was in response to a news report that said the ED has found "no links" between the Bhim Army and the PFI. While the PFI has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, the Bhim Army said it was ready for all kinds of probe. "We are ready for every kind of investigation, you (ED) should investigate and if no link is found then you should publicly apologise for spreading false propaganda," All India Bahujan Coordination Committee and Bhim Army coordinator Kush Ambedkarwadi said. Official sources said the communication analysed between individuals of the two groups indicated talk about certain activities in the Jama Masjid area of the national capital during the anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protests. The central probe agency is also expected to question some other linked people in this case which it is probing under the criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED, in August, had arrested former Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in this case and alleged that cash received by him was used to "fuel" anti-CAA protests and the Delhi riots that took place in February. Hussain, the agency claimed, has been "arrested in connection with an ongoing PMLA investigation into his role in money laundering and funding of anti-CAA protests and organising riots in north-east Delhi during February, 2020". The ED had booked Hussain and others after studying multiple FIRs of the Delhi Police crime branch to probe the riots. "The probe revealed that companies owned and controlled by Tahir Hussain and his relatives transferred huge amounts of money to dubious entities and entry operators which was returned by them in cash," it said. "The cash received by Tahir Hussain through entry operators was used to fuel the anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots," the agency had said in a statement. The agency, which is investigating the PFI under the PMLA since 2018, has alleged "financial links" between these protests and the Kerala-based organisation. It had questioned several PFI office bearers in the past. The ED had said that at least Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in several bank accounts linked to the organisation between December 4 last year and January 6 this year in various parts of the country. The sources said a total amount of Rs 120 crore, credited to bank accounts linked to the PFI, are under the ED's scanner. The PFI had denied the charges. "The Popular Front of India has stated it multiple times that we fully comply with the law of the land and the allegation of Rs 120 crore transferred from the Popular Front's accounts just before the CAA protests is totally baseless and the people who are levelling these allegations should prove these claims," the organisation had said in a statement. The sources claimed that these dubious deposits were either made in cash or through the immediate payment service (IMPS) and a number of such instances were seen in Uttar Pradesh, where the maximum number of violent anti-CAA protests were reported to have taken place. Quoting the ED findings, the sources said, the withdrawal of money from the bank accounts linked to PFI and its related entities had a "direct correlation" with the violent demonstrations against the CAA. It is suspected and alleged that these funds were used by PFI affiliates to fuel the anti-CAA protests in various parts of Uttar Pradesh and other locations, the sources had said. The ED had also sent a report in this connection to the Union Home Ministry.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ed-says-investigating-pfi-bhim-army-links-set-to-magnify-probe-into-anti-caa-protests-918005.html

The comments by Tripathi come amid demands from various quarters for cancellation or postponement of board exams in view of rising Covid-19 cases. "The board exams will happen for sure and a schedule will be announced very soon. The CBSE is making plans and will soon reveal how it will do test assessments," he said during a webinar on "New Education Policy (NEP): Brighter future of school education" organised by ASSOCHAM. He, however, did not comment upon whether the exams will be conducted in the same format and will be held in February-March as per schedule or will be postponed. "During March-April we were flummoxed as to how to move forward, but our schools and teachers rose to the occasion and transformed, trained themselves in using new technology for teaching purposes and within few months conducting online classes using different apps became normal," Tripathi said. Schools across the country were closed in March in order to contain spread of novel coronavirus and opened partially in some states from October 15. However, few states decided to keep them closed or closed again in view of spike in Covid-19 cases. The board exams which had to be postponed mid-way were later cancelled and the results were announced on basis of an alternative assessment scheme. There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online. Noting that a common aim of all education policies including the new National Education Policy (NEP) has been to shift students from rote learning to experiential learning, Tripathi said, "the entire NEP 2020's thrust and main aim is to make a shift to skill and competency based education". "We need to move students away from knowledge based education to competency and skill based learning. To implement skill-based, competency based education there is a need to transform and follow entire pedagogy based teaching-learning process be it classroom teaching, face-to-face teaching or online teaching. "The pedagogy based teaching-learning process is more about making students more curious, innovative, creative and providing them experiential learning and this can be achieved only when schools, teachers and principals change the teaching pedagogy," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-board-exams-to-happen-for-sure-schedule-to-be-announced-soon-says-cbse-secretary-918016.html

While the first phase of the 24th edition of the Malabar exercise was conducted in the Bay of Bengal from November 3-6, the second phase was conducted in the Arabian Sea from November 17-20, said a statement by the Indian Navy. The major highlight of the four-day second-phase exercise was the participation of the Indian Navy's Vikramaditya carrier battle group and the Nimitz strike group of the US Navy. The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship. "The two aircraft carriers, along with other ships, submarine and aircraft of the participating navies, engaged in high intensity naval operations including cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of Vikramaditya and F/A-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz," the statement said. The Australian Navy deployed its HMAS Ballarat, an Anzac-class frigate while the Japanese Navy had sent its leading destroyer JS Murasame for the exercise. The mega exercise took place at a time when India and China are locked in an over six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.

The children from 17 districts of the state prepared the document so that their issues are heard by the policy makers, UNICEF-Assam Chief Madhulika Jonathan told reporters here. It was released on the occasion of World Children's Day. The charter of demands include protection from violence in all forms, access to affordable healthcare and nutritious food, no discrimination based on class, caste, gender, religion or any other ground, and quality and affordable education for all children. Some of the other demands include adequate resources for improving infrastructure and human resources of educational institutions, safe drinking water and proper sanitation for all families across Assam and safe spaces for children to play, prosper and grow. The charter also demanded respect for rights of differently abled and active measures to ensure that they are provided with adequate rehabilitative and social support in order to live a dignified life. "The global pandemic has laid bare deep inequalities that have left some children far more at risk than others. UNICEF hopes that not only political parties but other bodies and Commissions take cognisance of children's recommendations and use this as a baseline for working upwards", Jonathan said. The manifesto will be presented to the chief minister, assembly Speaker, and leaders of all major political parties. Speaking on the occasion, NGO Shishu Sarothi's deputy director Amvalika Senapati said that though children do not have voting rights but they are the future electors and decision-makers, and their opinions and recommendations are important. The preparation of the manifesto was an effort led by an NGO, PratYek, which sensitised the children through a series of online workshops between June and September 2020 on child rights, participation, climate change, sustainable development goals among others. Meanwhile, for the first time Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal's Twitter account was handled by an 18-year-old Vandana Urang, for two hours, as a symbolic gesture to support children's empowerment and participation. Urang, who hails from Namroop Tea Estate in Dibrugarh district, shared her opinion on #Reimagining Education in Assam in a post-pandemic world. In another event, Bombay High Court's Justice Ujjal Bhuyan formally operationalised the functioning of the Assam Police Sishu Mitra Resource Centre. Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta said, the police in collaboration with UNICEF and UTSAH Child Rights Organisation initiated a comprehensive Child Friendly Policing Programme, with the aim of enhancing access to justice for children. The centre will provide technical assistance to Investigating Officers across the state to deal with child- related cases, to ensure timely investigation and child friendly handling of cases as per laws, rules and procedures, he said.

These IOAs are in six critical SDG (sustainable development goals) enabling sectors that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development, the UNDP, which works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities through the sustainable development of nations, said in a release.  "India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally. This initiative is an instrumental stride in India's development trajectory, and I believe it couldn't have come at a better time. We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India," Invest India MD & CEO Deepak Bagla said. The development pathway that India chooses will set an example for other emerging nations and determine the achievement of global environmental and social targets, the UNDP said. It is thus critical to ensure that these pathways are sustainable, resilient and equitable.  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the SDG financing gap has widened by an estimated USD 400 billion in developing countries, adding to the pre-Covid shortfall of USD 2-2.5 trillion per annum, it said. Whilst the government continues to show strong support for the SDGs and a sustainable recovery, mobilizing this kind of capital and supporting the on-ground innovation needed to meet the SDG targets by 2030, requires the collective efforts of the public and private sector transition from short-term recovery to long-term sustainability, said the release. The 6 SDG-enabling sectors include education, healthcare, agriculture & allied activities, financial services, renewable energy & alternatives and sustainable environment. These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks. This ensured that the Map's findings were truly reflective of market sentiment, the UNDP said. Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust private equity and venture capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability. The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors, said the UN development agency. The UNDP said nearly 50 per cent of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs (internal rate of return) in excess of 20 per cent. While 84 per cent of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/invest-india-undp-launch-investor-map-to-push-sustainable-development-918024.html

Of the five vaccines, four are in Phase II and Phase III and one is in Phase-I and Phase II. Countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar, Bhutan, Switzerland, Bahrain, Austria and South Korea – have shown keen interest in partnering for vaccine development of Indian vaccines and use thereof, the government said. The Prime Minister reviewed the aspects of emergency use authorisation and for manufacture and procurement of medicine. As the results of these Phase III trials from national and international vaccines arrive, the regulators will speedily and rigorously examine these for according authorisation for use. Reviewed various issues like prioritisation of population groups, reaching out to HCWs, cold-chain Infrastructure augmentation, adding vaccinators and tech platform for vaccine roll-out. National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with the state governments and all relevant stakeholders have accelerated the implementation of vaccination of priority groups in the first phase. The Prime Minister asked for a time-bound plan  for speedy regulatory clearances and timely procurement for early rollout of the vaccination drive. The meeting was attended by Principal Secretary to PM, Cabinet Secretary, Member (Health) NITI Aayog, Principal Scientific Advisor, Secretary Health, DG ICMR, officers of PMO, and Secretaries of related Departments of Government of India. Issues like prioritisation of population groups and tech platform for rolling out vaccine for the coronavirus were discussed in the meeting after which the Prime Minister tweeted "reviewed various issues like prioritisation of population groups, reaching out to HCWs (health care workers), cold-chain Infrastructure augmentation, adding vaccinators and tech platform for vaccine roll-out." "The vaccination supply chain is being enhanced and non-vaccine supplies are being escalated. Medical and nursing students and faculty will be involved in training and implementation of the vaccination programme. Every step is being steadily put in place to ensure that vaccines reach every location and person according to the prioritisation principles," the government said. The assurance at the meeting came in the backdrop of a fresh wave in many parts of the country and festival induced surge in the number of cases in various states including Delhi which has spread fear among people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-holds-meeting-to-review-covid-19-vaccination-strategy-priority-groups-being-identified-918028.html

While 41 people have tested positive in the Thorang village, a total of 890 people of Lahaul-Spiti district, accounting for about 2.83 per cent of its population of around 31,500, have been found infected with coronavirus so far, HP Health Department data showed on Friday. Earlier in October, 39 residents of Rangrik village of Spiti valley had tested positive for the infection. Dr R C Thakur, the principal of Lal Bahadur Shashtri Government Medical College in Mandi and a Lahaul district native, has attributed the increasing Covid-19 cases in the district to three reasons -- a recent religious function in Lahaul, extreme winter and the arrival of many tourists in the district after the opening of Atal Tunnel Rohtang. Dr Thakur advised people to shield themselves from cold, maintain distance and hygiene and wear masks.  Of the Lahaul-Spiti district people tested Covid-positive so far, 479 have been cured while 406 are still recovering from the disease. As per data, five people have succumbed to the virus in the district so far. Several Lahaul-Spiti district residents generally migrate to the adjoining Kullu district in winter due to the extreme cold, a district official said. Meanwhile, a district health official said they have started special awareness programmes to help people guard against the infection. In Himachal Pradesh, a total of 32,239 people have tested positive for Covid till date. Of them, 25,176 have been cured with the number of active cases at present hovering at 6,547.

Ansari said that as against religiosity and strident nationalism, patriotism is a more positive concept as it is defensive both militarily and culturally. Speaking at the virtual launch of senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's book 'The Battle of Belonging', Ansari said that in a short space of four years, India has made a long journey from its founding vision of civic nationalism to a new political imagery of cultural nationalism that appears to be firmly embedded in the public realm. The former vice president said that "there is a passionate plea for an ideal of India (in the book), an India that was taken for granted by our generation" and now is seemingly endangered by "overt and covert ideas and ideologies that seek to segment it on imagined criteria of us and them". "Hitherto, our core values were summed up as an existential reality of a plural society, a democratic polity and a secular state structure. These were accepted in the freedom movement, they were incorporated in the Constitution and encapsulated in the preamble of the Constitution," said Ansari, who was vice president from 2007-2017. The plurality of Indian society is evident from the sociological evidence of 4,635 communities, he said, adding that every fifth Indian belongs to a recognised religious minority. It is this diverse mass that a new ideology is seeking to homogenise supposedly on the basis of a faith premised on an "imaginary history", he said. "The Covid-19 as a pandemic is bad enough, but before it our society became a victim of two other pandemics -- religiosity and strident nationalism. Religiosity is defined as extreme religious ardour, denoting exaggerated embodiment, involvement or zeal for certain aspects of religious activity enforced through social and even governmental pressure," he said. Much has also been written about the perils of strident nationalism and it has been called an "ideological poison" that has no hesitation in transcending and transgressing individual rights, Ansari said. "Records world over show that it at times takes the form of hatred as a tonic that inspires vengeance as a mass ideology. Some of it can be witnessed in our own land," he said. Ansari asserted that patriotism is a more positive concept as it is defensive both militarily and culturally and inspires nobel sentiments, but must not be allowed to run amok. In the book published by Aleph Book Company, Tharoor makes a stinging critique of the Hindutva doctrine and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which he says is a challenge to, arguably, the most fundamental aspect of Indianness. He has asserted that Hindutva is a political doctrine and not a religious one. Speaking at the event, Tharoor said that the BJP has spent its last six years in government contesting the idea of India by arguing that there can be an alternative idea of India. During the discussion on the book, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah said,"We had the opportunity of joining Pakistan in 1947, it was my father and the others who felt that the two nation theory is not for us." Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Christians are not different as they are all human beings and thus "we chose (Mahatma) Gandhi's India, (Jawaharlal) Nehru's India, an India that belong to everyone", Abdullah said. "That's how I felt till this government came in. They think that only a Hindu can be an Indian and all the others who are there cannot be Indians, they are second class citizens. This I am never going to accept till my dying day," he said. "My belief is that this is for all of us, this is our motherland, we grew in it, we were educated in it, we have developed in it, our families live here, our ancestors are buried here, this is as good for me as it is for any Hindu. Today we are being divided, divided on religion, on caste on creed on language," the National Conference leader said. "Tyrants come and tyrants go, nations continue to survive and I am confident that his nation will survive, these dividers will go," he said. Former JD(U) leader Pavan Varma said that the role of secular parties on issues such as minority appeasement like in the Shah Bano case also needs to be examined while dealing with the question of the idea of India. Also part of the discussion, Professor Makarand R Paranjape argued that there was not one idea of India, but many that were being hotly contested.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/before-covid-19-society-became-victim-of-two-pandemics-religiosity-strident-nationalism-ansari-918057.html

The chief minister said that it was likely that the distribution plan of the vaccination will be prepared by the central government, but he would prefer "priority-based" vaccination which is "technical rather than political in nature". "The whole world is eagerly waiting for a vaccine, the Delhi government is too. Perhaps, the distribution plan will be made by the central government. If they ask for our suggestion... there should not be VIP or non-VIP categories when it comes to giving vaccination to people. Everyone is equal and everyone's life is important," Kejriwal said at The Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS), 2020. He said, "We should do one thing. First priority should be given to corona warriors as they are working hard during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Second priority should be given to those who are vulnerable groups like senior citizens and then those who have comorbidities. If we make such categories, it will be technical in nature rather than political In nature. I would prefer this." The national capital has witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases since October 28, when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time, and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. On Wednesday, the infection tally in Delhi rose to over 5 lakh with 7,486 fresh cases being reported, while 131 new fatalities -- the highest single-day death count till date -- took the toll to 7,943. During the summit, Kejriwal said despite the "severe third wave" of coronavirus in Delhi, the situation has not gone out of control as the city government has aggressively been following testing, tracing, isolation and other things under the 'Delhi Model'. He said out of 43,000 active Covid-19 cases in the city, there are 25,000 patients under home isolation. "Had we admitted all these 25,000 patients to hospitals, we would not have enough beds in hospitals. The Delhi government is providing tele-counselling and other care to such patients," he said. As many as 7,546 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Thursday, taking the infection tally to over 5.1 lakh while 98 more fatalities pushed the toll to 8,041. On Thursday, the AAP government announced sweeping measures to control the situation including a steep Rs 2,000 fine for not wearing a mask, reservation of 80 per cent ICU beds in private hospitals, doubling testing centres in every district and postponement of non-critical surgeries at health facilities. The Union Health Ministry on Thursday said Delhi accounted for 22.39 per cent of the fatalities reported across the country in a span of 24 hours by recording 131 deaths on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-vip-or-non-vip-categories-for-covid-19-vaccine-corona-warriors-aged-should-get-priority-kejriwal-918081.html

The agreement was inked on Thursday, and Modi announced signing of the agreement during the launch of the second phase of the RuPay card of India in Bhutan on Friday. “I am especially happy that work is progressing fast for the ISRO to send a satellite of Bhutan into space next year. For this, four young space engineers from Bhutan will come to the ISRO in December for training,” the Prime Minister said, adding that New Delhi would support implementation of the vision of Bhutanese King, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, to use the space technology for the development of his country. Modi and Bhutanese Prime Minister Lotay Tshering had in August 2019 jointly inaugurated the “ground earth station”, which the ISRO built in Thimphu at the cost of Rs 7 crore to help Bhutan take advantage of the South Asia Satellite launched by India in 2017. The two Prime Ministers had witnessed signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the ISRO and Department of Information Technology and Telecom of the Bhutanese Government on establishment of SATCOM network for utilisation of the South Asia Satellite. The two Prime Ministers had jointly launched Phase-I of the RuPay card implementation project in Bhutan in August 2019. The implementation of Phase-I of RuPay cards in Bhutan enabled visitors from India to access ATMs and Point of Sale (PoS) terminals across Bhutan. The Phase-II, launched by Modi and Tshering on Friday, would now allow Bhutanese card holders to access RuPay network in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-bhutan-ink-framework-for-peaceful-use-of-space-918093.html
20-11-2020||National||Indian teen's solar iron smooths a pressing problem: forest loss||On India's residential streets, amid the tea vendors and vegetable sellers, ironing "wallahs" press clothes each day for millions of Indians, smoothing out wrinkles with iron boxes packed with hot charcoal. But India's 10 million ironing carts and shops take a hefty toll on the country's forests. Each uses, on average, more than 5 kilograms of charcoal each day, the government's science and technology department estimates. Now, however, a 14-year-old girl, troubled by the heaps of used charcoal left by her local ironing vendor and by his painful wheeze from pollution, has developed an alternative: an award-winning solar-powered iron. "I calculated the enormous quantity of charcoal being used, the pollution from it that worsens climate change, damages Mother Earth and human health. I wanted to create a renewable resource to replace charcoal," said Vinisha Umashankar from her hometown of Tiruvannamalai, in India's southern Tamil Nadu state. This week her innovation was recognised with the Children's Climate Prize for its contributions to cleaner air. The prize, backed by a Swedish energy company, includes 100,000 Swedish krona ($11,600) to further develop the project. It is just one of several national and international prizes Umashankar has won for her innovation: a wheeled cart equipped with solar panels and batteries sufficient to power a steam iron. 'INEVITABLE' Panels on the cart's roof produce solar power that can be used immediately as the cart wends its way between customers or stored in four batteries, Umashankar said. When fully charged - which takes just under five hours in bright sunshine - each battery can power the iron for six hours, she said, providing power on cloudy days, though the cart can also run on grid electricity or a generator in a pinch. To boost earnings for ironing vendors, the carts are also equipped with a mobile phone recharging station and a coin-operated telephone for making calls. Umashankar said she hopes the cart - which she developed after school over six months - will improve incomes and health for ironing vendors and offer them "a dignified life". It could also be used in other developing countries, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. She said she had designed the cart so it was easy to operate - the system takes 15 minutes to learn - and she planned to produce online videos to help those who speak other languages understand how to use it. "Today, solar energy is inevitable", particular in sunny nations such as India, where some parts of the country get 300 days of sun a year, she said. The country receives enough sunshine to produce solar power equivalent to 3,000 times the country's current energy consumption, she added. COSTS While Umashankar developed the detailed design, the first full-scale working prototype was put together and tested last December by the National Innovation Foundation, which operates under India's Department of Science and Technology. The foundation has also applied for a patent for the device, on Umashankar's behalf. The girl, who said she sees radioactivity scientist Marie Curie as a role model, said the cart could save a "countless number of trees". She said she had read that a large tree can produce enough oxygen for five people in a day - and mature trees are most likely to be logged as they produce the best charcoal. "What's the point of planting trees if we can't stop cutting trees for making unsustainable charcoal?" she asked. She said she believes ironing vendors will make the switch to her device if it is cost-effective. Enough charcoal for two day of ironing costs 700 to 1,000 rupees ($9 to $13), she said. The cart, as currently configured, by comparison, costs 40,000 rupees ($540). But Umashankar said she hopes to use her prize money to develop a new prototype that will reduce costs and boost efficiency. "In the long run my innovation will not only work out cheaper for vendors but help the environment too," she predicted, with each cart's solar panels and batteries built to last at least eight years. Sam Barratt of the U.N. Environment Programme, one of the members of the jury for the Children's Climate Prize, said Umashankar and other young innovators were "coming at the challenge with all the smarts, passion and energy that is needed to change the future to the one we all need". Umashankar said her parents and grandparents had talked about how it was cooler and seasons were more predictable when they were younger, while she and others have noticed increasing heat and pollution. "This generation... wants normal weather, which also will reduce droughts and floods. That is one reason why we take so much interest in climate change," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-teens-solar-iron-smooths-a-pressing-problem-forest-loss-918105.html

Addressing the press, Muraleedharan demanded that the Congress and the CPI(M) should make their stand clear on backing 'anti-national forces'. People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has several Jammu and Kashmir parties as its constituents pressing for restoration of J-K's special status and statehood. "The Congress is joining hands with the Gupkar alliance led by Farooq Abdullah and other separatists, who have raised weak protests in parliament against the repeal of Article 370 in Kashmir," he said. The union minister alleged that it was not surprising that the left party had joined the alliance, as it had been taking an 'anti-national' stand since the country's freedom struggle. Hitting out at the parties, he said, "The approach taken by both the parties in Kashmir is against the integrity of the country. This can be read in conjunction with the Congress alliance with the Jamaat-e-Islami for the panchayat elections in Kerala." The Congress has asserted that it was not part of the Gupkar alliance and was contesting the district development council elections in Jammu and Kashmir to "expose" the BJP through democratic means.  On CPM, he said that it "is also part of Gupkar Alliance but I’m not surprised because CPM is the party which aligned with anti-national forces and the forces which were out to denigrate the national independence struggle in 1942. So they are following that tradition."

Demanding that kickbacks in defence deals should be considered in the wider ambit of anti-national activities at par with other acts such as terrorism, the group of retired Army veterans demanded that an example should be made of those found guilty of taking bribes in the AgustaWestland case as corruption in the defence sector can compromise the nation's security and territorial integrity. Signatories including Air Marshal S P Singh (retd), Air Marshal Dushyant Singh (retd), Vice Admiral Shekhar Sinha (retd), Lt Gen V K Chaturvedi (retd) and Lt Gen Arvind Sharma (retd), said that besides the middleman involved, all those who have taken bribes in the government as also all those politicians, and their kin, who have either directly benefited from corruption or have facilitated the unethical practices for any reason should be punished, so that the case outcome has a deterrent effect and also serves as a precedent for dealing with similar cases in future. The statement referred to the names of several Congress leaders and their kin whose names have cropped up during the probe. Earlier the BJP, latching on to a purported statement of Rajiv Saxena, a key accused in the case, which claimed him as mentioning the names of former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath's nephew Ratul Puri and son Bakul Nath, along with Congress leaders Salman Khurshid and Ahmed Patel, alleged that scam was the priority in defence deals when the Congress was in power. The BJP leadership had also hit out at Rahul Gandhi for his "silence" on the allegations which reminded the former Congress President how he frequently attacked the Modi government over the Rafale fighter aircraft deal despite the Supreme Court giving a clean chit to it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/army-veterans-seem-exemplary-action-in-agustawestland-case-917994.html

The city also witnessed cold wave conditions, as the minimum temperature was less than 10 degrees Celsius and five notches below normal, according to Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. According to the weather department, 7.4 degrees Celsius is Delhi's lowest minimum temperature in the month of November in at least 14 years. Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius last year, 10.5 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 7.6 degrees Celsius in 2017 in the month of November. The all-time record for the lowest minimum temperature in November is 3.9 degrees Celsius recorded on November 28, 1938. Palawat said cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury and a similar situation will continue till Saturday. A fresh Western Disturbance is approaching northwest India on November 23. It is likely to increase the minimum temperature by a few notches, he said.  The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. On Thursday, the city recorded a minimum of 9.4 degrees Ceslius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-records-coldest-november-morning-in-at-least-14-years-917789.html

20-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality 'poor', likely to improve||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Friday morning, while central government agencies said it is likely to improve marginally due to favourable wind speed.   The city's air quality index was 292 at 10 am. Its 24-hour average AQI was 283 on Thursday, 211 on Wednesday and 171 on Tuesday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR air quality is likely to improve and remain in the “poor” category on Friday and in the “poor” to “moderate” category on Saturday. The predominant surface wind direction is northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 15 kmph, it said. Around 600 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, adjoining Pakistan and Haryana on Thursday, it said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 20 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Thursday. It was 8 per cent on Wednesday and 3 per cent on Tuesday. The minimum temperature settled at 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday – the lowest in the month of November in at least 14 years, according to IMD. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,000 m2/s on Friday and is likely to be 13,000 m2/s on Saturday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The IMD said the minimum temperature in Delhi will drop to 7 degrees Celsius by Monday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-poor-likely-to-improve-917808.html

The victim, Shriya, was having lunch with her grandmother, Sumitra, at their farm in Golhana village on Thursday evening when the leopard pounced on the child and dragged her into the forest, Superintendent of Police (SP) Vipin Mishra said. Forest department employees reached the area following reports of the incident only to face protests by irate villagers. Stones were pelted, resulting in injuries to five officials, including two inspectors, and some vehicles were also damaged. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Yashwant Singh said one forester was held hostage by the villagers and beaten up. Two Forest inspectors, who initially were reported missing from the area after the commotion, returned Friday morning. They claimed that they were hiding in the forest to escape the angry villagers, officials said. The SP said Forest employees of seven ranges, a deputy superintendent of police and personnel from nearby police stations were camping in the village. The body of the girl was recovered on Friday morning, he said. The DFO said the body was sent for an autopsy, and efforts were on to pacify the villagers. Villagers have been advised not to take children to areas adjoining the forests and asked to only move out in groups, Singh said. They have also been asked not to sow sugarcane in the fields adjoining the forests as the wild animals take them for their natural habitat, he added. The DFO termed the attack on Forest employees a serious matter, and said a case would be lodged in this connection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/leopard-kills-5-year-old-girl-in-ups-bahraich-villagers-pelt-stones-at-forest-officials-917834.html

The third phase trial of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin began in the state on Friday and the 67-year old senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader was administered the trial dose at the Civil Hospital at Ambala Cantt.   Vij is stated to be the first cabinet minister of any state government who has volunteered to take the trial dose of a potential vaccine against Covid-19.   Civil Surgeon, Ambala, Dr Kuldeep Singh told reporters that the Covaxin dose was administrated to Vij successfully. Earlier the minister underwent some tests at the hospital, where he was kept under observation for some time after being administered the vaccine. Before reaching the civil hospital, Vij, while talking to media persons, said if all goes well, the vaccine against Covid-19 will be available to the people by the beginning of next year.   To a query, Vij, who has diabetes and had undergone a surgery, said he was not suffering from any such disease which will affect him adversely after taking the vaccine. The MLA from Ambala Cantt, had on Wednesday said the third phase of trial of Covaxin will begin in the state on November 20 and had offered to get vaccinated. Covaxin is being developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Last month, the vaccine maker said it had successfully completed interim analysis of Phase 1 and 2 trials and is initiating Phase 3 trials. Bharat Biotech had on Monday said the Phase 3 trial of Covaxin will involve 26,000 volunteers across 25 centres in India and is being conducted in partnership with the ICMR. It is the largest clinical trial conducted for a Covid-19 vaccine in India. This is India's first Phase 3 efficacy study for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the largest Phase 3 efficacy trial ever conducted. Human trials of Covaxin had begun at Rohtak's Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in July, Vij had said earlier.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-health-minister-anil-vij-gets-trial-dose-of-indigenous-covid-19-vaccine-917856.html

It's just not a level playing field, several candidates said ahead of the November 28 District Development Council polls, the first democratic exercise since Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 was revoked in August last year and the state was bifurcated into union territories. Seven parties, including the National Conference and the PDP, have come together on one platform, the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), to contest the elections. But the lack of enthusiasm is evident with political parties accusing the administration of strictly restricting the hours of campaigning and not even allowing their candidates to move out, unless it is in a government car. "BJP and 'Kings party' candidates and their junior-level workers are provided individual personal security and bulletproof vehicles, while all others are hounded to far away government accommodations. Is this the 'new mantra' of providing a level playing field?” asked Nasir Aslam Wani, NC provincial president, Kashmir. “King’s party” is a reference to the Apni Party, floated by businessman-turned-politician Altaf Bukhari. Wani said PAGD candidates have been locked up in hotels and guesthouses in several places and not allowed to campaign. "I have never witnessed this kind of electioneering… not since the political process started after the eruption of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. We have always had candidates running around. How can you expect somebody to campaign only between 12 noon and 3 pm?" The NC leader said the claims of the UT administration and Union Home Minister Amit Shah about the situation being peaceful in Jammu and Kashmir were either wrong or they were trying to influence this election. "If we listen to what the home minister or the state administration has to say, militancy has been wiped out. Then is this being done to influence the election? You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. You have to go one way about it. "Either the situation is safe, as they claim, and let the candidates campaign. Or else, the security scenario is so bad that they cannot create a conducive environment. In that case, why have the polls then?" he added. It is not just about the campaigning not taking place, Wani said. The party, he added, is also worried it may not get candidates to file their nominations for the rest of the eight-phase polls. The administration, on its part, said “collective security” is necessary given the resource limitations. Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said providing security to each candidate contesting the polls is difficult. "We are providing them collective security and they are being put up in secure areas," he said. Rayees Mattoo, a NC candidate of the PAGD from Khag area of central Kashmir's Budgam district, said he has been put up at a hotel here and candidates of the alliance are not allowed to campaign even while their competitors are freely working in the field. "Is this the way to hold an election? We are not provided with security or vehicles. I had three meetings scheduled for the day and had conveyed the same to the authorities well in advance. But I was not allowed to move out of the hotel as they say there are not enough vehicles or security available," he asserted. His party colleague and candidate Mohammad Ashraf Lone said there are only six vehicles for about 40 candidates in the hotel he has been allotted. "How can we all move around in just a few vehicles? The government says new faces should contest the polls and so we did. But if they cannot provide us with the facilities, how can we manage? If they do not want us to contest, let them say it then." According to Lone, the candidates were told to use the vehicles to campaign but return before 4 pm. "The journey from our hotel to Beerwah (in central Kashmir's Budgam district) itself takes about two hours. How can we campaign in such a short time," he said. Sabzar Ahmad, an independent candidate from Dooru area of south Kashmir's Anantnag district, said he has been placed in a hotel in Pahalgam and is not allowed to move out. "About 25 of us are here and we feel like prisoners. They do not let us move out, while candidates from other parties go out for campaigning," he said. Another independent candidate, Akhtar Hussain Magray from Beerwah, withdrew his nomination papers, saying the authorities had failed to provide the candidates with security and other arrangements. Officials privy to the security plan for the polls said the government does not have resources to cater to the needs of every candidate. "It is so difficult to manage with the resources that we have. There is more demand for logistics and manpower and it gets difficult to rationalise things," an official said. Several candidates are being put up in cluster accommodations which are secured and their movement is facilitated so that they are able to reach their constituencies for campaigning. IGP Vijay Kumar said the candidates are provided escort when they leave and the security forces secure the area for them to visit and campaign. "Whenever any candidate goes out for campaigning, we provide a double escort with him and secure the area for him to campaign," he said. The PAGD, led by National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, was formed to seek the restoration of the erstwhile state's special status. But the alliance announced a plunge into electoral politics to keep the BJP away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/confined-to-hotels-and-unable-to-campaign-freely-jammu-and-kashmir-poll-candidates-ask-for-level-playing-field-917871.html

City’s Additional District Magistrate Mahendra Kumar Singh, who is in charge of the Integrated Covid-19 Control Room here, on Friday said the district administration is keeping a close eye on all those coming from Delhi. Directives have been issued to ensure prompt corona tests of people coming from Delhi for which mobile vans have been deployed on the borders, he said. The administration is making an all-out effort to see to it that those testing positive go in for home isolation, the ADM said, adding the corporators’ help too is being sought in this task. Bareilly Mayor Umesh Gautam said hundreds of people keep coming from Delhi and so it is a must to see to it that the infection does not spread here. All the corporators have been asked to ensure prompt testing of all those coming from Delhi in their respective wards, the Mayor said, adding even those who test negative should be asked to go in for another test in case of any symptom surfaces in five to ten days. Making an appeal to Nagar Nigam staff besides the district administration and the Health Department, the Mayor said local corporators will also help people in this. Corporators are appealing on loudspeakers for people coming from Delhi to go in for testing, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bareilly-goes-in-for-testing-people-from-delhi-for-covid-19-at-border-917874.html
20-11-2020||North and Central||J&K Lt Governor assures parties of smooth campaign for upcoming DDC polls||Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha has assured political parties of smooth campaign for the upcoming local body elections and said the polls would go a long way in strengthening panchayati raj institutions in the Union Territory. Responding to a letter by CPI(M) leader Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami who had raised the issue of candidates being kept away from their constituencies and not being allowed to campaign, Sinha said he has taken note of the concerns and conveyed "necessary instructions". Tarigami, a former MLA from the militancy-hit Kulgam district of south Kashmir, had informed the Lt Governor that after filing their nomination papers, the candidates were not allowed to campaign due to "perceived threat to their lives" and had been bundled in "cluster accommodation". "Confining candidates against their wishes has severely restricted their movement and ability to campaign. Even in some cases, they are not allowed to attend party meetings," the letter said. Tarigami said that there had been instances that rival candidates were sent in the same vehicle and asked to campaign together. "Several candidates from far-off places were sent to hotels in Srinagar soon after they filed the nomination forms last week. Not just the voters, but the families of the candidates are also concerned," he said. In his response, the Lt Governor said, "I am sure that the coming elections will go a long way in strengthening the Panchayati Raj Institutions." Tarigami released the Lt Governor's letter. The former MLA said such arrangements were a big concern and there was a lot of dissatisfaction on ground over it. "Who wins and who loses, the decision must lie on the electorate. Democracy must finally win. For that the process must be made secure and credible. It is advisable not to put avoidable restrictions on the contesting candidates and instead their legitimate movement for the campaigning in their respective areas must be effectively facilitated," he said. The CPI(M) is part of the newly formed People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) which comprises the National Conference, the PDP and four other local parties. The PAGD was formed to work for the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state democratic and legally. The Jammu and Kashmir will go for an eight-phase District Development Council elections beginning November 28.

According to the police, a case of murder was registered against SI Yunus Khan, the woman's parents, three uncles and another man at Miranpur police station in Muzaffarnagar district on Thursday. Miranpur police station SHO Santosh Kumar Tyagi said they have begun investigation into the case.

The couple died on September 4 under suspicious circumstances near Kanpur when they were being brought to Muzaffarnagar. The man's brother alleged foul play in the deaths.

However, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain sought to paint a positive picture saying a reduction in the number of new Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate is a "clear indicator" that the spread of the virus is decreasing in the national capital. The survey will be completed in five days covering 57 lakh people in containment zones to identify and test symptomatic people living there. Teachers, municipal corporation staff, ASHA workers, and civil defence volunteers have been drafted in survey teams, numbering around 9,500. Each team will survey 50 households every day. The survey came as part of the decisions taken at a review meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Meanwhile, the number of containment zones in the capital has now touched 4,550 with South-West Delhi topping the list with 743. Six districts out of the total 11 have more than 400 containment zones. "The positivity rate was 15.26% on November 7. It is less than 11% now. The maximum number of cases (8,593) were reported on November 10. The positivity rate has come down and the number of cases is also reducing gradually. It is a clear indicator that the spread of the virus is decreasing in Delhi," Jain said. While the average death rate across the country is 1.48%, it is 1.57% in Delhi while it was around 3.50% in June.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-begins-door-to-door-survey-in-containment-zones-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-917950.html
20-11-2020||North and Central||Article 370 has been buried, will never return in J&K: BJP||The BJP on Friday asserted that Article 370, which was revoked by the Centre last year, would never be restored in Jammu and Kashmir, and alleged that parties of 'Gupkar alliance' were befooling people by making promises over its restoration. Addressing a press conference here, BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz also said the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) polls were being fought over local developmental issues and its results would not be a referendum on the Centre's last year's decision of revocation of the special status of the erstwhile state. "We believe that when someone dies, he cannot return from the grave. Article 370 has also been buried and it will never return. It can never be restored and no world power can help in its restoration," he said. The BJP leader, who is the party's incharge for Kashmir for the polls, said NC president Farooq Abdullah and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti were befooling people by showing them dreams, but asserted their dreams would never come true. "They are showing the people dreams and befooling them. There is no big a lie than that. These are the same leaders who were claiming Article 370 cannot be scrapped and even stated that nobody in J-K will raise tricolour if it is scrapped. However, the people are now raising tricolour without any objection," he said. Hussain said the leaders of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PGAD) - an amalgam of several parties, including the NC and the PDP, seeking the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state - had accepted the Centre's decision of revocation of Article 370. "They have accepted this decision and are now participating in the elections. They have ganged up. They have befooled the people of J-K. They have indulged in politics over the bodies of the youth of J-K to save their chair. They are sinners and no one will forgive them. They have committed big sins and are worse than gangsters and they live only for power and to benefit their families and relatives," he said. Referring to the DDC polls, he said the lotus - the BJP's election symbol - will bloom in the valley like the rest of the country. "The polls are not a referendum. This is a local body election, about local issues. This is not about national politics," he said, when asked if the BJP losses the DDC polls, would it mean that the people of Kashmir have not accepted the abrogation of Article 370. Seeking people's support for the polls, the former Union minister said the party would live up to the people's expectations. "We are concerned about the people of Jammu and Kashmir and will ensure the development, which is the right of people and will be given to them. The J-K will see a new dawn of development and for which the work has already been started. Give the BJP a chance and God willing, we will live up to your expectations," he said. Hussain said it was the desire of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to see massive development in J-K. "Jammu and Kashmir is in the heart of PM Modi and he wants to develop it like other parts of the country. J-K has the capability to give employment not only to the people here, but to the outsiders as well," he said. On a question about the eviction of nomads from forest areas, Hussain said nobody can snatch the lands of the people of J-K. "This is only propaganda. The laws have already been implemented and the rights of the Gujjar and Bakerwal community will always be protected," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/article-370-has-been-buried-will-never-return-in-jk-bjp-917966.html

A proposal to enactment the process of a stringent law to deal with cases of alleged 'love jihad' (Muslim youths marrying Hindu girls under false pretenses), was prepared by the UP home department, sources said on Friday. The proposal would be sent to the law department and after getting its approval would be placed before the state Cabinet for its nod, sources said. The law would cover marriages after conversion as well as marriages under false pretenses. Sources said that anyone wanting to convert on one's own volition to marry would have to compulsorily give an application in this regard to the district magistrate concerned a month in advance. The proposal comes within days after UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's warning those indulging in 'love jihad'  to  be ready for 'Ram Naam Satya' journey (Hindu funeral chant during the last journey). Adityanath had said that the state government would make the law to deal with 'love jihad' so stringent that those wanting to violate it would think many times before doing so. ''Cases of love jihad have been pouring in from different parts of the state....there is an urgent need to enact a stringent law to deal with it,'' said a senior UP BJP leader here. Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders, however, said that the BJP government was trying to make it a ''communal issue''. ''The government must act in cases of forced conversion but the state government, it seems, wants to divide the people in the name of religion,'' said an SP leader. Several other states, including Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, were also contemplating to enact laws to deal with alleged cases of 'love jihad'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/love-jihad-to-be-non-bailable-offence-in-uttar-pradesh-5-year-imprisonment-if-found-guilty-917970.html

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi led-government has ended the 'corruption of clan' from the corridors of power of Delhi and now it will make Jammu and Kashmir free from 'corruption of clan'," Naqvi, who is the union minister for minority affairs, said at an election meeting in Balahama area of the city here. He said that secularism is not a "definition of vote politics" for the BJP. "It is determination for inclusive development. The Modi era is an era of 'Iqbal' (authority), 'Insaaf' (justice) and 'Imaan' (integrity) where inclusive development, security and prosperity of the country are of the utmost priority," he said.  After several decades, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have become an equal partner in transparent democratic and development processes, he claimed.  Naqvi alleged  that the "dynastic politics" had deliberately deprived the people of Jammu and Kashmir of mainstream development process and their constitutional rights. "Now, the BJP is committed to take the Union Territory forward on the path of prosperity," he added.  Naqvi reiterated his party's allegation that the "Gupkar Alliance" is a conspiracy against the country.  "The alliance is trying to create confusion among the people of Jammu and Kashmir but they will not succeed in their attempt. The people will never accept any such alliance which wants to throw Kashmir back into the quagmire of separatism and terrorism," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/narendra-modi-led-govt-will-rid-jk-of-corruption-of-clan-mukhtar-abbas-naqvi-917986.html

The central agency has said that the accused cops can't claim relief as they allegedly "conspired, kept in illegal confinement and eventually killed the Bhavnagar youth in cold blood." The Gujarat police had branded Sadiq as a "terrorist" as he was accused of planning to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi, among other saffron leaders, to avenge 2002 riots. CBI probe found that he was killed by a team of eight policemen including J G Parmar, I A Saiyed, K M Vaghela, R L Mavani, G H Gohil, Ajaypal Yadav and Chhatarsinh Chudasama in a fake encounter near Jai Ambe Traders, Saibaba Complex, Galaxy Cinema, Naroda, Ahmedabad on January 13, 2003. The affidavit said that 19-year-old Sadiq was apprehended in a "stage-managed joint operation of SIB (Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau), Mumbai and CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit of Mumbai police), Andheri, Mumbai on November 19, 2002, from a place near Arsa Hotel, Andheri (E), Mumbai." The document said that the youth was subjected to interrogation at CIU, Andheri by the officials of SIB, Mumbai. The affidavits were filed in response to discharge pleas filed by accused policemen Mavani and Yadav. It says that retired Deputy Superintendent of Police Tarun Barot, the then police inspector, Detection of Crime Branch, Ahmedabad along with other staff took Sadiq into custody from Mumbai police and returned on January 4, 2003. Thereafter, he was kept in "illegal confinement by officials of DCB, Ahmedabad till he was killed." The two accused cops have sought discharge on various grounds including the absence of any government sanction for prosecution under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) which mandates prior approval for prosecuting government servants. The CBI reply states, "Had Sadiq been killed in a crossfire in self-defense, accused persons would have been entitled for sanction for prosecution u/s 197 of CrPC. However, in this case, as per the report of investigation, it was not killing in self-defense but in a cold blood." "Facts constitute offences punishable u/s 120-B r/w (read with) 302 of IPC. Hence, the accused persons are not entitled to protection." The agency added that because the criminal conspiracy to kill anyone in such manner is neither official duty nor purported official duty. "In other words, there exists no nexus between acts and duty so as to attract Section 197 of CrPC," it said. Interestingly, the CBI, despite taking such stand on record chose to seek prosecution sanction from the Gujarat government in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case after the special trial court asked the agency whether it would want to seek such permission or not. The CBI chose to seek and filed an application which was rejected by the Gujarat government allowing the court to discharge key accused ex IPS officer D G Vanzara and retired Superintendent of Police N K Amin. The CBI is facing a similar situation after the court rejected discharge pleas of four remaining accused policemen in Ishrat case including IPS officer G L Singhal while asking the agency to seek sanction from the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cops-conspired-kept-in-illegal-custody-killed-sadiq-jamal-in-cold-blood-cant-claim-relief-cbi-918014.html

At a virtual meeting with the representatives of the market associations, the chief minister also sought cooperation from the market associations on curbing Covid-19 cases in the city. "Met representatives of market associations. I removed their anxieties, government does not wish to shut any market. They assured anyone not wearing a mask in the market will be provided free by market associations. All shops will also be asked to keep spare masks and hand sanitizers," Kejriwal tweeted. He said he was assured by market associations that they will provide free masks to those not wearing it and also ensure availability of spare masks and sanitisers at shops. Amid the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, Kejriwal had on Tuesday sought power from the Centre to impose restrictions in those markets which may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots due to crowded situation, people not using face masks and violations of social distancing there. "Delhi government does not want to shut any market, the people of the associations should provide free masks to the people who are without masks," Kejriwal said in the meeting and sought cooperation in controlling the rising cases of Corona in the national capital.  The market associations assured that they will support and extend all possible help to the the government to prevent the infection of Covid-19 in the marketplaces, said a Delhi government statement.  In view of the rising coronavirus infections in the city, the representatives of the market associations expressed concern over the possibility of closing down of markets, on which the chief minister "clarified" that the Delhi government does not want to shut any market, the statement said. He said that despite the rapid spread of coronavirus in Delhi, our doctors, nurses, and medical staff have done commendable work and are tirelessly treating Covid 19 patients.  Constant efforts are being made to ensure that Delhi residents do not suffer due to the shortage of ICU beds in hospitals. Seeing the shortage of ICU beds, the chief minister has appealed to increase ICU beds by meeting doctors in GTB and DDU hospitals, it said. After the efforts of the chief minister, 663 additional ICU beds will be increased in Delhi government hospitals within the next few days. Also, 750 ICU beds have been received from the central government, added the statement. The chief minister has also appealed all the political parties to deploy their volunteers on the road to distribute masks to people who are not wearing it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chief-minister-arvind-kejriwal-asks-market-associations-to-provide-free-masks-to-those-not-wearing-it-918020.html

The protests, which began on September 24, have affected 3,850 freight trains which could not be loaded. As many as 2,352 passenger trains have been cancelled or diverted so far, it said. The deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Railways continued with the national transporter rejecting a proposal by the protestors that only freight trains will be allowed to run in the state. "The revenue loss due to cancellation of passenger trains is Rs 67 crore. The total loss of earnings at IR level is Rs 2,220 crore," the Railways said. The Northern Railways, which caters to the region, incurred a revenue loss of Rs 891 crore with an average loss of Rs 14.85 crore daily. From October 1 to November 19, the Railways’ freight loading suffered losses due to cancellations of trains and many being stranded in the outskirts of Punjab meant for Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir carrying essentials. The Railways said around 230 loaded rakes for Punjab are currently held up outside the state. This includes 78 rakes of coal, 34 of fertilizer, eight each of cement and petroleum, oil and lubricants and 102 containers carrying steel and other commodities. Around 33 rakes are stuck in Punjab itself, it said. Goods trains have not entered Punjab for one-and-a-half months now, except for two days in late October, leading to a shortage of essential goods, including fertilisers needed for wheat sowing and coal supplies for thermal plants. Farm leaders say they have vacated the tracks, but some protests still continue at stations. The Railways has maintained that it needs full guarantee from the state government that no trains will be disrupted and both passenger and freight trains be allowed to operate. The farmers, however have said that while they will allow goods trains, they can give no guarantee for passenger trains. The farmers are protesting three farm related bills passed by the government recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/suffered-loss-of-rs-2220-crore-due-to-farmers-protest-in-punjab-railways-918025.html

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration had on Wednesday started random testing of people coming from Delhi to Noida at the borders of the two cities amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the national capital. On Thursday, 178 people were randomly tested at Ashok Nagar and at the Botanical Garden Metro Station, while 165 tests were done on Wednesday at the DND and the Chilla borders in Noida, according to officials. Nine incoming people were found Covid-19 positive during the random antigen-based tests on Thursday and three were found positive on Wednesday, as per official figures.  Giving details of Thursday, Additional Chief Medical Officer (ACMO) Sanjeev Manglik said 178 random antigen-based tests were done and out of these nine were found positive for the novel coronavirus. "The positivity rate in border areas was 5.06 per cent," he said. On the other hand, 2,712 antigen-based tests were done in non-border areas of the district and 27 positive cases were reported, Manglik said, adding that the positivity rate was less than one per cent. "In non-border areas, the positivity rate was 0.99 per cent," the ACMO said. The purpose of randomly testing incoming people from Delhi at Noida's borders was to assess and prevent the spread of the infection from high-risk carriers, according to District Magistrate Suhas L Y. "This is being done in order to assess the spread of the infection and would help in issuing advisories to employers and organisations, where a large number of people work and commute between Gautam Buddh Nagar and adjacent areas, so that the spread of infection is contained to a large extent," he said earlier this week. Gautam Buddh Nagar had 1,401 active cases of Covid-19, while the district's overall infection tally stood at 21,166 and the death toll at 74, according to official data on Friday. Delhi has crossed five lakh cases while its death toll was around 8,000, according to official figures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/noida-random-testing-covid-19-positivity-rate-higher-among-people-tested-at-delhi-border-918043.html

The accused, Pravin Kumar (37), had received the consignment from his accomplice in Kolkata. He had boarded a train from Asansol in West Bengal and was on his way to Mumbai to deliver the gold parcel to jewellers, they said. To avoid detection at airports, the accused opted to travel by train. His brother, who is a jeweller, operates businesses in Delhi and Mumbai, the police said.

When the passenger was questioned, he failed to give any satisfactory response, according to the police. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra K Singh said that after preliminary enquiry, custom officials were called to the spot and the man was searched. He was carrying gold bars in cloth pouches kept inside his jacket.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR air quality is likely to remain in the "poor" to "moderate" category on Saturday. The predominant surface wind direction is likely to be west-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 15 kmph on Saturday, it said. Around 600 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining Pakistan on Thursday, it said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 15 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Friday. It was 20 per cent on Thursday, eight per cent on Wednesday and three per cent on Tuesday. SAFAR said "energetic" surface winds are likely to influence AQI positively in the next two days. The minimum temperature settled at 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday – the lowest in the month of November in 14 years, according to IMD. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 12,500 m2/s on Friday and is likely to be 13,000 m2/s on Saturday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The IMD said the minimum temperature in Delhi will drop to 7 degrees Celsius by Monday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-poor-likely-to-improve-918067.html

A senior official said the 112 facility is now available in 18 languages and the state government has roped in volunteers proficient in foreign languages to cater to foreign tourists. "In case a tourist falls ill, ambulance assistance will be provided to them by 112 personnel," said Asim Arun, the Additional Director General of 112 facility. "Many citizens are serving as volunteers to speak in foreign languages. Considering the number of foreign tourists, volunteers are offering their services for languages ​such as English, French, Spanish, Urdu, Malaysian, Korean, etc.," he said. He also said that tourist police facility is available in Lucknow, Agra, Mathura, Kushinagar and other districts of the state. He said, "112-UP coordinates with the tourist police in these cities to provide assistance to tourists. Police Response Vehicles act as a bridge between tourists and administration/district police." Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said that 112 personnel are being trained on the kind of help tourists may need in an emergency and how to help them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-extends-ambulance-service-under-112-helpline-to-tourists-918068.html
20-11-2020||Oasis||The panacea of prayer||If Shakespeare is acclaimed a genius for investing rare sensibilities in the “brute” Caliban who recites his incandescent poetry in “The Tempest,” why not recall our own poetic maharshi, Valmiki, who did the same--not in the prince of Ayodhya --but in a monkey who makes his appearance at the very end of the Ramayana? Hanuman, who is the embodiment of courage, intelligence and humility, is the true hero of this remarkable epic. His creator also titled this chapter as the “Sundara Kanda” the beautiful chapter or the chapter that describes a beautiful character.  We have much to learn from it to find peace in our troubled lives.  The pandemic has made our lives insecure and disturbed. It has lowered our resistance to cope with our day to day problems. Every small glitch seems enormous now. Those of us who are elderly and alone find it even more challenging to meet these difficulties. This is the time to fall back on our faith and philosophy that were designed to help us swim through troubled waters and reach the shore safely.  Every one of us needs an anchor in life to hold on to. Religion, prayer and trust in something bigger than yourself is perhaps the best and safest anchor. Now is the time to cast off that cavalier attitude, that contempt for simple faith and belief, that “intellectual” superiority that made you scoff at those who prayed with unconcealed trust. Now is the time to remember Valmiki’s hero who lifted mountains to find one plant, who flew across oceans to save one woman. If we remember him and emulate a fraction of his wisdom, we will find the strength to weather these times.  No wonder great composers like Purandhara Dasa, Thyagaraja, Annamacharya or Bhadrachala Ramadaasu wove their best compositions around this devotee of Rama rather than Rama Himself.  “Banthu reethi koluveeyavayya, Rama ” or lyrics like “Rama bhakthi Saamarajya…” say everything. Gandhi’s interpretation of prayer is simple and easy to understand. He asks: “What is it that millions of Hindus, Mussalmans, Christians, Jews and others do every day during the time set apart for the Maker? It seems to me that it is a yearning of the heart to be one with the Maker …..” Praying is like a child turning to a parent for security and comfort. Why deny yourself of this simple act?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/the-panacea-of-prayer-917668.html
20-11-2020||Opinion||G20 must begin the next chapter in multilateralism||By Nic Dawes For all of its branding as “the premier forum for international economic cooperation,” let’s recall that the Group of 20 was born under a bad sign. The heads of state first met in the maw of the 2008 financial crisis, in the dying days of the Bush administration. Now, as they limp toward a low-expectation summit in the twilight of the Trump era, under the presidency of a Saudi Arabia struggling to launder its global reputation, the stars look just as bad. In April 2009, at just the second full summit meeting of the new great-power forum, Gordon Brown and Barack Obama chivvied and haggled with Hu Jintao, Angela Merkel, and Nikolas Sarkozy. The leaders of big developing economies were there too of course, with left-leaning technocrats like India’s Manmohan Singh and Brazil’s Lula Inacio da Silva lending more equitable look the high council of global economic governance. Despite some opposition from the French and Germans, they emerged with an extraordinary deal: $1 trillion in new capacity for the International Monetary Fund: $250 billion in new funding from members, $500 billion in “New Arrangements to Borrow,” and $250 billion in additional Special Drawing Rights — the near-cash instrument available to IMF members on a proportional basis. Intervention on a similar scale is if anything, more urgent now.  Much of the G20 has drifted into a widely-predicted second wave of Covid-19 cases, with public compliance faltering and governments unable to muster the will to contain a resurgent virus. Something similar has happened to efforts to ensure a coordinated global economic response to the pandemic. From the most resilient economies to the most fragile, there is massive uncertainty. Global output has taken a $12 trillion hit, and the timeline to recovery remains uncertain. The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to act as a de-facto global anchor, and China’s central bank has an increasingly large set of surpluses to invest. But a second round of stimulus funding in the U.S. remains in doubt, and in smaller economies, worries about debt and deficits are already causing a premature pull-back. A new IMF report notes that in economies where fiscal balances dropped by more than 10% of GDP this year, they are expected to improve by more than 5% of GDP in 2021. To be clear, that is an unwelcome development: most of the improvement will be down to reduced stimulus spending, which will starve the recovery of oxygen. The Fund itself has provided $70 billion in loans through its existing programs, and around $29 billion in through its rapid-credit and financing facilities. These are big numbers, but derisory relative to the scale of the problem. The Trump administration has vetoed widespread calls to expand SDRs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claims that the funds would go mostly to G20 members who, he says, don’t need them. Tell that to South Africa, which faces a 15% budget deficit this year. Mnuchin clearly hasn’t studied the numbers. Poorer countries would realize enormous benefits too. Mozambique, for instance, would see its international reserves bolstered by some 18% if the stock of SDRs was increased to $1 trillion. Bangladesh would get around $9 billion, which, the Center for Economic Policy Research reminds us, would enable it to purchase around 12 million Covid-19 test kits or fund 50% of its annual imports from the US. The G20’s current leadership dynamics are no cause for optimism. Donald Trump is looking to prove that a lame duck can still smash things, and his good friend Mohammed bin Salman lacks the moral authority to secure a deal. Singh and Lula have been replaced by Narendra Modi and Jair Bolsonaro, who combine hollow economic rhetoric with rightwing populism. As for Boris Johnson, he may be anxious for a reset, but he is no Gordon Brown on questions of global development. If nothing else, however, the summit is an opportunity to focus minds on the dangers of ongoing inaction. Zambia has just become the first African country to default on its debt since the advent of the pandemic, and similar pressure is piling up elsewhere. Even where there is little risk of default, austerity will cause deep scarring, with consequences for both individual countries, and what remains of the multilateral system. Perhaps the most damaging legacy of 2008 is the global rise of the same nationalist, anti-democratic leaders who are an obstacle to coordinated action now. Cutbacks in social spending and investment in fractured democracies like South Africa, Mexico, and Nigeria, threatens to give space to more of the same. There is some hope in the recent past, however. As Adam Tooze writes of the first G20 summit in Crashed – How a Decade of Financial Crises Change the World, “On his way out of office, Bush’s administration, which had given unilateralism a bad name, would reluctantly inaugurate a new chapter in multilateralism.” Joe Biden and his team may have to work around a reluctant Senate, but they have more scope internationally. They should be telegraphing now — to Europe, to China, and to big emerging markets — that they will support a G20 plan with four basic elements: An expansion of existing debt relief and fiscal support, headlined by increasing to $1 trillion the available pool of SDRs; a shared political commitment to expansionary spending; firm climate commitments for recovery investment; and open, rules based global trade. That may the basis for positioning now, and more substantial action early in the new year. Just maintaining stimulus spending would be no small victory. The next chapter in multilateralism will look very different from the last, but if it is put off much longer, it won’t begin at all.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/g20-must-begin-the-next-chapter-in-multilateralism-917867.html
20-11-2020||Opinion||Why we must regulate dubbed content on Kannada TV||For decades, the Kannada Film Chamber of Commerce and Karnataka Television Association (KFCC and KTVA) had imposed an unofficial ban on screening dubbed content. In 2012, a few consumer rights groups fought for the removal of the ban. Following a Competition Commission of India  (CCI) ruling in their favour, the group managed to mainstreamise content that otherwise could not have been accessible to the Kannada-speaking population. This was a welcome move, which made important shows from the Discovery Channel and certain serials like Mahanayaka (based on the life of BR Ambedkar) available in Kannada. Post the lifting of the ban, however, several dubbed Hindi serials have flooded Kannada channels. The film fraternity has repeatedly expressed concerns about dubbed TV content bulldozing native content and the ensuing loss of jobs. And sure enough, coupled with the effects of the lockdown, Kannada serials have been replaced by their dubbed counterparts.  Problems with dubbed content In the last few months, hundreds of artists and technicians have lost their jobs. The serials they worked on have been permanently scrapped, including critically acclaimed serials like Magalu Janaki. With technicians losing their livelihood, worker associations have been advocating for regulations in dubbing. Pro-dubbing consumer rights groups, meanwhile, have vehemently opposed the introduction of regulatory measures. In the current context, one of the arguments made by the advocates of dubbing is that it will create new opportunities in voice acting, sound mixing, and translation. However, these are not new jobs. The demand for these roles has existed in equal measure before the advent of dubbing. The second argument is that the competition arising out of dubbed shows will force native serial directors to up their ante, eventually ensuring that only “good” Kannada content survives. This concept of the “survival of the fittest” stems from the discredited theory of Social Darwinism. In West Bengal, a similar premise led to a TV channel acting as dumping ground for dubbed Hindi content, so much so that the channel now does not telecast any original serials. Back home too, this narrative has proved costly for Kannada serial directors and producers.  Role of large media corporations Even though shooting has resumed post-lockdown, dubbed content continues to rule the roost. For large media corporations, dubbed shows are cost-effective since the cost of production for an original show is between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 1 Lakh per day, while dubbed shows need only minimal input.  Karnataka does not have its own GEC (General Entertainment Channel). Most channels are owned by corporations based out of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. While it can be said that a Kannadiga-owned GEC would work in favour of original content, this assumption is reductionist.  Even when GECs are based out of their own state, the situation is grim. TV worker associations in states like West Bengal, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu are fighting to regulate dubbed material. In Tamil Nadu, significant screen time is occupied by dubbed Hindi serials, even in channels owned by Tamil GECs. The networks are driven more by TRP and profits than the interests of their workers and artists. The argument by worker groups across the nation is similar – the dumping of dubbed content leads to native serials being discontinued, forcing small-time actors and technicians to bear the brunt. Even if we were to believe that jobs will eventually be restored, the debate fails to acknowledge the immense amount of power that large media corporations have come to enjoy, owing to our current approach to dubbing.  This will inevitably create a hegemony, wherein a media corporation controls what the producer creates and what the viewer consumes. The power granted to the media corporations will enable the telecasting of agenda-driven serials. In the 80s, when DD was the only accessible channel, the telecast of Ramayan eventually manufactured consent for the Ram Mandir movement. Today, at least five dubbed serials in Kannada television tell stories from Hindu mythology.  Looking for solutions There is no quick-fix to the dubbing chaos we are in, but we can look to our neighbours for possible measures. In Andhra Pradesh, 70 per cent of all screen-time is reserved for native serials. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, levies an additional tax on dubbed serials to force media networks to telecast a limited number of foreign content. By limiting the number of dubbed serials that a channel can telecast, regulations work in favour of the local workers. The opening of doors to dubbing was meant to protect Kannada and Kannadiga rights, but the uncontrolled approach is proving to be anti-worker and pro-corporate. There is still a long way to go before Kannada television airs content that truly provides the Kannadiga with what they earlier did not have access to, while safeguarding the workers’ interests. The removal of the ban might have been the first step to democratise infotainment, but the movement will be self-destructive if pertinent regulations are not put in place.  (Anusha Bhat is pursuing postgraduate studies in Development from Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.

20-11-2020||Panorama||Import tariffs: ‘Infant industry’ argument and its limitations||Indian policymakers are reportedly thinking of introducing a sunset date for higher import tariffs imposed on goods like mobile phones and TVs to boost local production (Make in India initiative) in the electronics sector. This is invoking the so-called ‘Infant Industry Argument’ for protection of some industries while trying to limit its possible ill effects on the consumers and the rest of the economy. The logic behind the argument is that domestic producers in some ‘new’ industries, because of being late starters, cannot compete successfully with established foreign producers. However, given protection from foreign competition for some time, the domestic firms would be able to compete with foreign firms on an equal footing and would be eventually internationally competitive. So, temporary protection of ‘infant industries’, even if it imposes a cost on the consumers (who would have to pay a higher price) during the period of protection, is justified from a longer run efficiency point of view. In a sense, it increases the benefits from free trade over time as the country creates a comparative advantage (which otherwise will not be realised) by providing temporary protection from foreign competition. The case becomes stronger when the infant industry is expected to create new jobs and incomes, which will not take place unless foreign direct investment (FDI) with state-of-the-art technology and global brands come into the industry. With free trade, foreign producers would find it profitable to export finished products to India rather than setting up factories in India. With tariff barriers, FDI (of tariff-jumping variety) would be induced to set up factories in India to avoid the tariffs. Initially, they would come to exploit the large Indian market and then, gradually, would use India as an export base to neighboring countries. However, components need to be allowed to be imported free while some import duty (not too high, to encourage highly inefficient production under tariff shelter) is imposed on final products. Otherwise, India would not be able to seamlessly integrate with global supply chains – something essential if India has to become an important production and export hub of electronic goods in the highly competitive international markets. Given the continuing trade, technology and investment tensions between China and the US (and its allies), rising labour cost in China, and the lure of the big Indian market, India has the potential to emerge as a manufacturing hub for many electronic goods. Whether the Indian potential would be realised or not depends on a host of factors (like the state of infrastructure, the working of land, labour and capital markets, the ease of doing business, etc), in addition to its tax and tariff structure. The biggest practical difficulty with the argument is that once protection is given, it becomes very difficult to withdraw it later. Vested interests develop to lobby for continuing indefinite protection.  Also, other industries would press for protection, once it is allowed to some industry. The Indian experience since independence till the economic liberalisation in 1991 makes us apprehensive about the outcome of this new wave of protectionism. That is why we need a sunset clause or a mandated time schedule of phased reduction of tariffs so that the firms are forced to improve efficiency to become globally competitive within an agreed time frame. This would also provide prior information and policy stability for potential investors who then cannot complain that they did not know about the withdrawal of protection later. In addition, while deciding on the degree of protection to be allowed, the policymakers need to focus on ‘value-added protection’ or ‘effective tariffs’, rather than ‘nominal tariffs.’ To give a simple example, suppose that 10% of the price of a cellphone consists of value-added (wages and profits), while 90% is composed of component costs. In such a case, if there are zero tariffs on imported components while there is a 20% nominal tariff on imported finished cellphones, the ‘effective tariff’ for the cellphone industry in India would be 200% [=(.2/.1) x100]. In other words, with this tariff structure, labour and capital in the industry would be able to get three times more, compared to what they would earn under free trade. That is the measure of the true protection that the industry is enjoying, but it is remaining hidden behind a small nominal tariff of only 20%. WTO mandated ‘bound tariffs’ only put a cap on nominal tariffs, not on effective tariffs. It is for us to decide how much effective protection we should provide to our infant electronics industry to compensate for the initial high costs and how fast we need to reduce the effective protection to force the industry to improve efficiency to global levels. Unfortunately, there is insufficient realisation of this important distinction between ‘nominal’ and ‘effective’ protection among policymakers. So, while determining the sunset date and the time schedule of phased reduction of protection, the composite target variable to look at  should be the ‘effective protection’ granted to the infant industry, rather than the ‘nominal protection’. Of course, the instrument variables (the values of which the policymakers announce to the public) would still be the nominal tariffs and other nominal taxes and subsidies (like GST rates, income tax reliefs, subsidised interest rates etc). In addition, the exchange rate can be adjusted (with ‘managed floating’) to provide a uniform subsidy to all export industries, which many successful exporting countries like Japan, Korea and China have done.

20-11-2020||Right in the Middle||When the national bird appears||A tap-tapping outside my bedroom window awakened me from my afternoon nap. Thinking it was a woodpecker in the coconut palm outside, I jumped out of bed and rushed to the window, eagerly pulling the curtain open. What happened next startled me into yelping. There was an agitated squawk, a rush and swoosh of feathers as the peacock which had been pecking at the window sill, spread its wings and flew to a tree beyond our garden wall. We had both startled each other. Perhaps it was searching for dead moths or other insects on the window sill. the sudden opening of the curtain must have frightened a heart attack. The poor thing made loud honking alarm calls for quite some time going, “ troi, troi, troi” till its heartrate returned to normal. When I first came to live here in rural Karnataka decades ago, the house was in a Sylvan paradise. The area surrounding our compound was like a forest, thick with shrubs and trees and covered with undergrowth. For a city girl like me, it was nothing short of Eden. I saw new birds everyday. Birds that I had never set eyes on before. With the help of field guides, I began to identify the winged beauties and even maintained a journal where I noted down my birdwatching experiences. As years passed, houses began to crop up where there had been only wilderness. Since the area was no longer a safe habitat for the avian denizens, the number of species began to dwindle every year. Today, I see only about half the species I had recorded in past years. Interestingly, peafowl were never among the birds seen in yesteryears. They have become common only in the past two years or so. They are forest dwellers so their presence in domestic gardens only means that their natural habitat no longer exists. Today, I see them around my house throughout the day. They wander about in groups of hens and chicks, ever alert to rush away at the slightest sound. I can see them on rooftops, in trees and foraging on the ground. I feel both joy and sadness at the presence of this bird. Joy because it is so beautiful and sadness because cruel selfish man has destroyed its home. Losing its secure home with abundant food available, this bird is now forced to live in close proximity to man and survive as a scavenger.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/when-the-national-bird-appears-917666.html
20-11-2020||Second Edit||Online class isn’t all it is touted to be||A survey by the Azim Premji University (APU) reaffirms widely held apprehensions over the efficacy of education imparted to children online. The survey, which focused on schools catering to children from economically marginalised families, was conducted in five states, including Karnataka. It found that online education is ineffective and inadequate for the development of schoolchildren. Online education has been necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The need to maintain social distancing to avert infections has prevented children from attending school. Of the teachers surveyed, 80% said they were unable to establish an emotional connect with their students, while 90% pointed out that the online medium hindered meaningful assessment of students, the report, “Myths of Online Education,” said. Almost 70% of parents surveyed felt that online classes were ineffective in ensuring positive learning outcomes. Online education was all the more inadequate in teaching children with disabilities. The APU study also reaffirms that lack of access to internet connectivity, laptops or mobiles is preventing children from accessing education. The digital divide is deepening the learning divide. The APU survey emphasises the importance of the emotional connection between teacher and student for the latter’s development. It stresses the role that the human touch, one-to-one interaction and engagement in a school setting play in a child’s capacity to imbibe, reflect and learn. The survey indicates that both educators and parents are worried about the inadequacy of online education; around 90% of parents of government schoolchildren surveyed want to send their children back to school if adequate precautions are taken against the pandemic. India needs to step up efforts to improve the outcome of online education. In addition to improving internet connectivity and access to computers, training of teachers to impart online teaching is imperative. Tough decisions lie ahead. Inadequacy of online education calls for a reopening of schools, not just so that our children can imbibe faster and learn better but for their emotional and social wellbeing as well. However, unseemly haste could prove counter-productive, especially if we do not prepare well for re-opening. School managements must sit with health authorities to put in place the safest environment for children, whether inside the classroom or en route to school. We must bear in mind that children will be returning to school after months of being locked up inside their homes. They will forget the rules of social distancing and wearing masks and will need to be constantly reminded. A phased re-opening is the best way forward.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/online-class-isn-t-all-it-is-touted-to-be-917662.html
20-11-2020||South||Ahead of TN polls, DMK launches campaign to highlight 'AIADMK's misrule,' set tone for Stalin's electioneering||Tamil Nadu's principal Opposition, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, kicked-off a 75-day-long campaign on Friday that will take 15 senior leaders and speakers of the party across the state to “highlight 10 years of AIADMK's misrule” and to listen to people's grievances. Campaign Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural (Stalin's Voice Towards A New Dawn) was launched by Udhayanidhi Stalin—youth wing secretary and son of party chief M K Stalin—at Thirukuvalai, the birthplace of late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi, in Nagapattinam district in the Cauvery delta region. However, Udhayanidhi was detained by police for violating Covid-19 rules and was released later. Kanimozhi, secretary of DMK's women's wing, will launch her campaign from Edappadi, the home constituency of Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Salem district, on November 29.  Kanimozhi and Udhayanidhi will cover all 234 Assembly constituencies, while 13 others, some of whom are veteran DMK leaders, will cover 15 constituencies each during their tour. The DMK said the campaign, which will last for 75 days, will cover 15,000 kms, witness 1,500 meetings, 500 local events and 10 lakh direct interactions. The campaign has been devised in a way to set the tone for Stalin's electioneering, which is expected to begin in January. The DMK, which is occupying the Opposition benches in the Tamil Nadu Assembly since 2011, is leaving no stone unturned to win the Assembly elections due in the first half of 2021. Sources in the DMK told DH that the campaign will have eight ingredients that include leaders having their lunch at one of the houses in Samathuvapuram, a locality that houses people from all communities of the village; meeting a party veteran; street-corner meetings; visit to a historical place; and discussions with NGOs that work for the people. The main focus is to present a “charge sheet” against the AIADMK government and highlight the failures of the dispensation that is in power for the past 10 years, a senior leader said. “We will meet people in their villages and towns. Most of the meetings will be in an informal set-up. The main focus is to interact with people and get to know their problems and priorities. We will criticise the AIADMK and highlight their failures and at the same time we will also ask people to tell what they expect from us,” the leader added. Four of the five deputy general secretaries—K Ponmudi, I Periyasamy, Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan, and Anthiyur Selvaraj—MPs Tiruchi N Siva, Dr S Senthilkumar, and Thamizhachi Thangapandian, are some of the prominent leaders who are part of the campaign. The fifth deputy general secretary, A Raja, is likely to be made in-charge of a zone. The leaders will travel in a specially designed propaganda vehicle and distribute pamphlets that will speak in detail about the “failures of the AIADMK government,” another leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ahead-of-tn-polls-dmk-launches-campaign-to-highlight-aiadmks-misrule-set-tone-for-stalins-electioneering-917818.html

20-11-2020||South||Kerala gold smuggling: ED rejects Swapna Sureshs' claims; says it's digging deep||The Enforcement Directorate rejected the claims of coercion made in an audio clip purportedly by Kerala gold smuggling case "prime accused" Swapna Suresh and official sources said on Friday that the agency was digging deeper into the money laundering trail that involves a number of people. The central probe agency has also written to the Kerala Prisons Department seeking a probe into how the clip was recorded and circulated in violation of guidelines meant for the accused in jail. The sources said if the clip is true, it is a "serious breach" of legal procedures and aims at jeopardising the probe in a high-profile criminal case which has international ramifications. An online news portal is stated to have released a voice clip that is purportedly of Suresh, at present in judicial custody, who alleged the ED was putting pressure on her to give a statement against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The development has created a political stir in the state. The official sources said Suresh is a "prime accused" in the case and the allegations made in the clip of coercion by the ED to take certain names are "false and aimed to stall probe in the case". They added that the ED has not offered her to be made an approver in the case. The sources said the agency is "digging deep" into this money laundering case linked to gold smuggling and is looking to unravel the entire money trail that reached various people. Suresh has been questioned in this case and her statement recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) that has been duly signed by her. The entire proceeding has been done as per law, they said. A statement made by a person under section 50 of the PMLA is admissible in a court of law. The agency filed its first chargesheet or prosecution complaint in this case sometime back and has named Suresh and others in it. More such supplementary chargesheets are expected to be filed by the ED, including possible attachment of assets of the accused under the anti-money laundering law, they said. The state prisons department had already ordered a probe into the surfacing of the voice clip. In the clip, Suresh purportedly said investigative agencies tried to force her to take the name of Vijayan, which she refused to do. She was also asked to sign documents regarding her statement without being permitted to read them, it was alleged in the clip. South Zone Deputy Inspector General of Police Ajaykumar, entrusted with the probe into the audio clip incident, had visited the Attakulangra women prison in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday and told reporters that Suresh "had admitted that the voice in the clip was hers." "But, the recording was not made in the jail," the DIG had said. While the ruling CPI(M) has said that the alleged use of probe agencies "to target the chief minister" and the government was a very serious matter, Union Minister of State V Muraleedharan and the state Congress slammed the Left front government, alleging it was a "political plot" to divert attention from corruption charges ahead of the local body elections next month. The ED, the Customs Department and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are conducting separate probes into the alleged gold smuggling racket that was busted with the seizure of Rs 15 crore worth of the precious metal from the 'diplomatic baggage' of the UAE Consulate at the Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. Suresh, a former employee of the consulate, Vijayan's former principal secretary M Sivasankar and several others have been arrested in this case by the ED and other agencies. MoS Muraleedharan had alleged that the voice clip was planted by the chief minister's office and it was a conspiracy ahead of the local body polls to derail the probe reaching Vijayan's office. State Congress President Mullapally Ramachandran had said the audio clip was an attempt by the state government to wriggle out of the corruption charges being faced by it. The CPI(M), in a statement, had said "attempts" to force the accused to turn approver amounts to challenging the democracy and the law of the land. The ED, in its chargesheet filed last month before a special court in Ernakulam district, had named three accused -- Suresh, Sarith PS and Sandeep Nair. "The accused indulged in criminal activities and huge amount of proceeds of crime have been generated and they are possessing, concealing and using such proceeds of crime." "The chargesheet has been filed against them (with a prayer) for punishing the accused in accordance with the law for the offence of money laundering," the ED had the said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-gold-smuggling-ed-rejects-swapna-sureshs-claims-says-its-digging-deep-917879.html
20-11-2020||South||Kerala gold smuggling case: IAS officer Sivasankar moves Kerala High Court for bail in ED case||Suspended IAS officer M Sivasankar on Friday moved the Kerala High Court seeking bail in an Enforcement Directorate (ED) case related to money laundering charges in the gold smuggling racket. Sivasankar, arrested by the ED on October 28 and now in judicial custody, filed the bail petition two days after the Special Court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases here rejected his application for regular bail on November 17. Declining bail, special court Judge Kauser Edappagath had noted the investigation was at a crucial stage and the ED may require further time to collect all the materials, particularly related to the alleged nexus of the petitioner with the crime. In his plea in the high court, the bureaucrat alleged that false and frivolous allegations have been levelled to the effect that he accepted kickbacks from different agencies and the money kept in the locker of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the gold smuggling case, belonged to him. The prosecution could not produce any material to substantiate its charges against him, the former principal secretary to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan contended in his petition. Almost eight signed statements were recorded from Suresh in connection with the investigation of the PMLA case by the ED. In none of these statements, she implicated him or said he was aware of the gold smuggling, Sivasankar claimed. The ED could not connect him with the predicate offence (money laundering) and after the special court questioned it, the agency to justify his arrest obtained a ninth statement from Suresh implicating him, the officer charged. He alleged that the ED deviated from its main allegation and claimed that the money seized from the locker of Suresh was the kickbacks received from certain projects offered by the Kerala government in connection with the flood relief. "That shows that they deviated from their initial case of predicate offence as smuggling of gold", Sivasankar said. He also contended that the materials collected by the investigating agency was not enough to arrest him in terms of Section 19 of PMLA. "The respondent (ED) did not comply with the procedure prescribed in the PML Act to arrest the accused. Multiple checks by senior officers are contemplated in the act but the arrest order did not show that they have complied with the procedure prescribed," he submitted. The central agency, probing the money trail in the case, had earlier alleged that Suresh in a statement claimed that Sivasankar and his team in the CMO were fully aware of the smuggling of the precious metal through diplomatic channel. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold worth Rs 15 crore from a diplomatic baggage of the UAE Consulate at Thiruvananthapuram airport on July 5. The IAS officer was suspended after his links to Suresh, a former employee of the consulate, surfaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-ias-officer-sivasankar-moves-kerala-high-court-for-bail-in-ed-case-917936.html

On his Twitter handle, Stalin tagged the posts of his party's Rajya Sabha member P Wilson and that of CPI (M) Lok Sabha member Su Venkatesan, where they said they received replies from Home Minister Amit Shah and his colleague Nityanand Rai, respectively, in Hindi on different issues. அலுவல் மொழிச் சட்டத்தையே மீறுவதா? "Central Ministries that reply in Hindi to Tamil Nadu MPs Wilson and Venkatesan; responded in English after being condemned," he said. He wondered if the Official Languages Act was being followed. "I condemn this Hindi dominance sentiment of the BJP government," Stalin added. In his tweet, Wilson said when Stalin had asked all DMK MPs to write to Shah on the 7.5 per cent quota for government school students in medical education, "Honble Minister acknowledged my letter in Hindhi which I was unable to read and understand." "At my request, the Hon'ble Home Minister sent me his reply in English. I therefore request Hon'ble Parliamentary affairs minister @JoshiPralhad to inform all concerned to communicate to us in Tamil or English in future," he said. Venkatesan, CPI (M) MP from Madurai, said MoS (Home) Rai had written to him in Hindi while replying to a communication. The language issue has been raised by the DMK several times in recent months with the Dravidian party accusing the Centre of seeking to impose Hindi. Earlier, DMK MP Kanimozhi had accused a CISF personnel at the airport here of mocking her for not knowing Hindi.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-leader-m-k-stalin-slams-bjps-hindi-dominance-sentiments-917945.html

The actress and the prosecution approached the High Court alleging that a fair trial was being denied by the additional sessions court (special-CBI) in Kochi. The actress was abducted and sexually assaulted by a gang, in an act allegedly engaged by Dileep to settle personal scores, in February 2017 at Kochi. The gang allegedly shot the video of the assault. Dileep, who is an accused, was arrested in this connection in July 2017 and was granted bail in October. In the plea seeking shifting trial filed last month, the victim stated that she was being denied a fair trial. She also reportedly stated that even as she turned emotional during the trial the court did not interfere. The prosecution stated that victim often faced harassment during the trial and the court hardly controlled it. Around 20 lawyers representing the accused were present for examining the victim during the in-camera trial and the victim faced severe harassment. The HC rejected the plea citing that the victim or prosecution did not submit adequate evidence to substantiate their concerns. The court also directed that the trial should resume from Monday even as the prosecution sought a stay on trial for one more week for approaching the Supreme Court. The trial was earlier assigned to the CBI special court with a woman judge by the High Court considering the victim's plea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-high-court-rejects-actresss-plea-to-change-court-in-sexual-assault-case-917949.html

A day after the minister's arrest, B V Nagesh, who heads the Bengaluru-based Nagesh Consultants that designed the flyover, was also arrested by the Vigilance after being summoned to Kerala. Senior IAS officer Mohammed Hanish, who was managing director of Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala that initiated the flyover project was also arraigned as accused. On Friday, the Vigilance went a step ahead by arraigning four more middle and senior level officials of the Public Works Department who were involved in sanctioning payments of the work. Government sources said that the fresh moves, which is considered as a measure to resist allegations of political ploy behind the minister's arrest, has not gone down well with the officials. Former public works secretary T O Sooraj was earlier arrested in this case in August 2019. Meanwhile, the vigilance special court has directed that a medical board should be constituted to examine the health condition of Ebrahim Kunju. Kunju got hospitalised a day ahead of his arrest and he is still in hospital under judicial remand.

Adding a serious dimension to it, Chithralekha told a prominent news channel in a sting operation that she was being lured by the Popular Front of India with job and financial support to convert to Islam. Hailing from Edat near Payyanur, a citadel of CPM in Kannur, Chithralekha even faced attacks, allegedly from local CPM cadres. Her fight against discrimination grabbed attention in 2005 following resistance towards her decision to eke out a living by riding an autorickshaw. She had alleged that a section of CPM and CITU workers were unhappy with her for entering a male-dominated job. Even her autorickshaw was burnt. As the alleged discrimination continued, she even staged a stir that lasted for months. The Congress-led government in Kerala offered her financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh and land for house in Kannur district in 2015. But the CPM government that succeeded allegedly tried to sabotage the decision. British scriptwriter Fraser Scott visited her in 2018 for filming her fight against discrimination. A documentary on her fight was also released prior to that. Noted filmmaker Shekhar Kapur also hailed Chithralekha's fight. Following the channel sting operation, in which she said that she was being lured by PFI to convert to Islam with offers of job and financial support, Chithralekha made a social media post stating that she was planning to convert to Islam, and not any organisation. She also said that not only Popular Front, but many others, including former Chief Minister and Congress leader Oommen Chandy, supported and helped her. Meanwhile, Kannur CPM district secretary M V Jayarajan told DH that the party was considering the fresh statements only as an election stunt. Earlier also during elections she used to come up with such statements. Converting to Islam or any other faith was individual's freedoms. The allegations of discrimination and burning autorickshaw were all past things, he said. While PFI local leaders denied the allegations that Chithralekha was being lured to join Islam, Chithralekha stated in a fresh post that Hindu Aikya Devi workers were not demanding her not to convert.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-dalit-auto-drivers-plans-to-convert-to-islam-triggers-row-917964.html

Sources said the meeting discussed the strategy to be adopted during the 2021 elections, while alliance issues also came up for deliberations. The meeting was attended by newly-appointed zonal in-charges, ministers, and district secretaries. They said the meeting resolved to work for the party's victory in the Assembly elections. The meeting assumes significance as it comes a day before Shah's visit to Chennai. At the meeting, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, who patched up recently after a tug-of-war on the Chief Ministerial nominee, also introduced the newly-appointed zonal coordinators to district secretaries and seeking their cooperation. The AIADMK government will roll out a red-carpet welcome for Shah at the airport. After attending a government function, Shah will meet BJP leaders at a five-star hotel. AIADMK entered into a formal electoral alliance with the BJP in 2019 after a gap of 15 years and both parties are likely to continue with their tie-up for the 2021 Assembly elections. For the AIADMK, which has had a roller-coaster ride ever since its leader J Jayalalithaa died in 2016, the Assembly elections in 2021 is the most crucial in recent years. Facing 10 years of anti-incumbency, the party is making every effort to put up a tough fight against a resurgent DMK, whose alliance swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and has divided the states, for its convenience, into zones for better coordination.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-leaders-meet-on-eve-of-amit-shahs-visit-917981.html

Telangana BJP unit president Bandi Sanjay Kumar stated this following a 'letter' allegedly written by him to the Election Commission, asking that it be stopped. He said Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao had alleged that distribution of financial aid had to be stopped following a letter written by him (Kumar) to the EC, asking that the exercise be put on hold. Kumar, a Lok Sabha member, said the charge had hurt him as he had never written to the EC. "The letter bore my forged signature and was on an illegal BJP letterhead," he said. Kumar, who visited the Bhagyalakshmi temple at Charminar area here, had earlier challenged the Chief Minister to also come to the shrine and respond to the matter. The BJP leader said he hoped Rao would announce a probe into the issue and take action against those who put it out. Kumar said he visited the temple to explain the facts to the people. The BJP leader said that if the state government was sincere, it should have held the GHMC elections after completing the distribution of financial assistance. Kumar assured that if BJP wins the post of Mayor in the polls, the party would provide Rs 25,000 to each affected family. Tight security arrangements were made during the visit of Kumar to the temple. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls are scheduled to be held on December 1. The BJP and TRS have been engaged in a war of words, especially in the context of the recent bypoll to Dubbak Assembly segment, which the former won.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-flays-false-campaign-by-trs-over-financial-aid-disbursement-to-flood-affected-people-917990.html

In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, KCR said that at present, all such exams for recruitment to posts in central government, central PSUs, Indian Railways, defence services, nationalised banks etc. are held in only two languages i.e., Hindi and English. “Students who do not study in English medium or those who are not from Hindi speaking states face serious disadvantage in these competitive exams,” KCR said. The chief minister requested that candidates should be permitted to write all competitive exams in the regional languages also for recruitment in government of India, its departments and undertakings through the UPSC and all other agencies like Railway Recruitment Boards, public sector banks, RBI, Staff Selection Commissions. “(This is) in order to provide equal and fair opportunity to the students from all states of India,” KCR said in his letter dated 18 November. On the same day, addressing his TRS party men in preparation of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls scheduled on 1 December, KCR alleged that the BJP led NDA government was willfully weakening the PSUs established by the first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, “and withdrawing investments to hand them over to the corporate companies.” “Modi, who claims to have sold tea on railway platforms in his childhood, is selling the railways now,” KCR said launching a direct attack on Modi. KCR's letter related to jobs comes at a time when the BJP is mounting an attack on his TRS government alleging failure in providing jobs to the state's youth.

On the yatra, for which the government has denied permission citing Covid-19, Srinivasan said it was carried out not only to strengthen the BJP, but also the Tamil culture among the people of the state. State party president L Murugan will take out the yatra in Coimbatore on Sunday, Vanathi said.

On Wednesday, the state election commission, which conducts the municipal polls, asked the TRS government to halt the distribution of the relief “likely to influence the electors” till the results are declared on 4 December. While the TRS leaders claimed the decision was based on the opposition party's representation, a letter questionably written by Bandi to the election commissioner asking to stop the “enticement” was circulated on social media. Bandi alleged that the letter was created at Rao's behest to target him. He also approached the police complaining the letter was fake, and forgery of his signature. On Friday, Bandi, along with party cadres, visited the Bhagyalakshmi temple at Charminar in the old city. The Karimnagar Lok Sabha MP had demanded Rao “to prove his claims at the temple, “if he is a true Hindu” or else apologise.

In a controversial remark, BJP Telangana chief Bandi Sanjay branded Rao as a traitor and suggested that the intelligence agencies should keep an eye on his activities. The Karimnagar MP said that he suspects “Rao's connections with terrorists since he hobnobs with the AIMIM.” TRS leaders like Energy Minister Jagadish Reddy objected to Bandi's remarks and warned of legal action. Municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao reacted, tweeting, “Making baseless comments that the honourable CM has links to terrorist outfits is stooping to a new low and most reprehensible rhetoric.” The BJP appears unperturbed. The party which could win only four out of the 150 Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation wards in 2016 is now bullish with the recent victory in Dubbaka. It has now set its sight on the Hyderabad polls to consolidate its strengths and target the 2023 Assembly elections in the state. The BJP has been repeatedly referring to “the TRS-AIMIM political affinity” in its apparent attempt to unify the Hindu votes in the city. Bandi had asked Rao to prove his Hindu credentials at the Bhagyalakshmi temple contiguous with the iconic Charminar in the old city area, close to the Mecca Masjid. To prove their point, BJP leaders refer to the meeting between Hyderabad MP Owaisi and CM Rao, days ahead of the GHMC polls notification. TRS had won 99 and AIMIM 44 wards in the previous polls, which was seen as a friendly contest between the two parties. On Thursday, Rama Rao clarified that “the AIMIM and TRS are not friends and there is no election alliance between the two.” CM Rao's son who also holds the IT, investments portfolio, alleged that some forces are conspiring for communal disturbances in Hyderabad but the TRS government would not let the peaceful city's image suffer. “We will deal with the law and order disturbers with an iron hand,” he said while speaking to reporters. The BJP on Friday received support from actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan, who earlier announced Janasena Party's foray into the GHMC elections. Kalyan said that JSP is withdrawing plans to field its candidates and would support the BJP wholeheartedly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hyderabad-municipal-polls-bjp-targets-cm-rao-trs-aimim-affinity-to-consolidate-its-core-base-vote-918063.html

"... Whatever judgement is there... conditions in the judgement, as well as regarding fine and punishment, and the prison norms will decide (the release)," he said in response to a question from reporters here on Sasikala's release. "Everything will be as per law only, nothing else," he said. A fine of over Rs 10 crore imposed on Sasikala was remitted to the 34th City Civil Court, Bengaluru, by way of demand drafts, her counsel N Raja Senthoor Pandian had said on Wednesday, as he expected her to be set free soon, earlier than the scheduled release date of January 27, 2021. Sasikala and her two relatives are undergoing simple imprisonment of four years in the assets case in the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail. In 2017, after the Supreme Court restored the Bengaluru trial court judgment in toto against Sasikala and her two relatives, V N Sudhakaran and J Elavarasi in the assets case, Sasikala surrendered before the Karnataka court on February 15, 2017 and she has been serving her sentence since then. With the death of Jayalalithaa in December 2016, the appeal against her by Karnataka stood abated. The trial court had in 2014 convicted Jayalalithaa and three others (including Sasikala) on charges, including corruption and criminal conspiracy, 18-years after the disproportionate assets case was filed against her. With Tamil Nadu assembly polls due early next year, Sasikala's release from jail is seen with political significance there.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sasikalas-release-from-jail-will-be-as-per-court-orders-prison-norms-basavaraj-bommai-918098.html

We are setting a deadline till November 30. He should withdraw it by then, failing which the bandh will be observed throughout Karnataka on December 5," Nagaraj said. Activists will lay siege to KSRTC bus stands and prevent buses from plying during the bandh, he said.  Though Nagaraj had announced the December 5 bandh earlier this week, prominent outfits such as the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike had delayed their decision until the meeting held on Friday where they came on board. Groups representing cab and auto drivers, street vendors and hotels have said they will support the bandh. It is not yet clear if they will stop operations on December 5.  Pro-Kannada groups have been up in arms ever since the government decided to set up the MDC on November 13. The MDC was widely seen as the BJP’s move to woo the Maratha community that forms a significant voter base in the Basavakalyan assembly constituency, which is due for a bypoll.  On Wednesday, Yediyurappa had warned pro-Kannada groups against forcing a bandh on the people of the state, arguing that the bandh was unnecessary. He said the government would take strict action. Yediyurappa has defended the MDC saying it had nothing to do with the Marathi language, and that the government’s sole aim was to ensure the development of the community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/december-5-karnataka-bandh-against-maratha-body-on-as-pro-kannada-groups-set-deadline-917929.html

"Karnataka's digital economy is already worth $52 billion (Rs 3.85 lakh crore). Over the next five years, we are looking at achieving $300 billion business from the IT/ITeS sectors. The government has initiated several measures to achieve this target," Narayan said on Thursday at the inaugural session of the 23rd Bengaluru Tech Summit. He said the government is encouraging investors to go beyond Bengaluru and look at Tier-2/3 cities, which he said will contribute substantially towards achieving this target. In due course, the state will also become a $1 trillion economy and contribute significantly towards achieving Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025, Narayan said. To achieve these targets, the state government has set up the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDM). The KDEM will help in accelerating the digital economy goals, the minister said. Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said the state is looking at garnering 50% share of the national bio-economy, which is targeted to reach $100 billion (Rs 7.42 lakh crore) by 2025.  "Karnataka has been at the national forefront in harnessing the benefits of biotechnology for the past two decades," he said. "We are keen on making Karnataka the most attractive destination for investment, particularly for high-end technologies," Yediyurappa said. The Chief Minister said his government had taken a number of steps to enhance the overall business environment and cited "amendments to labour and land laws, establishment of Karnataka Digital Economy Mission, Karnataka Innovation Authority" as some of the major steps taken in this direction. As is evident from the newly released IT policy of Karnataka, the government is taking further steps to vigorously push IT beyond Bengaluru, aiming to generate over 6 million direct and indirect jobs in the next five years, he said.  Narayan said several initiatives like KDM and Go Beyond Bengaluru will also help the state to achieve the target of $150 billion in IT exports in the next five years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/tier-2-3-cities-will-drive-300-bn-it-dream-karnataka-dy-cm-ashwath-narayan-917670.html
20-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka gets approval for for reforms-linked borrowing||Karnataka has secured the Union Commerce Ministry’s approval for additional borrowing after the state government showcased over three dozen “ease of doing business” reforms, which include property registration, permission to start schools and other such procedures that have gone online.  The commerce ministry has recommended to the finance ministry to allow additional borrowing for the state.  With this, Karnataka can borrow an additional 0.25% of its gross state domestic product (GSDP). The state’s GSDP is Rs 16.52 lakh crore. On that, 0.25% will work out to Rs 4,131.6 crore that the state can now borrow.  “We are among the first Indian states to have received the nod for additional borrowing for having implemented reforms,” Commissioner for Industrial Development Gunjan Krishna told DH.  The “ease of doing business” reforms largely involve making services available online. It also includes computerising the inspection of factories, which will now happen at random to prevent harassment or nepotism. Also, trade licences will be renewed automatically obviating the need to run from pillar to post. “We are one of the fastest in the country to implement the reforms, which involved changes in services offered at various departments and at the district level,” Krishna said. Karnataka has also executed the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ initiative, according to Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) I S N Prasad. This single reform would allow the state to borrow another 0.25% of its GSDP. This is another Rs 4,131.6 crore. Reforms to augment revenues of urban local bodies are under progress, while the state government is said to be wary of taking up some reforms in the power sector fearing a backlash.  To help states tide over the economic crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre relaxed the limit of borrowing from 3% of GSDP to 5%. This allowed Karnataka to borrow Rs 82,621.6 crore. Of the additional 2%, the Centre allowed additional borrowing up to 0.5% and another 0.5% for having chosen the Centre’s first option on GST shortfall compensation. The other 1% was tied to sectoral reforms, which Karnataka claims to have achieved.   The Covid-induced economic crisis hit Karnataka hard as revenue streams dried up due to the lockdown. The B S Yediyurappa administration is not shying away from raising loans to fund development.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-gets-approval-for-for-reforms-linked-borrowing-917671.html

Similar to Karnataka One and Bangalore One, the GramaOne centres will be a one-stop shop for all citizen services at the village level. While the government launched these centres on a pilot basis across 100 villages in Davanagere district, it plans to eventually expand them to every village in the state. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, who launched the pilot project, said the centres will ensure that citizens don’t have to visit government offices. Nor will they fall prey to middlemen.  According to officials at the Centre for e-Governance, each GramaOne centre will act as a service delivery centre for Seva Sindhu and Sakala services. Citizens will also be able to submit RTI applications at the centres. An operator at the centre will help people to submit their applications for a stipulated fee. The applications will be submitted online to the department concerned. The applicants will receive a notification on their mobile phone indicating the status. Once it’s processed, they will be able to collect the certificate. Speaking to DH, Sindhu B Roopesh, Director, Directorate of Electronic Delivery of Citizen Services (EDCS), explained that people had to visit the nearest Hobli centres for government services such as caste certificate. With GramaOne, all the work can be done at the village level itself. Based on the pilot project, the government would take stock of the services that were in demand and also examine the viability before expanding them across the state, the official added. Apart from regular services of obtaining various identity cards and payment of bills, these centres will also serve as a platform for registration for skill development training for youth. Besides, information pertaining to the price of crops at different APMCs will also be displayed through an LED screen. Wi-Fi and video conferencing too will be provided, apart from availability of a digital library where citizens can access books and newspapers, officials in the e-governance department told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/gramaone-brings-karnataka-govt-services-under-a-roof-in-rural-areas-917673.html

The former Karnataka Minister, who is in-charge of party affairs in Maharashtra, Goa and poll-bound Tamil Nadu, said a law banning cow slaughter would be passed in the upcoming Assembly session. "Cow Slaughter Ban will be a reality in Karnataka in the near future. I have asked Animal Husbandry Minister Sri @PrabhuChavanBJP to get "The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter & Preservation of Cattle Bill" passed in the Cabinet and present the same in the upcoming Assembly Session," the Chikkamagaluru MLA tweeted. Cow Slaughter Ban will be a reality in Karnataka in the near future. Ravi had also said earlier this month that on the lines of Allahabad High Court's order, Karnataka would enact a law banning religious conversions for the sake of marriage. "We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of our sisters," he had said, adding, anyone involved in any act of conversion shall face severe and swift punishment. The Allahabad High Court in its order on October 31 said that religious conversion just for the sake of marriage was not valid. The court made the remark while dismissing a plea by a newly married couple in Uttar Pradesh that had approached it to direct police and the woman's father not to disturb their marital life. In the petition, it was stated that the couple got married in July this year, but family members of the woman were interfering in their marital life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/cow-slaughter-ban-will-soon-be-a-reality-in-karnataka-bjp-leader-c-t-ravi-917812.html
20-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Despite warning, Kannada outfits to stage bandh opposing Maratha board move||Despite government warnings, pro-Kannada organisations on Friday decided to go ahead with the Karnataka Bandh on December 5 in protest against the formation of the Maratha Development Authority (MDA). Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had on November 13 announced setting up the MDA, earmarking Rs 50 crore for the overall development of the Maratha population in the state. The move was seen in some quarters as an attempt to woo the sizeable community members in Basavakalyan Assembly segment in Bidar district in north Karnataka and Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency bordering Maharashtra where by-elections are due. The decision has not gone down well with several pro-Kannada organisations. The consortium of the pro-Kannada organisations such as Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha (KCVP) and Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (Shivarame Gowda faction) passed a resolution opposing the government move and deciding to stage the bandh. The Ola-Uber Drivers and Owners Association to has extended its support to the bandh. In a statement, KCVP chief Vatal Nagaraj claimed support of the former chief of the Kannada Development Authority Mukhyamantri Chandru and former head of the Kannada Film Chamber of Commerce, Sa Ra Govindu, among others, for the consortium. However, two other factions of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike belonging to T A Narayana Gowda and Praveen Shetty have said they would take a call only after discussing with their leaders. As the matter snowballed into a controversy after his announcement, Yediyurappa clarified that he was only setting up the Maratha Development Authority and not the Marathi Development Authority. He stated that Maratha community members are "staunch Hindutvavadis", many of whom need to be elevated socially and economically. The Chief Minister had warned that he would not allow any 'forced bandh' on Dec. 5. "We will take strict action if the forced bandh is called," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/despite-warning-kannada-outfits-to-stage-bandh-opposing-maratha-board-move-917848.html

In a virtual discussion with UK’s Minister of State at the Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office Tariq Ahmed, Yediyurappa said Karnataka was also keen on a collaboration for wastewater treatment, solid waste management, animation, gaming and other areas. “Karnataka is blessed with a huge potential of wind and solar power. Already, the state has around 62% of renewable energy sources meeting the demand,” Yediyurappa said. “On this renewable energy front, we want to engage with the UK in forecasting, scheduling and grid management with ancillary solutions,” he added. Yediyurappa told Ahmed that Karnataka had prepared action plans to improve the environmental quality in industrial areas. “We’d like to discuss (with you) wastewater treatment, reuse technologies and scientific solid waste management,” he said. Besides suggesting collaborations in the areas of animation and gaming, Yediyurappa pitched for a tie-up with the UK on AI and regulatory sandboxes. The UK minister, who is the Baron Ahmed of Wimbledon, said the time was right to create a world that is greener, cleaner and more sustainable. “We want to work even more closely with India to mobilise global action at COP26, because we both lead by example,” he said, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office quoting him. British Deputy High Commissioner to Karnataka and Kerala, Jeremy Pilmore-Bedford, said the collaboration of startups and companies from the UK and India “will be key to address climate change issues and secure the future of the planet for generations to come.” According to Yediyurappa, Karnataka is home to the second-largest number of UK-educated Indians in India. “Karnataka has been widely referred to as one of the fastest growing tech hubs in the world,” he told Ahmed||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-bats-for-renewable-energy-tie-up-with-uk-917968.html
20-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Bills in Karnataka likely against cow slaughter, 'love jihad' as a push for BJP's Hindutva agenda||The BJP government is likely to table bills to prohibit cow slaughter and religious conversions for marriage (also termed as love jihad) in the upcoming winter session of the legislature, in what will be seen as a push for the party's Hindutva agenda in Karnataka. "Cow slaughter ban will be a reality in Karnataka in the near future," BJP national General Secretary C T Ravi said in a tweet. Ravi said he had spoken to Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chauhan on getting the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter & Preservation of Cattle Bill passed in the Cabinet and table it in the upcoming Assembly session that starts December 7. Ban on cow slaughter was BJP's poll promise in its 2018 Karnataka election manifesto. The Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964, which is in force now, permits slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes if they are above 12 years or if they are unfit for breeding or if the buffaloes don't yield milk. The BJP government's proposed Bill seeks to impose a blanket ban on slaughter of cattle and consumption of beef, while also prescribing penalty for violations. In fact, the BJP had introduced this Bill in 2010 during B S Yediyurappa's earlier stint as  chief minister. While the 2010 Bill failed to get Presidential nod, the government changed hands and in 2013 and the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government withdrew the Bill and retained the 1964 Act. Revenue Minister R Ashoka told reporters that the government would also legislate a law against 'love jihad'. "The government has taken a clear stand against love jihad. During discussions held with the CM, it was decided to ban love jihad and punish those behind it. The government has decided to come up with a law and will definitely implement it," he said. The conversion of women is "detrimental to Indian culture" and needs to be stopped, Ashoka said. Yediyurappa himself has publicly vowed to put an end to religious conversions in the name of marriage.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bills-in-karnataka-likely-against-cow-slaughter-love-jihad-as-a-push-for-bjps-hindutva-agenda-917980.html

A white paper on the economic scenario in the state released by the CII on Friday has also expressed concern about the dip in Goods and Services Tax collection and the slipping of the state in the ease of doing business rankings to 24. “Goa is in urgent need for economic re-imagination. Traditional industries like tourism and mining are at a standstill and new industrial investment is slowing. As per our research records, there were only six new MSME units with an investment of over 5 crores rupees employing more than 25 people, in the last decade registered in Goa,” the white paper said. “If we were to use GST collections as a barometer for economic recovery from the Covid crisis, September 2020 saw a rise in total GST collections in the country - a first in 7 months. However, Goa’s collection was down 23 per cent. Further, the latest ease of doing business rankings (EoDB) has seen Goa’s rank dip further to 24 among 29 states. For a state with a manageable size and a highly educated population there is much scope for improvement,” it added. The state was ranked 19 in the ease of doing business ranking before it plummeted down the rankings earlier this year. According to a survey which accompanied the CII's white paper in the financial year, the expected decline among businesses for the current and forthcoming financial year has been pegged at 72% and 25% respectively. "32% of respondents are going to face a revenue decline up to 20%, while 25% are going to face a decline of more than 50% in their revenue for FY21. 5% of respondents fear going out of business in FY2," according to the survey's findings, which also states that 67% of the respondents from the IT and hospitality sectors fear more layoffs in the coming year if the economy slips further. The survey has also tapped into an overwhelming demand by entrepreneurs for a single-window system of government clearances. “97% of respondents seek implementation of a single-window online platform. 90% of respondents are confident that responsiveness of government offices should improve along with service delivery act, while 87% want the availability of better credit to reduce revival time,” the survey said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-economy-slipping-in-urgent-need-for-re-imagination-cii-917987.html

Replying to a question that the government didn't do anything to control the crowd during Diwali vacation leading to a rise in the infection, Patel responded: "There was not much crowding anywhere. We are seeing an increase of barely 100 cases per day compared to other states like Delhi." However, a notification issued by Ahmedabad collector's office stated that "to contain the virus from spreading in view of large gatherings in the market during the festivities and arrival of winter, the curfew is being imposed in the public interest under section 144 of code of criminal procedure (CrPC) 1973." This section authorises the executive magistrate to issue orders prohibiting assembly of four or more people in an area.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-announces-night-curfew-in-four-cities-to-curb-covid-19-spread-918026.html

He expressed confidence that the NCP would win more seats than the lone one (Churchill Alemao from Benaulim) which it managed in the 2017 polls. "We are in alliance with the Congress in Maharashtra. If there is respectful seat sharing here too, we don't mind having an alliance with the Congress for the 2022 Assembly polls," he said. The NCP would open a state office on November 22 and also hold a rally in Azad Maidan in Panaji on Monday, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/wont-mind-alliance-with-cong-for-2022-goa-polls-ncp-leader-918089.html
