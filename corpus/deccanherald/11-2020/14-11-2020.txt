14-11-2020||In Perspective||Can Church serve both God and mammon?||“You cannot serve both God and mammon." These are the prophetic words of Jesus Christ in the famous ‘Sermon on the Mount’ that encapsulates the central tenets of Christian discipleship. This emphatic exhortation of Christ has been long forgotten by the Church, if one looks objectively at the way it functions today.  Who or what is mammon? Mammon has a Latin etymology. It is a term used to mean money, the greed for money, and the debasing influence of material wealth. Christ was always on the side of the poor and the dispossessed, whereas Church today is unabashedly on the side of the rich and the powerful. The quintessential teaching of the master is all but forgotten by the self-anointed custodians of the faith. Suffering and sacrifice are no more worthy options in Church life. Serving the poor and the downtrodden is on the backburner and is just cosmetic in nature. The Church today is immersed in the creation and worship of wealth. There are noble exceptions here and there, but the general trend is one in which money plays a significant, if not central, role. There have been reports of financial malfeasance involving different denominational churches in recent times. There was even an aborted move by the present government in Kerala to enact a law to make churches financially accountable to the government from time to time. The result -- all the churches united and rose in protest, exhibiting a rare sense of unity and solidarity. Why are churches reluctant to be transparent?   Another shocking report is about a recently established church in Kerala with a modern medical college under its aegis being raided by the Income Tax department, unearthing several millions in hard currency stashed away in cellars, unused cars parked in their warehouse, etc. This church has been in the news more than once for alleged foreign exchange violations and ownership of lands and estates in various parts of the country.   Magnificent churches and priestly extravagance are a visible manifestation of the new generation leadership’s misplaced priority. ‘Mission’ is a word still used but it sounds hollow in reality. Bishops travelling in opulent cars is a common sight. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw a Bishop boarding his official ambassador car after we attended a function together. I am told that his successor has chosen to retain the same car.  The exemplary conduct of these Bishops is praiseworthy, but not emulated. Christ’s mission is abundantly clear, and so the Church has a ready ‘manual’ available. The manual is in the form of the gospel where Christ’s invocations are stated in unambiguous terms. Service to the poor is equated to worship of God. ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” (St Matthew 25:40). Is the Church today practising this covenant with the Master? Greed for others’ wealth, or covetousness, is condemned in the Bible. Churches are obsessed with amassing wealth, and raising funds for different causes, chiefly to construct buildings. Then, there are instances of alleged misappropriation and unauthorised use of Church property and funds. Let me cite two clear instances to show how far removed the Church is from the avowed principles of a true Christian life and witness. A classic case is what is happening in the Orthodox Church in Kerala. They are poised to annex all the Jacobite churches, their erstwhile fellow-believers, on the basis of a court judgement. Be that as it may, can’t they give up the claim and be magnanimous enough to not grab what’s not theirs? If they do so, the decades-old, expensive court battle and the resultant bitterness and enmity will all come to a pleasant closure. Why can’t the Orthodox leadership see this God-sent opportunity and rise to the occasion?   The second example is about Church’s role in education. Christian institutions undeniably have played a stellar role in shaping modern India through their schools and colleges. The missionaries of yore reached the remotest parts of the country and spread the light of learning. Even to this day, they are a byword for quality education. People of all religious backgrounds seek to educate their children in Christian schools and colleges for this very reason. It’s all very well, but the crux of the matter is whether this distinctive role is played responsibly by the Church today. We hear about many institutions that take advantage of their reputation and demand capitation fee for admissions. They also extract money for job appointments. These are not compatible with Christian ethos. If Christian values of truth and charity are to be imparted to the students who study in these institutions, these corrupt practices have to be stopped.    The Church can reclaim its pristine glory only if it comes away from its propensity to serve mammon. The sooner it happens, the better.

14-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||With no funds, Santwana Kendras now in distress||The Government has failed to release grant for maintenance of Santwana Kendras, run under the Women and Child Development department, across the state this fiscal year. With the objective of rehabilitating women in distress, Santwana Kendras were launched during 2001-02. In the past two decades, Santwana Kendras have been providing temporary shelter, education, legal and financial aid to hundreds of women, who are victims of domestic and sexual violence. Besides offering protection to the victims, the Kendras provide training in order to help these women lead a dignified life in society. Dakshina Kannada district has five Santwana Kendras run by four NGOs. There are nearly 187 such Kendras across the state. Each Santwana Kendra has one counselor and three social workers who work round-the-clock counseling the women victims. Jana Shikshana Trust (JST) Director and MGNREGS former ombudsman Sheena Shetty wrote to Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on how the failure to release grants for 2020-21 had stalled maintenance of Kendras and payment of honorarium to the staff. On average, Santwana Kendra in Puttur receives 50 calls in a month, seeking guidance and help from the aggrieved. While the center in Bantwal receives 80 to 100 calls in a month. ‘Release grant’ On a humanitarian basis, the grant should be released at the earliest to ensure the smooth functioning of the Kendras. Trust Director Krishna Moolya, in a letter to ZP CEO, stated that the Trust had been running the Santwana Kendras in Bantwal and Puttur. Owing to the failure in releasing the first installment of the grant for 2020-21, the staff did not get an honorarium. The staff of the centres are dependent on the honorarium for their livelihood and have been facing a lot of problems without the money. According to the officials from Women and Child Development, “The government has not released the grants for the year. The issue has already been brought to the notice of the higher authorities.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/with-no-funds-santwana-kendras-now-in-distress-915425.html

DYFI State President Muneer Katipalla condemned the decision of authorities and said that the proposal to hand over the land for the seafood park should be withdrawn and should be reserved for the medical college. Citing the reason for the non-availability of land near Wenlock Hospital, the government had dilly-dallied on the decision to set up a government medical college all these years, he added. Dr Rohinaksha Shirlalu of Puttur also urged the authorities not to divert the land identified for the government medical college. The Village Accountant (VA) of Bannur in a public notice has declared that land will be handed over for setting up of the seafood park. Any objections from the public should be submitted to the VA office in Bannur within seven days. Dr Rohinaksha said Puttur was being considered as a district centre in the future and the town is already also an educational hub. Having realised that the district has no government medical college, 40 acres of land was identified in Puttur. "The district in-charge minister, Puttur MLA and district administration should reconsider its decision. Alternative land should be identified for the seafood park,” he said on behalf of the residents of Puttur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/diversion-of-land-for-sea-food-park-opposed-in-puttur-915434.html

The video of Simha commenting on Sumalatha, during the inspection of Mysuru-Bengaluru Highway widening work, had gone viral. In the video, Simha, speaking to a person over mobile phone, says, “She will not let others to work and she will also not work. If you need any support come to me.” Members Ambareesh Abhimanigala Sangha have warned Simha not to make loose comments either against Ambareesh or Sumalatha. “The statement shows Simha’s mindset. Being a MP, he should not make such statements. In an attempt to protect a corrupt employee, the MP has blamed Sumalatha,” they alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mp-criticised-for-his-comments-against-sumalatha-915641.html
14-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Divine Art: His creation is the centre of attraction in Dasara||Anything that is related to Mysuru is, either directly or indirectly, related to the Wadiyars, the Mysuru Palace or Dasara. This year, among 65 recipients of Kannada Rajyothsava Award, there are four persons from Mysuru district -- C Maheshwaran (Media), Dr A S Chandrashekar (Yoga), Puttasiddaiah (Education) and N S Janardhana Murthy (Sculpture). While Dasara concluded with the Jamboo Savari on October 26, Rajyothsava awards were announced on October 28 and presented on November 1. Incidentally, Dasara and the award had a connection through Janardhana Murthy. The idol of Sri Chamundeshwari, taken out in a procession in the golden howdah, carried by elephant, during Jamboo Savari, the last leg of Dasara, is sculpted by Janardhana Murthy. It is the same idol, which is used for inauguration of the annual Dasara celebrations, atop the Chamundi Hill. With the evolution of royal Dasara into people’s Dasara or 'Naada Habba', the idol of Sri Chamundeshwari has assumed significance. Earlier, the Wadiyar kings used to travel in the golden howdah during the Jamboo Savari. Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, the last ruler of the erstwhile Mysuru state, conducted his last Dasara in public, in 1969. In 1970, Kannada activist and writer Na Nagalingaswamy of Kannada Kranthidala, along with Nagabushan Tiwari, P V Nanjaraja Urs and others organised private Dasara and took out a procession of an idol of Sri Chamundeshwari made of sandalwood, on a wooden howdah, carried by an elephant. It was a repeat in 1971, with more support by the late MLA D Jayadevaraja Urs, industrialist F K Irani, and the late president of Mysuru Municipal Council B C Lingaiah. The committee was later expanded to include Sahukar Thimmaiah, Subba Rao, R Vasudeva Murthy, Subramanyaraje Urs (Chaduranga) and others. In 1975, Jayadevaraja Urs, then MLC, prevailed upon chief minister D Devaraja Urs to support them to conduct Dasara. The golden howdah was borrowed from the Mysuru Palace, then head by Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, for Jamboo Savari. There was an image of Bharat Matha in an open jeep, behind the elephant. In 1976, an idol of Chamundeshwari was ordered to be made. It was in Chola style. Janardhana Murthy, the 1949 born sculptor said, “In 1987, I received an order to sculpt the idol of Sri Chamundeshwari from H N K Gowda, a patron. I completed the work in 1989 in Hoysala style, under the guidance of my father N P Srinivasachar. Since 1990, it is used for the Jamboo Savari. Rest of the time, it is placed in a mantapa in the Gombe Thotti of the Mysuru Palace, where daily puja is offered to it.” It has to be noted that then president R Venkatraman launched the Jamboo Savari in 1990. Murthy said, "Even though his three sons have learnt the art of sculpting, they are not into it for a livelihood. The Rajyothsava award is a honour to the art. My grandchildren are still too young. They observe me at work. If they show interest, I wish to teach them, so that they can carry forward the legacy.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/divine-art-his-creation-is-the-centre-of-attraction-in-dasara-915642.html
14-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||GPs bordering Mysuru to be upgraded||The state Cabinet has approved a long-pending demand of upgrading a few Gram Panchayats (GP), adjoining Mysuru city, to municipalities. Thus, the villages bordering the city are likely to witness fast and sustainable growth.   Four GPs -- Hinkal, Koorgalli, Belvadi and Hootagalli -- under Chamudeshwari Assembly segment, will be upgraded as Hootagalli City Municipal Councils (CMC). Similarly, Bogadi, Srirampura, Kadkola and Ramnahalli GPs will be upgraded to Town Panchayats. Bogadi Town Panchayat will include Bogadi, Maratikyathanahalli, Dasanakoppal, Ganigarahundi, K Hemmanahalli, Sahukarhundi, Kergalli, Basavanapura and Badagalahundi. Srirampura Town Panchayat will comprise Srirampura, Mahadevapura, Ramabai Nagar, Gururu, Kalalavadi, Koppaluru, Lingambudi Palaya and Parasayyanahundi. Kadakola and Hosahundi Gram Panchayats will be brought under Kadakola Town Panchayat limits. Rammanahalli Town Panchayat will have Rammanahalli, Kalisiddanahundi, Hanchya, Sathagalli, Bharathnagar and Alanahalli, Nadanahalli and other areas outside the Outer Ring Road. According to MLA G T Devegowda, upgrading the GPs was possible because of the continuous efforts and owing to the cooperation of the officials concerned. The GPs adjoining to the city generate more revenue and the areas can be developed, using the revenue. The government and the officials must concentrate on these villages for the development. There is a need to ensure basic facilities like street lights, drinking water and roads. Devegowda thanked Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj and District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar for their initiatives for the development works. According to the sources, all GPs, which will be upgraded, will not go for the upcoming GP election. The elections for the GPs are likely to be held in December and the authorities are preparing to conduct the polls. It has to be noted that there were several attempts to expand Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) limits, by including the GPs adjoining the MCC. But, the civic body authorities were not interested in including the villages. Thus, the GPs were upgraded to CMCs and Town Panchayats, according to sources.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/gps-bordering-mysuru-to-be-upgraded-915643.html

The vendors fell at the feet of Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) A N Prakash Gowda, when he visited the grounds, to inspect the crackers. The vendors pleaded with the officer and fell on the ground, urging him to allow them to sell the crackers. The DCP said, “As per the court order, only green and trademarked crackers are allowed. Legal action will be initiated, if any trader flouts the norms, he warned. Earlier, the vendors were indulged in an argument with the police personnel, for not allowing them to open stalls. Later, the officials of Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) inspected the crackers. The vendors also charged the officials for obstructing their business. The sellers said, “We have invested huge amounts on the crackers. Now, it is impossible to stop the business.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/vendors-plead-with-police-for-permission-to-sell-crackers-915645.html
14-11-2020||Main Article||A glimpse of the real Nehru||“Sir, a dream has been shattered, a song silenced, a flame has vanished in the infinite. It was the dream of a world without fear and without hunger, it was the song of an epic that had the echo of the Gita and the fragrance of the rose…That vibrant personality, that attitude of taking even the Opposition along, that refined gentlemanliness, we may not see again.” This is how Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid homage in the Rajya Sabha to India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru when he died in May 1964. Coming from Vajpayee, Nehru’s ardent critic -- especially during the 1962 war with China – the tribute reflects the most beautiful phase of our democracy – those early years. Can one expect such mutual respect and admiration (Nehru had earlier complimented Vajpayee for his criticism of him in Parliament over the 1962 war) in today’s hate-filled atmosphere? Nehru is an intensely debated personality in Indian politics, a man most abused and a victim of calumny. In his own day, the Communists felt he was not leftist enough, the Capitalists felt he was not on their side, the Socialists felt that he compromised too much. But none of them ever questioned his integrity and dedication to the cause of India. Sadly, that’s not the case today. The online media is full of abuse and conspiracy theories surrounding him. Long after Nehru’s death, many myths started to be created about his alleged waywardness in his personal life and politics. Rajiv Dixit of ‘Bharat Jago’ fame did not even bat an eyelid when he spread a falsehood in describing him as a philanderer and that Nehru and Jinnah fought over Edwina Mountbatten. Available on YouTube, men like Dixit spoke lies with authority. Dixit said that Jinnah, Edwina and Nehru studied at Harris College in London. In reality, there is no such college. What’s more, Jinnah had returned from England a decade before Nehru even started his journey to the UK. And Edwina never had any college education. Such unabashed calumny is being spread only to make people, particularly Hindus, hate Nehru. Some people are today adding even more ‘masala’ to such lies, even circulating pictures of Nehru with his sister and niece to show him as a philanderer. Unfortunately, many people get their ‘history’ and ‘facts’ on WhatsApp university. The great Socialist revolutionary Bhagat Singh, who was executed by the British in 1931 when he was just 23, is often posited against Nehru and Gandhi. What did Bhagat Singh himself think of Nehru? In his 1928 article “Naye netaon ke alag alag vichar” (The different views of new leaders), Bhagat Singh, himself a deep thinker, compared Sadhu Vaswani, a spiritual poet, Subhas Chandra Bose and Nehru. He called Vaswani a romantic idealist and said his vision – of India as a goddess protected by her ancient culture and sages – offered nothing to emancipate India from bondage. He analysed the views and visions of Bose and Nehru, and while they had similar ideas on some issues, he found himself in tune with Nehru. Both Bose and Nehru wanted the youth to rebel in the political sphere, but Nehru also wanted them to rebel in social, economic and religious thought, too. Nehru, Bhagat Singh noted, wanted all that was unreasonable to be discarded. Both Bose and Nehru were sympathetic to the cause of peasants and labourers. But Nehru, he declared, was an epochal change-maker who was energising not just the heart but also the mind of Indians and expressed his inclination towards Nehru’s leadership.   Nehru was also the only leader who would write in newspapers and journals, under a pseudonym or anonymously, criticising himself and warning people not to blindly adore him and make him a Caesar, as he did in the Modern Review in November 1937. He wrote it to prevent Indian National Congress leaders from pressuring him to become its president for the third time. Elsewhere, Nehru brooded about himself: “I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere, whose thoughts and approach to life are more akin to the Western but within me, India clings like a possessive mother.” He declared that in his subconscious, generations of cultural memories of India were embedded that he would never try to get rid of. The onslaught on Nehru today is due to two factors: one, a false assumption that he appeased the minorities. Two, that he became India’s first Prime Minister and not Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. On the second, Nehru was supported strongly by Patel himself to become PM (as letters and documents reveal, edited by Patel’s daughter, Maniben). Conservative, ignorant, closed minds perhaps needed an enemy to project and fight for their own political purpose, and they find one in Nehru. One should remember that when India became independent, Muslims resided in majority not only in the present Pakistan and Bangladesh, but many lived in every part of the country from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. It was only Nehru and Patel who could instill confidence in the minds of minorities that they were safe in a secular state. Had they not instilled that confidence, the entire country would have become chaotic and anarchy would have ruled. Nehru is also blamed for the Kashmir issue. But wasn’t Patel right there and backing him completely, even on the decision to go to the UN? Nehru is faulted for the 1962 India-China war. Was he naïve and sentimental about China, as is often depicted? Did he distrust the army and deliberately keep it weak, as is often insinuated? Morarji Desai, Nehru’s Finance Minister, would not allocate enough money for the military because he thought war was un-Gandhian. For the better part of his six years in office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with good intention, has tried to keep China in good humour and keep the bilateral relationship from becoming confrontational. Should we call him naïve and sentimental? Should we call him unpatriotic? Unfortunately, though, many in the Congress party itself have forgotten the values of our founding fathers like Gandhi, Patel, Azad and others. It has even forgotten the ideas of Nehru, who followed the “golden middle path” when ‘baby India’, newly independent, was just trying to stand up and walk on its own. Criticising Nehru for failures is one thing. Calumnising him and branding him as the cause of all of our present-day problems is not only unethical, but completely idiotic. Let’s remember Nehru today for all the good that he did, for his dedication to India.

14-11-2020||National||Delhi sees record 8,593 new Covid-19 cases in a single day||Covid-19 cases and deaths are increasing in the capital with the daily numbers nearing the 9,000-mark for cases and crossing the 100-mark for deaths even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed hope that the situation should come under control in the next seven to 10 days. On Wednesday, the national capital breached the 8,000-mark to touch 8,593, the highest for a single day, while the next day, cases dropped to 7,053 but the daily death toll crossed 100-mark to touch 104. Altogether, Delhi has 4,67,028 Covid-19 cases as on Thursday while the cumulative death toll has touched 7,332. Officials attribute the rise in numbers to festival season during which there is a greater movement of people. During a review meeting earlier this month, Delhi government officials told the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), "the recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid-19 behaviour." One of the worrying signs for the capital is the surge in positivity rate. On Thursday, it clocked 11.71% while it had breached 12% mark earlier. Another troubling sign is an increase in daily deaths. While Thursday saw 104 deaths, the capital has been witnessing a large number of Covid-19 deaths. While the city had witnessed 93 deaths on June 16, some of these took place days earlier and added to the toll on that day after cross-checking, only to come down below 50 later, the numbers have risen the past couple of weeks. On November 7, the death toll was 79 while it was 77 and 71 respectively in the next two days. Kejriwal said pollution was the "biggest" reason behind the spike in coronavirus cases in the city while emphasising that the situation was under control till October 20. "Covid-19 cases have been increasing for the last few days. I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in 7 to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing," he said. The number of active cases of coronavirus infection rose to 43,116 on Thursday from 42,629 the previous day while the recovery rate was over 89%.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-sees-record-8593-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-single-day-915364.html

14-11-2020||National||On Diwali, Delhi wakes up to thick layer of smog, 'very poor' air quality||Delhi's air quality remained “very poor” on Saturday morning and emission from firecrackers and calm winds may push it to the “severe” zone, according to government agencies and weather experts. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the “lowest” in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt. Pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks, it said. But two factors – smoke from farm fires and stagnant surface winds – will keep the air quality in the higher end of the “very poor” category to the lower end of the “severe” on Diwali night, it said. Transport-level winds have become northwesterly and the stubble burning-induced impact on air quality index (AQI) is expected to increase, the central government agency said. A spike in PM2.5 levels in the early hours Sunday is likely if firecrackers are burnt, it said. The city recorded an AQI of 369 at 9 am on Saturday. The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (323), Ghaziabad (412), Noida (362), Greater Noida (350), and Gurgaon (338), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded their AQI is the "very poor" and “severe” categories. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 the next day. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the “severe” category for three days on the trot. In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the “poor” category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the “severe” category on three consecutive days thereafter. In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the “severe” zone the next day. This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post-Diwali. Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. “However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post-Diwali due to an increase in wind speed. On Sunday, the maximum wind speed is expected to be around 12 to 15 kilometre per hour,” he said. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environmental research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said. There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal's directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period. “In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the Commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on the violation,” it said. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in "poor" and above categories.  "At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail," the NGT had said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered the closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.  (With PTI inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/on-diwali-delhi-wakes-up-to-thick-layer-of-smog-very-poor-air-quality-915409.html

But after the vaccine is ready, the biggest challenge would be dissemination and distribution of the vaccine to 1.3 billion Indian citizens. Infosys Chairman, Nandan Nilekani, feels that without a digital orchestration platform the distribution of the vaccine won’t be possible. Since there are so many vaccines in the line, he mentioned that even after a vaccine is distributed, it might not give the expected results. To tackle this ambiguity, there must be an agile digital system to scale up and AI to figure side effects and withdraw the vaccines. Nilekani rubbished the problem of privacy issues tied with the Aadhaar-type model to vaccinate people. “We simply are not geared for this kind of vaccination because this is adult vaccination at scale with an injection which we have not done ever before. I feel we need 200,000 new vaccinators who can be trained to give these vaccines. I do not see this as a privacy issue,” he told the news website. The Infosys Chairman also said that vaccine regulators in the world would work closely together and might even give simultaneous emergency authorisation. "It will be entirely possible that by January or so we will have at least one vaccine in India," he stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nandan-nilekani-pushes-for-aadhaar-type-covid-19-model-to-vaccinate-people-report-915460.html

In a clear swipe at China, Modi said without naming it that the entire world feels troubled by "expansionist" forces and expansionism shows a "distorted mindset" which belongs to the 18th century. "India believes in the policy of understanding others and making them understand but if an attempt to test it is made, then the country will give a fierce reply," he asserted. His unambiguous message came amid a continuing standoff with China at the Ladakh border. No force in the world can prevent our soldiers from protecting our borders, he said, adding that India has shown that it has strength and the political will to give a befitting reply to those challenging it. "The world now knows that India will not compromise with its interests even one bit," he said. Referring to his custom of celebrating Diwali with soldiers since he assumed office in 2014, Modi said that his resolve to serve and protect the country becomes stronger by spending more time with them. He also urged troops to innovate, practise yoga and learn an Indian language they don't know from colleagues. On the occasion, he recalled the fierce fight the post had witnessed in the 1971 war against Pakistan and paid tributes to Brig Kuldeep Singh Chandpuri, a hero of the battle, saying he became "rashtra deep" with his feat of bravery. The war was also an example of exemplary coordination among Army, Navy, and Air Force, he said. India had defeated Pakistan in the war, leading to the independence of Bangladesh.  (With PTI inputs)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-celebrates-diwali-with-jawans-warns-of-befitting-reply-if-tested-at-border-915465.html

Sawant accused former chief minister Digambar Kamat of giving permission for the expansion of coal handling capacity twice during his tenure between 2007 and 2012. "It was the Congress-led government in 2011 that allowed the expansion of coal handling capacity at Mormugao Port Trust (MPT). The Goa Pollution Control Board (GPCB) gave environment clearance for the expansion of coal handling two times," he alleged while addressing a pre-Diwali event in Panaji on Friday. He claimed that the Kamat-led government gave permission to it in 2011 and again in March 2012. "The capacity to increase coal handling by five million was permitted by the Kamat government in March 2012, when the model code of conduct (for state assembly elections) was in force," he said. The chief minister also alleged that he has all the "documentary evidence" to prove how the Congress government brought in coal in Goa. Sawant added that his government has drawn plans to decrease the coal handling at MPT over the next six months. "The permission for up-gradation of MPT berths are given to use it for tourism purpose," Sawant said. Apart from the opposition parties, several activists have been opposing three projects in the state, including the expansion of a national highway and doubling of a railway line by South Western Railway, alleging that they were being executed to help multinational companies transport coal from MPT to neighbouring Karnataka.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/past-congress-govt-in-goa-allowed-coal-handling-expansion-sawant-915468.html

Expansionism is, in a way, reflective of 18th-century thinking. India is becoming a voice against such thinking,” Modi said addressing Indian Army and Border Security Force forces. The Prime Minister said that the entire world was now coming to know that India would not compromise one bit on matters of national interest. “India’s stature and power are entire because of your valour,” Modi said recalling the historic battle of Longewala during the 1971 India-Pakistan war. “World history tells us that only those nations have remained safe and progressed who have the ability to counter the invaders,” he said even as India remained in a tense standoff with Chinese troops in Ladakh. This was the seventh consecutive year when the Prime Minister celebrated Diwali with the armed forces deployed at the forward posts. Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat, Army Chief M M Naravane and Border Security Force (BSF) Director General Rakesh Asthana accompanied the Prime Minister. “Whenever the valour of our soldiers is talked about, the Battle of Longewala will be remembered.

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna declined to interfere with the Bombay High Court's order of October 21, rejecting an application for advance bail by Ebrahim Mohd Iqbal Lakadawala. The man, represented by advocate Sunil Fernandes, claimed that he is the father of five children, including three minor daughters, who were completely dependent upon him, and there was a threat to their health and well-being, in case of his arrest. His third wife lodged an FIR with Mumbai's Amboli police station against Lakadawala under various provision of the IPC, including unnatural sex and under the Information Technology Act for making obscene picture of complainant wife. She also lodged the case also under provision of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, saying he pronounced triple talaq against him. In its order, the top court, however, said the dismissal of his petition would not come in the way of seeking regular bail to be filed within four weeks of his surrendering to the court concerned. "Till then, no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner but the petitioner shall make himself available before the Investigating Officer as and when required in connection with the investigation of the subject case," it said. The court said if 48 hours notice is given in advance to the prosecution, the trial court may decide the bail application on the same day. The FIR was lodged by the victim-woman on August 28, alleging her husband gave some intoxicating drink to her and took some photographs and recorded video of the first informant. She alleged the man had unnatural sex with her in October, 2018 and had inserted aluminium rod causing bleeding in her private parts. He used to quarrel with her as he did not want children from her.

In a letter to Sitharaman, he said West Bengal has opted for Centre’s new proposal whereby it agreed to borrow money from the market to compensate the states for their GST shortfall. However, the Centre’s proposal that it will borrow only to the extent of two-thirds of compensation due to the federal bodies, was not agreeable to the state. The remaining amount, the Centre had said, should be raised by states themselves on easy loan terms and the Centre would compensate for that by 2022. Mitra, however, urged that the remaining one-third of potential shortfall of Rs 72,000 to states should also be borrowed by the Centre and compensated to states by January next year itself. “Needless to say, we sincerely urge you to borrow the remaining one-third of the potential shortfall (Rs 72,000 crores) as was suggested in GST council meeting in earlier letters and conversations,” Mitra said in the letter and sought Sitharaman convene a GST Council meeting at the earliest to discuss the matter. Mitra said there was a huge differential in interest rates when it comes to borrowing by states. While the Centre is able to borrow from the special window at 5%, the states have to pay 6.8% rate of interest. “In other words, by asking the states to borrow one-third of the potential compensation funds from the competitive auction market of the RBI, a lot more debt servicing burden will be generated for the states to be paid from Cess collection,” Mitra said. He said that due to the pandemic and cyclone Amphan which battered West Bengal, the state is already in acute financial stress. Therefore, the Centre must call a GST Council meeting for a unanimous decision.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengal-finance-minister-amit-mitra-urges-nirmala-sitharaman-to-convene-gst-council-meeting-915527.html
14-11-2020||National||Covid-19 pandemic casts shadow on festival of light||Fear of the coronavirus, mixed with chronic pollution, has spoiled the party for hundreds of millions of Indians celebrating the biggest Hindu holiday of the year on Saturday. Diwali is meant to be the festival of light, but the pandemic has clouded the future for many in the country of 1.3 billion. The smog-shrouded capital New Delhi has banned firecrackers because of sky-high pollution levels and, while people still thronged markets, traders said Covid-19 had scared them off spending. With 8.7 million cases, India has the world's second-highest coronavirus infection count behind the United States. About 130,000 people have died from Covid-19 in India since February and Delhi is going through a new surge with nearly 8,000 new cases a day. Experts have blamed the rise on Diwali crowds, and -- although traditional revelry was muted -- there was no sign that people were staying at home. Engineer Rahul Randhawa, 27, said the throngs were "the total opposite" of what he expected to see when he returned from the United States. "There are major jams on the street... and there are huge crowds in markets," he said. However, the crowds are being selective. Cinemas are open but remain empty. Restaurants say they are struggling to get people to come in. Mahinder Kumar, who sells flowers outside the Jhandewala temple, one of the oldest in Delhi, said that normally there are huge queues for Diwali. "This year it's nothing - almost empty." "Our business has been affected badly. We have hardly sold any flowers this year." The eight weeks up to Diwali can account for 40 per cent of some traders' annual business and it is considered an auspicious time to buy gold. But the lights were off at Vineet Garg's gold and jewellery store near the central Connaught Place, despite an "open" sign on display. "It is a waste of electricity to put the lights on," he said. "People are not buying in shops. The business I am doing is online. They are too worried to have fun." In Mumbai, markets were bustling with shoppers buying lights and food but shopkeepers said sales were no better than on an average day. "It is a dull Diwali," said Raju Harijan, 35, who has a food store in north Mumbai. "Usually every year, sales would peak now but this year, even survival has become tough." Bank worker Sonam Choudhary acknowledged that people were "scared" of the coronavirus and "adjusting to the new normal". She said families would celebrate Diwali "with all the precautions". Prime Minister Narendra Modi and most of his ministers put out traditional Diwali greetings. "May everyone be prosperous and healthy," Modi told his 63.5 million Twitter followers. But the government is struggling to kick-start an economy that is expected to shrink by nearly 10 per cent this year because of the pandemic crisis. Millions across the country have lost their jobs. The government this week announced incentives worth more than $35 billion to boost employment, consumer demand, agriculture and manufacturing. Since May, it has spent about $300 billion on stimulus measures. But Garg said there would be no point putting the lights on in his jewellery store until a coronavirus vaccine is available to all. "The new normal is all dark for now," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-pandemic-casts-shadow-on-festival-of-light-915530.html

Here are the top news of November 14, 2020: Samajwadi Party (SP) President Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday categorically ruled out an alliance with the Congress or the BSP in the next assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, which are due in a little over a year's time. Speaking to reporters in his home town of Etawah, Akhilesh said that his party, however, could consider aligning with smaller outfits in the elections. ''We will, under no circumstances, ally with bigger parties but there may be an alliance with smaller outfits...we are in talks with some such outfits,'' he said. Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday asked India and Pakistan to rise above their political compulsions and initiate dialogue, saying it was sad to see mounting casualties on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC). Mufti's remarks came after the two countries traded heavy fire on the LoC following ceasefire violations by Pakistan on Friday. The firing resulted in loss of lives on the both sides. The former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said restoring the ceasefire that was agreed upon and implemented by former prime minister A B Vajpayee and ex-Pakistan president General Pervez Musharaf is a good place to start.   Addressing soldiers along the India-Pakistan border in Longewala in Rajasthan, the Prime Minister on Saturday lashed out at “expansionist forces”, an apparent reference to China, and termed the idea as a “mental disorder”. Amid a standoff with China and Pakistan, PM Modi also sent out a clear message that India believed in the policy of understanding and explaining, but anyone testing its resolve will get an equally fierce response. “Today, the entire world is troubled due to expansionist forces. Expansionism is, in a way, reflective of 18th-century thinking. India is becoming a voice against such thinking,” Modi said addressing Indian Army and Border Security Force forces.   Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Saturday said his government would try to get additional funds from the Centre for the flood-hit districts of the state. The statement comes a day after the central government approved Rs 577.84 crore as financial assistance to the state, from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).   Armenia on Saturday said that more than two thousand fighters were killed in six weeks of clashes with Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. "To date, our forensic service has examined the corpses of 2,317 dead servicemen, including unidentified ones," Armenian health ministry spokeswoman Alina Nikoghosyan wrote on Facebook. The updated death toll from the Armenian side pushes its fatalities up by nearly 1,000 compared to the last confirmed toll among Armenian fighters. Nearly two months of fierce clashes between the ex-Soviet rivals ended this week with a Russian-brokered peace accord that sees Armenia cede swathes of territory captured by Azerbaijan's forces.

"From the development of indigenous vaccines, novel point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic formulations based on traditional knowledge, to establishing research resources and offering services, Indian R&D entities, both public and private, are working relentlessly to develop effective interventions for combating the pandemic," Vardhan, who holds the charge of Health Ministry as well as the Science and Technology Ministry, said.   ] Valery Falkov, Russian Minister of Science and Higher Education, Marcos Pontes, Brazilian Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Huang Wei, First Vice Minister of Science and Technology, China, Bonginkosi Emmanuel Nzimande, South African Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology and several other dignitaries from member countries participated in the meeting. Vardhan said more than 100 start-ups have developed innovative products for Covid-19. He said the government has announced a USD 120 million grant for Covid-19 vaccine research. This is being provided for CovidSuraksha (Mission for protection from Covid) and is to be used purely for research and development in this field, he said. "The grant does not cover the actual cost of the vaccine and its distribution expenses, which will be made separately as and when the vaccine is available," he said. Vardhan said India is also hosting clinical trials for all the major vaccine contenders. Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, is conducting trials for the vaccine developed by Oxford University, he said. "One of our pharma giants, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, will distribute the Russian vaccine in India after conducting final-stage human trials and receiving regulatory approval," the minister said.  Vardhan said India will actively contribute in implementation of BRICS STI Calendar of Activities 2020-21 and support continuation of scientific activities under BRICS MOU on Science, Technology and Innovation. The BRICS member leaders applauded India for the 'SERB–POWER' (Promoting Opportunities For Women in Exploratory Research) scheme launched last month, the Department of Science and Technology said.   "We have recently launched a scheme 'SERB–POWER' to encourage and support emerging as well as eminent women researchers to undertake R&D activities in areas of science and engineering. We may think of networking BRICS women scientists through a dedicated platform and mechanism," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-has-initiated-an-integrated-response-against-covid-19-pandemic-vardhan-915565.html

"The Charge d'Affaires of the High Commission of Pakistan was summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs today and a strong protest was lodged over unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces, on multiple sectors along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir on November 13, resulting in the death of four innocent civilians and serious injuries to 19 others," the MEA said. India condemned “in the strongest terms” the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by the armed forces of Pakistan. “It is highly deplorable that Pakistan chose a festive occasion in India to disrupt peace and perpetrate violence in J&K through coordinated firing along the length of the LoC using heavy calibre weapons, including artillery and mortar on Indian civilians,” the senior officials of the MEA conveyed to the diplomat of the neighbouring country’s High Commission in New Delhi. New Delhi also strongly protested Pakistan’s continued support to cross border terrorist infiltration into India, including through supporting cover fire provided by armed forces of the neighbouring country. “Pakistan was once again reminded of its bilateral commitment to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the MEA, said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-summons-charge-daffaires-of-pakistan-mission-over-ceasefire-violations-along-loc-915597.html
14-11-2020||National||East Asia Summit: India talks about need for respecting territorial integrity, sovereignty||In an oblique message to China, India on Saturday expressed concern over "actions and incidents" that "erode" trust in the South China Sea, and underlined the importance of adhering to international law, respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty. In an address at the 15th East Asia Summit (EAS), External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also talked about the Indo-Pacific and noted the growing interest in the region as an integrated and organic maritime space with 10-nation ASEAN at its centre. The external affairs minister, referring to recent announcement of policies by several countries for the Indo-Pacific region, said that harmonising various perspectives would never be a challenge if there is commitment to international cooperation. The summit, held in the virtual format, was chaired by Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc in his capacity as chair of the ASEAN and all the EAS member nations attended it. India is generally represented at the summit by the prime minister. In his address, Jaishankar also underlined the need for greater international cooperation in the post-Covid world to tackle the challenges cutting across national boundaries such as terrorism, climate change and pandemics, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said. The East Asia Summit is a premier forum in the Asia-Pacific region dealing with issues relating to security and defence. Since its inception in 2005, it has been playing a significant role in the strategic, geopolitical and economic evolution of East Asia. Apart from the 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states, East Asia Summit includes India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Russia. The MEA said Jaishankar re-affirmed the importance of the EAS as the leaders-led forum to exchange views on strategic issues and spoke of the "importance of adhering to international law, respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty, and promoting a rules-based global order". His comments on the need for respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty came in the midst of the bitter border row between India and China in eastern Ladakh and Beijing's increasing expansionist behaviour in South China Sea and Indo-Pacific. "On the South China Sea, the external affairs minister expressed concern about actions and incidents that erode trust in the region," the Ministry of External Affairs said.   China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons. However, several ASEAN member countries, including Vietnam, Philippines and Brunei, have counter claims. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, China has significantly ramped up military offensives in the South China Sea in the last few months, triggering global concerns. India has been pitching for promoting a rules-based order in the region including through upholding adherence to international law, especially the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). "He stated that the Code of Conduct negotiations should not be prejudicial to legitimate interests of third parties and should be fully consistent with UNCLOS," the MEA said in a statement. On the Indo-Pacific, it said: "The external affairs minister noted the growing interest in the Indo-Pacific as an integrated and organic maritime space, with ASEAN at its centre. He appreciated the synergy between the ASEAN Outlook and India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative." He said India was equally positive about the Indo-Pacific policies announced recently by other nations. At the East Asia Summit in Bangkok last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed setting up of the Indo-Pacific Ocean's Initiative (IPOI) to conserve and sustainably use the maritime domain and to make meaningful efforts to create a safe and secure maritime domain. The concept is gaining traction with Japan already agreeing to be the lead partner in the connectivity pillar of the IPOI. Referring to the Covid-19, Jaishankar briefed the EAS leaders about India's response to the pandemic and highlighted India's efforts to support the international community. He reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to help make the Covid-19 vaccine accessible and affordable to all nations. The MEA said the leaders underlined the importance of cooperation in ensuring safe, effective and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. "They called for greater cooperation in keeping the global supply chains open for an expeditious and sustainable economic recovery. Regional and international issues such as South China Sea, the situation in Korean peninsula and Rakhine state were also discussed," it said. The summit issued a declaration and also adopted four statements on marine sustainability; epidemics prevention and response; women, peace and security; and steady growth of regional economy, the MEA said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/east-asia-summit-india-talks-about-need-for-respecting-territorial-integrity-sovereignty-915619.html
14-11-2020||National||Delhi protests as Beijing tries to turn South China Sea Code of Conduct into a barrier to keep US, India, others away from dispute||India on Saturday tacitly opposed China's latest move to press the ASEAN hard to insert in the proposed Code of Conduct on the South China Sea certain clauses that would help the communist country to keep its rivals and other nations outside the region away from the disputed waters. The negotiation for the code “should not be prejudicial to the legitimate interests of the third parties and should be fully consistent with the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)”, said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar while representing Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the East Asia Summit, which was held through video-links in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Without mentioning China, he expressed India’s concern over the nation's aggressive moves in the region, including building military infrastructures in the disputed waters, and purported plan to create an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) covering the disputed Pratas, Paracel and Spratly Islands. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) expressed concern about “actions and incidents that erode trust in the region”. Jaishankar’s remarks on the South China Sea came amid the six-month-long military stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh. Premier Li Keqiang represented China in the East Asia Summit. He also attended the ASEAN-China summit on Friday, when he nudged the leaders of the South East Asian nations to speed up negotiations for a code of conduct for the South China Sea. The conclave was attended by the leaders and representatives of the 18 nations – the 10 Southeast Asian nations and India, Russia, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and the United States. President Vladimir Putin represented Russia, but the US President Donald Trump, who recently lost the election to his rival Joe Biden, skipped it. The US was represented by Trump’s National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien. India last month joined the US to stress that the proposed Code of Conduct in the South China Sea should not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of any nation in accordance with the international law. Beijing has of late been stepping up pressure on the ASEAN to agree to insert certain clauses in the Code of Conduct in order to make it restrict Japan, India, the US and the other nations outside the region from engaging in maritime security cooperation with the South East Asian nations and exploring resources in the South China Sea. If China manages to get all the clauses proposed by it included in the Code of Conduct, the ASEAN nations may have to get prior clearance from Beijing for joint military drills in the South China Sea with the US, Japan, India or any other nations outside the region. It may also make it difficult for ONGC Videsh Limited of India and similar entities of other nations to continue exploring hydrocarbon and other resources in and around the disputed waters. China has been protesting the role of the OVL and other foreign companies in the exploration in the blocks in the continental shelf of Vietnam. The Code of Conduct was necessitated after Beijing started building artificial islands in the South China Sea in 2014. China also started building military facilities, including airstrips and radar towers, on the artificial islands, ostensibly to get a strategic edge in the disputed waters. China had initially been reluctant to enter into any negotiation with the ASEAN for a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea. It, however, finally agreed to start the negotiation in May 2017. The communist country is now trying to turn the Code of Conduct into its favour, so that it can keep dominating the disputed South China Sea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-protests-as-beijing-tries-to-turn-south-china-sea-code-of-conduct-into-a-barrier-to-keep-us-india-others-away-from-dispute-915649.html

Subodh was among those martyred in the heavy shelling by Pakistan at the LOC at Baramula in Kashmir on Friday. He did not live to see his three-month-old daughter. The 24-year-old jawan was eager to return home for his daughter's 'Annaprasan', a ceremony when a child begins to have rice and other solid food when he/she turns six months old. "My son was eager to return home for his daughter's Annaprasan ... Now instead of him, his coffin will come. The village is in mourning," the jawan's father Gouranga Ghosh, a day labourer, told reporters at his modest home on Saturday. The body will arrive on Sunday after completion of the formalities, he said. Recounting the dreadful afternoon when the family got the news of the jawan's death on Friday, Ghosh said, "There was a call at around 3.30 pm from Jammu and Kashmir. As we missed it my daughter-in-law called back and the person at the other end said they had received the marriage documents of Subodh and was confirming it. "After 10 minutes there was a second call from the same number and we were informed that Subodh was killed in firing by Pakistan," he said.. Subodh's wife Anindita fainted on hearing the news. "Subodh was at home for the last time in June this year for 40 days. Due to the lockdown, he was unable to meet friends and relatives at that time. His daughter was born after he left and he was planning to be back home during the 'Annaprashan' of his daughter," his mother said. Subodh spoke to his wife and mother for the last time on Thursday. The martyred jawan's father-in-law Tapan Ghosh, who owns a small confectionery, had rushed to his daughter's home soon after getting the news of Subodh's death. "I spoke to Subodh 10 days ago and he had enquired about my health," he said. Subodh had married his daughter a year and three months ago. After passing out from local Nimtala High School, Subodh had taken admission at Betai College but he made it to the Army three years ago. The family's financial condition had improved after he joined the Army and Subodh had started to build a pucca house. District administration and police officials visited the martyred jawan's house on Saturday and conveyed the official message from Jammu and Kashmir. The villagers garlanded Subodh's photograph on Saturday and paid the homage. "On the day of the festival of lights, the village has plunged into darkness," a villager said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/martyred-jawan-subodh-ghosh-did-not-live-to-see-his-daughter-915661.html

She expressed hope and prayed that "a million lamps illuminating India and our hearts on this festival of lights would end the gloom of pandemic, the darkness of economic recession and distress being caused to fellow citizens".

Obama, in his memoir, ‘A Promised Land’, describes Rahul Gandhi as having “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject.” Raut lashed out, saying that politicians in India do not make such harsh statements. He said, according to an ANI tweet, “A foreign politician can't give such opinions on Indian political leaders; subsequent domestic political discourse on it is distasteful. We won't say 'Trump is mad'. How much does Obama know about this nation?" This further charged the friction between the two political parties as the BJP has repeatedly critiqued Rahul Gandhi’s abilities during his tenure as Congress president, and the defeat the party faced in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala had earlier tweeted “May I humbly remind certain overzealous friends of the Media running a sponsored agenda that we don’t comment on individual’s views in a book. In the past, a Leader has been called “psychopath” and “master divider” by people and agencies.

14-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality turns 'severe' on Diwali||Delhi's air quality turned "severe" on Diwali with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of the city's PM2.5 pollution and calm winds worsening the situation as they allowed the accumulation of pollutants, weather officials said.  The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said, "Even a small increase in local additional emissions is likely to have significant deterioration impact on Sunday and Monday." It said peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am and 6 am in case of additional internal emissions.  Earlier, it had said that the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the "lowest" in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt. The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 on Saturday, which falls in the "severe" category.  The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the "severe" category for three days on the trot. In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the "poor" category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the "severe" category on three consecutive days thereafter. In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the "severe" zone the next day. This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post-Diwali. Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. "However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post-Diwali due to an expected increase in the wind speed on Sunday," he said. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environmental research centre, said calm winds, smoke from farm fires and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the "severe" zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said. There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to "improve significantly" on Sunday.  "Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph," it said. "Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday," the central agency said. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal's directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period. "In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the Commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on the violation," it said. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in "poor" and above categories.  "At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail," the NGT had said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered the closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-turns-severe-on-diwali-915466.html

They said due to the snowfall, authorities closed the Srinagar-Leh road, which passes through Zojila pass and connects Jammu and Kashmir with Ladakh union territory, for traffic. "The road has been closed for traffic as a precautionary measure in the wake of snowfall," the officials said. Meanwhile, most of the areas in the plains of the Kashmir valley received rains, bringing down the temperature.

14-11-2020||North and Central||ED Director S K Mishra's tenure extended by one year||The Narendra Modi government has extended the tenure of Enforcement Directorate Sanjay Kumar Mishra by one more year after modifying his appointment order issued two years ago. Mishra was appointed ED chief on November 19, 2018, and his tenure was to end next week as the post comes with a two-year fixed term. According to the order issued by the Department of Revenue under the Ministry of Finance, President Ram Nath Kovind approved the modification of the earlier order appointing Mishra as ED Director for two years. After quoting the 2018 order, it said it should be modified as "the President of India is pleased to appoint Shri Sanjay Kumar Mishra, IRS, Principal Special Director, Directorate of Enforcement as Director of Enforcement in the Enforcement Directorate for a period of three years from the date of assumption of charge of the post or until further orders, whichever is earlier". Officials said the extension of tenure of Mishra, an Indian Revenue Service officer of the 1984-batch, by modifying the earlier order is possibly the first time that such a thing has happened with regard to the post of ED Director. Mishra attained the superannuation age of 60 years in May but continued in the position as his assured two-year term was to end on November 19. Mishra is spearheading the agency at a time when it is conducting probes into a wide range of high-profile cases, including money laundering aspects in the Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case, the ICICI Bank case, and the Kerala gold smuggling case. He was also part of the investigating team that probed the National Herald case and had handled a disproportionate assets case filed against BSP chief Mayawati as well.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ed-director-s-k-mishras-tenure-extended-by-one-year-915506.html

An army official said no cross-border firing or shelling incidents were reported since Friday evening. The firing and shelling stopped following strong retaliation by Indian Army, he said. Ghulam Mohammad Chichi, a resident of Madian village in Uri said after the shelling stopped his family returned home from an underground bunker this morning. “The shelling stopped at around 11 pm yesterday [Friday]. I along with my family had taken shelter in a nearby underground bunker,” he told DH over the phone. However, he said, a tense situation still prevails along the LoC as they live in constant fear. “In this harsh winter, we have to remain on our toes as shelling can start at any time. Not only people on this side of the LoC but residents on the other side too are facing the brunt of Indo-Pak animosity,” Chichi rued. Another border resident said that several shells fell on roads close to the residential areas. “We live in fear every time now. We do not know when the shells will start raining close to our homes,” he said. Sources said security forces have strengthened presence all along the LoC, notwithstanding temporary thaw in the shelling, and firing and were ready to retaliate any fresh ceasefire violations from the Pakistan side. “There are reports that Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad militants have mixed up with the Pakistan Army to target Indian posts and infiltrate into the Indian territory. Taking no chance, the army and the BSF were taking all steps to counter infiltration attempts by the militants along the LoC,” a source said. The Pakistani troops targeted border outposts and dozens of hamlets along the LoC from Gurez to Uri in north Kashmir on Friday, killing six civilians and five Indian soldiers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/a-day-after-flare-up-uneasy-calm-prevails-along-loc-in-kashmir-915507.html

Speaking to reporters in his home town of Etawah, Akhilesh said that his party, however, could consider aligning with smaller outfits in the elections. ''We will, under no circumstances, ally with bigger parties but there may be an alliance with smaller outfits...we are in talks with some such outfits,'' he said.  In an indication of a thaw in his relations with his estranged uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, Akhilesh also said that the SP would leave the Jaswant Nagar assembly seat for Shivpal.  ''Shivpal will also be made a cabinet minister if the SP comes to power after the next assembly polls,'' he added. According to sources in the SP here, the party is likely to ally with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has pockets of influence in the western UP districts. In reply to a question on the recently concluded assembly polls in Bihar, Akhilesh said that the Mahagathbandhan (RJD-Cong) was the victim of ''electoral malpractices''. He expressed satisfaction over his party's performance in the recent assembly bypolls in the state and said that the SP was able to retain its seat. The SP had contested the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with the Congress but could manage to win only 47 seats. The Congress, too, could win only seven seats. Akhilesh's alliance with arch-rival and BSP supremo Mayawati in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections also failed to click. The SP could win only five seats and the BSP managed to win 10 seats.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/akhilesh-rules-out-alliance-with-congress-bsp-in-next-uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-915523.html

Addressing a gathering at Vantangia village Tinkonia Number-3, Adityanath said, "I appeal to all to light a diyaa (earthen lamp) in the name of martyrs." "We all have to make Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream come true. Due to corona, 'deep' (earthen lamps), light jhaalar, statues of Gauri–Ganesh didn't come from China and everything here was made by potters and at the gaushalas. "Artists of Aurangabad-Ekla village of Gorakhpur showcased terracotta products in an exhibition in Lucknow, where they said that they earned Rs 8 lakh in three days. A 'deep' stand was sold for Rs 22,000. There is demand but efforts were not made (earlier). We need to be 'vocal with local'," he said. The chief minister said that the benefits of government schemes took 70 years to reach forest villages like Vantangia and now, one could walk to the district headquarters in 70 minutes from here. "Earlier the people of administration did not even visit the place, I knew the situation and condition of this place and so for the past four years all benefits of the Centre and state government have been reaching here. Earlier we used to sit in huts at Vantangia village, but now pucca houses have been constructed here and this is true Diwali." The Vantangia community comprises people who were brought here from Myanmar during the colonial rule for planting trees. The community faces problems related to the use of natural forest produce as the forests inhabited by them were not considered as revenue villages. However, in 2018, in a bid to bring the forest-dwelling community into the mainstream, the chief minister declared their 18 settlements as revenue villages. Adityanath also said that his government didn't consider caste or religion for development schemes. "Everyone should think that no one stays deprived of development and they could get benefits of schemes and electricity. People's representatives like MPs, MLAs have information about the benefits of government schemes and it should reach the people," he said. He also mentioned a decrease in deaths due to encephalitis. "From 1977 to 2017, at least 50,000 children died of encephalitis. This year only 21 died and soon we will eradicate the deadly disease," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/this-year-lights-statues-of-deities-were-made-in-india-due-to-covid-19-yogi-adityanath-915528.html

This comes close on the heels of Kejriwal writing to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan requesting him to augment bed capacity in central government-run hospitals in following apprehensions that the number of Covid-19 cases could reach 15,000 a day in the coming weeks. Kejriwal wrote to Vardhan earlier this week, citing a shortfall of around 4,900 beds in hospitals, and urged him to direct central government-run hospitals to provide at least 1,092 additional beds, including 300 ICU beds, with the required medical staff. Sources said Kejriwal's meeting with Shah would take place soon to follow up on his request for additional beds. Kejriwal has already announced that several steps will be taken to handle rising cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, including certain restrictions. These steps will also be discussed with Shah, sources said. He is also likely to ask for further assistance from the Centre, including co-operation from other states on controlling pollution which is leading to increase in cases during the festival season. The capital is witnessing surge in Covid-19 cases since October 20 with the Delhi government officials attributing it to the festival season and laxity in adhering to norms like ensuring social distancing and wearing masks.

Teams of intelligence officers affected searches at a total of 22 premises spread over Srinagar, Budgam and Anantnag in Kashmir, and in Jammu and Delhi which include private offices and residences, he said. The spokesman said the searches were conducted against several suspects in connection with the investigation of a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Armed with search warrants issued by competent judicial authority and overseen by executive magistrates as witnesses, teams of CID investigators looked for additional evidence pertaining to several dubious and irregular financial transactions, the spokesman said. He said many of these involve suspected collusion between bank officials, private persons and public servants. The suspected irregularities amounting to a variety of offences under different provisions of law include concealment of suspicious and dubious transactions from identification and scrutiny by closing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) alerts, wrongly closing alerts that were to be mandatorily furnished by the bank under the regulatory directions notified by the RBI with faulty and false closure remarks as 'STR' (suspicious transaction reports) or 'already reported in STR' or other related comments, whereas STR MIS did not contain these alerts. “Dishonest exporters in collusion with bank officials obtained in advance but did not submit invoices and documents to prove that the advance so obtained from the bank have been utilised lawfully, bank officials failing to raise alerts wherein funds flowed from many different accounts into one account even when these transactions involved acceptance of huge deposits and withdrawals in cash in violation of banking rules and regulations,” the spokesman said. He said the raids led to recovery of incriminating evidence which would be analysed for further action and form useful pieces of evidence in the investigation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/j-k-cid-searches-22-places-in-kashmir-jammu-and-delhi-in-irregular-financial-transactions-case-915585.html

Adityanath took the measure after the video of a minor girl repeatedly banging her head against a police van while pleading with them to free her father surfaced on the social media. The incident was confirmed by the chief minister’s close aide Shalabh mani Tripathi, who said the incident happened in Khurja town of Bulandshar. The local police had picked up the girl’s father along with a few others after a raid in Mundakheda Road area of Khurja on Friday evening for illegally selling firecrackers. As the policemen were about to whisk them away in the van, the minor daughter of one of the men began crying and pleading with them to free her father. In desperation, she also banged her head a few times against the police van, but the policemen ignored her cries with one of them pushing her aside to enable the driver to drive the vehicle. As the video of the incident went viral, Chief Minister Adityanath found the police behaviour “insensitive” and he promptly ordered the release of the men besides ordering to send Diwali gifts and sweets to the girl at her home. Bulandshahr’s Senior Superintendent of Police Santosh Kuma Singh too confirmed the incident saying the police sent some sweets to the girl on the CM’s order. One of the constables, Brijveer, found wanting in handling the situation with a human touch, too was transferred to the police lines, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/yogi-adityanath-frees-illegal-firecracker-seller-sends-diwali-sweets-for-daughter-915610.html

Kejriwal had urged people not to burst crackers due to rising pollution level and its impact on Covid-19, and had appealed them to join him in the 'Diwali Pujan' programme that was telecast live through TV channels and social media platforms. "Today my family of two crore Delhi people together performed Diwali Pujan. Prayed for happiness, health and prosperity of all. May there be well being of all," Kejriwal tweeted after the programme.  Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia,  many AAP MPs and MLAs and senior officers of the Delhi government were part of the 'Diwali Pujan' ceremony. The priests chanted 'mantras' invoking blessings of deities for the wellbeing of people, while the chief minister and his ministers performed rituals. Noted singer Anoop Jalota rendered 'bhajans' accompanying 'arti' and lighting of 'diyas' on the occasion. "Entire Delhi together performed Diwali Pujan today. The pious sound of chanting  mantras created marvellous vibes and all the visible and invisible forces blessed Delhi people," said a tweet from the Chief Minister's office. Ahead of Diwali, the Delhi government last week had banned all types of firecrackers till November 30 in the city, after a Covid-19 review meeting chaired by the chief minister. The Covid-19 cases have increased in Delhi due to the ongoing festival season and pollution, the chief minister had said, announcing the ban and had appealed to the people not to burst crackers. The air quality in the city has reached alarming levels due to various factors, including burning of paddy stubble in the neighbouring states. The chief minister on Friday expressed concern over the growing Covid-19 cases and claimed that pollution was the "biggest" reason behind rise in such infections. Delhi recorded 7,053 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.67 lakh on Thursday, while 104 more fatalities in a same period, the highest in over five months, pushed the death toll to 7,332, authorities said.

14-11-2020||North and Central||With crackers, some send NGT ban up in smoke in NCR||Some people in Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad burst firecrackers to mark Diwali on Saturday, defying the ban on their sale and use in the National Capital Region (NCR) imposed due to rising air pollution. The development came even as the average 24-hour air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad plunged to "severe" level, while it stayed "very poor" in Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad -- the five satellite cities of Delhi in the NCR. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has recently imposed a "total ban" on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight amid worsening air quality. Ghaziabad resident Amita Sinha said there was non-stop sound of firecrackers throughout Saturday. A resident of Raj Nagar extension, Sinha said even her dog Monty, a dachshund, remained jittery due to the loud noise every now and then. "Seems like the onus of following the NGT rules and caring about the environment is only on law-abiding citizens because those who violate law anyway go scot-free," she told PTI. Aniket mentioned an incessant bursting of firecrackers in his area of residence -- Indirapuram, while the situation has been similar in Vasundhara area as well. Akhilesh Upadhyay, a resident of Nehru Nagar, said, "Despite the NGT's ban, some people are hell-bent on firing crackers not realising the harm they are doing to the environment and in turn, to all of us." In Noida and Greater Noida, too, bursting of firecrackers continued unabated,, according to some residents that PTI spoke to. "No one seems bothered about pollution. I could hear crackers being burst all day from inside my home," Noida Sector 21 resident Savita Mehta said. Sector 19 resident Shivang Jain said, "The celebration in the form of firecrackers has been continuous since the evening in his area." Manish Kumar described a scene of cracker rockets going up in the sky of Greater Noida (West), also known as Noida Extension, and spreading light in various hues along with toxic fumes. Ram Singh, a resident Sector Omnicron 1 in Greater Noida, said, "By the sheer sound of it, it felt like people set more crackers afire this year than last year." The NGT's ban was also defied by some people in Noida's Sector 7X, a collective of sectors from 73 to 78, that houses several high-rises and thousands of people, according to locals. "Crackers are being fired in some societies as well as on main roads in 7X. Not in all societies but some definitely, and it has been continuous today," Sector 77 resident Amit Gupta said. Noida's Sector 92 resident Sushil Jain said some people burst crackers in his area on Friday also, but the intensity grew on Saturday. The situation was no different in Haryana's Faridabad and Gurgaon, which had registered "very poor" air quality on Saturday. "There's no way one cannot hear the sound of fire crackers today, and all this despite the ban," Namrata Banik, who lives in Sector 42 of Faridabad, said. She said her friend's daughter, who joined them for Kali Puja, was thrilled at the sight of some people setting "anaar" alight although she detested the sound of other crackers. "Quite a sight that some people are firing crackers despite the ban and so much discussion about the harm they do to the environment," Gurgaon Sector 58 resident Kashika Gulati said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/with-crackers-some-send-ngt-ban-up-in-smoke-in-ncr-915669.html

The 151-inch-tall statue is made of "ashtadhatu" (eight metals with copper being the major constituent) and is being installed at the Vijay Vallabh Sadhana Kendra, Jetpura, in Rajasthan's Pali, an official statement said. The saint, who lived during 1870-1954, led an austere life, working selflessly and dedicatedly to spread the message of Lord Mahavira, it said. He also worked relentlessly for the welfare of the masses, the spread of education and eradication of social evils, wrote inspiring literature (poetry, essays, devotional hymns and stavans) and gave active support to the freedom movement and the cause of the swadeshi, the statement said. With his inspiration, more than 50 educational institutions of eminence, including colleges, schools and study centres, are operational across several states, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-to-unveil-statue-of-peace-in-rajasthan-on-nov-16-to-mark-151st-birth-anniversary-celebrations-of-jain-monk-915671.html
14-11-2020||North and Central||This Diwali, Delhi's air quality turns 'severe'; firecrackers add to misery||Delhi's air quality turned "severe" on Saturday with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution and firecracker emissions making the situation even worse. A layer of haze lingered over Delhi-NCR at night as people continued bursting firecrackers despite a ban, and calm winds allowing accumulation of pollutants. The level of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – was 331 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 10 pm, above the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3. The PM10 level stood at 494 µg/m3 at 10 pm, precariously close to the emergency threshold of 500 µg/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the "severe plus" or "emergency" category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 respectively for more than 48 hours. Earlier, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, had said that the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali was "likely to be the lowest" of the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt. However, it had said that even a small increase in local additional emissions is likely to have "a significant deterioration impact on Sunday and Monday". It said peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am and 6 am in case of additional internal emissions. The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 at 4 pm on Saturday. It soared to 454 by 10 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the "severe" category for three days on the trot. In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the "poor" category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the "severe" category on three consecutive days thereafter. In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the "severe" zone the next day. This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali. Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said. "However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an expected increase in the wind speed on Sunday," he said. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly. There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to "improve significantly" on Sunday. "Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph," it said. "Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday," the central agency said. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and the states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal's directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period. "In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on violation," it said. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in "poor" and above categories. "At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail," the NGT had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/this-diwali-delhis-air-quality-turns-severe-firecrackers-add-to-misery-915672.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||2020 shows why the Electoral College is stupid and immoral||Last year I wrote that the Electoral College, an archaic and outmoded system that runs contrary to our democratic principles and intuitions, was the “greatest threat to our democracy.” Somehow, this was an understatement. As recently as Wednesday, according to a report by my colleague Maggie Haberman, President Donald Trump was pressing his aides on whether Republican legislatures in key states could overturn the results of the presidential election and pick pro-Trump electors, potentially giving him a second term. It’s not likely, but the fact that it is even theoretically possible is one of the most starkly undemocratic elements of the Electoral College. If it actually happened, in 2020 or the future, it would mark the end of American democracy as we know it. If Americans chose their president by a national popular vote, the outcome would have been apparent from the time polls closed on the West Coast on Election Day. Late that night, Joe Biden held a strong lead in ballots cast, and since then it has only grown. As of Friday morning, the president-elect led the national tally with 77.8 million votes to 72.5 million for Trump, for a spread of 5.3 million votes. With plenty of outstanding ballots left to count in Democratic strongholds like New York and California, the gap will continue to grow. Of course, Americans don’t choose their president by national popular vote. They choose him (still him, for now) in 51 individual elections, nearly all of them winner-take-all, with special attention paid to those states competitive enough to make a difference in the fight for 270 electoral votes. No one designed this system — it bears little resemblance to the deliberative, temporary legislature empowered to pick a president described in the Constitution — but it’s what we have. It is because the outcome depends on results in individual states — and because those results are much narrower than the national tally — that Trump can claim there is a path to reversing the outcome of the election, however ridiculous that claim is. Allege enough fraud in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia and you might convince Republican state legislators to take matters into their own hands, embracing the view, first articulated by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in Bush v. Gore and then echoed in a recent opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that state legislatures have sole and exclusive power to decide election law and procedures. What could those lawmakers do? Under the Constitution, states can allocate electors — meaning electoral votes — in “such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.” Beginning after the Civil War, every state in the union has used direct popular election to choose electors. The modern process is straightforward. After the vote, election officials certify results and prepare “certificates of ascertainment” that establish credentials for each elector. There are multiple copies, and the governor signs each one. The electors meet, record their votes, and those votes, along with the certificates of ascertainment, are sent to state and federal officials, including the vice president, who will preside when Congress counts electoral votes early next year. If a state submits conflicting electoral votes, the House and Senate may choose which ones to accept or reject. Under the theory of legislative supremacy over elections, however, Trump-friendly state legislatures could possibly circumvent governors and election officials to create different slates of electors to send to Congress, forcing a choice between the people’s electors and those of the legislature. It’s a move that would almost certainly force the Supreme Court to intervene, creating confusion and — more important — the sense that the outcome of the election is genuinely unsettled. It has to be said that there is almost no chance of this happening. Pennsylvania Republicans have already ruled it out, and without the state’s electoral votes Trump has no reasonable path to a second term. Biden’s win was decisive, with hundreds of thousands of votes in five swing states separating him from Trump in the Electoral College. Republicans in Washington know this and have privately described their public statements (that the results are uncertain; that Biden is not yet president-elect) as one part performance art for a chief executive who cannot face reality, one part a strategy to gin up turnout for the upcoming pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will determine which party controls the Senate. But the thing about performance art is that it’s only effective when everyone knows it is a performance. Is every Republican in Michigan or Wisconsin in on the joke? Are Republican voters nationwide? If not, how can anyone really say they know when and how this game will end? The best odds are that come Jan. 20, Joe Biden will take the oath of office as the 46th president of the United States. Many Americans will want to breathe a sigh of relief. They shouldn’t. We are living through a period in which, for reasons of geographic polarization in particular, the Republican Party holds a powerful advantage in the Senate and the Electoral College, and a smaller one in the House of Representatives. Twice in 20 years they’ve won the White House without a majority of votes. A few shifts here and there, and Trump might have won a second term while losing by a popular vote margin nearly twice as large as the one he lost by in 2016. The Republican Party, in other words, can win unified control of Washington without winning a majority of the vote or appealing to most Americans. Aware of this advantage, Republicans have embraced it. They’ve pinned their political hopes on our counter-majoritarian institutions, elevated minority government into a positive good (rather than a regrettable flaw of our system) and attacked the very idea that we should aspire to equality in representation. “Democracy isn’t the objective; liberty, peace, and prosperity are,” Sen. Mike Lee of Utah tweeted last month. “We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.” “Rank democracy.” Perhaps Lee, one of the leading intellectual lights of the Republican Party, is alone in his contempt for political equality between citizens. But I doubt it. And a Republican Party that holds that view is one that will do anything to win power, even if it breaks democracy. It’s a Republican Party that will suppress voters rather than persuade them, degrade an office rather than allow the opposition to wield it and create districts so slanted as to make it almost impossible for voters to remove them from office. For that Republican Party, the Electoral College is a loaded gun, waiting to be fired. We’ll disarm and disassemble it as soon as possible, if we value this democracy of ours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/2020-shows-why-the-electoral-college-is-stupid-and-immoral-915410.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||A better tomorrow won’t fix India’s broken today||By Andy Mukherjee India’s currency is strong, the stock market is surging, and long-term interest rates are under control. The technical recession that blighted the June and September quarters is probably already over. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has rolled out the red carpet for industries ranging from automobiles and solar panels to speciality steel. The iPhone supply chain is keen to set up assemblies. So is it all looking up for India’s post-coronavirus economy? Hardly. The trouble is with demand. Firms are protecting operating profit — or preventing losses — by pruning jobs and cutting pay. The rupee hasn’t suffered the double-digit declines seen this year from Brazil and Argentina to Turkey and Russia. That’s because imports collapsed after Modi’s Covid-19 lockdown in March, and the trade deficit narrowed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has raised India’s equity-market rating to “overweight” on vaccine optimism, while the local bond market is sanguine because of austerity, mistimed as it is. Twelve large states, accounting for three-fourths of overall gross domestic product, may have to cut back capital expenditure by up to $36 billion in the fiscal year through March, ICRA Ltd., an affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service, estimates. How will the gap in private consumption and public investment get filled? The global economy is hardly in shape to absorb much new merchandise, and improving market share takes time. This week, the government approved $20 billion of production-linked incentives for 10 industries that could give India a better tomorrow. They’re spread over five years. They won’t help today. One obstacle is the low starting point. India’s exports never had much overseas value addition embedded in them, reflecting the country’s isolation from global supply chains. Over time, these “backward linkages” have weakened, according to economists at IDFC First Bank Ltd. The forward links — the value that India adds to products consumed globally — hasn’t gone anywhere, either. The contrast with China couldn’t be more striking:  To get into the game, India needs more than sops. The bureaucracy has to shed its deep-rooted, Soviet-era suspicion of imports. A country with $560 billion in foreign exchange reserves, or 20% of GDP, shouldn’t make it difficult to import tires and axles for firms re-exporting trailers. India is the second largest exporter of human hair. If wig-makers source shampoo and conditioners duty-free from overseas, they won’t exactly be bankrupting local soap makers who have 1.3 billion scalps to lather at home.  Asian exporting powerhouses, from South Korea to China, have addressed the issue of fair and fast tax rebates on imported inputs. Additionally, India’s goods and services tax rate on exports must be zero. After all, the GST is a levy on local consumption. Exporters shouldn’t have to tie up working capital chasing refunds, or get bogged down in unnecessary paperwork.  Some laws are changing. Cultivators have been given the freedom to sell produce outside of state-designated market yards. They can enter into contract farming agreements with buyers. As many as 44 federal labor codes have been consolidated into four. Over time, Indian firms should become bigger and more productive. Rapid adoption of digital technologies will boost competitiveness. Using 5G and the Internet of Things to check power theft will help lower tariffs for industrial customers. But these supply-side reforms won’t create their own demand. On Thursday, India said it will shoulder the burden of social security payments if private employers create new jobs at the bottom of the wage pyramid. Moves like this work well in developed economies. They don’t go far enough when a majority of workers don’t have provident fund accounts.  One way to stoke demand may be for the government to clear its overdue bills, says economist Indira Rajaraman. Take solar panels. For them to be made locally, renewable energy producers must ramp up investment after this year’s Covid disruption. For that, their customers — financially weak state distribution utilities — need to pay promptly. In BloombergNEF’s calculations, a one-year delay for half the payment makes the internal rate of return on a newly commissioned solar project fall below its cost of debt.  Government departments settling bills on time will ease a $27 billion logjam, improving the private sector’s cash flow and its capacity to take on new projects. Just doing this won't create the eight to 10 million jobs the country needs every year. India has to persuade investors to set aside its reputation as a tough place to do business. Only then will the supply side deepen and demand strengthen. About 10% of Modi’s financial incentives are earmarked for drugmakers. That’s just as well. Being able to supply a Covid vaccine to its own population and to other developing countries could give its manufacturing sector and the broader economy a confidence boost. With some luck, both today and tomorrow will look better.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/a-better-tomorrow-won-t-fix-india-s-broken-today-915424.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||Airlines are making money selling everything but tickets||By David Fickling With hopes that their season in hell could be approaching an end, airline stocks are on a tear. Shares in Singapore Airlines Ltd. jumped the most in 21 years Tuesday while those in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. were up the most since 2008 after Singapore and Hong Kong announced the opening of a travel bubble starting Nov. 22. News of successful trials of a Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE coronavirus vaccine pushed the Bloomberg World Airlines Index up 9.7% Monday in anticipation of an ebbing tide of pandemic. The cavalry better come quickly. Right now, much of the industry is running short of rations. With traffic down 73% from a year earlier in September — and international flights running at just 12% of their levels a year ago — the usual path for companies to bring in cash by eking out a margin on their revenue is still blocked. That could remain the case well into next year, given the likely bottlenecks to producing and distributing vaccines in quantities sufficient to reopen international travel.  Still, there’s more than one way to provision your army. If you can’t sell plane tickets, you can still try everything else that’s not nailed down.  The first thing companies try to sell in a crisis are bits of paper. Airlines have issued $88 billion in bonds so far in 2020, more than half of the $153 billion that the industry sold over the previous four decades put together, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Throw in the value of loans taken out and airlines’ total debt is up by $124 billion since the end of February, the data show. It’s a similar picture on the equity side. Japan Airlines Co. last week announced plans to raise as much as $1.6 billion by issuing shares equivalent to about a third of the existing register. Singapore Airlines' $6.5 billion rights issue in June represents the biggest raising of additional equity by any airline in history. The $27 billion in new shares issued by the industry as a whole this year is equivalent to all the cash raised through that route over the previous six years put together. In aggregate, all the new debt and equity sold by the world’s carriers this year amounts to nearly two-thirds of the $241 billion that the International Air Transport Association expects the industry to collect in passenger revenue through the whole year. Companies that own fleets of high-value transport equipment have other ways to get cash, too. EasyJet Plc raised $170 million this month from the sale and leaseback of 11 of its planes to aircraft leasing companies. Air Canada last month took in $365 million from a similar move and Wizz Air Holdings Plc and United Airlines Holding Inc. have done the same. The fundraising effort has been titanic. Compare the revenue of some of the world’s largest airlines in the most recent quarter with their cashflows from finance and investing, minus the capital expenditure that airlines usually have to commit well in advance, and you can see the picture clearly: Typically airlines should see cash outflows from finance and investing offset with an inflow from operating activities. That’s what you have with Chinese carriers, which have returned to some semblance of normality in recent months with the suppression of Covid-19. Elsewhere in the world, however, working the balance sheet has often been bringing in more money than selling transport services. You might regard that flexibility as a hopeful sign — but as we’ve argued, a miserable third quarter is likely to lead to a grim winter for airlines. Chances are there’s far more to come in terms of bankruptcies and restructuring. Getting the industry out from under its Covid-induced debt load could take the best part of a decade. Furthermore, while demand for tickets from air passengers is more or less an inexhaustible resource, there are only so many assets that a carrier can sell and lease back before it runs out. The orgy of bond and stock issuance this year is also likely to be leading to sharply diminishing appetites among creditors and shareholders. In spite of the slump in share prices, investors still show a surprising amount of enthusiasm for airlines. If only passengers felt the same way.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/airlines-are-making-money-selling-everything-but-tickets-915455.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||Coronavirus is worsening Delhi’s air pollution crisis||By David Fickling The thick smog that blankets northern India with the approach of winter has a particularly grim ally this year: Covid-19. Air pollution from the annual burning of rice stubble across the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab is reversing the gains that gave the north of the country its cleanest air in two decades under lockdown earlier this year. New Delhi’s air quality was running at levels considered hazardous for three consecutive days earlier this week, and the usual peak in pollution around the Diwali festival won’t even hit until Saturday. In Alipur in the north of the capital, an air quality index that conventionally tops out at 500 posted an off-the-charts reading of 851 Monday.  That’s particularly troubling given the evidence that air pollution is a major factor raising the risk of dying from coronavirus. The decline in pollution and road accidents under lockdown meant that Delhi, paradoxically, saw an improvement in overall mortality rates in the early months of the pandemic, because the baseline of deaths from normal economic activity is already so high. With polluted winter weather, restrictions being further relaxed, and a two-month fall in death totals levelling off in recent days, India’s remarkably effective public health efforts against Covid-19 are about to be put to the test. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Waves of smog as farmers burn off the residue of their monsoon rice harvest to make way for plantings of wheat and other winter crops have been common in recent years, but there’s a ready-made solution. The Happy Seeder, a tractor tool that allows crops to be sown directly without removing rice straw, was proposed as a miracle cure that could increase farmers’ profits as much as 20%, improve agricultural productivity, and eliminate the need for burning. Sales of Happy Seeders have boomed thanks to government subsidies and heavy promotion, but it’s not been enough to end the haze. Despite reports of fewer fires in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh this year and a smaller area burned in Punjab, the sheer number of fires in that state — the epicentre of India’s seasonal crop burning — is already the highest since 2016, turning satellite monitoring images of the region into a sea of red. Why hasn’t the Happy Seeder stopped this? It’s not been for any lack of demand. Sales of such advanced seeders are up 100-fold this year, according to Gurpreet Singh, joint head of marketing and sales at the Jagatjit Group of Industries, a farm-equipment manufacturer in Sangrur in Punjab. Unfortunately, that’s not enough to turn the tide, given the sheer volume of farms that need to convert. “It will take time to educate the farmers of my region,” he said. “70% of customers are still using traditional methods.” It’s possible that the pandemic itself is making matters worse. Farmers try to switch rice and wheat crops at this time of year as quickly as possible, but that depends on an army of more than a million migrant farmworkers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states to manage the work of burning and planting. The coronavirus has kept many of those them closer to home in 2020, pushing the fire season further into the still, cool winter months when particulate smog settles most persistently over the north Indian plain. Farmers who were reluctant to comply with government anti-burning orders in a normal year are even less likely to hold back now, according to ML Jat, principal scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in New Delhi. On top of that, booming sales of Happy Seeders still aren’t sufficient to cope with the scale of the problem. While around 15,000 of the attachments have been sold so far, about 40,000 need to be in operation across the region to have a decent chance of eliminating stubble burning, said Jat. At that point, he predicts, northern India may finally start to see the pollution relief it’s been promised — but that’s probably another two years away. It’s impossible to fix such a long-standing problem on a short timescale, said Jat: “The burning thing was not created overnight. It took decades.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/coronavirus-is-worsening-delhi-s-air-pollution-crisis-915462.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||Personal Finance: Advice for women avoiding money in marriage||By Farnoosh Torabi Another day, another study suggesting women are bad with money. A UBS Global Wealth Management survey of over 1,800 married men and women (including 50 same-sex married women) recently found that nearly half of the women — led by Millennials — defer major financial and investment decisions to their spouses. The wives cited reasons for this such as not wanting to argue, having “no idea where to begin” and believing their spouses are better with money. Close to 60% said simply that they wanted to be “taken care of.” While the sample of women in the study is narrow (the people surveyed were wealthy, with the lower end having at least $250,000 in investable assets), the financial imbalance in marriage that the findings underscore is hardly an anomaly. I’ve been reporting and writing at the intersection of money and relationships for over a decade, and I speak to hundreds of women each year about their money, often in the context of coupledom. Financial avoidance is a recurring narrative among women and wives, often passed down from previous generations. Now in the pandemic, with more women losing their jobs or dropping out of the workforce than men, traditional gender roles in marriage are increasingly at play, including deferring significant financial decisions to husbands. We already know the risks inherent to burying your head in the sand — things like getting a false sense of security, scrambling to piece together your finances when a spouse is no longer around or worse, and feeling financially trapped in a bad relationship. So let’s discuss tangible solutions. If you find yourself out of touch with your finances, here are steps to help you level the playing field with your partner. In the end, the goal is to arrive at a place where you feel like an active participant in the decisions that impact your financial life together. Go to the dark place. For just a moment imagine yourself suddenly left alone needing to manage your finances independently after years of being in the dark. Or consider wanting out of your relationship, with no idea about the current balances in your joint brokerage account, or even how to access them, to ensure assets get divided fairly. If, like some of the women in this study, you worry about not knowing where to begin today, think about how lost you’d be later if and when you really need to manage your investments, life insurance and will with your partner out of the picture. The facts are that women tend to live longer and are more likely to be alone in old age. We often face higher long-term care costs. This exercise isn’t meant to add anxiety to your life, but to provide the wakeup call necessary to understand the risk that comes with walking through your financial life blindfolded. Face the “what ifs” and you might be motivated to embrace your finances. Get back in the game. This will require a conversation with your partner, but it doesn’t have to be hard. Try something to the effect of: “I’ve been thinking, and starting this week (or month), I’d like to be more in touch with our finances. You’ve been doing a great job, but me taking a back seat, we both know, is not ideal. It doesn’t help you or me when I’m not knowledgeable about things.” Your partner should understand and be open to it. If not, explore why. In my experience, a spouse’s resistance to financial transparency and co-piloting big decisions can be an indication of larger issues. I hope this goes smoothly, but bottom line: You shouldn’t feel like you need to get “permission” to know how money’s getting managed. Start with access and transparency. Sharing a password-protected document that provides a list of all usernames and passwords to your financial accounts is an easy first step that promotes equal access to your shared financial life. From there, use an online tool that can help you see all account balances and cash flow in one place, like Personal Capital or Zeta. On your own time you can log in and review balances and become more familiar with the numbers. (Full disclosure: I am an investor in Zeta.) Make weekly strides. From here, expand your knowledge. Dedicate weekly time to touching base with your partner until you feel caught up. Your investments and long-term financial plan can be a lot to digest in one sitting, so pace yourself and commit to learning something new at each meeting. For example, the first can focus on retirement, specifically, your contributions, investment breakdown and exposure to risk. Are you 100% in stocks or just 60%? Are you comfortable with that? Week two can be about life insurance, followed by your will and then long-term care planning. Consider a pro. Working with a certified financial planner was instrumental in the beginning of my own marriage because it helped us create a financial road map, fill some insurance gaps and create an overall sense of accountability that we may not have had on our own. It was also helpful to have an objective individual in the room to give us highly qualified feedback and advice. If you’re worried about disagreements like some of the women surveyed, a good CFP can help calm the waters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/personal-finance-advice-for-women-avoiding-money-in-marriage-915603.html
14-11-2020||Opinion||The empty half of the glass may also be full||Finding an ant in the kitchen often triggers my sense of alarm, because for any ant I see there must be many more out of view. The same applies to many aspects of life, occasionally with greater consequences. Take scientific breakthroughs as an example. The 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in part for the first discovery of a Jupiterlike planet close to a sunlike star by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz in 1995. Searching for such a planet was proposed by Otto Struve in 1952, but it took four decades for mainstream astronomers to agree that a risky search for another planetary system so different from our own was worth the precious telescope time it would consume. Similarly, the revolutionary theory of continental drift advanced by Alfred Wegener in 1912, was rejected by mainstream geologists for four decades and only became popular after the mechanism of plate tectonics was recognized. In biology, the rules of genetic heredity formulated by Gregor Mendel in 1866 were ignored by the scientific community, rediscovered by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns three decades later, and eventually explained by the molecular chemistry of DNA almost a century after Mendel’s work. Such examples are often used to support the notion that the scientific method works and that the truth eventually prevails. But these success stories reflect a selection bias. For every case that barely made it to a successful end, there must have been many that never came to our attention since their value was never recognized. Bearing in mind the “ants in the kitchen” metaphor, there must have been many scientific innovations that were suppressed, and their originators bullied, because they were ahead of their time. That these breakthroughs never came to fruition constitutes a net loss to humanity. This lesson also reverberates throughout the professional life of scientists, including my own. My eventual focus on astrophysics was enabled by John Bahcall, who chose to offer an untrained foreigner like myself a five-year fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His generosity paid it forward three decades later—when I hired the brilliant, unrecognized scientist Manasvi Lingam as my postdoctoral fellow. My collaboration with Manasvi over the past four years blossomed into 35 papers and a forthcoming textbook. A similar but more extreme example involves the career of the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who produced groundbreaking theorems after being plucked out of obscurity based on the recognition of his raw talent by Godfrey Hardy of Cambridge University. There must be many Ramanujans in developing countries, who lack an opportunity to realize their talents. The same applies to artists and their creative work. Vincent van Gogh was considered a madman and a failure throughout his life, but his reputation changed to that of misunderstood genius when elements of his painting style were incorporated by expressionists several decades after his suicide in 1890 at age 37. Today, van Gogh’s paintings are among the most expensive ever to have sold. The writer Samuel Beckett did not get his first novel published and so he shelved it. The novel was eventually published in 1992, three years after Beckett’s death and 23 years after he was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in literature. In an even more unusual example, the extraordinary novelist Franz Kafka instructed his friend Max Brod to burn his literary writings after his death at age 40. If Brod had followed the instructions, Kafka’s remarkable writings would have been lost forever. How many works of art and literary treasures were lost this way from our collective memory? Darwinian selection based on the principle of short-term popularity does not necessarily favor the most significant human creations for the long run. Rather than assuming that our evaluation system functioned well in selecting the worthiest products of our civilization, historians of arts and sciences should dig into past records in search for lost treasures. Recognizing “unborn babies” and hearing their muted messages from our past should convince us to do better in the future. Most importantly, we should not use social media to bully those who are different among us but rather celebrate the innovation they bring. Constructive debates can nowadays be recorded online at a relatively low cost. During these turbulent times of polarization, it is crucial to cultivate tolerance to diversity of ideas. We must learn to listen and explain why we disagree, especially on matters of science where evidence serves as the ultimate arbitrator for disputes. “The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently,” wrote the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his 1881 book titled The Dawn of Day. The lesson from our troubled past is simple. We should nurture those who think creatively and use merit instead of the number of “likes” on Twitter to gauge the value of their insights. Private and federal funding agencies should establish scholarships to support brilliant individuals with insufficient education and adverse socioeconomic backgrounds. If we will not get our act together, advanced alien civilizations in search of intelligent life in the cosmos might downgrade us as not particularly intelligent and worthy of their attention. From their perspective, we might be a form of life as primitive and common in the cosmos as ants are in a kitchen. Through better behavior, it is in our power to exclude this possible explanation for not hearing from them—the so-called Fermi paradox.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-empty-half-of-the-glass-may-also-be-full-915663.html
14-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Love is what love does||Love they say is like an ocean, always there and yet always different. Holding on, embracing the unexpected and letting go are all facets of love. The moment we understand that love can look different at different times –we would have come closer to understanding it.  We brought ‘Prince’ our golden retriever home with a lot of love, however with a lot less thought.  He brought such delight into our lives that we temporarily forgot our imprudence. In my family, all of us either go to work or to school. Our absence, sometimes for as long as eight hours a day hit Prince badly despite all the toys and food. After a long day when Prince had too much energy in reserve and we had exhausted ours it was difficult to find an equilibrium. What began then were series of disappointing days for Prince and us.  The enormity of what we had done dawned on us when Prince fell ill. We took days off to take care of him and somehow nurtured him back to health, but we knew we could not leave him alone. Wondering what we needed to do next, I spoke about my predicament to my friends.  At-least two of them were willing to adopt him, however, firstly we were not ready to part with Prince and secondly I thought it would be an imposition on their lives. Uma, however, was quite adamant. A cheerleader for the underdog, literally in this case, she told me that her home provided the right environment for Prince. She already had Roca, a beagle, and her parents (dog lovers) stayed with her. Her not so big apartment exuded warmth and she reiterated that keeping prince would be a privilege. I marvelled at her positivity and readiness to embrace the uncertain with open arms. Prince fit into Uma’s home like he was always meant to be there.  She and her family loved him with such abandon, that Prince was happy and nurtured. At first we didn’t quite have the heart to visit him, however, when we did, we saw him buoyant.  I am forever indebted to my friend for transforming a weak moment in my life into a strong one.  Love asks us of different things. It asks us to be strong when we are most vulnerable, to be the head when you are all heart, to lose when you want to win. Once in a while however, it gives us back an Uma; who teaches us that love is not only something you say and feel, it is something you do.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/love-is-what-love-does-915374.html
14-11-2020||Second Edit||Encouraging sign of deepening democracy||The National League for Democracy, which spearheaded Myanmar’s struggle for democracy for decades, has won a resounding victory in elections to local and national bodies. This is its second victory in a row under the new constitution and the party has not only won a majority in parliament but also improved on its showing in the 2015 election. Clearly, the NLD still commands the overwhelming support of the people of Myanmar; it has won almost every seat in the Bamar-majority areas and has outperformed ethnic parties in the seven ethnic states. Voters have inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), a proxy of the country’s powerful military, the Tatmadaw. The USDP has won fewer seats than it did in 2015 and has performed poorly even in its former strongholds. As heartening as voter rejection of the military is the Myanmar Election Commission’s conduct of the elections. Holding elections amidst a pandemic was bound to be challenging, all the more so for a fledgling democracy. Yet, the MEC was successful in conducting an election that international monitors have endorsed as free and fair. But the gains democracy has made during the recent elections are in danger. USDP leaders have said that they will go to court over “some controversies surrounding the voting process.” Their rejection of the people’s mandate is disturbing, especially since they could be voicing the views of the Tatmadaw. A few days before the elections, the military threatened President U Win Myint with impeachment if he failed to “properly uphold constitutional responsibilities.” The military’s continued perception of itself as the supreme arbiter of power in Myanmar does not bode well for democracy. The NLD’s impressive electoral performance has been attributed to the immense popularity of its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Clearly, the support she enjoys has not diminished. But her popularity alone will not be enough to keep the NLD in power or ensure the health of democracy in Myanmar in the coming years. The NLD’s performance in power was underwhelming as economic problems persisted and national reconciliation with alienated ethnic nationalities made little headway during its first term at the helm. Indeed, the Rohingya problem worsened over the past five years and, worryingly, the NLD supported the Tatmadaw’s brutal military operations against the Rohingya Muslims. Many of the NLD’s failings in power can be attributed to the military’s reluctance to allow it to function. However, this cannot remain an excuse for underperformance in its second term at the helm.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/encouraging-sign-of-deepening-democracy-915371.html

The specified time period for bursting of crackers is between 8 PM and 10 PM on Deepavali day (Saturday). A fresh Government Order (GO) was issued on November 13, superseding a previous directive on November 12, which imposed an immediate ban on sale and use of firecrackers following HC directions. "In supersession of the orders issued in the G.O. 1st read above, Government keeping in view the orders of the Honble Supreme Court of India in the reference 2nd read above hereby order that only green crackers shall be sold and used. The timings for use and bursting of crackers is restricted to two hours i.e., 8.00 pm to 10.00 pm on Deepavali day," the GO said. The Member Secretary of Telangana Pollution Control Board shall initiate a special drive to contain air pollution from all sources in view of potential aggravation of Covid-19 and shall regularly monitor the air quality during the said period and upload in the respective website, the GO said. It said the state DGP, DG of Fire Services, Member Secretary of state Pollution Control Board, the district Collectors, Commissioners of Police and Superintendents of Police in the state shall take necessary action accordingly. On Friday, the Supreme Court had modified a Telangana High Court order imposing complete and immediate ban on sale of firecrackers in the state during Diwali, saying the directions of National Green Tribunal (NGT) on bursting of firecrackers keeping in mind the pollution level be followed. The NGT, on November 9, imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) till November 30 midnight. It had said the direction of complete ban will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in 'poor' and above categories. It, however, had said that in cities or towns where air quality is 'moderate' or below, only green crackers be sold. The Telangana High Court on November 12 came out with an order asking the state government to ban the sale and use of firecrackers and it was challenged by the Telangana Fire Workers Dealers Association (TFWDA) in the top court. Two other southern states-- Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, have allowed the use of green crackers during Deepavali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-government-permits-sale-use-of-green-crackers-915504.html

The entire pilgrimage would be through the virtual queue system this time, so the usual heavy rush can be regulated, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said after a high level meeting of officials to review the final preparations at the temple on Friday. Detailing various measures taken by the government to ensure a smooth pilgrimage in the wake of the pandemic, Surendran said that each pilgrim visiting the shrine should carry a Covid negative certificate, which was taken within the last 24 hours. Covid-19 testing kiosks would be opened at Pampa and Nilakkal, the base camps, to help devotees to carry out the test before beginning the trekking. Apart from this, arrangements would be made by the health department to make antigen tests in various centres including, all bus stands and railway stations at Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruvalla, Chengannur and Kottayam, where pilgrims arrive to proceed to the Lord Ayyappa temple, he said. Steps would be taken to ensure social distancing while allowing pilgrims for darshan. For this, specific place would be marked for each devotee, the minister said adding that those aged between 60- 65 years should submit a medical fitness certificate. Those testing positive for the viral infection, including those from other states, would be given adequate treatment until they turn negative. Treatment can be given in either government or private hospitals as per the demand of the pilgrims. All arrangements including the ambulance facility have been arranged in the government medical colleges in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam and also in the private hospitals in these districts, he said. Noting that mask was not mandatory for pilgrims while trekking, Surendran said the relaxation was according to the protocol that provided exemption during high physical activity, but, devotees should follow strict Covid protocol. Used masks should not be thrown away and arrangements would be made to collect and recycle it, official sources added. The two-month-long annual Mandalam-Makaravilakku season at the Sabarimala Lord Ayyappa Temple, located in Pathanamthitta district, would begin on November 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/covid-19-precautionary-measures-in-sabarimala-for-the-annual-mandalam-makaravilakku-season-915508.html
14-11-2020||South||Acting as per PMLA: ED tells Kerala govt on 'crossing the line' allegation||The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday responded to the Kerala government's allegations on the central agency crossing the limits by seeking details of its flagship projects stating that it was only acting as per the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Replying to a notice issued by the Kerala Assembly's Committee on Privileges and Ethics, the ED said that since the issue involved suspected hawala transactions and money laundering, it was empowered to seek details regarding the government projects. In his reply to the Kerala Legislative secretary, ED assistant director also said that the protections available for the Assembly were not applicable for the Life Mission, a campaign aimed at providing housing to the homeless in the state. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier accused the Enforcement Directorate of crossing the limits as the central agency sought details of the government's flagship projects like Life Mission and Kerala Fibre Optic Network (KFON) that aims to provide free highspeed internet to 20 lakh economically weak families. He also said that the government would resist the move. Close on the heels of that, CPM MLA James Mathew approached the Committee on Privileges and Ethics and the committee subsequently issued notice to the ED. Mathew's contention was that the Life Mission project was a policy decision announced in the Assembly to provide housing to all homeless on a time-bound basis and the ED intervention might affect the implementation of the project as a whole. While Mathew said that it was on the ethics committee to decide the further course of action, legislative secretariat sources said that the committee could either close the matter based on ED's reply or initiate a personal hearing of ED officials and the petitioner. The ED sought the details of the major projects as part of the probe against Kerala Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar. Sivasankar was suspected to have received huge commissions from many projects.  Vijayan had alleged that ED was putting key development projects under a cloud of suspicion as part of a ploy of the centre to sabotage Kerala's flagship development initiatives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/acting-as-per-pmla-ed-tells-kerala-govt-on-crossing-the-line-allegation-915554.html

Dismissing the findings, Isaac told reporters here that the state government will not allow the Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) to destroy KIIFB, the primary agency of the state government for financing large and critical infrastructure projects in the state, "They (CAG) claim that the KIIFB loans are unconstitutional. Since 1999, CAG had audited KIIFB nine times and prepared the audit report. This allegation was not raised anytime before this. The Indian Constitution is not a book which can be interpreted by any person, appointed as CAG, according to his political leanings," Isaac told reporters here. The CAG auditing for this year began in January and all the documents sought were submitted, he said, adding 76 audit queries were raised by the AG's office and detailed replies were given. Pointing out that KIIFB was a corporate body and like any other such institutions, he said it had the right to raise loans as per the existing rules. Corporate bodies of the central government have also availed such loans, he claimed. The CAG observation that KIIFB violates Article 293(1) of the Indian Constitution was baseless, he said. The Article deals with loans of the state government. The state government requires the permission of the centre for taking loans. But in this case, it's a corporate body that is taking the loan and not the state government, the minister said. Isaac also hit out at the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for bringing under its scanner various prestigious projects of the left government like Life Mission, K-FON, e-Mobility. Meanwhile, leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala attacked Isaac for making public details of the draft CAG report before it was tabled in the assembly. Noting that the findings of a CAG report comes in the public domain only after it is tabled in the House, he alleged that this was the first time a minister had released details of a CAG report concerning his ministry through a press conference before its tabling. Accusing Isaac of violating rules of the legislature, Chennithala said he will move a breach of privilege notice against the minister.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-finance-minister-thomas-isaac-hits-out-at-cag-for-faulting-kiifb-915592.html
14-11-2020||South||Telangana announces 50% waiver in domestic property tax||The Telangana government on Saturday announced a 50 per cent waiver in property tax to (domestic) house owners in Hyderabad and 140 other towns across the state as a Deepavali gift, in view of the financial difficulties being faced by people following the Covid-19 pandemic. "We decided to give some relief to people in the property tax (for the year 2020-21) in Hyderabad and towns across the state," state Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao told reporters here. He said several ministers, in a cabinet meeting held on Friday, sought more help to be extended to people in view of the adverse economic impact of Covid-19. Accordingly, as per the directives of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, the relief has been finalised, he said. He said house owners who pay property tax up to Rs 15,000 in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits would get a 50 per cent subsidy. The house owners in 140 other towns in the state who pay property tax up to Rs 10,000 would also get a 50 per cent subsidy. The move would benefit 13.72 lakh families in the GHMC limits and cost the government Rs 196.48 crore, he said. In other municipalities, 17.68 lakh families would benefit and it will cost the government Rs 130 crore. Altogether, 31.40 lakh families would get the benefit, amounting to Rs 326.48 crore, he said. The 50 per cent waiver would be adjusted next year for those who have already paid their property tax, he said. In another decision, Rama Rao, son of the Chief Minister, said those who have still not received the financial assistance of Rs 10,000 per household announced by the state government for those affected by recent heavy rains and floods in the city, can apply in the 'Mee Seva' citizen service centres. The state government has disbursed over Rs 475 crore to 4,75,871 lakh families till today. Rama Rao announced a salary hike of Rs 3,000 to sanitation workers in the city, which pushes up their wages to Rs 17,500 per month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/telangana-announces-50-waiver-in-domestic-property-tax-915636.html

We may chant Nehru's name saying he was the first prime minister. What's more important is how he brought the nation and people of all classes together,” Kharge said. “The problem is, one person says one thing and another says something else. We aren't united. With folded hands, I ask everybody to work together in the interest of the party and our ideology,” he made an appeal.  He said the BJP attacked Congress repeatedly with the hope that it would fuel differences and misunderstanding among us. “We shouldn't become victims with this,” the Rajya Sabha member said. He cited the example of how the BJP projected that there were differences between Nehru and Sardar Patel. “All of us, including me, clarified about this in Parliament. But, none of us took it forward whereas the BJP continues to spread misinformation and spoil people's minds.”  Kharge also said the Congress would not have a future if it failed to stick to its ideology. “Till our ideology doesn't come to the party seriously, we don't have a future.”  Kharge’s call for unity within the party comes amid reports that the Congress in Karnataka was divided into factions.  Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah attacked the RSS and urged party workers to study history in order to counter any lie. “We shouldn’t become weak-minded listening to the lies of the BJP and RSS.

This move could gain significance ahead of the bye-election to the Basavakalyan assembly constituency, where Marathas are said to form a good number of voters. The bypoll is yet to be announced. In a note to Additional Chief Secretary (Backward Classes Welfare) Gangaram Baderiya, Yediyurappa stated the Maratha population in the state was significant enough to focus on their financial, social, educational and religious development. He further ordered that Rs 50 crore be set aside for the Maratha Development Authority with the concurrence of the Finance department. In a similar move, the government notified the creation of a Kadu Golla Development Board just ahead of the bye-election to the Sira constituency, which the BJP won. The BJP has already hit the drawing board to plan its strategy to win Basavakalyan, a seat located in the Bidar district of the Kalyana Karnataka region. The constituency will have a bypoll due to the recent death of its legislator B Narayan Rao of the Congress. The constituency is dominated by the Lingayat community to which Yediyurappa belongs. However, Rao was not a Lingayat; he belonged to the backward fishermen community who supported the demand of Lingayats to recreate 12th century social reformer Basavanna’s concept of Anubhava Mantapa. There is talk that Yediyurappa’s son and BJP vice-president BY Vijayendra should contest the Basavakalyan bypoll. However, Yediyurappa has ruled out Vijayendra’s candidature.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-orders-creation-of-maratha-development-authority-915595.html
14-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka keeps law on job quota for locals at bay||Earlier this month, the BJP-ruled Haryana enacted a law to reserve 75% jobs for locals in private sector jobs, which was inspired by a similar legislation passed by Andhra Pradesh in 2019.  Karnataka, where the BJP is in power and there are calls to provide quota in jobs for locals, seems to have internal contradictions on such a move.  Although the Constitutional validity of such laws remain challenged in court, Haryana's move has revived the debate in Karnataka where this has been tried before.  That jobs should be reserved for locals dates back almost three decades when the Sarojini Mahishi report recommended this. Last year, the B S Yediyurappa administration had drafted a legislation to provide 75% reservation to Kannadigas in industries, MSMEs, joint ventures and public-private partnerships. This is yet to see the light of day.  The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government had moved to provide 100% reservation in all private industries, excluding IT-BT sector, which did not take off because the Law department vetoed it for violating Constitutional provisions under Articles 14 and 16.  Law Minister J C Madhuswamy told DH that the government had already "reserved" jobs that came under groups C and D (blue-collared) in industries set up on government land. "However, exceeding reservation above 45% goes against the state's constitutional obligations," he said. Madhuswamy's doubt notwithstanding, the government has tried to pacify the pro-Kannada camps by announcing 70% reservation in Class A & B jobs and 100% reservation in other categories under the new Industrial Policy. "All new projects will come up under the new reservation parameters and the process has started already," Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said, adding that new approvals are being done based on the policy.  Besides Constitutional limitations, mandating such quota would result in a “bureaucratic nightmare”, according to Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FKCCI) president Perikal M Sundar. "Under such a law, special permission should be sought from the government if a company has less than 75% local employees. This leads to a lot of logistical complications, as it is not necessary that all expertise required to run a firm or a factory is available locally," he explained. Also, such laws run counter to the 'ease of doing business’ initiatives that the Centre is pushing, Sundar said. "Though reasonable restrictions to provide up to 50% reservation is fine, a higher limit is against the well-being of a company, which should be empowered to make its own appointments," he added. It's retrograde, says DyCM Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan, who heads the IT/BT department, concurred and said companies would prefer states with fewer regulations of this kind. He even called it 'retrograde'.  Pro-Kannada outfit Karnataka Rakshana Vedike's president T A Narayana Gowda argued that providing reservation to locals was essential to tackle unemployment and that there was no shortage of skilled personnel in the state. "Since these industries enjoy all facilities from the government, we have some right to demand jobs," he said, adding that the percentage of Kannadigas in the IT sector was only about 30%. "In some companies, it's just 7-8%."   The government has already reserved jobs that came under groups C and D (blue-collared) in industries set up on government land. However, exceeding reservation above 45% goes against the state's constitutional obligations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-keeps-law-on-job-quota-for-locals-at-bay-915607.html

Though important festivals are lined up this month, the KSRTC and the BMTC employees have not received the salary as the corporation has been running in huge losses due to the coronavirus lockdown and the limited passengers allowed to maintain social distancing. Speaking to reporters in Belagavi, Savadi, who holds the transport portfolio, said, "There were some issues related to the payment of salaries but it will be resolved in the next three or four days." Savadi said the department has incurred massive loss due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The salaries were borne by the state government for the next two to three months but after that it was agreed upon by the state government and the transport department to share the burden of salaries of employees at a ratio of 75 and 25 respectively. "With that arrangement, we paid four months salary but this month is a big challenge because our revenues have dried up and we are running in loss. When we sent the proposal to the Finance Department to bail us out as per the agreement, they returned it," Savadi said. According to him, the proposal has been sent to the finance department again. Sources in the transport department said the annual spending on salaries is around Rs 325 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/issue-over-pay-for-bus-crew-will-end-soon-karnataka-deputy-cm-laxman-savadi-915613.html

The state government had initially ordered a blanket ban on fireworks this time, but it permitted the usage of green crackers after it came under criticism from various quarters. The government had said that only those firecrackers with QR code showing green crackers should be sold and purchased. On Monday, the officials launched a crackdown on many cracker shops in many urban areas of the state, including Bengaluru, Mysuru, Dharwad, Belagavi and Hubballi-Dharwad, for selling the banned crackers. The cracker-sellers pleaded, but to no avail. The banned firecrackers were taken away by the police. The coronavirus fear was quite palpable in the market as there was not much noise this time. The festivities were restricted to decorating the house with lamps and festoons, and distributing sweets, fruits, flowers and clothes, said traders PTI spoke to.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/low-key-deepavali-in-karnataka-under-covid-19s-shadow-915646.html
14-11-2020||West||Covid-19: Rapid Antibody tests are easier and cheaper to perform, says Dr Gilada||Ten months into the Covid-19 global pandemic, India has done 12.3 crore RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen tests, with almost 9% of its population being covered. However, what is lacking is a better understanding and applicability of Rapid Antibody tests. According to Dr IS Gilada, an infectious diseases specialist and leading HIV/AIDS consultant, the Rapid Antibody tests need to be enhanced. The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction or the RT-PCR is considered the gold standard as far as detection of the Covid-19 infection is concerned. Similarly, Rapid Antigen tests reveal if a person is currently infected with a pathogen such as the Covid-19 virus. Once the infection is gone, the antigen disappears. However, Rapid Antibody tests can help us to track the spread of disease, giving a more accurate representation of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Gilada, who is Secretary-General, People's Health Organisation (India) and President, AIDS Society of India, said that we need to think out of the box. “Until now, the Indian government decided to use it only for surveillance purposes by doing minuscule few thousand tests each month for the last six months. Without undermining the importance of the RT-PCR tests; which is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of Covid-19 globally, the time has come to widen the usage of the Covid-19 Rapid Antibody test that is easier and cheaper to perform and yet provide vast insights that can be crucial in managing the pandemic and brining the society back on track,” he said. According to him, the Rapid Antibody test is easy to perform, is done on a drop of blood through a finger prick or on sera - part of blood used for several tests. The patient need not go through the painful procedure of nasal swab. “It shows two bands –IgM shows a current infection, IgG shows a past infection,” said Dr Gilada. He also said that the Rapid Antibody test has its own importance. “It can help in recruitment and getting people back to work including those with co-morbidities. Surgery, dialysis, chemotherapy, delivery – if Rapid Antibody Test positive, no need to do RT-PCR and no need to wait for such procedures,” he said. Added Dr Gilada, “This is a truly point-of-care (POC) test, done on a drop of blood with a finger prick, can be done by anyone, on anyone, and anywhere with result in just 10 to15 mins. It is low cost and the government can intervene to get the cost further reduced, as it is a cartridge-based test but sold at a very high price by manufacturers. Other such tests for HIV, Hepatitis B, and C, Syphilis, Malaria, Dengue are available for less than Rs.100, but these are sold at over Rs 300 per test.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-rapid-antibody-tests-are-easier-and-cheaper-to-perform-says-dr-gilada-915464.html
14-11-2020||West||Maharashtra celebrates Diwali in toned-down manner amid Covid-19||Diwali, the festival of lights, is being celebrated across Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra on Saturday with fervour, but in a subdued manner under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. This year, Laxmi Pujan, the main day of Diwali, and Naraka Chaturdashi, are being celebrated on the same day on Saturday. In Maharashtra, families celebrate this day by getting up early in the morning and having an 'abhyanga snan' (ritual bath) as per the custom. People light earthen lamps, adorn the balconies with 'akash kandil' (sky lantern) and colourful rangoli patterns are drawn at the entrance of houses. Early morning 'Diwali Pahat' cultural programmes in major cities across Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nashik, have become an integral part of the festival. However, these programmes were missing this year due to the coronavirus outbreak. Nevertheless, some organisations conducted online programmes, like musical events and interviews. Masunda Lake in Thane city and Phadke Road in Dombivli (in Thane district) are famous spots for such programmes, where people gather in large numbers to enjoy the cultural extravaganza. However, such celebrations were cancelled this year due to the pandemic. Even as the Maharashtra government has not banned firecrackers, the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced a ban on the use of crackers and fireworks in the city to curb the spread of coronavirus. The civic body has, however, allowed the use of 'mild firecrackers' on Laxmi Pujan, saying Mumbaikars can use anar (cracker known for a sparkling display and showers of coloured sparks upwards) and 'fulzadi' (sparklers) at their private premises. In a recent review meeting with senior Covid-19 task force members on the preparedness for a possible second wave, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had said firecrackers could have an adverse effect on lungs. Maharashtra has so far recorded 17,40,461 coronavirus positive cases, while 45,809 people have so far died due to the infection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-celebrates-diwali-in-toned-down-manner-amid-covid-19-915505.html
14-11-2020||West||Places of worship in Maharashtra to open from November 16||The places of worship in Maharashtra will be reopened to the public from Monday. Coinciding with the Diwali festivities, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray made the formal announcement on Saturday. Places of worship of all religions were shut for public in March after Covid-19 pandemic broke out in India. While slowly and slowly other states opened places of worship, the issue has snowballed into a major political issue with the BJP staging protests against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government demanding reopening of temples. There was also a spat between Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Thackeray – and even the Centre took note of the issue. Last month, in a letter to Thackeray, Koshyari said: “….You have been a strong votary of Hindutva. You have publicly espoused your devotion for Lord Rama by visiting Ayodhya after taking charge as Chief Minister. You visited Vitthal Rukmini Mandir in Pandharpur and performed the puja on Ashadi Ekadashi. I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of the places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turn ‘secular’ yourself, the term you hated.” Thackeray, however, shot back writing to him: “You have taken oath as a Governor…and secularism is a part of the Constitution. However, I don’t need a certificate on Hindutva from anybody, nor do I have to learn it from anyone. Those giving a warm welcome to people who compare my state and its capital (Mumbai) with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir don’t fit in my Hindutva.” In the wake of the governor's letter, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi complaining about the kind of language the Governor used in the letter. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has snubbed the Governor saying: “I have read the letter. He has made a passing reference. I believe some restraint could have been exercised”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/places-of-worship-in-maharashtra-to-open-from-november-16-915521.html

He was 92. He breathed his last on Friday, the official said. Fialho is survived by his wife, sons, daughter and grand children. His last rites were performed at St Andrews Church in Bandra, he said. Fialho had detected several cases, but he is best remembered for the arrest of serial killer Raman Raghav, for which he was awarded with the President's Police Medal. Fialho, who was a police sub inspector (PSI) posted at Dongri Police Station at that time, had apprehended Raghav from Bhendi Bazar area of South Mumbai in 1968. After the arrest, Raghav had confessed to committing at least 41 murders. Most of his victims were pavement and hut dwellers. Raghav terrorized Mumbai between 1966 and 1968, during which he bludgeoned to death several poor men and women with a hard and blunt object like an iron rod while they were asleep, police said. Fialho had apprehended Raghav in September 1968 merely on the basis of suspicion, a police official said. "The police had launched a nationwide hunt for Raghav. PSI Fialho had studied the serial killing case and he used to carry the photo of Raghav along with him," he said. "When Fialho spotted Raghav in Mumbai, the latter was in blue shirt, khaki pant and canvas shoes. Raghav was carrying an umbrella. As Fialho wanted to see his reaction on spotting a police officer in uniform, he went close to Raghav. But on seeing him, Raghav crossed him and walked calmly," the official said. "Fialho then turned around and started following him. After walking some distance, he tapped Raghav on his back and asked him to come with him. As the umbrella that Raghav was carrying was wet although it was not raining in that area, Fialho verified and found out that it was raining in Malad suburb," he added. "He was informed that the man with that description was last spotted in Malad area. He then took Raghav to police quarters in Dongri for interrogation, where he identified himself as Sindhi Dalvai. On verification, it came to light that this was one of Raghav's assumed name and fingerprints experts also confirmed his identity," the official said. Talking to PTI, retired Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Suresh Walishetty said that Raghav's arrest was widely published in the national media at that time. "Fialho was a very professional, knowledgeable and skilful police officer. He had the responsibility of handling cases of political importance at that time," said Walishetty, who worked under Fialho in 1980-82, when the latter was a senior police inspector in the crime branch. After that, Fialho got promoted as ACP in Colaba division, he said, adding that he will always be remembered for the arrest of Raghav. "The then Mumbai Police Commissioner E S Modak, who was happy with the arrest of Raghav, had even announced a cash reward of Rs 1,000 for Fialho," he said. Raghav died in 1995 due to kidney failure at Sassoon General Hospital in Pune.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/retired-cop-known-for-serial-killer-raman-raghavs-arrest-dies-915539.html

Pawar, who will turn 80 on 12 December, says there is no question of exhaustion or giving up. In a letter to Shardabai Pawar, who passed away several years ago, Pawar said that he follows the mantra to keep on working and fighting for causes. Pawar’s mother Shardabai was a member of District Local Board in Pune while father Govindrao Pawar was instrumental in starting sugar cooperative mills in Baramati region. The four-time Maharashtra chief minister and two-time union minister, who had also served as leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha, said: “You travelled long distances, with the little babies on your side… Knowingly or unknowingly, all these qualities were imbibed in me which enabled me to perform satisfactorily in my public life.” In the letter, Pawar recalled how she lost one leg because of a bull attack, but kept herself engaged in public service. “It was on the strength of that inspiration that I decided to rise again and travelled extensively to the remotest corners of Maharashtra. I felt a surge of new youthful energy,” he said. Referring to last year’s rally at Satara during which he was drenched in rains, he said: “I even braved the heavy rains during my Satara rally which seeped into the peoples’ soul and translated as votes. New political equations were formed and our (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government took office. When the new government took oath, I remembered how you guided me before I filed the nomination papers for my first-ever election,” Pawar penned. Pawar started off the letter saying - “Sorry for the late letter!” – and signed off as “Sharad”. He also urged “Bai” (his mother) to take care of herself and  “Aba” (his father). Talking about the new generation, he said: ““Bai… Even your grandchildren are making waves in different fields, I am sure you must be proud of us… We follow your tradition of the annual Diwali get-together in Diwali, but we miss you very much today.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sharad-pawar-pens-emotional-letter-to-mother-shardabai-915552.html
