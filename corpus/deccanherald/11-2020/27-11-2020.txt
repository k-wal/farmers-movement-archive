The bus was bound for Ooty from Bengaluru. The iron bar that was used to open and close the gate at the checkpost was snapped after a lorry ran over it two days ago. The bus could not move as the bar got stuck below the vehicle. This caused heavy traffic jams on the route for more than an hour. Movement of vehicles is banned between 9 pm and 6 am on the route. As the bus was stuck midway, vehicles were stranded for more than two kilometres. However, highway patrol employees rushed to the spot, lifted the bus with a crane to remove the rod and cleared the traffic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ksrtc-bus-gets-stuck-on-ooty-mysuru-bandipur-route-causes-traffic-jam-920650.html

Speaking after distributing cows to the beneficiaries of Farmers’ organisation and Milk producers’ unit at Nagapura Tribal Rehabilitation Centre in Hunsur taluk, Mysuru district on Thursday, he said that there are significant changes among the tribals who moved out of the forest two decades ago. The Union government has released Rs 4.16 crore for the tribals to take up agricultural activities.

27-11-2020||Karnataka Politics||Amit Shah dials BSY, Lingayat OBC plan put on hold||Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday agreed to defer a decision on including the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community in the central OBC list under pressure from his own Cabinet colleagues who warned against moving hurriedly on this subject. But the prospect of such a huge decision was enough to get the attention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who spoke with Yediyurappa over phone early in the morning. “Due to various reasons, a decision on Veerashaiva-Lingayats will be taken after I visit Delhi to discuss this. Even my Cabinet colleagues are of this view. This will be a special decision that will need discussion,” Yediyurappa told reporters before the Cabinet meeting. Asked about his Cabinet expansion, Yediyurappa said: “It’ll happen in 2-3 days. I just spoke to Amit Shah. They will send (the list of new ministers).”   It is said that Shah told Yediyurappa that the proposal to recommend OBC status for Veerashaiva-Lingayats would need discussion within the party before any decision is made. Apparently, Yediyurappa expressed his ire over the BJP central leadership dragging its feet on approving the expansion of his Cabinet, saying the delay was undermining the chief minister’s office. At present, Veerashaiva-Lingayats are considered backward class in Karnataka and come under Category 3B with a 5% reservation based on income. Their inclusion as OBC in the central list will give them space in 27% reservation in Central government services and Central educational institutions. This move was politically loaded with ramifications, especially for Yediyurappa amid buzz that he could be replaced. It is believed that this would have further consolidated Yediyurappa’s standing within the community that is estimated to form about 16% of the state's population. Briefing reporters, Law Minister JC Madhuswamy that Yediyurappa was convinced that the government should go slow on this. “At present, only 16 sub-castes of Veerashaiva-Lingayats are considered OBC in the central list, which is wrong. There are sub-castes in other major communities that have been left out, such as Kunchitigas among Vokkaligas. So, we told that CM that we should move a holistic proposal to recommend central OBC status for all such communities that have been left out,” Madhuswamy explained. “We will ask for anthropological studies and certification of backwardness of all such communities that are seen as forward, but are actually backward,” he said. Inclusion of any community in the central OBC list will require a formal proposal from the state government to the National Commission for Backward Classes, Madhuswamy pointed out. He also defended the timing of the proposal being brought before the Cabinet. “Since 1994, when only 16 sub-groups of the Veerashaiva-Lingayats were considered as OBC in the central list, there have been efforts to get the entire community to be seen as backward. We’re just asking for a share in the central quota for this community. Why is it being treated as a national crime?” Of late, Yediyurappa has been bullish on community-specific measures while showing a sense of urgency in making political appointments to state-run companies. He ordered the establishment of the Maratha Development Corporation, following it up with the Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation. All these moves were superimposed with talks of his replacement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/amit-shah-dials-bsy-lingayat-obc-plan-put-on-hold-920454.html

During his final days at the hospital, the state's longest-serving chief minister had told the doctors that he wanted to visit Titabor, and then the other parts of the state, and call a press conference to tell people about the dreams that he had nurtured, Gaurav told reporters after performing the last rites of his father. "He had a strong desire to visit his constituency, which he had not been able to do due to the illness, and then travel across the state to meet people and to understand their problems," the Lok Sabha MP from Kaliabor said. The veteran leader's family has decided to "fulfil his last wish by taking his ashes to Titabor and then to Brahmaputra and Barak Valleys, Upper and Lower Assam and the North Bank", he said. "My father may not be present with us but his ideals, dreams and aspirations for the youth, for the bright future of rural people and the well-being of all sections will continue to be with us. As a son, it will be my responsibility to fulfil the dreams that he had," the Lok Sabha Deputy Leader of the Congress said. He thanked the people of the state for showering their love on his father and coming out in such large numbers to pay their last respects to him. He also expressed his gratitude to party chief Sonia Gandhi for her letter of condolence, leader Rahul Gandhi for personally coming to pay his homage and meeting his mother, AICC General Secretary and in-charge of Assam for attending the last rites, and everyone who helped ensure that necessary arrangements were made and rituals conducted smoothly. There comes a time in one's life, "when we lose our guardians and this is the truth of life. In my case, I am not feeling sad but my heart and mind is at peace. I am sure that with all the love, honour, respect and blessings showered on my father by the people of the state, his soul will rest in peace," he added. The 84-year old three-time chief minister and six-time Lok Sabha MP died on November 23 after a nearly-four-month battle with coronavirus infection and post-Covid complications.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tarun-gogois-ashes-to-travel-across-assam-says-son-gaurav-920309.html
27-11-2020||National||DH Deciphers | Why are farmers from Haryana and Punjab marching towards Delhi?||Farmers in Punjab have been protesting since September 24 when Parliament passed three new farm sector laws. The three laws, described as much-awaited reforms by the Modi government, allow farmers to sell their produce beyond traditional APMC markets, enter into contract farming with adequate safeguards and abolish stock limits of essential commodities except under extraordinary circumstances.   Farmers fear the laws could lead to the abolishment of the minimum support price system and end the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets. They are also demanding the withdrawal of amendments to the Electricity Act, contending that they could lead to an increase in power tariffs. The November 26-27 protests by farmers are in response to the ‘Chalo Delhi’ call given by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), and over 500 organisations are supporting it. Here's all you need to know:  Didn't the Punjab assembly pass the bills to negate the Centre’s farm laws? The Punjab assembly did unanimously pass three bills to negate the impact of the farm laws but they have to be approved by Governor V P Singh Badnore and President Ram Nath Kovind. The governor is yet to refer the bills to the President.  Farmer organisations are happy with the Punjab government's move but they believe it's a symbolic gesture as it is yet to be approved by the Centre. The agitation is also stronger in Punjab, a Congress-ruled state, prompting the BJP to accuse Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of supporting the protests.  Aren't farmers from other states protesting? Farmer organisations from Punjab, Haryana, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have responded to the 'Chalo Delhi' call given by the AIKSCC and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. Farmers have been moving in convoys towards Delhi. Governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana erected barricades at the borders with Rajasthan, Punjab and Delhi to prevent the march of farmers to the national capital citing the pandemic. Delhi police, who report to the home ministry, had cancelled the permission for protests and rallies at the Ram Lila Maidan on November 27. Farmer organisations have also planned localised actions with protests in state capitals and district headquarters. A protest march was planned to the Raj Bhavan in Jharkhand and a Grameen Karnataka Band call was given by farmer organisations.  District-level protests were also planned in Telangana, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Farmer organisations have also threatened to lay an indefinite siege to the national capital if their demands were not met. The Centre has rejected calls to roll back the three laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed that the three laws would transform Indian agriculture by setting farmers free from the clutches of middlemen while selling their produce in wholesale markets. Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Food Minister Piyush Goyal held one round of talks with farmer leaders from Punjab on November 13 while another meeting is scheduled for December 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dh-deciphers-why-are-farmers-from-haryana-and-punjab-marching-towards-delhi-920330.html

A short-circuit is said to have caused the fire. This is the second deadly incident in which coronavirus patients were burnt to death in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Earlier in August, eight patients had succumbed in a similar incident in Ahmedabad. Fire officials said that the fire broke out in the ICU of Uday Shivanand hospital in Mavdi area, where a total of 33 patients were admitted. Officials said that the fire broke out at around 12:30. The victims have been identified as Nitin Dadani, 61, a resident of Morbi, Ramsinh Loha, 62, a retired Assistant Sub-Inspector and a resident of Jasdan, Rasiklal Agrawat, 69, a resident of Gondal, Sanjay Rathod, 57, a resident of Rajkot and Keshu Akbari, 50, a resident of Rajkot.  "Five patients have died in the incident. Prima facie, it seems that the short circuit was the reason but it needs a detailed inquiry," Rajkot district collector Ramya Mohan told DH. Officials said that the condition of one of the six injured patients remains critical. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who happens to be from Rajkot, ordered IAS officer AK Rakesh, additional chief secretary, Panchayats, Rural Housing and Rural Development, Gandhinagar, to probe the incident. Rupani also announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to be given to the family of the deceased. Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda termed the probe as an "eyewash" and said that "This is the fifth such incident in the past few months which shows the failure of the government." In August, eight Covid-19 patients were killed in a similar incident at Shrey hospital in Ahmedabad. The police arrested the managing trustee of the hospital Bharat Mahant who was released on bail hours after his arrest. He was booked for causing death due to criminal negligence, section 304A of IPC, triable by a magisterial court. Meanwhile, the police has registered a case of accidental death and set up a special investigation team to probe the incident.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/5-covid-19-patients-killed-as-fire-breaks-out-at-gujarat-hospital-920351.html

Adhikari, who is the state transport minister, had served his resignation from the post of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) chairman on Wednesday night, according to sources in the state government.The state government on Thursday appointed Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee as the new incumbent. Banerjee was appointed to the post with "immediate effect" in an order issued by the state transport department on Thursday evening. The development came just a day after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also the TMC supremo, announced at a rally in Bankura that she is the sole observer of the party in all the districts of the state. Sources close to, Adhikari, who has been maintaining a distance with the party and has not attended state cabinet meetings for some months, said he is unhappy with the organisational rejig effected a few months ago. They said he was not comfortable with the idea of scrapping the post of the district observer as he was party's in-charge in various districts. Although both Adhikari and the TMC top brass remained tight-lipped about his resignation from the HRBC, a senior TMC leader said "A war of nerves has begun between the leadership and Adhikari". Adhikari, who also holds charge of the irrigation department. "Yesterday our party chief had said that she is the observer (of TMC) in various districts. It seems Suvendu did not like it and gave a reply through his resignation. Now it's a war of nerves. But we are hopeful of solving the situation," a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity. TMC has opened backchannel talks with Adhikari and is trying to address his grievances to retain him in the party. TMC MP Sougata Roy along with senior party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay has been assigned by the party to talk to him. The two rounds of talks between the ruling TMC and Suvendu Adhikari have remained inconclusive and more meetings are likely to take place soon, the sources said. Adhikari has been organising rallies and meetings without party banner and flags in various parts of the state for the last one month. Apart from East Midnapore district from where he hails, Adhikari influences about 35-40 assembly constituencies of West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Jhargram districts which fall in the tribal Jangalmahal area and parts of Birbhum district. Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are due in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cracks-in-tmc-widens-as-suvendu-quits-state-corporation-920362.html

The aircraft, a two-seater trainer version, was operating at sea when it was ditched at about 5 pm on Thursday. “While one pilot was rescued, the second pilot Cdr Nishant Singh is still missing. A massive search involving ships and aircraft have been launched. But there is no information so far. An inquiry to investigate the incident has been ordered," a Navy spokesperson said. This is the third accident of the Russian-origin combat jets in the last one year. On November 16 last year, a MiG-29K trainer crashed in south Goa. Three months later on February 23 another trainer crashed after being hit by birds over Goa. Fortunately, in both cases, both the pilots had ejected safely. In January 2018, a naval MiG-29K fighter aircraft veered off the runway and caught fire inside INS Hansa, the naval base that houses the naval combat platforms. New Delhi purchased 45 such naval fighters from Russia at a cost of Rs 10,409 crore a decade ago and the first MiG-29K squadron was commissioned in Goa in August 2013. However, in a 2016 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out the MiG29K fighter jets had operational deficiencies due to defects in engines, airframe and fly-by-wire equipment. Further, the aircraft continues to suffer from low serviceability. INS Vikramaditya was part of the second phase of the Malabar exercise involving navies of India, the US, Australia and Japan. The MIG-29K fleet onboard the aircraft carrier was also involved in the mega naval drill that took place from November 17-20.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mig-29k-trainer-aircraft-ditched-search-for-1-missing-pilot-on-920372.html

The Delhi Police used tear gas shells to disperse a group of farmers who had reached the Singhu border, while at the Tigri border security personnel used water cannons to disperse farmers trying to enter the national capital. Plumes of smoke were seen as security personnel used multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesting farmers at the Singhu border. At the Tigri border, farmers clashed with police and also tried to remove a truck, which was placed as a barricade, by tying it to a tractor with the help of a chain. Multi-layer barricading was in place at the Singhu border --- a direct route from Punjab to Delhi --- to prevent farmers from entering the national capital. Drones are also being used by security personnel to keep a strict vigil on the movement of protestors in bordering areas. A police officer said, "We are using tear gas to disperse protesting farmers. We are also informing them that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, any kind of rally and dharna is not allowed." "They have been denied permission and legal action will be taken against them if they still try to enter Delhi," the officer further said. In view of the march, the Delhi Police has sought permission from the AAP government to use the city's nine stadiums as temporary jails, government sources said. Traffic was disrupted in many parts of the city due to the protest.  Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Friday posted a series of tweets asking people to avoid outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK road, NH-44 and Singhu Border in view of the 'Delhi Chalo' march by farmers from Punjab against the farm laws. "In view of the rally/ march/protest by All India Kishan Sangharsh co-ordination committee, the traffic police is diverting traffic from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy in this area," it said The traffic police also requested commuters to avoid Mukarba Chowk Delhi as there is diversion and vehicles are not allowed towards Singhu border. However, the inter-state vehicles are advised to take Western/Eastern peripheral expressway.  "Tikri border is completely closed for traffic movement by local police. Traffic intending to go towards Haryana is also closed. All motorists are advised to avoid this route in view of the protest by Kishan Sangharsh committee," the Delhi Traffic Police said in another tweet. In view of the march, checking of vehicles has also been intensified at the Delhi-Gurgaon border leading to heavy traffic jams.  Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. Tension was escalating at all the border points. Farmers have assembled near the borders in tractor-trolleys laden with rations and essentials for the march. Authorities in Haryana have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of the protesters. Farmers' bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital. Punjab farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on the minimum support price.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-delhi-police-fire-tear-gas-shells-to-disperse-farmers-at-singhu-border-920399.html

In September, RDIF tied up with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for a clinical trial of Sputnik-V on 1,600 Indians besides functioning as a distributor of the imported stock. “DRL is doing clinical trials and will handle the distribution as they have a contract for receiving 100 million doses,” a RDIF spokesperson told DH. The Russian vaccine’s interim clinical trial results show 95% efficacy on the 42nd day after the first dose. Requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from over 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market would be produced by RDIF's international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries, RDIF said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/russia-agrees-to-produce-over-100-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-of-sputnik-v-in-india-920401.html

Attempting to disperse a group of farmers from Punjab trying to make it to Delhi in protest of the farm laws, the police drenched them with cold water despite freezing temperatures. The group were talking to the police throughout the evening requesting passage, however, as the night progressed and the farmers made no attempt to leave or step back and police prepared its forces for riot control, according to the report. A police officer told PTI on Friday, "We are using tear gas to disperse protesting farmers. We are also informing them that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, any kind of rally and dharna is not allowed." "They have been denied permission and legal action will be taken against them if they still try to enter Delhi," the officer further said. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will enter Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa to protest the three new farm laws.

Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana, appearing for the convict, sought extension of parole for another 90 days on the ground that he was seriously ill and needed medical attention. Additional Advocate General of Tamil Nadu, Balaji Srinivasan, for his part, submitted that the convict sought extension of parole before the Madras HC, which granted him two weeks relief on November 6 with a direction that no further extension would be granted for it. He also said CMC Vellore was only 25 kms away from the jail in which the petitioner was lodged and in case of any medical necessity, he would be taken over there. Notably, the court had earlier fixed the issue of grant of remission, for consideration on January 19, 2021. The Tamil Nadu government's recommendation for the remission of all convicts is pending before the Governor for over two years. The CBI had earlier told the court that an ongoing probe by its multi-disciplinary monitoring agency was going on as per the mandate of Jain Commission about role of some Sri Lankan and Indian suspects and was not related to Perarivalan, already convicted in the 1991 Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-sc-extends-a-g-perarivalans-parole-by-a-week-920424.html

Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, addressing a lecture hosted by the Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs (AIDIA), a Kathmandu-based non-partisan foreign policy think-tank, said that India is “on the cusp of the availability of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus”. “As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India is at the forefront of this effort. We have at least five promising vaccine candidates at advanced stages of trials. “I would like to assure the people of Nepal that once a vaccine is rolled out, meeting Nepal’s requirement would be a priority for us,” Shringla said. He said that the year 2020 has brought with it the additional challenge in the form of Covid-19 pandemic and this has been the most globally disruptive event since the second world war. Its devastating impact on society, and the economy is still being calculated. “Through this period, Nepal and India have been together, we have suffered together and we have fought back together,” he added.

"Own troops responded immediately to the enemy fire. In the ensuing fire, two Jawans of the Indian Army Naik Prem Bahadur Khatri and Rifleman Sukhbir Singh got critically injured and later succumbed to their injuries.” The incident comes a day after a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of Indian army was killed and a civilian injured along the LoC in neighboring Poonch district. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC in J&K frequently. Six civilians and five security forces personnel were killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani army along the LoC in north Kashmir on November 13 while eight Pakistani soldiers were reportedly killed in the retaliatory action by Indian army. On November 8, seven persons, including three army men, a BSF personnel and three militants were killed as security forces foiled a major infiltration bid near the LoC in Machhil sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. Prior to that three army soldiers were killed and four others were injured on October 1 as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire along the LoC in Kupwara and Poonch districts. According to official figures, as many as 3386 incidents of ceasefire violations have taken place along the LoC and International Border (IB) in Jammu & Kashmir in the first eight months of 2020. Last year 3479 incidents of ceasefire violations were reported in J&K. The Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. A number of infiltration attempts have been thwarted by the army along the LoC leading to the killing of several infiltrating militants in recent months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/2-soldiers-killed-in-ceasefire-violation-in-jammu-and-kashmir-920426.html

Singh questioned as to why the Centre was waiting for December 3 for holding talks with farmers when the situation is “getting out of control now”. "The voice of farmers cannot be muzzled indefinitely. Centre should immediately initiate talks with Kisan Union leaders to defuse the tense situation at the Delhi borders. Why wait till December 3 when the situation is getting out of hand now?" said Singh in a tweet. The Delhi Police on Friday used tear gas shells and water cannons to stop farmers from entering the national capital as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march to protest against the Centre's new farm laws. Despite heavy security deployment, groups of farmers from Punjab managed to reach near two Delhi border points on Friday morning after breaking police barricades in Haryana. Singh further asked the Centre to show statesmanship and accept the farmers' demand for assured minimum support price. “Central govt needs to show statesmanship and accept the farmers' demand for assured MSP, which is the basic right of every farmer. If they can give verbal assurance I fail to understand why they can't make it a legal obligation of the GoI,” said the Punjab chief minister. Singh also called those people who alleged that the Congress was instigating farmers, as “blind” and said that farmers were fighting for “lives and livelihood”. "Those claiming it's @INCIndia that's instigating the farmers are blind not to see the lakhs of farmers trying to enter Delhi from across the country. It's a fight for their lives & livelihoods & they don't need any backing or provocation", he said in another tweet. Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's three farm laws. They have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.  They have been demanding that these new laws should be repealed. The Centre has invited several Punjab farm bodies for another of talks in Delhi on December 3.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/situation-getting-out-of-hand-hold-talks-with-farmers-immediately-amarinder-to-centre-920432.html

Terming the incident as “shocking”, the apex court said this is a “very serious thing” and it reflects the situation of designated government hospitals as similar instances have taken place in other places also. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the incident showed that there are no proper fire safety measures in place there to deal with such situation. “We are taking suo motu cognisance. This is a very serious thing,” said the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, and asked the Gujarat government to submit its report on this by December 1. “This is shocking and this is not the first incident,” the apex court said, adding, “How many fire officers you are having to supervise all this? You don’t have fire safety measures”. “These incidents are repeated from states to states and hospitals to hospitals. No concrete action has been taken by the states in this regard,” the bench said. Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said 26 patients at the hospital were rescued and shifted to other facilities, and five other patients died. The fire broke out around 12.30 am in the ICU ward located on the first floor of the four-storey Uday Shivanand Hospital in Anand Bungalow Chowk area, where around 31 patients were admitted, Patel added. During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the incident is serious and the state should file a report on this. “In government hospitals, this is the situation in ICU,” the bench observed. “This will not be applicable only for Gujarat and Rajkot but for the entire country”. Mehta assured the apex court that home secretary would convene a meeting on this issue preferably today or latest by tomorrow and proper directions would be given. The bench further said: “There must be inspection of whether electricity lines are proper, whether cables and wires are proper. How does this short circuit happen.” When the lawyer appearing for Gujarat said that the high court there is seized of a similar issue, the bench observed that report given to the high court on fire safety was not proper. When the lawyer said, “We will put our house in order”, the bench observed, “You have done nothing. For two years, appointments have not been made in the (fire) department”. Mehta told the bench that he would ensure that the meeting takes place at the earliest and necessary directions are given in this regard. “Immediate inspection by joint team of electricity and fire departments will be done to ensure that such incidents don’t take place,” he said. The top court, while observing that infrastructure regarding fire safety needs to be improved, asked Mehta to file a report on the issue. “You have to go to the root cause,” the bench told Mehta. The bench has posted the matter for further hearing on December 1. The issue cropped up before the bench which was hearing the matter in which it had taken cognisance regarding need for proper treatment of Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies in the hospitals. The top court on November 23 had said that the Covid-19 pandemic has “worsened” in Delhi and gone “out of control” in Gujarat and had directed the Centre and all states to apprise it of the steps taken to contain the situation nationwide.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-takes-cognisance-of-fire-incident-at-covid-hospital-in-rajkot-920446.html
27-11-2020||National||Arnab Goswami case: SC asks courts to safeguard liberty of citizens against harassment by states||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the court across the country to zealously safeguard the liberty of citizens against selective harassment by the State, as consequences of incarceration are too serious. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee said liberty is not a gift for the few and deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many. The court said the Chief Justices of the High Court must ensure access to justice was democratised and equitably allocated.  It said the courts, including of district level, must ensure proper enforcement of criminal law and that the law does not become a ruse for targeted harassment. "Liberty across human eras is as tenuous as tenuous can be. Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens, on the cacophony of the media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the rule of (and not by) law. Yet, much too often, liberty is a casualty when one of these components is found wanting," the bench said. Giving detailed reasonings of its November 11 order granting interim bail to Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case, the bench expressed "anguish" that the Bombay High Court, by declining relief to him, abdicated its constitutional duty and function as a protector of liberty. The court noted the specific case of Goswami was that he has been targeted because his opinions on his television channel are unpalatable to authority.  Though whether he has established a case for quashing the FIR is something on which the High Court will take a final view, it has, however, failed to make even a prima facie evaluation of the FIR, the bench said. Maintaining that the HC did have power under Article 226 of the Constitution to give interim protection, the bench said, "The doors of this court cannot be closed to a citizen who is able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the State is being weaponized for using the force of criminal law." Justice Chandrachud, who authored the 55-page judgement on behalf of the bench, quoted Justice Krishna Iyer's words that the basic rule of our criminal justice system is bail, not jail. Referring to the National Judicial Data Grid, showing pendency of 91,568 bail applications in HCs and 1,96,861 in district courts, besides 12,66,133 writ petitions and appeals in HCs, the bench said there is a pressing need for courts across the judicial hierarchy in India to remedy the institutional problem of bail applications not being heard and disposed of with expedition. "It is our earnest hope that our courts will exhibit acute awareness to the need to expand the footprint of liberty and use our approach as a decision-making yardstick for future cases involving the grant of bail," the bench said. The bench extended interim protection granted to Goswami on November 11 till the HC decided his plea for quashing the FIR and four weeks thereafter to enable him to avail legal remedies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/arnab-goswami-case-sc-asks-courts-to-safeguard-liberty-of-citizens-against-harassment-by-states-920449.html

Her attack on the prime minister came a day after Modi advocated 'one nation, one election' system and a single voters' list, saying polls taking place every few months hinders development. Posting a video on Twitter of water cannons being used on protesting farmers, Gandhi said, "To suppress the voice of farmers -- Water was rained on them. Roads are being dug up to stop them." "But the government is not ready to show or tell them that where MSP being a legal right is written," she said in a tweet in Hindi. The prime minister who is concerned about 'one nation, one election', should also implement "one nation, one treatment", the Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh said. The Delhi Police on Friday used tear gas shells and water cannons to stop farmers from entering the national capital. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will march to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa to protest against new farm laws. Farmers have assembled near the borders in tractor-trolleys laden with rations and essentials for their proposed Delhi march. Farmers' bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital. Punjab farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on the minimum support prices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-should-also-implement-one-nation-one-treatment-priyanka-on-farmers-protest-920450.html

"We have been allowed safe passage to Delhi," claimed Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal. He said that officials of the Union home ministry had allowed them a place at Burari in Delhi to hold the agitation. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said that farmers were headed to the Burari ground. Earlier, farmers had demanded that they be allowed to hold their protest at the Ramlila ground but the Delhi Police had denied the request. Despite heavy security deployment, groups of agitating farmers from Punjab and Haryana reached near two Delhi borders on Friday morning after breaking police barricades on the way as part of their protest march against the Centre's new farm laws. The Delhi Police has enhanced deployment of security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons and used barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu and Tikri border points (Delhi-Haryana border) to prevent the protesters from entering the city. Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's three farm laws and expressed apprehension that they would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.

The high court noted that the Supreme Court is seized of the matter and there was no ground to extend the interim bail. “Considering the orders passed by the metropolitan magistrate where the petitioner (Chandra) has been granted interim bail on ground of his wife being suffering from Covid-19; was on interim bail since last one month and hence there is no ground to extend the interim bail on submissions made, considering the fact that the Supreme Court is seized of the matter,” Justice Yogesh Khanna said on Thursday. A trial court had on October 24, granted interim bail to Chandra for four weeks on grounds of illness of his wife who was stated to be suffering from Covid-19. Later the relief was extended till November 26. Chandra, who was in jail since August 2017, approached the high court seeking further extension of interim bail on the ground that his wife’s post healing comorbidity condition has worsened and since his parents also suffered from coronavirus, there was no one else to take care of his spouse. He sought parity with other inmates in terms of the apex court’s October 29 order by which it had stayed the Delhi High Court’s decision asking under trial prisoners, who were released in view of Covid-19 pandemic, to surrender in phased manner. His counsel submitted that now the matter is listed before the apex court on December 2 and the relief has been extended to other undertrials till then. Prosecutor M S Oberoi, representing the State, apprised the high court about an order of the full bench which said that the interim bail and stays were extended till further orders “except where there are any orders to the contrary passed by the Supreme Court in any particular matter during the intervening period”. He also referred to the apex court’s August 18 order on the issue of interim bail to be granted to Chandra and the top court had declined to extend the interim bail. The apex court had on August 14 dismissed the bail plea of Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra, who were granted interim bail in July for 30 days on "humanitarian grounds" as both their parents had tested positive for Covid-19. They both are accused of allegedly siphoning off home buyers' money. The top court in its October 2017 order had asked them to deposit Rs 750 crore with the apex court registry by December 31, 2017. On January 20 this year, in a respite to over 12,000 hassled home buyers of Unitech, the Supreme Court had allowed the Central government to take total management control of the realty firm and appoint a new board of nominee directors. In 2018, the top court had directed a forensic audit of Unitech Ltd and its sister concerns and subsidiaries by Samir Paranjpe, Partner, Forensic and Investigation Services in M/s Grant Thornton India. The forensic auditors had submitted their report which said that Unitech Ltd received around Rs 14,270 crore from 29,800 homebuyers mostly between 2006-2014 and around Rs 1,805 crore from six financial institutions for the construction of 74 projects. The audit revealed that around Rs 5,063 crore of home buyers' money and around Rs 763 crore of funds received from financial institutions were not utilised by the company and high value investments were made off-shore tax-haven countries between 2007-2010.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-hc-declines-to-extend-unitech-promoter-ajay-chandra-s-interim-bail-920458.html
27-11-2020||National||India sees itself as Nepal's 'foremost friend and development partner': Harsh Vardhan Shringla||India and Nepal are on the same page and share the same vision, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday, as he underlined that New Delhi sees itself as the Himalayan nation's "foremost friend and development partner" in its quest for economic and social development. Shringla's maiden visit to Nepal from November 26-27 was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row. Delivering a Distinguished Lecture at the Asian Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs - a Kathmandu-based non-partisan foreign policy think-tank, Shringla said the relation between Nepal and India is "intricate" and they share the same geography, civilisational heritage, culture and customs. "India sees itself as Nepal's foremost friend and development partner," Shringla said in his lecture. "Our aspiration of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ and your goal of ‘Samriddh Nepal, Sukhi Nepali’ are entirely compatible." Noting that recent years have given the relationship a new momentum, he said, "For India, Nepal is fundamental to our ‘Neighbourhood First’ approach." "India’s development and modernisation are incomplete and intrinsically and symbiotically linked to the development and modernisation of neighbouring countries such as Nepal,” he said. He said aside from the common civilisational inheritance, India’s relationship with Nepal rests on four pillars – development cooperation; stronger connectivity; expanded infrastructure and economic projects; easier and enhanced access to educational opportunities in India for the young people of Nepal. "We will work to Nepal’s priorities," he said. Shringla on Thursday called on Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, which included a one-on-one meeting. The Foreign Secretary’s discussions with Prime Minister Oli included a candid review of the state of the bilateral relationship, and the potential for bringing India and Nepal ever closer. During the meeting, Oli conveyed Nepal’s desire to build on the momentum in the bilateral relationship and enhance the level of bilateral engagement. Shringla held productive talks with his Nepalese counterpart Bharat Raj Paudyal on a wide range of issues, including the border problem. He also called on President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Friday and Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali on Thursday. "In my meetings here in Kathmandu, with the President and the Prime Minister of Nepal, the Foreign Minister, and my counterpart, the Foreign Secretary, and other dignitaries and officials, I have been left with no doubt that our countries are on the same page and share the same vision," he said at the lecture, attended by experts from think-tanks and diplomats. Shringla said that the year 2020 has brought with it the additional challenge in the form of COVID-19 pandemic and this has been the most globally disruptive event since the World War II. "Through this period, Nepal and India have been together. We have suffered together and we have fought back together," he said. Shringla assured the people of Nepal that once India rolls out a vaccine against COVID-19, meeting their requirement will be a priority for New Delhi, amid a spike of the deadly disease in the country. "Together we will recover from the pandemic and together we will protect our people," he said. Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Nepal in August 2014, he said it was the first at that level in 17 years and it injected a fresh energy into the relationship. Talking about the development projects implemented with India’s support, Shringla said these projects are tailored to the needs of the local community, create community assets, and promote socioeconomic welfare at the grassroots level. "Such development projects have been implemented in all 77 of Nepal’s districts and over a hundred of them have been completed since 2014," he said, noting that they cover diverse sectors such as education, health, irrigation, drinking water, skill development, youth training, and agriculture. He said enhancing cross-border connectivity and infrastructure projects are critical and cited the Motihari–Amlekhgunj petroleum pipeline, the 900 MW Arun III hydropower power project, the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border rail line and modern integrated check-posts at Birgunj and Biratnagar as some of the examples of the such projects between the two sides. "As a neighbour and friend, India sees itself as Nepal’s natural and instinctive responder in times of crisis,” he said, citing an example of New Delhi's quick response after the devastating earthquakes in Nepal in 2015. "Seventy schools and 150 health facilities are coming up in 12 districts of Nepal with Indian support,” he said. "The outlay of Indian earthquake-related assistance is USD 1 billion but its true value is not in monetary terms. It lies in how it has helped communities on the ground," he said. He said the people-to-people linkages are so strong and so powerful that quite frankly "we in government only complement these." "We are dreaming of a new India, a new India as envisioned by our Prime Minister, an India with modern amenities for all our people, an India that is a middle income society...We would like our friends in Nepal to share our dreams and be a part of this journey," he said. "We need each other." "India’s market is available to Nepal," Shringla said in his speech during which he also occasionally spoke in Nepali langauge. The ties between the two countries came under strain after India constructed an 80-km-long road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand in May. Days later, Nepal came out with a new map showing the Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as its part. India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Nepal that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-sees-itself-as-nepals-foremost-friend-and-development-partner-harsh-vardhan-shringla-920459.html

Protesting against the Centre's new farm laws and the police action on the agitating farmers, the activists of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) blocked the Delhi-Dehradun National Highway at Nawla Kothi in Muzaffarnagar district and also staged sit-ins in Meerut and Baghpat. Due to heavy deployment of police personnel, however, the situation remained under control as the administrative machinery was already on alert after a call for holding the protests was given by the BKU. State vice president of BKU Harnam Singh Verma led a protest in Naubasta Kala under Chinhat Police Station area of Lucknow on Friday morning. Verma said farmers will soon be staging a protest at the Sadar tehsil in support of their demands. "We will continue our struggle till the time our demands are not met. We are ready to get arrested," he said. ADG Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said police personnel have been deployed in view of the farmers' call to ensure law and order is maintained in the state. There was no impact of the farmers' protest in Lucknow, Kumar said. However, as the Delhi-Haridwar stretch on the Delhi-Dehradun Highway was shut due to the protest, long queues of vehicles were witnessed. In Baghpat, BKU activists blocked traffic on the Sonipat Highway using tractors and raised slogans against the new farm laws. The BKU had given a call to stage protests on the national highways of the state after which traffic routes had been diverted in the district. SP Baghpat, Abhishek Singh said magistrates and police in strength have been deployed in Nivada area which shares border with Haryana to ward off any incident. The local farmer leaders have also been approached in this regard, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-stage-sit-ins-block-roads-at-some-places-in-up-920466.html

Sri Lanka will host the fourth national security advisor trilateral meeting on maritime security cooperation with India and Maldives on Friday and Saturday. The meeting is to take place after six years - the last meeting was held in New Delhi in 2014. "NSA Ajit Doval arrived in Colombo for trilateral India-Sri Lanka-Maldives consultations on maritime and security cooperation. He was accorded a warm welcome by Army Commander Lt Gen @SilvaShavendra,” the Indian Embassy in Colombo tweeted. Doval and Maldivian defence minister Maria Didi are expected to lead their respective delegations. There will be observers from Bangladesh, Mauritius and Seychelles, the Lankan military said. The high-level engagement that covers a wide range of subjects is designed to initiate collective action on maritime security including maritime domain awareness, legal regimes, train in search and rescue, maritime pollution response, information sharing, curbing piracy drugs arms and contraband trafficking in the Indian Ocean region. On Thursday, the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi said the NSA-level trilateral meeting has served as an effective platform for cooperation among Indian Ocean countries. "The meeting will provide an opportunity for discussion on issues pertaining to cooperation in maritime security in the Indian Ocean region," the MEA said in a statement. Doval is also expected to hold bilateral talks with Sri Lanka Defence Secretary Maj Gen (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne, official sources here said. This would be Doval’s second official visit to Sri Lanka this year. In January, Doval visited the island nation and discussed a range of bilateral issues, including strengthening cooperation in defence, intelligence sharing and maritime security with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nsa-doval-arrives-in-sri-lanka-to-attend-trilateral-maritime-dialogue-920469.html

According to the sources, a ward boy and a sweeper of the hospital were suspended in this regard on charges of laxity. A committee had also been formed to investigate the matter. Sources said that the girl child had met with an accident and was brought to the hospital on Thursday. She died a little later. Her dead body was kept on a stretch and was kept in a room inside the hospital premises. The 20-second video clearly showed a stray dog nibbling at the dead body after removing the white sheet with which the body was covered. It was not clear if the person, who made the video, shooed away the dog. ''We have taken note of the incident....it is shameful....we will take stern action against those responsible for it,'' said a senior health official here on Friday. The opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), which also released the video from its authorised Twitter handle, sharply condemned the incident and demanded a thorough probe and punishment to the guilty. ''The incident shows the pathetic state of the affairs of the health services in the state......the chief minister should focus on improving the health services rather than praising its government,'' said a senior SP leader here. Earlier also there had been reports of ward boys performing minor surgeries at government hospitals in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/video-shows-stray-dog-nibbling-at-girls-corpse-in-up-hospital-920486.html

The former Congress chief's attack on the government came as thousands of farmers, carrying flags and shouting slogans, gathered at various entry points into the national capital in a determined bid to push their way through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march against the new farm laws while police blocked them with barricades, teargas shells and batons. Later, the farmers were allowed to enter the national capital and hold peaceful agitation, the Delhi Police said. In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said the prime minister should remember that whenever arrogance takes on truth, it gets defeated. "No government in the world can stop the farmers who are fighting the battle of truth," the former Congress chief said. "The Modi government will have to agree to the demands of the farmers and take back the black laws. This is just the beginning!" he tweeted with the hashtag 'IamWithFarmers'. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had announced they will march to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa to protest against new farm laws. The farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on minimum support prices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-govt-in-the-world-can-stop-farmers-fighting-battle-of-truth-rahul-gandhi-920518.html

The top court said in the absence of vaccine, norms to be observed for fighting the pandemic were wearing mask and observing social distancing. “But what is the situation on ground? Union government must take lead to implement the guidelines across India. Harsher measures are needed,” the bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. "Union government issues guidelines but what is the implementation of it in this state? No development of vaccines everything is in trial stage! Look at the gatherings in states! Second wave of the crisis has already begun," the bench further added. The court also pointed out processions were being taken out and 80% people were not wearing masks and the rest have masks hanging on to their jaw. "There are SOP's, there are guidelines but there is no will. Things are going from bad to worse and not concrete steps being taken by the Centre or state," the bench said, emphasising more tightening up by States was required. Mehta said 10 states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, were contributing to 70 % of the Covid cases. The court also took suo motu cognisance of a fire incident in Rajkot hospital resulting in death of six in-patients. "This is shocking! And let me say this is not the first incident," Justice Shah said. Fire incidents in hospitals killing patients are recurring and there is no action taken by states to prevent it, the court said, as it sought a response from the Centre as well as Gujarat by Tuesday. Mehta said, we will take account of measures and what can be done. "We will look at setting up preventive measures for fires," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-centre-to-ensure-states-tighten-measures-to-contain-covid-19-pandemic-920535.html

Carrying flags and shouting slogans, thousands of farmers have gathered at various entry points into the national capital in a determined bid to push their way through while police blocked them with barricades, teargas shells and batons. "All arrangements for accommodation and food should be made. All possible help should also be extended to the farmers who may need medical help or treatment," Hooda, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the state, said in a statement here. Clashes broke out at multiple places and Delhi's borders resembled a virtual battle zone with restless crowds of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, milling around and a sea of police personnel keeping them at bay. Drones circled the air and plumes of smoke from teargas shells could be seen from far. Referring to use of water cannons and tear gas against the protesting farmers, Hooda said the BJP-JJP government in Haryana has tried to "suppress a peaceful movement of farmers in a dictatorial manner". "In a democracy, every citizen and every section of the society has the constitutional right to peaceful demonstration for their demands. The central government should also leave its stubborn attitude and talk to the farmers and accept their demands at the earliest," he said. Hooda said the demands of the farmers seeking a repeal of the new farm laws are completely valid, and added that he stands with the farmers in support of these demands. "New agricultural laws cannot be in the interest of the farmers without the guarantee of MSP," he said. The senior Congress leader further said the farmers did not trust verbal assurances given by the government, and hence, they were demanding for a law guaranteeing the MSP. "Farmers doubt the government's intention. They have put these demands before the government from every democratic platform, but the government ignored it. This is the reason farmers were forced to take to the streets to press for their demands in the time of the coronavirus pandemic," he said. Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's three farm laws and have expressed apprehensions that these would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. They have been demanding that the new laws be repealed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bhupinder-singh-hooda-appeals-to-people-of-haryana-to-extend-all-possible-help-to-farmers-marching-towards-delhi-920536.html

She said the past orders given by the high court regarding section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act will also be checked. Section 354A empowers a civic body and its officials to stop any ongoing illegal construction. Earlier in the day, the Bombay High Court declared the BMC's action of demolishing part of Ranaut's bungalow on September 9 as illegal and said it smacks of malafide intentions. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla said it was appointing private firm m/s Shetgiri as the valuer to assess the damages caused in order to calculate the compensation amount due to Ranaut. Talking to reporters, Pedenkar said, the 354A notice was issued to Ranaut under the MMC Act and due procedure was followed. "The 354A notice was not only served to the actress, but such notices were issued to many others. Many people had challenged those in the court," she said.

While rejecting the Delhi Police's request, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain said that every Indian citizen has the constitutional right to protest peacefully for which they cannot be put in jails. In a letter to the principal home secretary, Jain said the central government should accept the demands of the protesters and added that putting farmers in jails is not the solution. Police used tear gas at the Singhu and Tikri borders to disperse protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab, as they tried to enter the national capital on Friday morning as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march. But later in the day, after discussions with farmer leaders, the Delhi Police allowed the protesters to enter the national capital and hold peaceful demonstration at the Nirankari ground in Burari. Jain in his letter also said that the demands of the farmers are justified. "The Centre should immediately accept demands of the farmers. Putting farmers in jail is not a solution of it. Their protest is completely non-violent. Agitating non violently is the right of every Indian.They can not be sent to the jail for this," he said. "Therefore, the Delhi government denies this application by the Delhi Police to convert stadium into jail," Jain said in the letter. Earlier, the Delhi Police had sought permission from the AAP government to use the city's nine stadiums as temporary jails for the agitating farmers. "In view of the farmers' march, the Delhi Police has asked the Delhi government for permission to use nine stadiums as temporary jails to keep the detained or arrested farmers," a source said earlier in the day. Delhi Police had enhanced deployment of security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons, and used barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu and Tikri border points (Delhi-Haryana border) to prevent the protesters from entering the city. On allowing farmers into Delhi, police PRO Eish Singhal said that "after holding discussion with farmer leaders, the protesting farmers have been permitted inside Delhi to hold peaceful protest at Nirankari Ground in Burari". "We appeal to all farmers to maintain peace," the PRO said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-aap-govt-refuses-to-let-delhi-police-use-stadiums-as-temporary-jails-920545.html

He was speaking during a webinar where the country's largest paramilitary force -- the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) -- handed over a total of 79,572 organ donation pledges undertaken by its personnel to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. The country is observing the 11th Indian organ donation day on Friday. Vardhan urged people to come together for this noble cause, saying it was time for everyone to "bust the myths" and realise that the act of donating organs is not against "religion or religious customs". "There cannot be a bigger godly work than organ donation," Vardhan said. Guleria said the AIIMS was working to "very soon" start a lung transplant programme even as it has facilities available for transplantation of heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, cornea, heart valve and bones. The AIIMS chief said the premier medical institute at present has organ banks for eyes, heart valves, bones and "in future a skin bank will also be operational". "I am sure a time will come when there is no shortage (of donated organs) and people will not die while waiting for an organ," he said. The Union minister said India was moving fast in this domain over the last few years and occupies the third position in the world but still many people in the country die due to unavailability of organs. Citing data, he said while in Spain there were 48 organ transplants per 1 million population, in India the figure was less than one. Guleria also gave some details and statistics. "While the law for organ donation and transplantation was enacted way back in 1994, even today there is a huge gap in the demand and supply of human organs and tissues which is primarily because of lack of awareness and acceptance of brain death in our society," the senior pulmonologist said. He said every year one lakh cornea are required but only 50,000 are collected. "We need 1.7 lakh kidneys each year but only 7,000-8,000 are transplanted; about 25,000 livers are required every year in the country but only 1,500-1,700 are transplanted. "So, there is a huge gap... This really shows that there is a huge need for all of us to work together to fulfil this gap so that those who need organs are able to get them and can live a good quality life," the AIIMS Director said. Stressing that "many people die while waiting for an organ", he said there are certain "myths" that exist in our society in the context to organ donation. Guleria said some people believe that if one donates the heart after death, they will not attain salvation or that the body will get disfigured. He further said another prevalent myth is that old people cannot donate organs or that a person may be born in the next life without the organ they donated after death in this life. "We are duty bound to spread awareness so that the supply (of donated organs) not only increases but people understand how noble it is to donate organs," Guleria said. He praised the CRPF for undertaking an "extraordinary effort" of bringing in thousands of organ donation pledges in a very short span of time.  Vardhan added that people who wish to donate their organs should involve their families in their decision so that the organ reaches the needy in time. Praising the CRPF, he said their work "inspires the country" and was a unique event where almost 80,000 organ donation pledges have come in one go. During the event, CRPF Director General A P Maheshwari said his force was "determined" to take this noble cause and campaign forward and will work with the government to increase awareness about organ donation. The about 3.25 lakh personnel-strong CRPF is the country's largest paramilitary force and is designated as the lead internal security force.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/huge-gap-in-demand-supply-of-organs-for-transplant-in-country-aiims-chief-920552.html

At a virtual meeting chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the CWC described ‘Ahmedbhai’ as a man with no personal ambition and Gogoi as the “tallest leader” and the “authentic voice” of Assam and the northeastern region. “Shri Patel’s signal contribution was his unique capacity to reconcile competing aspirations and forge unity and comradeship among the leaders and members of the party,” the CWC resolution said. It said that Patel carried this remarkable talent to reconcile the competing aspirations of other political parties as well and to forging coalitions at the Centre and in the states. “He was a pillar of strength to the two coalition governments that were led by the Congress during 2004-2014,” the resolution read. The rich tribute to Patel also noted that he was deeply religious but secular to the core. “Ahmedbhai's simplicity, austerity, accessibility and generosity were legendary,” it said. The CWC noted that Gogoi had taken over as Assam Chief Minister during the most troubling time in the history of the state. “Taking forward the historic Assam Accord of 1985, he transformed Assam into a vibrant and modern state. His critical role in persuading many militant groups to abjure violence and join the mainstream will be written in the annals of Assam and long remembered by the people,” the CWC said. It described Gogoi as the quintessential consensus-seeker, saying in every task that he undertook, he brought his enormous knowledge of the complex issues, deft political skills, amiable disposition and genuine desire to find a common ground. “As a Congress worker, MP for six terms, Union minister, president of Assam PCC, and chief minister for three consecutive terms (2001-2016), he epitomised the fundamental values of the Congress party and was the party's proud standard-bearer,” it said. The CWC noted that Gogoi’s death came ahead of the Assembly elections in Assam. In recent months, Gogoi had been campaigning extensively and vigorously to secure a mandate once again for the Congress in the forthcoming state polls, it said. “The CWC is confident that Congressmen and women of Assam will continue to take encouragement and inspiration from the life and work of Shri Gogoi and fulfill his desire,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-working-committee-condoles-demise-of-ahmed-patel-tarun-gogoi-920559.html

The chargesheet, filed under Indian Penal Code sections before the special NIA court in Vijayawada, names West Bengal resident Enamul Haque, who was involved in cross-border smuggling and circulation of FICN after procuring them from his associates in Bangladesh, he said. Haque, who is from the state's Malda district, was arrested by the premier investigation agency on September 3 from there, the official said. He had conspired with others arrested in the case -- Mohammed Mahaboob Baig, Syed Imran, Firoj Saikh and Tajamul Saikh alias Bhoot -- to procure FICN with a face value of Rs 10,20,000 and then provide them to Baig and Imran for circulation, he said. The case came into being after the seizure of the FICN from Baig and Imran at the Visakhapatnam Railway Station on March 31, 2018, the official said, adding that the duo was travelling in the Howrah-Hyderabad East Coast Express. The seizure was made by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence's Visakhapatnam Unit. There were 510 numbers of FICN, in denomination of 2,000 and with a face value of Rs 10,20,000, he said. The NIA re-registered the case and took up the investigation. The first chargesheet was filed by the NIA against Baig and Imran in the special NIA court on June 29, 2018. Later, they were convicted and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 10,000. The NIA also arrested Firoi and Tajamul and charge sheeted them in July last year. Further investigation against Haque's Bangladeshi associates is underway.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nia-files-third-supplementary-charge-sheet-in-visakhapatnam-ficn-case-920563.html

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is an important macromolecule that is present in all biological cells. In the conventional testing method, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples collected by sample collection centres are transported to testing centres, sometimes even hundreds of kilometres away. The samples are generally placed in a liquid called Viral Transport Medium (VTM). To avoid leakage, they are packed heavily that adds on to sample processing times at both the sample collection and testing centres. Despite this, there are leakages from samples, which render those batches untestable and unsafe in handling.  CCMB researchers found that VTM can be totally avoided and dry swab technique also does not require RNA extraction and can be directly used for RT-PCR testing with sensitivity and specificity similar to the current gold standard. This method has now received ICMR approval for use in settings where automated RNA extraction is not available, the city based premier research institute said in a release. Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB said RNA extraction, even with automation, takes four hours for roughly 500 samples. VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden on money and time required for mass testing for coronavirus. "We believe the technique's merit holds for all kinds of settings and has the potential of bringing down the costs and time of testing by 40-50 per cent. It is a game-changing technology as with the existing infrastructure, the throughput of Covid-19 screening can be enhanced several-fold with immediate effect while, at the same time, making the whole process safer," Mishra said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/icmr-nod-for-ccmbs-dry-swab-testing-for-covid-19-920567.html
27-11-2020||National||CCMB says its dry swab technology for Covid-19 testing lowers cost, time by 50%||The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has announced that a dry swab technology it developed lowers the cost and time of Covid-19 testing by about 50 per cent. After evaluating the method and finding an overall concordance of 96.9 per cent, ICMR has now issued an advisory for the use of CSIR-CCMB dry swab method, considering its lesser cost and quick turn-around time. Director General-CSIR, Dr Shekhar C Mande, said that the Dry-Swab Direct RT-PCR method is easy to implement with no new kits requirement and existing manpower can perform the tests with no additional training. Hence this could make a significant contribution to ramping up the testing capacity in the country quickly. The modified method has been independently corroborated by Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), IISER-Berhapmur, CSIR-NEERI, GMCH-Nagpur, Genepath based in Pune, IGGMSH and MAFSU, Nagpur and Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad. The Hyderabad based CSIR institute has been testing samples for the virus since April 2020. Working closely with the healthcare workers of Telangana, CSIR-CCMB researchers identified certain issues that are prolonging the testing process, time. So, CSIR-CCMB developed a dry swab RNA-extraction free testing method to detect Covid-19 virus. In the conventional testing method, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples are collected at the sample collection centres and transported to testing centres, sometimes hundreds of kms away. These swab samples are generally placed in a liquid called Viral Transport Medium (VTM). To avoid leakage, the samples are packed heavily adding to sample processing time at the sample collection and also testing centres. Despite such care, there are leakages from samples sometimes, which render those batches untestable and unsafe in handling. CCMB researchers found that VTM can be avoided totally. Dry swab technique also does not require the RNA extraction process, and can be directly used for RT-PCR testing with sensitivity and specificity similar to the current gold standard, CCMB said in a press release on Friday. Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, CCMB says, “RNA extraction, even with automation, takes four hours for roughly 500 samples. VTM and RNA extraction both add a significant burden of money and timewise for mass testing of Covid-19 virus. We believe our technique’s merit holds for all kinds of settings and has the potential of bringing the costs and time of testing by 40-50 per cent.” Dr Mishra terms it “a game changing technology” enhancing Covid-19 screening several fold with immediate effect and at the same time, making the whole process safer.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ccmb-says-its-dry-swab-technology-for-covid-19-testing-lowers-cost-time-by-50-920569.html
27-11-2020||National||Govt intends to formalise registration process of vintage motor vehicles||The Centre on Friday said it intends to formalise the registration process of the vintage motor vehicles, and has sought public comments for proposed rules regarding this. In a statement, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said it has invited public comments for proposed rules on registering vintage vehicles. "The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has published GSR 734 (E) dated November 25, 2020, seeking comments and suggestions in regards to amendment to CMVR 1989 relating to vintage motor vehicles," it said. Through this notification, the ministry intends to formalise the registration process of the vintage motor vehicles. "There are no existing rules for regulating the registration process of vehicles of heritage value. These rules are proposed to be inserted as sub-rules 81A, 81B, 81C, 81D, 81E, 81F, 81G in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989," it said. The draft rules define vintage motor vehicles as all those vehicles that are two-wheelers and four-wheelers (non-commercial and personal use) and are more than 50 years old from the date of their first registration (including imported vehicle). There is a restriction in the definition — no substantial overhaul of the vehicle which includes modification in chassis or body shell, and/or engine. "It is proposed that all applications for registration shall be applied on 'PARIVAHAN' portal. It is further proposed that all states registering authority will appoint a nodal officer who will process all applications for registration of vintage motor vehicles," it said. Further, states will form a committee that will inspect a vehicle and declare whether the vehicle is fit for registration under vintage motor vehicle or not. "If approved, a 10-digit alphanumeric number will be assigned to the respective vintage vehicle. This registration shall be valid for 10 years," the statement said. The format for the registration mark will be 'XX VA YY ****', where VA stands for vintage, XX will be the state code, YY will be a two-letter series and '****' is a number from 0001 to 9999 allotted by state registering authority, it added. The fees for a new registration will be Rs 20,000; while for subsequent re-registration, it will be Rs 5,000. If a vehicle is registered as a vintage motor vehicle, the sale and purchase of the vehicle is allowed under the rules, it said. A vintage motor vehicle is allowed to run on Indian roads only for display, technical research or taking part in a vintage car rally, refuelling and maintenance, exhibitions, vintage rallies, and to and fro to such exhibition or car rally. The government said the objective is to preserve and promote the heritage of old vehicles in India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-intends-to-formalise-registration-process-of-vintage-motor-vehicles-920575.html
27-11-2020||National||10 states have almost 77% of active Covid-19 caseload in country: Centre to SC||The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court that ten states have almost 77 per cent of the active Covid-19 caseload of the country with Maharashtra and Kerala contributing almost 33 per cent of the overall actives cases. It said that most of the countries across the world are observing resurgence of Covid cases and given the size and density of population in India, the country has done remarkably well in restricting the spread.   The Centre pointed out that as on November 24, India stands at 9.2 million Covid cases, with over 0.44 million active cases, which make up only 4.75 per cent of the current cumulative cases. “Our recovery rate has gone up to 93.76 per cent, with almost 8.6 million recoveries made. The average cases per day have reduced by 50 per cent since the past 8 weeks. Currently, only 2 two states have more than 50,000 cases and they contribute to almost 33 per cent of the overall active cases,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in its affidavit. It said that the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of India remains low at 1.46 per cent, when compared to the global average of 2.36 per cent and stands at a total death count of 0.13 million. The Centre said that the government will continue making efforts to bring CFR down to less than one per cent and accelerate efforts in reducing the positivity rate, which currently stands at 6.9 per cent. “The 10 states contribute almost 77% of the active case load for the country. These are: Maharashtra (18.9%), Kerala (14.7%), Delhi (8.5%), West Bengal (5.7%), Karnataka (5.6%), Uttar Pradesh (5.4%), Rajasthan (5.5%), Chhattisgarh (5.0%), Haryana (4.7%) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1%),” the Centre said. It said that India is now testing on an average, almost 1.1 million samples daily and this has been a remarkable increase from 6 thousand tests daily at the start of April.   “We are further trying to reduce the spread with the use of digital innovations such as Arogya Setu/ITIHAS to predict emerging hotspots and they are also aiding contact tracing efforts. Our efforts are also directed towards managing Covid, non-Covid health facilities should also be effectively managed - these include: immunization, maternal and child health services, cancer, dialysis, etc,” it added. The Centre's 170-page affidavit filed before the top court added that given the ferocity with which the disease had spread, countries have been compelled to take drastic measures which have affected almost every facet of life and India was no exception to the same.   “However, India looked at the challenges imposed by the pandemic as a unique opportunity to demonstrate its self-reliance in areas like manufacturing of critical medical equipment, use of information technology etc. In order to become self-sufficient or “Atma-nirbhar” in all our capacities and enhance our healthcare preparedness, India also worked to boost domestic production and expand our healthcare workforce,” it said. Giving the statistics of various steps taken, the government said that as on November 23, 2020, a total of 24,17,085 passengers and crew members have been screened at the airports. It said that the laboratory network is continuously being strengthened and as of November 23, 2020, total operational (initiated independent testing) government laboratories reporting to ICMR is 1166 and in addition, 968 private laboratories have been approved for Covid-19 testing. It added that adequate laboratory reagents are available with ICMR and a total of 133.8 million (13.38 Crore) samples have been tested as on November 23, 2020. “It is submitted that as on November 24, 2020, a total of 15,454 dedicated Covid treatment facilities with 1,54,6983 dedicated isolation beds (including 2, 67, 886 oxygen supported beds) have been identified. Also, a total of 79,005 ICU beds (including 40,183 ventilator beds) have been earmarked in these facilities”, it said. Regarding development of drugs and vaccines, the government said that the principal scientific advisor to the Government of India has constituted a core group on Covid-19 and “thirteen clinical trials of repurposed drugs have been undertaken to build a portfolio of therapeutic options for Covid-19 patients”. “It is submitted that nearly 30 vaccine candidates encompassing a diverse group of vaccines based on multiple technologies / platforms are under development in India, by both academia and industry,” it said. The government submitted that five candidates are in the clinical trial stage, of which two vaccines are in Phase III trials and three are in phase II trials.   “A National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 has been constituted on August 7, 2020, under Member (Health), NITI Ayog, which is working round the clock to ensure that vaccines are developed and introduced for public administration at the earliest and at affordable price,” it said. Dealing with logistics, the Centre informed the top court that total orders for 1.92 Crore Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) have been placed by it so far and states/UTs and Central Government institutions are being supported in terms of supply of logistics.   “So far 1.62 Crore of PPE Kits, 3.89 crores N-95 masks, 11.16 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine, 34,279 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to states/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far. In addition, oxygen concentrators are also being supplied to states,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/10-states-have-almost-77-of-active-covid-19-caseload-in-country-centre-to-sc-920579.html

Dhansa and Jharoda Kalan borders were closed for traffic movement due to the demonstration and the commuters were asked to take an alternative route, the Delhi Traffic Police said. “Tikri Border is completely closed for traffic movement by local police. Traffic intending to go towards Haryana is also closed. All motorists are advised to avoid this route in view of the protest by Kishan Sangharsh committee,” it tweeted. The police asked people to “totally avoid" outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, Grand Trunk Road, NH-44 and Singhu Border as the traffic was “very very heavy in this area”. Heightened checking near the Dhaula Kuan police post led to obstruction in traffic in the carriageway from Gurgaon towards Dhaula Kuan. "Traffic is heavy in the carriageway from Peeragarhi towards Punjabi Bagh due to checking by local police at Ordnance Depot. Kindly avoid the stretch,” the traffic police tweeted. Farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa -- to protest against the Centre's new farm laws. They have been demanding the central government to repeal the contentious laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. Delhi Police had Wednesday refused permission to farmers' organisations to protest in Delhi on November 26 and 27. In order to prevent farmers from entering Delhi, heavy police deployment has been made at NH-24, DND, Chilla Border, Tigri border, Bahadurgarh border, Faridabad border, Kalindi Kunj border and Singhu border. While paramilitary personnel have also been deployed on Delhi-Gurgaon border, five sand-laden trucks and three water cannons have also been stationed at the Singhu Border to stop tractors being driven by the protesters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-leads-to-traffic-snarls-in-delhi-920580.html

The HC, in its order, has also taken Raut to task for his tirade against Ranaut. "How can it be illegal action if the construction (at Ranaut's bungalow) is illegal as per the BMC's findings?" Raut, who is Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson, asked. "I still respect the court's decision. The law should be equal for all," he added. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation started demolition of alleged unauthorised construction at Ranaut's Pali Hill bungalow on September 9 following a controversy over her tweet comparing Mumbai to Pak-occupied-Kashmir. Commenting on Raut's role, the court said the Sena leader "without being bothered that the rule of law should always prevail, was determined to teach a lesson to the Petitioner (Ranaut)". "Such conduct does not befit a leader like Shri Raut, who is also a Parliamentarian," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/law-should-be-equal-for-all-sanjay-raut-on-hc-ruling-920584.html

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi said as the admission process was at the final stages, they cannot permit reservation for in-service doctors for this year. "We direct that the counselling for admission to super speciality medical courses for the academic year 2020- 2021 shall proceed without providing for reservations to in-service doctors for the academic year 2020-2021," the bench said. Maintaining that its direction would be operative only for the current academic year, the court put the matter related to decisions taken by the Kerala and Tamil Nadu government for providing quota to in-service doctors for further consideration in February next year. The matter before the top court pertained to challenges made by Dr Prerit Sharma and others to the validity of the Tamil Nadu government's November 07, 2020 decision to reserve 50% of the super speciality seats in government medical colleges in the state for in-service candidates. Similarly, questions were raised against the Kerala High Court's direction to implement Kerala medical officers' admission to postgraduate courses under the Service Quota Act, 2008 which provided for 40% reservation to in-service doctors in the super speciality medical courses. The Tamil Nadu government sought to implement its decision saying 70% of doctors trained in the state did not serve there, though a huge amount was expended. It also said in-service doctors would work there till retirement. But the Kerala government expressed its inability to comply with its 2008 law. The Union government cited several previous judgments of the top court to contend there can be no reservation in super specialty courses. The National Medical Commission, for its part, said it was impossible to provide reservation for in-service doctors for this year as the admission process was at an advanced stage. The court also noted that the information bulletin for NEET-SS 2020 was issued on August 3, 2020. The examination was held on September 15 and results were declared on September 25, 2020. "It was made clear in the bulletin that there shall be no reservations of seats for super specialty DM/MCH Courses. The Medical Counselling Committee issued the scheme for 100% all-India quota for NEET super specialty DM/MCH DMB 2020-2021 in which it was made clear that there shall be no reservation," the court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-quota-for-in-service-doctors-in-super-speciality-courses-in-2020-21-sc-920586.html

Here is the top news of November 27, 2020: The Indian economy contracted by 7.5 per cent in the July-September quarter of this fiscal amid the Covid-19 crisis, official data showed on Friday. The gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded by 4.4 per cent in the corresponding July-September period of 2019-20, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The economy had shrunk by an unprecedented 23.9 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal due to the coronavirus pandemic and resultant lockdowns.   India's federal fiscal deficit in the seven months to end-October stood at Rs 9.53 lakh crore ($128.9 billion), or 126.7% of the budgeted target for the whole fiscal year, government data showed on Friday. Net tax receipts were Rs 5.76 lakh crore, down 15.7% from a year ago, while total expenditure was Rs 16.6 lakh crore, the data showed. The deficit is predicted to exceed 8% of GDP in the 2020/21 fiscal year that ends in March 2021, economists said, from initial government estimates of 3.5%, mainly due to a sharp economic contraction triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.   Thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital were allowed in on Thursday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, defusing some of the tension building up since morning around the city’s edges and beyond. The concession came after hours of a standoff that saw police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in some places in their determination to push through as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s new farm laws.   Former Congress minister R Roshan Baig, who is in CBI custody in connection with the multi-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) ponzi scam, has been hospitalised after he complained of chest pain and uneasiness, sources said on Friday. According to sources in the CBI, Baig was rushed to the Jayadeva hospital after he developed health related complications on Thursday evening. Hospital sources said the former minister had undergone an angiogram. Once he is discharged from the hospital, the investigation agency will once again take him in its custody, CBI sources said.   Source: DHNS / PTI/  Reuters||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-indian-economy-contracts-75-in-q2-of-this-fiscal-920592.html

"The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways through S.O. 4252 (E) dated 26th November 2020 has issued the ‘Helmet for riders of Two Wheelers Motor Vehicles (Quality Control ) Order, 2020.’ Protective Helmets for Two Wheeler Riders have been included under compulsory BIS certification and the publication of the Quality Control Order," the ministry said in an official statement. At present nearly 60-70% of helmets sold in India did not conform to the BIS norms. In 2019, a total of 30,148 two-wheeler riders and 14,516 pillion drivers died due to not wearing helmets. As per the directions of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety for considering lighter helmets in India suiting the country's climatic conditions and that for ensuring compliance among citizens to wear the helmets, a Committee was formulated. After detailed analysis, the Committee in its March 2018 report recommended lighter helmets in the country, which the Ministry accepted. As per the recommendations of the Committee, the BIS has revised specifications through which it is expected to make lighter helmets. "With good competition in the Indian markets and with numerous helmet manufacturers, now it is expected that the competition would enable for good quality and lighter helmets demand," said government. The total number of two-wheelers being manufactured in India annually is nearly 1.7 crore. The latest decision on helmet, would help in avoiding sale of low quality two wheeler helmets in the country which would in turn help in protecting citizens involved in two-wheeler accidents from fatal injuries," said government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/only-bis-certified-helmets-to-be-manufactured-sold-in-india-from-june-2021-centre-920594.html
27-11-2020||National||India's GMRT gets IEEE recognition for contributions in exploring the universe||India's biggest radio telescope outside Pune has received a global recognition that in the last 125 years came to only two Indian scientific projects one of which led to a Nobel Prize while the second one was modern India’s first scientific breakthrough. The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, one of the world’s largest and most sensitive low frequency radio observatories, has been recognised by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) under its Milestone Programme for its contributions in exploring the universe through the radio waves. The previous two IEEE milestones from India (both recognized in 2012) are for the pioneering work done by Sir J C Bose to demonstrate the generation and reception of radio waves in 1895, and for the Nobel prize winning discovery by Sir C V Raman in 1928. In fact, it's only after the IEEE recognition, there was a renewed global admission of Sir J C Bose’s pioneering contribution on wireless communication particularly in the millimetre wave transmission that is increasingly becoming relevant with 5G technology. Sir C V Raman and K S Krishnan’s 92 year old experiment at Kolkata’s Indian Association for Cultivation of Science that led to the discovery of the Raman Effect was the other IEEE milestone in India. In contrast Japan has 34 IEEE Milestone projects – the highest in Asia. The IEEE recognises such landmarks in the global pursuit of excellence in science and engineering which have significantly advanced technology for the benefit of humanity on the basis of a historical perspective and extensive documentation. Also the science facility or experiment has to serve humanity at least for 25 years. "The next in line is Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation, which has been supplying electricity since 1897. We are now working on the documentation. There are 15 other Indian proposals under various stages of considerations,” Harish Mysore, senior director, IEEE India told DH. Another project that may come under IEEE Milestone consideration is Karnataka’s Sir Sheshadri Memorial Hydroelectric programme that was set up in 1904 to supply electricity to the Kolar gold field and Mysore city just four years after the discovery of the incandescent bulb. Consisting of an array of 30 antennas of 45 m diameter each at a place 80 km from Pune, GMRT was being used by the astronomers since the last three decades. It pioneered new techniques in antenna design, receiver systems, and signal transport over optical fiber and led to important discoveries on pulsars, supernovae, galaxies, quasars, and cosmology, greatly enhancing human understanding of the universe. “After nearly 14 months of work on documentation, it was indeed a very proud and special moment for us when the IEEE board granted the recognition on November 23,” said Yashwant Gupta, director, National Centre for Radio Astronomy, Pune which runs the GMRT.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-gmrt-gets-ieee-recognition-for-contributions-in-exploring-the-universe-920595.html

Most of the high value technical work like laying of bridges and tunnels will be handled by Indian contractors, while Japanese firms will handle works related to signalling, telecom and rolling stock, he said at a webinar organised by the Associated Chambers of Commerce of India (ASSOCHAM). Of the estimated cost of Rs 1.10 lakh crore for the 508-km-long high-speed rail corridor project, Rs 88,000 crore will be given to India as loan by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). "After a very detailed discussion with the Japanese government, we have made 72 per cent of the entire contract value open to Indian contractors which includes all civil engineering work including bridges, under-sea tunnel related contracts, whereas contracts for Japanese contractors are only limited to signal and telecom, initial rolling stock and electrical works," Yadav said. "The Railways is going to achieve this objective of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' in a big way and the most important thing is that the Railways is developing infrastructure in an integrated manner in such a way that we will be able to take care of traffic requirements till 2050," he said. The chairman said that the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project is getting delayed due to land acquisition. In Gujarat, 90 per cent land has already been acquired and the remaining 10 per cent will be available by December 31. Yadav said. During the webinar, he also said that the final draft of the national rail plan 2030 is ready and it is likely to be released next month. "Vision 2024 is part of the national rail plan 2030 which will be taking care of infrastructure needs which requires to be developed by 2030 to take care of traffic requirements of 2050 and it includes all the projects included in the Vision 2024 document," Yadav said. Speaking on freight loading targets, the Railway Board chairman said that while last year it was 1210 MT, in 2020-21, the target is to achieve 1250 MT and by March 2024, the Railways aims to load 2,024 MT of freight. Yadav also said that there has been a paradigm shift in the last three to four months in the way in which business development activities and marketing initiatives have been undertaken. "Our portal for business development which is under development and by mid of December we are going to provide online facilities like tariff calculation, tracking consignment and others," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/72-bullet-train-contracts-for-indian-cos-japanese-firms-limited-to-telecom-signalling-works-rlys-920607.html

Stressing on the “imperative need” to ensure that tribunals discharge the judicial functions without any interference of the executive whether directly or indirectly, the apex court said that till NTC is constituted, a separate wing in the Ministry of Finance shall be established to cater to the requirements of tribunals. Observing that setting up of such commission would enhance the image of tribunals and instil confidence in the minds of litigants, a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao said dependence of tribunals for all their requirements on the parent department would not “extricate them from the control of the executive”. “Judicial independence of the tribunals can be achieved only when the tribunals are provided the necessary infrastructure and other facilities without having to lean on the shoulders of the executive. This can be achieved by establishment of an independent National Tribunals Commission as suggested above,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat. The observations by the apex court came in its judgement delivered on a batch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the ‘Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualification, Experience and Other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2020. “The Union of India shall constitute a National Tribunals Commission which shall act as an independent body to supervise the appointments and functioning of tribunals, as well as to conduct disciplinary proceedings against members of tribunals and to take care of administrative and infrastructural needs of the tribunals, in an appropriate manner,” the bench said in its 68-page verdict. The apex court said that to stop the dependence of tribunals on their parent departments for routing their requirements and to ensure speedy administrative decision making, “as an interregnum measure, we direct that there should be a separate ‘tribunals wing’ established in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India to take up, deal with and finalize requirements of all the tribunals till the National Tribunals Commission is established.” It said that till amendments are carried out in 2020 Rules, the search-cum-selection committees should comprise of Chief Justice of India or his nominee as the chairperson and others, including the outgoing chairman or president of the tribunal in case of appointment of chairman or president and secretary to the Ministry of Law and Justice. It said that Rule 4(2) of the 2020 Rules shall be amended to provide that the search-cum-selection committee shall recommend the name of one person for appointment to each post instead of a panel of names for appointment to each post and another name may be recommended to be included in the waiting list. “The chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and the members of the tribunal shall hold office for a term of five years and shall be eligible for reappointment.

The sheer number of farmers, who were stopped at the Delhi borders, prompted the Centre to allow them to march to the protest site at Nirankari Samagam Ground at Burari, about 20 km away from the Ramlila Maidan, where they had planned their agitation. “We have come prepared with rations for six months,” said Kartar Singh, a farmer from Punjab who was part of a huge convoy of tractors that brought farmers to the national capital. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the new farm sector laws were the need of the hour and it would bring about revolutionary changes to agriculture in the near future. “I have held one round of talks with farmers’ leaders and have invited them for another round of talks on December 3,” Tomar said. However, a section of the farmers refused to budge from the Delhi-Haryana Singhu Border contending that any move to the Burari grounds could weaken the agitation. Earlier, protesting farmers threw stones and broke barricades as they clashed with Delhi Police at the Singhu border after which police used tear gas shells to disperse them. Angry farmers, who were denied entry into the national capital for their “Delhi Chalo” march against the Centre's new farm laws, managed to break the first layer of barricading, at the border. Plumes of smoke were seen as security personnel used multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesting farmers at the Singhu border. A political war of words also broke out at Congress, AAP and Akali Dal leaders targeted the BJP, accusing it of being insensitive to the demands of the farmers. The AAP government in Delhi turned down a request from Delhi Police to earmark nine stadia in the national capital as jails to detain farmers marching towards the capital. AAP leaders have also announced that it would make all the arrangements for the stay of farmers protesting in the capital. Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government and said that no government in the world can stop farmers from waging the “battle of truth”. “The Modi government will have to agree to the demands of the farmers and take back the black laws. This is just the beginning,” Rahul said on Twitter with the hashtag ‘IamWithFarmers’.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-march-to-delhi-to-demand-rollback-of-farm-reforms-920616.html

A high-power committee headed by V K Paul, NITI Aayog member, had recommended that Delhi should prepare for a surge of 15,000 cases per day and accordingly prepare Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, but the Delhi government did take no timely measures for it, the Union government said. “While there were regular advertisements on achievements of Delhi Government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures,” the Ministry of Home Affair said in an affidavit. The Centre further claimed that containment measures, as prescribed by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, including house to house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine and clinical management, were also not done properly, leading to the spread of infection. "Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced," it said. The Centre also pointed out 10 states contributed almost 77% of the active case load for the country. These are: Maharashtra (18.9%), Kerala (14.7%), Delhi (8.5%), West Bengal (5.7%), Karnataka (5.6%), Uttar Pradesh (5.4%), Rajasthan (5.5%), Chhattisgarh (5.0%), Haryana (4.7%) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1%). Among the measures, it said, inter-sectoral coordination, travel advisories and guidelines for Covid-19, laboratory support, hospital infrastructure, community surveillance and surveillance at airports, sea ports and land border crossing were being undertaken. It also said five vaccines were in clinical trial stage, of which two vaccines were in Phase III trials and three were in phase II trials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-govt-failed-to-contain-covid-19-surge-centre-tells-sc-920626.html

On the occasion of National Organ Donation Day, he said no age, caste, religion, community, belief should come as an obstacle in a task as divine as that of donating organs. "A large number of people die due to non-functioning of organs. According to the national health portal, about 5 lakh people die every year due to non-availability of organs. I also want to say here that no age, caste, religion, community, belief should ever come as an obstacle in a task as divine as that of donating organs," he was quoted as saying in a statement by the health ministry. "If a person below 18 years of age wishes to donate organ, he can do so with the consent of his parents or guardian. The goal of this campaign is to remove the fear of organ donation by spreading awareness through webinars, seminars and workshops and aiming at the root of the problem by granting acceptance to organ donation," Vardhan added. Noting the Covid-19 pandemic has had a hugely negative impact on the deceased donor programme in India, he said, "National events such as the Indian Organ Donation Day where we recognise the selfless contribution made by deceased donors to healthcare and mankind re-instill our faith in humanity." He said Tamil Nadu performed 295 transplantations out of which 76 were lung transplants performed mostly on patients who suffered acute forms of Covid-19. "With 12,666 organs transplanted in 2019, India ranked third in the world as per data available on the WHO Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT) website. This exemplary performance by states and healthcare professionals in our country should be encouraged at every step so that the curve keeps following an upward trend," Vardhan said. As a gesture of gratitude, he read out the names of donors from every state whose death rekindled the lives of others. On the occasion, 79,572 soldiers, who have been named by CRPF as 'Angadan warriors', duly filled their pledge forms to donate their eyes, skin, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, heart valves and intestines after death. "They exemplify the spirit of service to the nation even after death," Vardhan said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-has-had-hugely-negative-impact-on-deceased-donor-programme-harsh-vardhan-920632.html

Ramesh said the 'Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas' has started discussions with stakeholders and he exuded confidence of coming up with an "acceptable and suitable solution" to combat air pollution by next year. He said 2018 recorded 51,751 incidents of farm fires from mid-October to November end. This figure was the highest between 2010-2018, he said. The number dropped marginally to 50,738 a year later. "This year, 73,000 cases of farm fires were reported until November 17," Ramesh, who was the former director general of the India Meteorology Department, said citing a study done by the Air Pollution Action Group. Ramesh was speaking at a webinar on 'Clean Air Management for Public Welfare'. The webinar was organised by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, a research body under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. IITM has launched several initiatives like SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) to track air pollution. Farm fires or stubble burning post-harvest season during October-November in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan significantly contribute to the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR. Last month, the Centre announced formation of the Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas. The members include a chairperson, a representative of Environment secretary and five ex-officio members who are either chief secretaries or secretaries in charge of the environment departments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  It also has two full-time members who have been joint secretaries to the central government, three full-time independent technical members who have specific scientific knowledge regarding air pollution, one technical member from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), one technical member nominated by ISRO and three members of NGOs having experience in matters concerning combating of air pollution. Ramesh, who is the one of the technical members, said the commission began its work from November 16. "Our work is to develop a common understanding on the issues of concern for Delhi's (Delhi-NCR) air quality by taking all states and central government ministries into assessment, understanding the process and evolving the most acceptable approach to emission reduction in Punjab, neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh...." He said the commission has started interactions with various groups in Delhi, with the Central Pollution Control Board, IMD and Indian Agricultural Research Institute's microbiology group where the bio-decomposer option is being talked about and tested at selected field sites. "We had a very detailed briefing from member of the EPCA (Environment Pollution [Prevention and Control] Authority), Sunita Narain. "With everybody's effort, the most acceptable and suitable solution for air quality improvement would emerge, definitely by next year. The target is to show some substantive changes with which the commission is working," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/stubble-burning-rose-by-more-than-20-this-year-air-quality-commission-official-920639.html

Following the talks in the virtual format, the defence ministry said the two sides signed an arrangement that will facilitate sharing of hydrographic data between the two countries. In the talks, both the ministers reaffirmed that defence cooperation is a key pillar of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, it said. "They discussed various ongoing projects and the future trajectory of bilateral defence engagements," the ministry said. Officials said both sides agreed to further boost the overall defence and strategic cooperation.    India and Vietnam upgraded their relationship to the level of comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016 and the defence cooperation has been one of the most significant pillars of the fast expanding bilateral ties. "The Vietnamese defence minister thanked the Raksha Mantri for the assistance by Indian armed forces in capacity building of Vietnamese defence forces especially in the field of human resource development," the ministry said. "Raksha Mantri conveyed India's willingness to enhance the scope and level of training for all three services of Vietnam defence forces in Indian defence institutes," it added. It said Singh underlined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of “Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India)” including in the defence sector. Singh outlined that a strong and self reliant India will positively contribute to capacity building of friendly partner countries like Vietnam. "He urged for closer defence industry cooperation between India and Vietnam by concluding an institutionalised framework agreement in the near future," the ministry said. Vietnam, an important country of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), has territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea region. India has oil exploration projects in the Vietnamese waters in the South China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons.

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah disposed of a PIL by Gajendra Sharma after he expressed satisfaction with the relief announced on charging of interest on the interest during the Covid-19-induced six-month moratorium on loan. On October 23, the Union government had told the court that it announced a scheme for grant of ex-gratia payment of the difference between compound interest and simple interest for six months to borrowers in specified loan accounts like MSMEs, education, housing, consumer durables, automobile and personal loans as well as credit card dues up to Rs 2 crore. Going through the affidavits filed by the Centre, the bench said it is clear that the Union government was fully conscious of the difficulties faced by the various sectors and and and took different measures to mitigate their hardships. "The pandemic Covid-19 has not only caused serious threat to the health of the people but has also cast its shadow on the economic growth of the country as well as other countries in the entire world. Due to lockdown imposed by the Government of India in exercise of powers under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, there can be no denying that most of the businesses including private sector as well as public sector have been adversely affected," the court noted. It said for several months, a large number of industries were not allowed to function and exemptions were granted only to some industries to run and carry on its activities. Although, gradually, due to Unlock - 1, 2 and 3, the industries and other business activities have been restored and the economy of the country is on track but at a slow pace.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-asks-centre-rbi-to-ensure-compound-interest-relief-on-loans-reaches-beneficiaries-920643.html

Jaishankar called on Seychelles’s new President Wavel Ramkalawan in Victoria on Friday. They discussed India-Seychelles security cooperation and development partnership. Ramkalawan took over as the new President of Seychelles after incumbent Danny Faure was voted out of the top office in the elections held last month. His ancestors had migrated from Bihar in India to Seychelles. The pastor-turned-politician earlier had two long stints as the leader of the Opposition in the parliament of the Indian Ocean nation – from 1998 to 2011 and from 2016 to 2020. Jaishankar handed over to Ramkalawan a personal congratulatory message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Discussed our close security cooperation, strong development partnership and long-standing people-to-people contacts,” he posted on Twitter, after meeting the new Seychelles President. “Assured him that Seychelles had a particular priority, both under the Neighbourhood First policy and the SAGAR outlook. Look forward to further strengthening our ties under his leadership.” Ramkalawan’s Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS) party earlier stalled the ratification of an agreement erstwhile Faure Government had inked with New Delhi for allowing India to invest $ 550 million to build a naval facility at the Assumption Island of Seychelles. He continued to oppose the project during his campaign ahead of the presidential elections. New Delhi, however, appears to be still not ready to give up hope for the project as the proposed facility on the Assumption Island of Seychelles will give the Indian Navy an edge in its outreach towards the Western Indian Ocean Region apart from keeping tabs on the shipping lanes in the vicinity of the island nation. India is keen to set up the facility as a countermeasure to the military base China built in Djibouti, which is located on a global shipping point linking the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, Modi’s National Security Advisor Doval had a bilateral meeting with Major Gen (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne, Defence Secretary of Sri Lanka, in Colombo. They discussed “matters pertaining to the growing defence and security partnership between the two countries (India and Sri Lanka)” and agreed “on several steps to further strengthen the valuable cooperation between two countries which also contributes to peace and security in the region”, according to the High Commission of India in Colombo. Doval also had a separate bilateral meeting with Maldivian Defence Minister Mariya Didi and had detailed discussion on deepening bilateral partnership between the two nations in defence and security. Doval, Gunaratne and Mariya Didi will hold a trilateral meeting on maritime security cooperation. The meeting is being held after six years and is being hosted by the Sri Lankan Government. New Delhi is keen to step up maritime security cooperation with Maldives and Sri Lanka to counter China’s bid to build strategic assets in the neighbourhood of India and to spread its geo-strategic influence in the Indian Ocean region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/s-jaishankar-in-seychelles-doval-in-colombo-india-ups-outreach-to-indian-ocean-region-to-counter-china-920645.html

The leaders discussed the work the UK and India are doing together across trade, climate change, defence, security and health with Johnson asserting that 2021 would be a year to deepen and strengthen the UK-India relationship, according to a Downing Street spokesperson. "The Prime Minister (Johnson) and Prime Minister Modi discussed joint efforts to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, and welcomed the collaboration between our countries' leading scientists. They looked forward to next month's Climate Ambition Summit, which will be an opportunity to reinvigorate the global efforts against climate change ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit next year," the spokesperson said. The UK is set to host the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow next year after the summit was postponed from its planned schedule this month due to the coronavirus pandemic and its worldwide lockdown impact. The UK and India have, meanwhile, held a series of virtual dialogues during the course of the year, including the 10th UK-India Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD) held at the end of October. Prime Minister (Johnson) stressed the importance of improving bilateral trade and investment flows and the two leaders welcomed the extensive work that has taken place on this to date and shared an ambition for deepening the economic relationship, the Downing Street spokesperson said. The PMO statement also said the two leaders laid particular emphasis on India and the UK joining hands in the fight against climate change and appreciated their collaboration under platforms like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-speaks-to-british-counterpart-boris-johnson-on-covid-19-vaccines-trade-and-security-920660.html
27-11-2020||National||Abrogation of Article 370 in interest of J&K: Anurag Thakur||Asserting that the abrogation of "irrelevant" Articles 370 and 35A is in the interest of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Union minister Anurag Thakur on Friday alleged that Gupkar alliance is trying to cheat citizens by selling false dreams about the restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state. Thakur said that Articles 370 and 35A are gone forever and it is not possible to restore them under any circumstances.  "The removal of irrelevant Articles 370 and 35A from Jammu and Kashmir is in the interest of the people here and Gupkar alliance is trying to cheat the Union Territory by selling false dreams about restoration of Article 370," he alleged. "Jammu and Kashmir is the crown of India and the Modi government at the Centre is committed to enhance its beauty, dignity and elegance and to maintain an atmosphere of peace here," Thakur said. He said that the Modi government removed the "curse" of Jammu and Kashmir by removing the provisions which were a hindrance in development.  "Due to 370 and 35A, for years Jammu and Kashmir and its citizens were deprived of the facilities they were entitled to. Under these irrelevant articles, some families worked only to make their political fortunes and live luxuriously. But Modi ji has given this state its right and identity," he added.  Thakur claimed that there is panic among these families and they are speaking the language of anti-nationals to compromise the interests of the state and are going with the enemies of country.  "It is our collective responsibility that in these DDC elections, for the prosperity, progress and peace of the state, we make the BJP win with an overwhelming majority and reject these families," he added. He questioned why governments had so far upheld Article 370 and misled the people of the country? With its removal, the problem of dual citizenship of the locals in Jammu and Kashmir has ended and the tribal and Balmiki society has got citizenship, Thakur said. "The way has been cleared for the establishment of industries and businesses and to create employment in the state. Women will now be able to get their rights even after marriage", he added.  Thakur said that after the withdrawal of the provisions, the days of stone pelting and terrorist incidents are under control.  After the removal of Article 370, for the first time the poor general class has got the benefit of reservation, he said, adding, "The people of Jammu and Kashmir have got their rights now and they know that the BJP government will continue to protect their interests in the same way".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/abrogation-of-article-370-in-interest-of-jk-anurag-thakur-920665.html
27-11-2020||National||We look forward to working with Germany on cooperation in Indo-Pacific: Shringla||India on Friday said it was looking forward to working with Germany in advancing practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure security and growth for all. In an address at a virtual conference on Indo-German ties, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla referred to Berlin's release of policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific region, and said that India was happy to note the "high degree" of convergence between the two countries on the issue. "Germany has also released its Indo-Pacific guidelines earlier this year and we welcome this development. We are also happy to note the high degree of convergence between India and Germany on the Indo-Pacific," he said. "We look forward to working with Germany in advancing practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure security and growth for all," Shringla said. On September 2, the German government released a document titled 'Policy guidelines for the Indo-Pacific region' that highlighted the country's vision for the region. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among the leading global powers. India, the US, Japan and Australia have been focusing on a comprehensive approach for the Indo-Pacific region under their quadrilateral coalition or "Quad". In his address at the 'Indo-German 1.5 Track Dialogue 2020', Shringla also referred to India's vision for the Indo-Pacific as outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in 2018. "We call for a free, open and inclusive order in the Indo-Pacific, based upon respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international rules and laws," he said. "At the Shangri-La Dialogue, the prime minister also spoke about the doctrine of 'Security and Growth for All in the Region' or SAGAR which guides our approach to the Indo-Pacific," the foreign secretary said. Talking about the coronavirus pandemic, Shringla said it has brought to the fore the need for more secure and reliable supply chains. "There is global recognition that we need to diversify our supply chains and design them to be more resilient to disruptions like the current pandemic. We also see this as an opportunity to make India, in the words of the prime minister, an 'active manufacturing hub placed at the heart of global value chains," he said. "This is the vision of the Atmanirbhar Bharat or self-reliant India campaign launched by our prime minister. The campaign, as the prime minister has underlined, merges domestic production and consumption with global supply chains," the foreign secretary said. Shringla also mentioned the reform measures India has undertaken since the pandemic began. "We have simplified our labour laws; instituted landmark reforms in the agriculture sector; and launched production linked incentive schemes to attract investment in sectors ranging from electronics manufacturing and solar modules to auto, textiles and pharmaceuticals," he added. The foreign secretary also said that German companies can ramp up their investments in India in a way that can decisively change the current paradigm. "We also see great potential for collaboration between our two countries in the area of digitisation, startups, innovation and new and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence," he said. Shringla also said climate change was another area on which India and Germany have a strong convergence of views and interests. "India played an important role in reaching the agreement to combat climate change at Paris in 2015. Despite its huge developmental challenges and energy requirements, India set ambitious targets for itself in renewable power, non-fossil fuel energy and increasing the green cover," he said. "And today, India is not only on track to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement, but is going beyond these commitments in its fight against climate change," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/we-look-forward-to-working-with-germany-on-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-shringla-920672.html

If anyone thinks that irregularities have been committed in the election, he can move the court for the redressal of grievances, Kumar said in the assembly while replying to a debate on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor's address. "Victory even by one vote is ultimately a victory. We have 125 (seats) and anyone having 122 would form the government. If anyone thinks that something wrong has been done (in the assembly election), he can move the court which will hear the case and give its ruling," Kumar said. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of the RJD, while participating in the debate earlier in the day, said that the NDA emerged victorious by getting only 12,270 votes and 16 seats more than what the Grand Alliance secured. Yadav also said that the JD(U) headed by Kumar finished a poor third in the election even after contesting as a partner of "the world's largest party (BJP)." The chief minister, without naming the RJD leader, said, "I would request you to maintain some decorum and dignity if you want to prosper in life." Kumar said that the government has already issued directions for carrying out the paddy procurement work and set a target of procuring 30 lakh tonne paddy in the state in the current season. Stating that his government has worked for every section of the society and every region of the state, Kumar said that he will prepare a plan of action for carrying out development programmes. Stern action would be taken against erring officials if members inform the government of any irregularity in the implementation of the "Saat nischay" development schemes, he said. The CM also talked about the development work his government has done in the fields of education, health, power, agriculture and roads. On tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, Kumar said that over one lakh tests are being conducted daily in the state. "Covid cases are increasing globally and some of the states have also witnessed a spike in cases recently. There is a chance that cases may rise here (in Bihar) too," he said. The coronavirus situation is good in Bihar but there should be no complacency, he said and urged the people of the state to follow Covid safety protocols properly. The motion of thanks to the governor's address was passed by voice vote. Members of opposition - the RJD, Congress, AIMIM and the Left parties - walked out after voting on the motion had taken place.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/win-by-even-one-vote-is-ultimately-a-victory-nitish-920685.html

Naik was addressing a virtual meet on opportunities at Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) and Mazagao Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDSL), organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The union minister said that more than 60 per cent of the Indian Navy's budget is dedicated to capital expenditure and nearly 70 per cent of this capital budget has been spent on indigenous sourcing, amounting to nearly Rs 66,000 crore in the last five years. He said that with more than 60 major surface and sub-surface platforms being built for mainly the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard at Goa Shipyard Limited, Mazagon Docks Shipbuilders Limited, Garden Reach Shipbuilder and Engineers (GRSE), Hindustan Shipyards Limited (HSL) and Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), the potential for MSMEs is vast. Naik said "expected orders for surface ships and submarines to be executed from 2020 to 2030 are to the tune of USD 51 billion". Speaking during the event, CII Goa State Council Chairman Blaise Costabir said that with India's maritime interests growing at a fast pace in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, the country's shipbuilding will see increased focus and demand. The country's vast coastline and the evolving geopolitical situation in India's neighbourhood has also put a greater thrust on maritime safety and security, he added. Chairman and Managing Director of GSL said the defence shipbuilding sector will continue to see robust growth. There was 9.3 per cent growth in the defence budget in 2019-20, he said and added that the country expects to see the same trend for the next 10 years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/51-billion-orders-likely-to-be-executed-by-navy-for-surface-ships-submarines-in-10-years-govt-920688.html

I am extremely grateful to him for accepting our legitimate demand since he also heads The Department of Pharmaceutical, a division of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers," the Maritime Union of India (MUI) General Secretary Amar Singh Thakur said in a statement. About 90 per cent of world trade takes place through sea routes currently. Since the outbreak of the pandemic in India and subsequent lockdowns thereafter, "Indian seafarers have relentlessly worked aboard cargo ships worldwide to serve our nation for maintaining the regular supply of merchandise, including essential items like food, fuel and medicines", he said. "While we continue to salute the contribution of Indian police personnel and healthcare workers, the immense contribution of Corona warriors like Indian seafarers too deserves huge accolades," he said. Thakur said that protection of Indian seafarers' health will be the prime focus of the MUI going forward. "To enable Indian seafarers work tirelessly aboard cargo ships and continue their service to our nation in the post pandemic phase, it is absolutely necessary to get them administered COVID-19 vaccine doses at the earliest possible. This is why, vaccines should be made available to them on priority basis at the earliest," he added. With the help of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways of India, the MUI intends to procure vaccines for its members on priority basis from the manufacturers based in India. Recently, the MUI and its Trusts donated Rs 25 lakh to PM Cares Fund dedicated to strengthen India's fight against the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/mui-says-govt-assures-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-for-indian-seafarers-on-priority-basis-920723.html

Addressing a virtual conference organised by realtors' body NAREDCO, the minister said the circle rates need to come down. "I think time has also now come to offload some inventories. Don't hang on to it," Puri said as he emphasised that it would spur economic activities and benefit developers. Puri said the finance ministry has recently relaxed income tax rules increasing differential between circle rate and transaction value to 20 per cent. Recently, the government announced changes in Income Tax rules to allow primary or first sale of housing units of up to Rs 2 crore at a price that can be 20 per cent below the stamp duty circle rate. Earlier, the law restricted differential between circle rate and agreement value at 10 per cent. The move was aimed to help builders clear unsold inventories. "This 20 per cent will lead to greater economic activities. All of you should step up now. Get rid of inventories," Puri said, adding that circle rates need to come down. Talking about stamp duty, Puri said he had written to chief ministers on this issue. Maharashtra and Karnataka governments have cut stamp duty on transactions of immovable properties to boost sales. Initial estimate suggest that there has been good response to the move, he noted. The sales registrations in Maharashtra for September 2020 has surpassed pre-Covid-19 level and recorded highest registration for the calendar year at 1,19,834, the minister said. Further, Puri said that he would write another letter to chief ministers and give a "renewed push", citing the experience of Maharashtra. Responding to concerns over delays in environmental clearances, Puri asked builders to share the exact problem and that he would write a letter to the Union Environment Minister if it relates to the central government. The minister also said that he would push for extending the deadline for Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for middle income group. It is currently valid till March 2021. On the demand for allowing financial institutions to set up stress fund, Puri said, "it is a great idea and I am wiling to make recommendations". The minister expressed satisfaction about the implementation progress of Prime Minister Aawas Yojana (PMAY) and the recently launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC)  programme as well as scheme for street vendors. These schemes are being seriously implemented and regularly reviewed at the highest level, he added. Puri, who is also in charge of the civil aviation ministry, talked about the civil aviation sector at the event. He expressed confidence that domestic air passenger traffic would touch pre-Covid-19 level by the end of this year. "When we opened domestic civil aviation, we were at a point of 30,000 passengers a day. Two days ago, we registered 2,38,000 in a day... between now and end of the year, we will be at pre-Covid-19 levels of 3,00,000 plus," he said. Domestic commercial flights were suspended for two months from March 25 as part of efforts to curb spreading of coronavirus infections. He also said that the economy is reviving. "In most areas of economic activities, we are almost at pre-Covid-19 level or even higher," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hardeep-singh-puri-tells-builders-to-offload-unsold-inventories-920734.html

Goswami along with Pramanik left for New Delhi this morning. According to state BJP sources, Goswami might join the saffron camp this evening. The TMC leadership declined to comment on the development. However, Goswami could not be contacted for his comments. Two days after senior TMC leader Rabindranath Ghosh visited him at his residence, Goswami on Thursday said it will be difficult for him to continue his association with the party, as he won't be able to put up with more humiliation. The TMC MLA from Coochbehar Dakshin, who met Pramanik in October fuelling speculation over his future course of action, said on various occasions he had "digested insults", but continued to stick to the party because of his allegiance to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Goswami, who remained non-committal over his plans, said in a Facebook post in Bengali on Thursday, "It seems to be tough for me to remain within the Trinamool (Congress) with which I have been associated for 22 years." The TMC had made several attempts to woo him back in the last few days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tmc-mla-mihir-goswami-leaves-for-delhi-with-bjp-mp-920451.html

Although Fadnavis did not specify which verdicts he was talking about, he was apparently referring to the Supreme Court's decision to extend journalist Arnab Goswami's interim bail and the Bombay High Court's observation that the action of Mumbai civic body's demolishing part of actor Kangana Ranaut's bungalow in Mumbai was illegal and smacks of malafide intentions. In a series of tweets in Marathi, Fadnavis said, "The verdicts of two courts in the country given on the same day in a way sum up the performance of the government in the last one year. But will they now call the SC and the HC as Maharashtra-drohi (anti-Maharashtra)?" "The verdicts of the SC and the HC over some of the incidents that occurred in Maharashtra in the recent past due to the rulers blinded by power, were a tight slap to the government. They should realise that every voice against the government cannot be crushed like this," he added. "The state government forgot that we have a democracy in the country. If the courts have to remind this government that criminal procedure code is for the protection of the people and not for their harassment, then it gives rise to a question whether they are violating the oath they had taken at the time of swearing-in," the former Maharashtra chief minister said. When contacted over the courts' decisions, Shiv Sena chief spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said, "I have come to know about these decisions through media. I need to study them thoroughly before commenting over it. I need some time." The Supreme Court on Friday said the interim bail to journalist Arnab Goswami and two others in an abetment to suicide case will continue till the Bombay High Court disposes of their plea, and stated that the judiciary should ensure criminal law does not become a weapon for selective harassment. The accused were arrested by Alibaug police in Maharashtra's Raigad district on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused. Goswami walked out of Taloja jail on November 11 after the SC granted interim bail to him. The Bombay High Court on Friday declared the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) action of demolishing part ofRanaut's bungalow here as illegal and said it smacks of malafide intentions. The court was presiding over a petition filed by Ranaut, seeking that the partial demolition of her Pali Hill bungalow carried out by the Shiv Sena-controlled BMC on September 9 be declared illegal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/devendra-fadnavis-latches-on-to-recent-sc-hc-verdicts-to-target-mva-govt-920474.html
27-11-2020||National Politics||Politics over farmers' protests picks up: As Opposition unites, BJP alleges farmers being misled||The ongoing farmer agitation brought a semblance of unity among Opposition parties and has even breached NDA ranks even as the BJP has laid the blame at the doors of Congress accusing it of misleading farmers. While former NDA ally Shiromani Akali Dal, which walked out of the ruling alliance in September hit out at the government accused it of treating farmers as "enemy of the State", NDA ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), which had contested the 2018 Assembly polls in Rajasthan in alliance with the BJP said the Centre should listen to farmers' issues and withdraw the recently passed farm laws. There are also murmurs of protest against another NDA ally Jananyak Janata Party headed by Dushyant Chautala in agrarian state Haryana as the protests continue. Chautala, the great-grandson of farmer leader Devi Lal and grandson of Om Prakash Chautala has roots in the farming community and his party's main support base is among farmland owning Jats. He has already faced a gherao (blockade) of his residence by farmers after the passage of the land bill. The BJP government in Haryana is dependent on the support of JJP after the 2019 Assembly poll threw a hung verdict. Congress has repeatedly attacked the JJP on farmers' issues reminding it of the legacy of farmer politics of Chautala's predecessors. What can queer the pitch further for JJP is that after clashes broke out at multiple places, Haryana Congress took the issue up with former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda going to the extent of making an appeal of people to extend all possible help like food and accommodation to marching farmers. Hooda also attacked the BJP-JJP government in Haryana over the use of water cannons and tear gas against the protesting farmers. RLP leader Hanuman Beniwal, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Nagaur tweeted that the central government needs to take back the agricultural bills after hearing the issues of farmers coming to Delhi to protest against the agricultural bills. He also said that the governments of nearby states including Haryana should not adopt any oppressive policy against farmers and threatened that if the police and governments adopted an oppressive policy against farmers, the RLP will hold demonstrations across the country, including in Rajasthan, in favour of farmers. Akali Dal has condemned the use of force to stop them from marching towards Delhi saying the Modi government should not adopt a policy of confrontation with farmers. Last week the Centre withdrew Z+ security cover for SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia after which the former NDA ally cried political vendetta over the party quitting the ruling alliance. On the Opposition front, the issue has evoked strong reactions from the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi. Delhi Government has rejected the request of Delhi Police seeking to convert nine stadiums into temporary prisons, in view of farmers' protest and argued that the farmers' agitation is non-violent. "It is the right of every individual to protest in a non-violent manner. They cannot be put in jail for that. Hence Delhi government rejects this application of Delhi police to turn the stadium into jail." Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal rued that instead of Centre withdrawing the "anti-farmer bills", water cannons are being used on farmers. Banerjee has accused the BJP of "snatching" the livelihood of farmers and "curbing" their rights. AAP MLA Raghav Chadha said, "the central government's hubris and inability to dialogue with or listen to the farmer - is an affront to the very 'will of the people' in whose name a govt is allowed to temporarily govern." However, the BJP launched a hashtag on Twitter #ModiWithFarmers alleging that farmers have received freedom from middlemen due to the farm laws passed by the Modi government but "some political parties and middlemen are spreading rumours and misleading the farmers".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/politics-over-farmers-protests-picks-up-as-opposition-unites-bjp-alleges-farmers-being-misled-920573.html

"Blinded by the greed for power, the state BJP leaders are doing negative politics by giving statements at the behest of their Central leaders about toppling the government and spreading fear about coronavirus,” said Gehlot in a statement. “The BJP should know that people of Rajasthan will not accept such unethical acts and will reply to BJP’'s measly efforts to take political mileage," he added. Accusing the BJP leaders of indulging in “negative politics”, Gehlot said, “In this era of a global pandemic, when the Rajasthan government is working along with the opposition and all sections of the society, the BJP leaders’ statements are bringing down the level of politics in the state." In his statement, Gehlot said the BJP leaders have made “unrestrained” remarks in the past few days about the corona management of the Rajasthan government and the future of the government. “Their negative politics has created resentment in the public against the opposition,” he said. “Many senior leaders of Rajasthan’s BJP have given statements that the state government will fall in coming days,” he said, naming Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria and Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal among others as having made such statements. "It is clear from these statements that the BJP is trying to destabilise the Rajasthan government on the basis of money and muscle power," he said. The BJP made similar efforts in the past, but due to the solidarity and commitment of the Congress MLAs, they had to face defeat, Gehlot added. The BJP, which formed the government through horse-trading in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, is still frustrated by its defeat in Rajasthan, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-trying-to-destabilise-my-govt-ashok-gehlot-920649.html

Stating that they were ready for a "do or die" battle against the union government, women owing allegiance to various farmers' outfits braved cold weather to set out for Delhi. A number of them travelled on tractor trolleys carrying ration and other essentials to participate in the protest. "We have brought with us enough stocks of ration, quilts, mattresses and other essentials. We are prepared for this 'do or die' battle and will rest only when the Modi government rolls back the farm laws," a 68-year-old woman, who was travelling in a tractor with her family, said. Near the Bathinda-Dabwali border, women under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugarhan) participated in a sit-in and shouted slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre.   Ahead of the Delhi Chalo protest, women had led several campaigns in rural areas to seek support of people and create awareness among them about the so-called "black laws". Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugarhan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan has said around 25,000 women would participate in the protest march. Massive participation of youth was also one of the main highlights of the Delhi Chalo protest. They led marches to force their way into Haryana despite tight security arrangements made by the Haryana police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-march-gets-overwhelming-response-from-women-920308.html

"Entry & exit gates of Brigadier Hoshiar Singh, Bahadurgarh City, Pandit Shree Ram Sharma, Tikri Border, Tikri Kalan and Ghevra stations on Green Line are now closed," the DMRC tweeted. The Delhi Metro authorities had earlier announced that services from neighbouring cities will remain suspended on Friday "As advised by Delhi Police, Metro services will be available only from Delhi towards the NCR sections. However, services from the NCR stations towards Delhi will not be available due to security reasons till further notice. However, metro services will be available from Delhi towards the NCR sections," DMRC had said. The Delhi Police on Friday used tear gas shells to disperse a group of farmers who had reached the Singhu border as part of the protest march. The shells were fired at the border point which connects Delhi with Haryana. Security has been strengthened at the border and sand-laden trucks and water cannons have been stationed. Barbed wire is also being used for fencing at the Singhu border to prevent the protesters from entering the city. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, have announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. Tension was escalating at all the border points. Farmers have assembled near the borders in tractor-trolleys laden with rations and essentials for their proposed Delhi march. Authorities in Haryana have imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in several parts of the state to prevent assembly of the protesters. The Farmers' bodies have said that they will hold a dharna wherever they are stopped from moving towards the national capital to demand the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-entry-exit-gates-at-6-delhi-metro-stations-on-green-line-closed-920409.html
27-11-2020||North and Central||Doctors warn over Delhi's 'suicidal' half-marathon||Top doctors have warned elite runners are taking a major health risk by competing in Sunday's New Delhi half-marathon in the midst of a major coronavirus outbreak and soaring air pollution. Women's marathon world record-holder Brigid Kosgei from Kenya and Ethiopia's two-time men's winner Andamlak Belihu are among the 49 elite athletes running the 21-kilometre (13.1 mile) race, while thousands of amateurs are taking part virtually. Organisers say the "highest level of safety-standards, with bio-secure zones" have been laid on for the race starting at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. But with New Delhi recording more than 500,000 virus cases, and air quality in the world's most polluted capital hovering between 'unhealthy' and 'hazardous', health experts said the athletes should think twice. "It will be suicidal for runners to run the race this time. We have such high levels of pollution, we have the risk of coronavirus," Arvind Kumar, founder trustee of the Lung Care Foundation, told AFP. "With the presence of this twin threat if people are still running despite knowing everything, well, I have no words to express my anguish." "Whether you are an international elite runner or you are a small boy from a village, the damaging potential of a damaging agent remains the same," said the doctor. Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the country's top research body, told AFP that "in an ideal situation" the race should not be run. "Because of high levels of air pollution, exercising outside in this weather sometimes can lead to aggravation of underlying lung problems," he said. "Even if you are an elite runner the air pollution would still affect your lung." Normally thousands of amateurs would also take part, but because of the coronavirus they have been told to run their chosen route between Wednesday and Sunday and chart their time on an app. Delhi has been hit by a winter pollution crisis each year for the past decade when crop-stubble burning from nearby states, cold temperatures and car and industrial pollution produce a toxic mix. This year, the Indian capital is also a major concern in the battle against the coronavirus. India is the world's second worst-hit country behind the United States, with about 9.3 million cases. The city is considering imposing a night-time curfew because of the rising number of cases, according to media reports. Kosgei, who is visiting India for the first time, acknowledged her concerns about travelling for the race. "We have definitely been affected by Covid-19. I had to convince my parents and family back home to allow me to visit Delhi for the half-marathon," she said. "The virus has affected most of the sporting events. But it is important for us to take care of ourselves." As in other countries, nearly all sport in India has been cancelled. After repeated delays, the Indian Premier League cricket went ahead in the United Arab Emirates and the Indian Super League football is being held in a bio-secure "bubble" in Goa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/doctors-warn-over-delhis-suicidal-half-marathon-920429.html

The Delhi Police used tear gas at the Singhu and Tikri borders to disperse protesting farmers as they tried to enter the national capital on Friday morning. While rejecting the Delhi Police's request, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain said that every Indian citizen has the constitutional right to protest peacefully for which they cannot be put in jails. In a letter to the principal home secretary, Jain said that the central government should accept the demands of the protesters, adding that putting farmers in jails is not the solution. Earlier, the Delhi Police had sought permission from the AAP government to use the city's nine stadiums as temporary jails for the agitating farmers. "In view of the farmers' march, the Delhi Police have asked the Delhi government for permission to use nine stadiums as temporary jails to keep the detained or arrested farmers," a source said earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police has enhanced deployment of security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons and used barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu and Tikri border points (Delhi-Haryana border) to prevent the protesters from entering the city.

Angry farmers, who were denied entry into the national capital for their 'Delhi Chalo' march against the Centre's new farm laws, managed to break the first layer of barricading, at the border. Plumes of smoke were seen as security personnel used multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesting farmers at the Singhu border. "The farmers are resorting to stone pelting. They have been denied permission and legal action will be taken against them if they still enter or attempt to jump over barricades," a police official said. At the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, farmers could be seen talking to a battery of police personnel across barbed wire fencing stretching across the road. Multi-layer barricading, including sand laden trucks and water cannons, was put up to block the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-pelt-stones-break-barricades-at-delhi-haryana-singhu-border-920457.html

27-11-2020||North and Central||New Delhi ambulance group grapples with surging Covid-19 quarantine deaths||Wearing a yellow turban and white overalls, Jitender Singh Shunty and three of his coworkers carefully pulled the body of a 57-year-old Covid-19 victim out of his bedroom in a house in New Delhi's west and onto an ambulance waiting downstairs. A second ambulance from Shunty's non-profit medical service carrying three other Covid-19 patients joined them on the Indian capital's clogged roads for a trip to a crematorium in the city's east. Before the novel coronavirus engulfed India, the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal helped cremate the unclaimed bodies of homeless people and others. This month, Shunty's team has been flooded with calls from families of those dying at home after quarantining for Covid-19. The disease has killed more than 2,000 people this month in the city slammed by its third, and most severe, surge of infections. Shunty's group has ferried up to 25 such bodies a day this month, compared to about three earlier. While infections and fatalities have slowed in India since a mid-September peak, Delhi is going in the opposite direction. "Corona has gone out of control in Delhi," said Shunty, who founded the non-governmental organisation more than 25 years ago. It runs 16 ambulances, almost all of them working overtime these days. "Too many deaths are happening, especially among the old and people with other complications." India has reported 9.3 million infections so far, the world's second-highest after the United States, with more than 135,000 fatalities. From the pandemic's start, Delhi has encouraged home isolation for non-severe patients to reduce the burden on local hospitals that also serve two surrounding states. The Delhi government does not regularly release data on home isolation deaths and did not respond to a request for comment. Currently, more than 23,000 people are recovering at home in Delhi, which has been recording a total of around 100 deaths a day this month and more than 5,000 infections. Shunty feels many home deaths are going unrecorded, because his team alone has been picking up around a dozen bodies a day from just one area of Delhi. After many Delhi hospitals ran out of critical-care beds this month, the federal government flew in army doctors and nurses, and squeezed more beds into hospitals. Delhi government officials say many isolation and critical-care beds are now available. That could encourage more people to demand hospitalisation, unlike Rajen Mehta's father, whose last rituals were done by Shunty's team on Thursday. "He was asked to home quarantine. We kept him separately," said Mehta. "Then he suddenly had a seizure, and within five minutes he died."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/new-delhi-ambulance-group-grapples-with-surging-covid-19-quarantine-deaths-920472.html
27-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi Police allows farmers to hold protest in city||Thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital were allowed in on Thursday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, defusing some of the tension building up since morning around the city’s edges and beyond. The concession came after hours of a standoff that saw police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in some places in their determination to push through as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s new farm laws. "After holding discussion with farmer leaders, the protesting farmers have been permitted inside Delhi to hold peaceful protest at Nirankari Ground in Burari. We appeal to all farmers to maintain peace," said Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal. At the Tikri border, farmers were escorted by police personnel amid tight security around 3 pm and taken towards the Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the city. But those gathered at the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, had not entered the city till evening. As the issue snowballed, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said no government in the world can stop farmers fighting the "battle of truth". In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said the prime minister should remember that whenever arrogance takes on truth, it gets defeated. "The Modi government will have to agree to the demands of the farmers and take back the black laws. This is just the beginning!" he tweeted with the hashtag 'IamWithFarmers'. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the Union government's decision to allow the farmers to enter Delhi to exercise their democratic right to protest. “They should also now initiate immediate talks to address farmers' concerns on the #FarmLaws and resolve the simmering issue," he said on Twitter. Punjab farmer groups said Union Home ministry officials had allowed them a place in Delhi to hold the agitation. "We have been allowed safe passage to Delhi," claimed Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal. Earlier in the day, clashes broke out at multiple places and Delhi’s borders resembled a virtual battle zone with restless crowds of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, milling around and a sea of police personnel keeping them at bay. Drones circled the air and plumes of smoke from teargas shells could be seen from far. Beyond the border points, the tension spilled over on highways where groups of farmers squatted on the road, and stood in trucks and tractors, waiting impatiently to make their way into the national capital. At the Singhu border,multi-layer barricading, including sand laden trucks and water cannons, was put up to block the farmers. Delhi Police used teargas to disperse farmers who had reached Singhu. At Tikri, a few kilometres away, some farmers used a tractor to pull away a truck placed as a barricade to prevent them from entering the city. Water cannons were used against the farmers. Hundreds of farmers from western Uttar Pradesh were also moving towards Delhi from Greater Noida to join the protest. The Bharatiya Kisan Union had given the call to farmers from the region, including Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat, to come together for the’Delhi Chalo’ march. "We have started our onward movement. But our route to Delhi is yet to be decided by our union leaders,” BKU state spokesperson Pawan Khatana told PTI. Delhi Police, which had expressed concern over the pandemic situation in the city, had sought permission from the AAP government to use the city's nine stadiums as temporary jails for farmers arrested or detained but this was denied. Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain said every Indian citizen has the right to protest peacefully. In a letter to the principal home secretary, Jain said the Central government should accept the demands of farmers, adding that putting farmers in jails was not a solution. As the farmers dug in their heels, police made announcements over loudspeakers asking them to retreat.         "We will enter Delhi. We will get these anti-farmer laws repealed. We were welcomed at the national capital by teargas shells lobbed by Delhi police," said a farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab who was among those who managed to reach the Singhu border.  Some farmers who had reached close to the Singhu border said they had taken night halts at various points and broken police barriers in Panipat, Haryana, about 100 km from Delhi. While a group of farmers from Punjab were the first to reach there some farmers from Haryana joined them later.        A farmer who had reached the Haryana-Delhi border point in Sonipat asked why they were stopped.        “Don't we have a democratic right to protest in a peaceful manner? Farmers meet the food needs of the nation, but today the Centre is behaving as if we are terrorists and has put thousands of security personnel to stop our peaceful march,” he said. Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had announced they will go to Delhi through several routes -- Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. As the day progressed, so did the chaos on the roads leading to Delhi and at its border points. Delhi Traffic posted a series of tweets asking people to avoid outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK road, NH-44 and Singhu Border saying traffic was “very, very heavy”. Checking was also intensified at the city's entryways, including at the Delhi-Gurgaon border, leading to massive jams. Authorities in Haryana imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in several parts to prevent assembly of the protesters. For those needing to commute from Delhi to NCR areas or from the suburbs to the city for work or other reasons, it was a tough day. Delhi Metro authorities had earlier announced that services from neighbouring cities will remain suspended on Friday. The farmers are demanding the repeal of the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. They also want a guarantee on minimum support prices.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-police-allows-farmers-to-hold-protest-in-city-920479.html

27-11-2020||North and Central||Mehbooba Mufti under house arrest; not allowed to visit Pulwama||Jammu and Kashmir police on Friday disallowed PDP president and former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti’s presser in Srinagar as she was allegedly put under house arrest after she tried to visit residence of party leader Waheed Para, earlier arrested by the NIA. “Since two days, J&K admin has refused to allow me to visit @parawahid’s family in Pulwama. BJP Ministers & their puppets are allowed to move around in every corner of Kashmir but security is a problem only in my case,” she tweeted. Parra was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday for allegedly seeking help from the Hizbul Mujahideen outfit in seeking their support in the 2019 Parliamentary elections in which Mufti was the PDP candidate. Later in the day a posse of policemen stopped media persons from entering Mufti’s official ‘Fairview’ residence in Gupkar area of the city where she was scheduled to address the media. “Press has been barred from entering my residence in Srinagar. This despite no written orders explaining my arbitrary detention. Kashmir is an open-air prison where no one has the right to express their opinion,” the former CM said in another tweet. However, police while denying the allegation said Mufti was stopped due to “security reasons.” “PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti is not under house arrest. She was requested to postpone her visit to Pulwama purely due to security reasons (sic),” J&K police tweeted. Since last one week, the leaders of People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) have been alleging that they were not being allowed to campaign for district development council (DDC) polls while the BJP candidates were being provided every opportunity to take part in the polls election activities. Reacting to Mufti’s alleged detention, National Conference (NC) vice president and another former CM Omar Abdullah said personal liberty is treated as a favour by the government, giving and withdrawing it at will, with no interference from the judiciary. “Parking a truck in front of our gates is now standard operating procedure for this admin. They did the same to my father recently to stop him from praying. Personal liberty is treated as a favour by the govt, to give & withdraw at will, with no interference from the judiciary,” Omar tweeted. On Wednesday Mufti had alleged that BJP will use grenades and guns to bag seats. The PAGD is an alliance of seven parties - National Conference (NC), PDP, CPI, CPM, Peoples Conference, Peoples Movement and Awami National Conference – and was formed on October 15 to work towards restoring the special status of J&K which was revoked last August. First-ever DDC elections and by-elections to the panchayat and urban local bodies are being held in J&K in eight phases from November 28.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/mehbooba-mufti-under-house-arrest-not-allowed-to-visit-pulwama-920501.html

"There is no need to worry about storage of vaccines. We have a large number of health care facilities, such as mohalla clinics, poly clinics, and hospitals etc, where a Covid-19 vaccine can be administered to people," Jain told reporters. "Once a vaccine is available, we can vaccinate the entire population of Delhi in a few weeks," the minister said. Jain also said Delhi should be given priority during the distribution of the vaccine as it is the national capital. A three-storeyed building on the premises of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital has also been identified for storage of Covid-19 vaccines. On Thursday, Delhi's Immunization Officer Suresh Seth had said the national capital is geared up for the Covid-19 vaccination programme and the city's entire population can be covered in a month. "We have 600 cold storage points and around 1,800 outreach sites for the universal immunization programme for children. We have sufficient equipment for vaccines that can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and those that need minus 15 to minus 25 degrees Celsius. The central government is further strengthening the infrastructure and providing more equipment," Seth had told PTI. He had said the equipment and infrastructure for vaccines that need ultra-cold conditions (minus 70 degrees Celsius) are not there, but "we don't think there will be any problem logistically because the immunization programme will be carried out in a phased manner". "If we involve hospital staff and nurses etc., we can easily vaccinate the entire population in a month," he had said, adding that at present, the Delhi government is collecting data of health care workers who are at top of the priority list of the Delhi government. "If a vaccine is available, we can administer it to all healthcare workers in just three days... We have sufficient equipment and cold storage space, we are geared up. We won't let Delhi falter," Seth stressed. Meanwhile, Jain said the Covid-19 positivity rate in the national capital has decreased by 45 per cent since November 7. "The positivity rate for RT-PCR tests was 30 per cent on November 7. It has come down to 15.84 per cent. The positivity rate for rapid-antigen tests has reduced to 2.61 per cent from 8.39 per cent a few days ago," Jain said. "The overall positivity rate has reduced by 45 per cent. While the number of RT-PCR tests has been increasing fast, the positivity rate has been decreasing rapidly," the minister said. Jain said the number of tests being conducted in Delhi was around three times the national average. The minister also said the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has remained below the 7,000 mark for seven consecutive days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-have-enough-infra-to-vaccinate-delhis-entire-population-in-few-weeks-says-satyendar-jain-920516.html

Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's farm laws fearing that they would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price mechanism, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. They have been demanding the repeal of the new laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmer-on-way-to-delhi-killed-as-truck-hits-his-tractor-trolley-in-bhiwani-920546.html

The farmers, who were part of the 'Delhi Chalo' march against the Centre's new farm laws, were escorted by police personnel amid tight security as they started entering the city from Tikri border around 3 pm. Delhi Police on Friday allowed protestors to hold their protest at north Delhi's Nirankari Ground - one of the biggest grounds in the national capital. However, farmers gathered at the Singhu border have not entered the city so far. Earlier in the day, the Delhi Police used tear gas at the Singhu border to disperse protesting farmers who were trying to head towards the national capital. Farmers also pelted stones at police and broke barricades in an attempt to enter Delhi. Plumes of smoke were seen as security personnel used multiple rounds of tear gas to disperse the protesting farmers at the Singhu border. At the Tikri border, farmers clashed with police and also tried to remove a truck, which was placed as a barricade, by tying it to a tractor with the help of a chain. Traffic was disrupted in many parts of the city due to the protest. Taking to Twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Friday posted a series of tweets, asking people to avoid outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK road, NH-44 and Singhu Border in view of the 'Delhi Chalo' march by farmers from Punjab against the farm laws. "In view of the rally/march/protest by All India Kishan Sangharsh co-ordination committee, the traffic police is diverting traffic from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy in this area," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-enter-delhi-from-tikri-border-after-braving-water-cannons-clashing-with-police-920560.html

He said Chinar Corps Commander Lt Gen B S Raju and all ranks paid homage to the soldiers on behalf of the country at a solemn ceremony at Badamibagh Cantonment. The spokesman said the two soldiers were part of the Quick Reaction Team (QRT) in the general area of Khushipora when unidentified militants fired indiscriminately at them and they both suffered gunshot wounds. “In spite of being grievously injured, they returned fire on the terrorists," he said. "The area was cordoned and search operations were launched.  The injured soldiers were provided immediate medical aid, but unfortunately, they succumbed to injuries,” he added. Sepoy Singh (35) was enrolled into the Army in February 2006. He belonged to Sarh village of JK's Reasi district and is survived by his wife and three children. Sepoy Yash (21) was enrolled into the Army in June 2019. He hailed from Pimpalgaon village of Jalgaon district, Maharastra, and is survived by his parents. “The mortal remains of the bravehearts were taken for last rites to their native places, where they would be laid to rest with full military honours. "In this hour of grief, the Army stands in solidarity with these bereaved families and remains committed to their dignity and well-being. The perpetrators will be identified, tracked and brought to justice,” the spokesman said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-pays-tributes-to-soldiers-killed-in-militant-attack-in-srinagar-920572.html

Mattu joined the JKAP -- led by former finance minister Altaf Bukhair -- at the party's head office in the Lal Chowk area of the city here, a party leader said. The Mayor of the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) was welcomed into the party fold by Bukhari, it said. Mattu on Wednesday returned as Mayor of the SMC less than six months after he was ousted from the office in a no-confidence motion. He defeated Sheikh Imran -- a former deputy mayor who was removed from the office last year through a no-confidence motion. Mattu got 44 votes while Imran got seven. As many as 19 corporators abstained from voting. Mattu, who was last associated with Sajad Gani-led People's Conference, was removed from office as Mayor in June this year in a no-confidence motion. His ascent to the Mayoral post in 2018 was surrounded by controversy as then governor of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir State S P Malik had predicted that he will be the next mayor of the city, weeks before the first vote had been cast. The remarks of the governor had raised question marks about the elections as the names of all contesting candidates were kept secret -- even from their electorate -- in view of security threat perceptions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/srinagar-mayor-junaid-azim-mattu-joins-apni-party-920583.html

Sinha said the establishment of chairs for Gojri and Pahari languages is in the offing to promote and encourage the regional languages of J&K. "Recently, when Parliament of India passed the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill, 2020, on the request of the union territory, the Government of India also agreed to the fact that efforts must be made towards promotion and development of the Punjabi language in J&K and today's occasion is a major step towards this direction," the LG said. He elaborated on the timeless teachings of Guru Nanak Devji which are still guiding the society at large. The Lt Governor emphasised that the establishment of Guru Nanak Chair will help in the development of inner and outer personalities of the students. "The perfect balance between inner and outer world is the most important aspect and a lifetime opportunity for the students. The teachings of the Guru Nanak Devji have always directed the people towards the path of God, who is just like a sea, what seems to be many like the waves," Sinha said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-university-gets-guru-nanak-chair-920598.html

B L Sherwal, the managing director of the hospital, said a team from the Union Health Ministry has surveyed the building and approved it. "The Delhi government had asked us to provide space to store vaccines. We have a three-storeyed building which can be used for this purpose. It has around 8,000 metre square area where vaccines can be stored," Sherwal said. He said, "Some work needs to be done to convert it into a cold storage facility. The doors need to be enlarged to ensure entry of deep freezers. More power points will be needed," Sherwal said. Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that there is sufficient infrastructure and equipment available in the national capital to vaccinate its entire population in a few weeks once a Covid-19 vaccine is available.  "We have a large number of health care facilities, such as mohalla clinics, poly clinics, and hospitals etc, where a Covid-19 vaccine can be administered to people," Jain told reporters. Jain also said Delhi should be given priority during the distribution of the vaccine as it is the national capital. On Thursday, Delhi's Immunization Officer Suresh Seth said the national capital is geared up for the Covid-19 vaccination programme and the city's entire population can be covered in a month. "We have 600 cold storage points and around 1,800 outreach sites for the universal immunization programme for children. We have sufficient equipment for vaccines that can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and those that need minus 15 to minus 25 degrees Celsius. The central government is further strengthening the infrastructure and providing more equipment," Seth had told PTI. He had said the equipment and infrastructure for vaccines that need ultra-cold conditions (minus 70 degrees Celsius) are not there, but "we don't think there will be any problem logistically because the immunization programme will be carried out in a phased manner". "If we involve hospital staff and nurses etc, we can easily vaccinate the entire population in a month," he had said, adding that at present, the Delhi government is collecting data of health care workers who are at top of the priority list of the Delhi government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajiv-gandhi-super-speciality-hospital-identified-as-delhis-first-covid-19-vaccine-storage-facility-920602.html

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey directed Kejriwal, Sisodia and Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav to appear before the court while granting them exemption on November 25 for the day. Yadav was then in the Aam Aadmi Party. The court was hearing an application filed by Yogesh Gaur, the legal heir of the complainant Surender Kumar Sharma, who died recently. In his application, Gaur has sought substitution of the name of complainant. “All the three accused persons are exempted through their counsel for today (November 25) only and they are directed to join the proceedings on the next date of hearing without any failure,” the court said. The judge posted the matter for further hearing on December 3. Sharma, in his complaint, had alleged that in 2013 he was approached by volunteers of AAP who had asked him to contest the Delhi Assembly elections on a party ticket, saying Kejriwal was pleased with his social services. He said he filled up the application form to contest the polls after being told by Sisodia and Yadav that AAP's Political Affairs Committee had decided to give him the ticket. However, it was later denied to him. On October 14, 2013, the complainant claimed that articles in leading newspapers carried "defamatory, unlawful and derogatory words used by the accused persons" which have lowered his reputation in the Bar and the society. Opposing the complaint, the accused had submitted that cancellation or allotment of an election ticket was the prerogative of the party and the complainant had not divulged correct information regarding the cases pending against him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-court-directs-arvind-kejriwal-others-to-appear-in-defamation-case-on-december-3-920611.html

Speaking to reporters in the sidelines of a meeting with leaders of industry here, the MSME minister said a call would be taken on a policy to revive sick units "closed due to genuine reasons". "We are charting out an exit policy having provisions for sick units to pull out of business. This is the need of the hour. We see that land on which abandoned industrial units stand cannot be reused for years in industrial areas. Such sick industries get caught in legal webs," the minister said, explaining the rationale behind the move. He also said industries have been given concession to work round-the-clock unhindered for seven days a week in five districts, including Bhopal and Indore, where night curfew is in force to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/new-policy-for-covid-19-lockdown-hit-msmes-soon-mp-minister-920613.html

The Centre on Friday blamed the Delhi government for rising Covid-19 cases in the national capital and said that despite "repeated exhortations", it did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 tests for a long time. In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party said the comments of the Centre about Delhi government in its affidavit before the Supreme Court are "very unfortunate". "It is extremely unfortunate that the central government has chosen to play dirty politics in this critical hour. "The affidavit seems to have been drafted by a BJP spokesperson rather than by the Union government which is meant to work in collaboration with the states at the time of a pandemic. The affidavit is also factually incorrect."  The AAP claimed that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had promised to provide 750 ICU beds within 72 hours during a meeting held on November 15. "Till date, only 200 beds have been provided. We hope the Centre will provide the rest of the beds soon. The central government has deprived Delhi of all funds, provided to other state governments during this epidemic, on the flimsy premise that Delhi is a UT. Therefore, we hope that the central government will do something concrete for Delhiites rather than play the blame game," it said. In its affidavit, filed before the top court, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), said "while there were regular advertisements on achievements of Delhi government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on Covid-appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures." It said, "That despite repeated exhortations in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, the Delhi government did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RTPCR tests for a long time." A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah took the Centre's affidavit on record and observed that "things are going from bad to worse but no concrete steps are being taken.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/very-unfortunate-says-aap-on-centres-remark-in-sc-blaming-delhi-govt-for-rise-in-covid-19-cases-920629.html

Thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital were allowed in to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground against the central farm laws. Some representatives of the farmers also inspected the Nirankari Samagam Ground in Burari along with police officers. Delhi Jal Board Vice Chairman Raghav Chadha said he had made arrangements for drinking water at the site on the directions of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. "We have deployed 20 tankers each containing 9,000 litres of water," he told PTI. Chadha said he had appointed two nodal officers at Nirankari Samagam to ensure that the farmers were taken care of. "They are our guests, we will be more than happy to host them," he said. Rithala MLA Mohinder Goyal made arrangements for food, while the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board set up shelters for the farmers. Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot issued an order directing district magistrates of North Delhi and Central Delhi to make adequate arrangements for shelter, drinking water, mobile toilets and sanitation services for the farmers in "view of the prevailing winter season and the pandemic”. "We will try and ensure that the farmers do not face any problem in Delhi," he tweeted. Chadha said it had come to his notice that farmers did not want to go to the Burari ground, adding that the Centre should give them a place of their choice to hold peaceful protests. A number of farmers said they want to go either to the Ramlila ground or Jantar Mantar to protest against the farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-makes-arrangements-for-farmers-at-burari-920690.html

27-11-2020||Opinion||Bitcoin and Millennials: How Indian crypto entrepreneurs beat the system||By Andy Mukherjee With the speed cryptocurrency is emerging as the Millennial generation’s alternative asset of choice in India, it’s hard to imagine that just two years ago a couple of blockchain pioneers were briefly in police custody. Sathvik Vishwanath and Harish BV, cofounders of a then five-year-old startup, were arrested in late 2018. No, they hadn’t pulled off a shady initial coin offering. Their “crime” was that they put up a kiosk in a mall in Bangalore where customers could swap Bitcoin, Ether or Ripple for cash or vice versa. That was the whole point of Unocoin, their crypto token exchange. But the police were suspicious of the new-fangled “ATM” A lot has changed since then. Unocoin, which just raised financing from Tesla Inc-backer Tim Draper’s Draper Associates, is flourishing, together with other Indian blockchain ventures. India’s share of person-to-person virtual-currency trading in Asia has surged to 33%, the same as in China, according to Oslo-based Arcane Research’s analysis of volumes on Paxful and LocalBitcoins, the biggest platforms for transactions in the region.  Some of this is no doubt due to the bubbly rise this year in Bitcoin, which recently came within $100 of its all-time high after surpassing $19,000 for the first time since 2017. Even after Thursday’s wobble, prices have still more than doubled this year. But fundamental factors are also at play. Sending money to India in a tokenized form, and thus avoiding hefty bank charges, is becoming an option. Some customers of digital-asset exchanges, probably tech-savvy freelancers, receive tokens at regular intervals as payment for their work and convert them into rupees via their local bank accounts. Families in India are using the same channel to send money to students overseas.  Having the world’s largest diaspora — and more than $100 billion in two-way money flows last year — isn’t the only thing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s disastrous ban on 86% of the country’s currency in November 2016 shook Indians’ faith in fiat money. Add the fear of leaving spare cash in banks when three major deposit-taking institutions have crumbled in the past 15 months. No wonder Arcane expects Indian crypto volumes to overtake China’s.  The domestic asset management industry is also helping adoption of crypto — by its incompetence. Most large-cap fund managers have struggled to beat their benchmarks, especially in recent years. The Nifty 50 index has returned only about 2% annually in dollar terms over the past decade. Yet, as Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gaurav Patankar and Morgan Barna have shown, lack of performance hasn’t kept managers from pocketing high fees.  Disgruntled younger savers are taking note, and dipping their toes in US exchange-traded funds. At 1%, international allocation is still tiny, the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say, but it’s growing rapidly. Ditto for crypto-investing, even though holding a highly volatile digital asset over the long term isn’t for the faint of heart. Only 600 of Unocoin’s 1.2 million customers have started a systematic buying plan to invest (mostly) in Bitcoin. But 99.5% of them are sitting on profit, and must be bragging about it to their friends.  There’s one dampener: regulation. Nobody wants a return to 2018, when the Reserve Bank, the monetary authority, instructed banks not to entertain customers who dealt in virtual currency. The draconian approach nearly strangled India’s blockchain revolution. The action against Unocoin’s kiosk in Bangalore was like the heavy hand of the state crashing down on a kids’ lemonade stand. If folks in India’s technology capital couldn’t pay cash to buy digital tokens, then the asset was effectively being banned nationwide. In hindsight, the founders’ ordeal with the police proved to be a blessing in disguise. Young entrepreneurs joined together, went to the Supreme Court in New Delhi and got the RBI’s direction to banks declared unconstitutional. That was in March. Already, the exchange has seen a fivefold jump in trading, averaging $150,000 a day, from $30,000 before the court’s verdict. Of late, trading is much higher, thanks to the rally in Bitcoin prices. Larger bourses such as CoinDCX were witnessing daily volumes of almost $700,000, when I last checked. The players are urging the government to bring digital assets under the existing money-laundering law, which will give the industry legitimacy. The next step would be to regulate the tokens as money or securities, depending on their use.  India’s phlegmatic bureaucracy may wonder if this is all a craze. Perhaps not. It isn’t even unique to Indian Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Wringing the global banking industry dry of its exorbitant fees, and putting more purchasing power in people's hands after the Covid-19 pandemic, will be a worldwide goal. In their study titled, “What We Must Do to Rebuild,” Deutsche Bank AG economists are advising companies and policymakers to design alternatives to credit cards and “remove middleman fees.” In the short run, conventional fintech will help, but in the longer term, major economies will all do this by replacing cash with their own central bank digital currencies.  That’s when older consumers will join in. If they don’t, they’ll get stuck, and not just figuratively. Automatically triggered crypto “smart contracts“ will make it possible for self-driving cars to switch lanes faster than others. Commuters will be continuously paying one another in official digital currencies — or in stablecoins like Facebook Inc.’s proposed Libra, private tokens whose values are fixed against fiat money. The Indian Millennials have read the tea leaves right.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/bitcoin-and-millennials-how-indian-crypto-entrepreneurs-beat-the-system-920364.html
27-11-2020||Opinion||Deep frozen arctic microbes are waking up||In August 2019, Iceland held a funeral for the Okjökull Glacier, the first Icelandic glacier lost to climate change. The community commemorated the event with a plaque in recognition of this irreversible change and the grave impacts it represents. Globally, glacier melt rates have nearly doubled in the last five years, with an average loss of 832 mmw.e. (millimetres water equivalent) in 2015, increasing to 1,243 mmw.e. in 2020 (WGMS). This high rate of loss decreases glacial stores of freshwater and changes the structure of the surrounding ecosystem. In the last 10 years, warming in the Arctic has outpaced projections so rapidly that scientists are now suggesting that the poles are warming four times faster than the rest of the globe. This has led to glacier melt and permafrost thaw levels that weren’t forecast to happen until 2050 or later. In Siberia and northern Canada, this abrupt thaw has created sunken landforms, known as thermokarst, where the oldest and deepest permafrost is exposed to the warm air for the first time in hundreds or even thousands of years. As the global climate continues to warm, many questions remain about the periglacial environment. Among them: as water infiltration increases, will permafrost thaw more rapidly? And, if so, what long-frozen organisms might “wake up”? Permafrost covers 24 per cent of the Earth’s land surface, and the soil constituents vary with local geology. Arctic lands offer unexplored microbial biodiversity and microbial feedbacks, including the release of carbon to the atmosphere. In some locations, hundreds of millions of years’ worth of carbon is buried. The layers may still contain ancient frozen microbes, Pleistocene megafauna and even buried smallpox victims. As the permafrost thaws with increasing rapidity, scientists’ emerging challenge is to discover and identify the microbes, bacteria and viruses that may be stirring. Some of these microbes are known to scientists. Methanogenic Archaea, for example, metabolize soil carbon to release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Other permafrost microbes (methanotrophs) consume methane. The balance between these microbes plays a critical role in determining future climate warming. Others are known but have unpredictable behaviour after release. New evidence of genes moving between thawing ecosystems indicates a restructuring at multiple levels. In the Arctic Ocean, planktonic Chloroflexi bacteria recently acquired genes used for degrading carbon from land-based Actinobacteria species. As melt-swollen Arctic rivers carried sediments from thawing permafrost to the sea, the genes for processing permafrost carbon were also transported. Permafrost thaw in Siberia led to a 2016 anthrax outbreak and the death of 200,000 reindeer and a child. But the hardy spores of Bacillus anthracis may represent an exception to the brutal freeze-thaw cycle that degrades more delicate bacterial and viral pathogens. Their adaptable characteristics have allowed them to remain frozen and viable over centuries of inactivity. Organisms that co-evolved within now-extinct ecosystems from the Cenozoic to the Pleistocene may also emerge and interact with our modern environment in entirely novel ways. A potential example, the emerging Orthopoxvirus species Alaskapox causing skin lesions, has appeared and disappeared in Alaska twice in the last five years. It is possible that the virus was transmitted through animal-human contact, but this novel virus’s origin remains unknown. The microbiomes of the Arctic contain resilient and tenacious cold-adapted microbes. Some species survive as psychrophiles, a type of specialist species highly adapted to prolonged exposure to subfreezing conditions. These species may be lost with warming. Others survive by being highly adaptable, inhabiting many, varied niches. Understanding more about these generalists’ ecology and genomic diversity offers a window into the microbiome of the New Arctic. These generalist microbes that adapt to diverse conditions are the likely winners, as we lose the cryosphere. And then there are microbes that are entirely unfamiliar to scientists, which may represent a novel threat. It is clear that the warmer we make the Arctic, the weirder it will get, as temperatures at the surface become more extreme and thawing deepens. With the coalescence of microbes reawakening from the deep and surface conditions unprecedented in human history, it is challenging to assess risks accurately without improved Arctic microbial datasets. We should pay attention to both known unknowns, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and unknown unknowns, including the potential risks from the resurrection of ancient and poorly described viral genomes from Arctic ice by synthetic biologists. For all of these reasons, we must come up with guidelines for future Arctic research. As travel through the region increases, the likelihood of pathogen export and import rises as well. The planetary protection guidelines that space agencies follow to prevent interplanetary contamination can provide a framework for how microbial investigation can safely continue. Biosurveillance measures must be put into place to protect communities in the Arctic and beyond. As the Arctic continues to transform, one thing is clear: as climate change warms this microbial repository during the 21st century, the full range of consequences is yet to be told.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/deep-frozen-arctic-microbes-are-waking-up-920566.html
27-11-2020||Opinion||Belief in Trump fiction can be worn down by fact||President Donald Trump keeps claiming that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and was replete with fraud. He has spread the false assertion that voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems Inc. deleted millions of pro-Trump votes and shifted hundreds of thousands to his victorious opponent, President-elect Joe Biden. Many Republicans agree that the presidency has been stolen. Polls show that about half of them think that Trump “rightfully won” the election, and a whopping 68 percent have concerns about a “rigged” process for counting votes. Various media outlets associated with the political right have fueled these beliefs. Social media are playing a major role. Wild ideas are circulating on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere. In a recent interview, former President Barack Obama identified the contemporary media environment as “the single biggest threat to our democracy.” He added: “If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn’t work. And by definition our democracy doesn’t work. We are entering into an epistemological crisis.” Obama’s claim calls to mind a brilliant 2002 essay, “The Crippled Epistemology of Extremism,” by the late political scientist Russell Hardin, who taught at the University of Chicago and New York University. Hardin was writing amidst a radically different media environment, but his basic claims are enduring. His starting point is that on many topics, including politics, most people lack personal or direct knowledge. With respect to immigration, climate change, macroeconomic policy or a pandemic, citizens can’t easily acquire the necessary information on their own. Instead, Hardin wrote, “We typically rely on authority for most of the information that we actually have.” How do you know that dinosaurs once roamed the earth? That George Washington was the first president? That the earth is round and orbits the sun? Here Hardin quoted the early 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: “My life consists in my being content to accept many things.” So far, so good. People are busy and life is short. The problem comes when accepted authorities turn out to be liars or charlatans. When we do have outlandish or false beliefs, we often protect them, whether intentionally or not, “by keeping ourselves in the company only of others who share our beliefs,” as Hardin put it, adding that extreme or fanatical views “may primarily be simple matters of the skewed epistemology that comes from lack of contact with and, hence, lack of accurate knowledge or relevant others.” Hardin concluded with a remark, said to come from Winston Churchill, that fanatics are people who cannot change their minds and will not change the subject. Hardin didn’t completely agree. True, he wrote, fanatics won’t change their minds, but it’s not quite right to say that they will not change the subject. “Rather, they cannot change it, because they have no other subject,” Hardin wrote. “That is the nature of their crippled epistemology.” Turn now to contemporary American politics. Those who believe that Trump won the election are listening to apparent authorities they trust (including Trump), and they are speaking and listening mostly to one another. That’s how they know. Maybe that’s only a short-term problem, but how are the next few years going to play out? Some observers are arguing that Biden can and should work cooperatively with Republicans, seeking to find shared goals on such issues as prescription drug pricing, immigration, an expanded child tax credit and green energy. In the abstract, that’s an attractive argument. But if Republican leaders actually believe that Biden stole the election, they might not want to work with him, even on shared goals. And even if they don’t believe those things, a lot of their constituents do — which makes cooperative solutions a lot less likely. Still, there are some bright spots. On a number of important issues involving safety and the environment, the Trump administration quietly refused to overrule the decisions of the Obama administration. A central reason was agreement on the facts, at least within the U.S. government. Call them the “deep state” or not, civil servants with technical expertise really do “have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false,” despite Obama’s fears about citizens in general. There is more good news. Recent research finds that on numerous factual questions, both Republicans and Democrats shift their beliefs when they hear from credible sources, which include the Treasury Department, the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Homeland Security and the Census Bureau. Many people who spend a lot of time in echo chambers or informational cocoons are nonetheless willing to learn from outsiders. Hardin captured much of the essence of extremism, and Obama was not wrong to say that the U.S. faces an “epistemological crisis.” The coming years are going to be tough. Still, to paraphrase Mark Twain: Reports of democracy’s death have been greatly exaggerated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/belief-in-trump-fiction-can-be-worn-down-by-fact-920710.html

The low pressure is likely to intensify into a depression by November 30, even as the state is yet to firm up the damages caused by Cyclone Nivar.  Cyclone Nivar made landfall between Marakanam and Puducherry in the wee hours of November 26, killing three people and uprooting over 1,000 trees. Under the influence of the cyclone, heavy to very heavy rains pummelled Chennai and its neighbouring districts of Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, and Vellore for the past few days.   In an update on Friday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said a low-pressure area is very likely to form over the south-east Bay of Bengal during the next 48 hours.  “It is very likely to concentrate into depression during the subsequent 24 hours (around Nov 30). It is likely to intensify further and move towards Tamil Nadu coast. Under its influence, enhanced rainfall activity is likely to occur over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry during December 1 to 3,” the update said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/low-pressure-in-bay-of-bengal-may-bring-more-showers-to-tamil-nadu-920440.html
27-11-2020||South||For residents of Cuddalore, 'cyclone' spells fear, insecurity||For residents of this coastal town in Tamil Nadu, the word cyclone spells fear and insecurity. The trail of destruction that Cyclone Thane left in 2011 is still fresh in the minds of the people and those memories come back to haunt them whenever a cyclone forms in the Bay of Bengal. When the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) announced that Cyclone Nivar will cross the coast between Mamallapuram and Karaikal, an enclave in the Union Territory of Puducherry, people of Cuddalore were worried and feared about the impact that the cyclone could cause. “We are happy that there are no major damages and we are alive. We were all worried because the intensity with which Cyclone Gaja made landfall in Tamil Nadu in 2018, wiping out coconut farms across the Cauvery Delta. Since MeT said the winds will pack speeds of up to 145 kmph, we were obviously scared,” Moorthy, who lives in Thazhanguda locality in Cuddalore, told DH. Arun, his neighbour, interjects to ask how long will people in Cuddalore, especially those living close to the ocean, live in fear. The coastal town was affected in 2015 as well when unprecedented rains lashed Tamil Nadu bringing Chennai underwater, and Thazhanguda was one of the localities to have been affected by tsunami in 2004. “We don't sleep for days together once a cyclone forms in the Bay of Bengal and makes landfall. We were really scared during the landfall of Cyclone Nivar due to gusty winds. But as luck would have it, there are not much damages. We were all inside a relief camp but came back home once it was clear that no much trees had fallen,” Arun said. Water entered many houses and water stood at knee-length on Thursday evening in the locality which is very close to the ocean. Those living in the heart of the town too say a cyclone forming in Bay of Bengal is bad news for them. “First came Cyclone Thane in 2011, and we were affected by Cyclone Nilam, and the worst floods in 2015. We did suffer during Cyclone Gaja and now due to Cyclone Nivar though the damages are less,” Manickam, who runs a tea shop, said. Since Cuddalore is vulnerable to cyclones, the district administration gets into evacuating thousands of people living close the sea and lodging them in camps.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/for-residents-of-cuddalore-cyclone-spells-fear-insecurity-920496.html

The widespread rains caused by the cyclonic system have wreaked havoc in Nellore, Chittoor, Kadapa and Kurnool districts. At least two people have died in the rain related incidents. Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy would make an aerial survey of the affected areas on Saturday. The heavy rains resulted in 188 per cent excess rainfall. Over 10,000 people are taking shelter in 147 relief camps, CMO officials said. Agriculture minister K Kannababu informed that people in the relief camps would be handed Rs 500 each while returning home. Water bodies in these districts are filled to the brim and police, irrigation, and revenue departments are kept on high alert till Saturday. Gushing rivers, streams have cut off hundreds of villages from the outside world. Several colonies were inundated in Ongole, Kadapa etc towns. Besides power line disruptions due to electricity pole damages, about 180 km of roads were damaged. At-least 673 houses were damaged, as per the initial reports. Preliminary estimates, as per the CMO, showed crop loss in about 30,000 hectares of Chittoor, Nellore, YSR Kadapa and Prakasam districts. Paddy (16,290 hectares) followed by black-gram (7,362), cotton (3,571) and other crops (2,529 hectares) were damaged due the rains triggered by Nivar cyclone, officials said. However, later in the evening, Kurnool collector G Veerapandian, said that agriculture crops were estimated as damaged in 15,788 hectares in the district alone. The AP cabinet which met on Friday under the chairmanship of Reddy decided that the enumeration of crop loss should be completed by December 15 “so that compensation could be paid by December 31.” There would be an 80 per cent subsidy on seeds to farmers in the affected areas. Compensation with regard to loss of human life and damage to property would be paid as per the guidelines.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-nivar-rains-wreak-havoc-in-andhra-pradesh-at-least-two-dead-920669.html

They were on their way to stage a protest before Suvarna Vidhan Soudha opposing the formation of Maratha Development Corporation. Vatal Nagaraj has called for a state-wide bandh on December 5, demanding that Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa withdraw the decision of the formation of Maratha Development Corporation. He had announced that he would stage a protest before Suvarna Vidhan Soudha and block the movement of traffic on the national highway. Vatal Nagaraj’s efforts to give the police the slip by attempting to travel in an alternative vehicle did not yield results and he was detained near the toll plaza on the national highway. Earlier, Vatal Nagaraj told reporters that the government has been allowing leaders from Maharashtra to come to Belagavi and speak whatever they want but Kannada leaders are being prevented.  None of the activists of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti were externed for observing Kannada Rajyotsava as a black day on November 1, he said. Nagaraj also alleged that all politicians from Belagavi district were Marathi and  agents of the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti. BJP has been trying to woo Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu for its political interests, he said. He further alleged that Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa would one day sell Suvarna Vidhan Soudha too to the rich from Maharashtra and attempt to make an impression that it was in the interests of the state.

27-11-2020||State||Karnataka High Court bins plea challenging appointment to boards, corporations||The High Court has declined to entertain a PIL challenging the appointment of chairpersons to boards and corporations. The petitioner contended that the chairpersons are getting salary and allowances on par with ministers. This increases the actual strength of the ministers beyond the stipulated number as prescribed under the Constitution, the petition contended. The petition was filed by city-based advocate K B Vijay Kumar. The petitioner, appearing party-in-person, contented that the number of ministers cannot exceed 15% of the total strength of the legislative Assembly. At present, Karnataka Legislative Assembly has 225 members, including one nominated member. According to the petitioner, if the chairpersons to the boards and corporations are added to the 28 cabinet ministers, who have taken the oath from the Governor, the actual number of ‘ministers’ would go beyond the ceiling imposed under the constitution. The petitioner said this was in violation of Article 164 of the constitution. The petitioner further added that the facilities, including salary and allowances, to the ministers are extended to the chairpersons of boards and corporations. Hence, they have to be treated as ministers for all practical purposes. The petitioner had relied upon a judgment of Karnataka High Court in January 2020 by which Karnataka Parliamentary Secretaries’ appointments were struck down. The petitioner submitted that the positions of the appointment of chairpersons to boards and corporations are no different from the position of parliamentary secretaries. The court, however, said merely equating the chairpersons on the salary and allowances do not elevate their positions as ministers. “Merely because the salary and other perquisites which are applicable to ministers are being provided, these chairpersons cannot become ministers,” a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S Vishwajith Shetty said. The bench however clarified that it has not gone into the decision of the state government to provide salaries and allowances admissible to the posts of chairpersons of boards and corporations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-high-court-bins-plea-challenging-appointment-to-boards-corporations-920687.html

27-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Most deaths due to Covid-19 occur in 50-72 age group, analysis shows||More people in their fifties and sixties have died from Covid-19 than much older individuals who caught the virus, according to a DH analysis of 9,534 senior citizen deaths in Karnataka, with co-morbidities and late diagnosis emerging as the two major factors behind the deaths. The analysis considered all Covid-19 fatalities in the state of people aged 50 and above. The worst-hit age group turns out to be between 50-72 (65, 60, 70, 55, 75, 50, 58, 68, 62 and 72), with people aged 65 having suffered the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities (793) in the state.  Next are people aged 60 (670 deaths), people aged 70 (667) and people aged 55 (484 deaths). The data shows a clear link between fatality rate and the presence of co-morbidities, with a significant chunk of people in the above ages having had three or more co-morbidities. On top of these serious conditions, many of the deceased had somehow slipped through surveillance measures or had failed to get themselves tested early. Dr Thrilok Chandra, head of the Critical Care Support Unit (CCSU) which has handled over 2 lakh critical Covid-19 cases, said the primary cause of death is almost always late diagnosis.  “We have seen multi-organ dysfunction in all cases which arrived late for treatment - the kidney is compromised, the lung is compromised or the heart is. The circulatory system is involved and Covid-19 can cause hypercoagulation which is a force multiplier,” he said. The highest number of people who died on the same day of diagnosis in Karnataka were 166 people who were aged 65. The next highest number were 154 who were aged 60. The third highest group was 141 people who were aged 70. Tellingly, 39.2% of these people also had three or more co-morbidities. No other age group comes close to these high numbers of late diagnosis. However, the relatively lower death rates of the very elderly is surprising. In contrast to 22.85% of people in their 50s who died after catching Covid-19, only 8.79% of people in their 80s died. Among the 60 people aged over 100 who contracted the disease, only three people (or 5%) died.  To be fair, mortality rates among people in their 60s and 70s are lower (at 3.82% and 6.28% respectively) because larger numbers of people in this group (1.27 lakhs) were infected than older senior citizens, 80 and above, (12,360). Dr Anoop Amarnath,  Covid Task Force member, said an early guideline, calling on senior citizens aged 65 years not to leave their homes likely saved many lives.  “At the same time, the condition of immunosenescence, the gradual weakening of immune system with age, could have saved the lives of some of the most aged of senior citizens.”  He said cytokine storms of the body’s immune system were responsible for some deaths.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/most-deaths-due-to-covid-19-occur-in-50-72-age-group-analysis-shows-920343.html

Forest Minister Anand Singh, the minister in charge of Ballari, is said to be the force behind getting the new district created. Singh had resigned from the Congress last year when the Congress-JD(S) coalition was in power, citing that his demand for a new district fell on deaf ears. He got disqualified and went on to join the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cabinet-formally-clears-creation-of-vijayanagar-district-920510.html
27-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Cabinet sub-committee to examine sale of land to JSW Steel||The Karnataka cabinet on Friday decided to constitute a cabinet sub-committee to examine the proposal on the sale of 2,000.58 acres land to JSW Steel in Ballari district and make a suitable recommendation. "It was decided in 2005 to give 2,000.58 acres of government land at a Kurekuppa village near Toranagallu in Sandur taluk of Ballari to JSW. To examine it, a cabinet sub-committee will be constituted," Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy said. Speaking to reporters here after a cabinet meeting, he said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has been authorised to constitute the sub-committee. The previous Congress-JD(S) coalition government too had constituted a four-member cabinet sub-committee headed by the then Home Minister M B Patil to examine the proposal, as its decision to convert the lease of about 3,667 acres to JSW Steel at Ballari into the sale, in accordance with the initial agreement, had created a row. Accusing the Congress-JD(S) coalition government of selling the land to the company at a throwaway price (Rs 1.22 -1.50 lakh per acre), the BJP, then in opposition, had held a two-day round-the-clock sit-in. Yediyurappa, who was then a state BJP president, had even accused the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition of getting "kickbacks" for the sale of land. In 2005, when Dharam Singh was the chief minister, the Cabinet had decided to give on lease-cum-sale arrangement 2,000.58 acres to JSW. An order on this was issued by the JD(S)-BJP coalition government that came to power thereafter when Kumaraswamy was chief minister and B S Yeddyurappa was industries minister. In 2007, another 1,666 acres were allotted. In another decision, after giving in-principle approval to create Vijayanagara as the state's 31st district, carving it out from the mine-rich Ballari, the cabinet today said it has identified taluks for the new district and will be issuing a notification. Hosapet, Kudligi, Hagaribommanahalli, Kotturu, Huvina Hadagali and Harapanahalli will form part of the proposed Vijayanagara district, Madhuswamy said. Six out of eleven taluks will be part of the new Vijayanagara district with Hospet as its headquarters, while remaining taluks will be in Ballari district, he added. The cabinet has also approved a revised estimate of Rs 384 crore, enhancing it from the earlier Rs 220 crore for the development of Shivamogga airport. Other decisions include appointing three more members- Bengaluru Police Commissioner, Divisional Railway Manager, and Managing Director Rail Infrastructure Development Company(Karnataka) Limited 'KRIDE'- to the committee overseeing the implementation of Bangalore Metro Rail Project. The committee already consists of Chief Secretary, Additional Chief Secretaries Urban Development, Finance, Revenue Department, among others. It has also approved the setting up of the centre of excellence for efficiency augmentation by Karnataka government along with Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), which may cost about Rs 26.77 crore, he said. "It's a five-year project, we are now releasing Rs 17.6 crore," the minister said. The centre is aimed at drawing advantage from emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data and internet of things. The idea is to increase industrial production, increase efficiency in government services, supporting startups and innovation, among others. The minister said "under the labour department, till now remaining leave upto 30 days could have been carried forward to next year by workers, today we have made provision to carry forward up to 45 days."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cabinet-sub-committee-to-examine-sale-of-land-to-jsw-steel-920601.html

Some of the ministers, MLAs and other leaders, who came to the national capital to attend office inauguration event of newly-appointed National General Secretary C T Ravi on Friday, met National General Secretary B L Santosh and newly-appointed Karnataka incharge General Secretary Arun Singh and expressed their grouse against the CM, sources in BJP told DH. During the meeting, the state leaders complained against working style of the Chief Minister. They also suggested the party top brass to advise the CM take all the leaders into confidence before taking any decision. Even some of the leaders also suggested that this is high time to change the CM considering his age. They also suggested that the party leaders in Delhi should vet the CM's decision on making appointments to key posts. Some leaders also complained against the family members of the CM and alleged that their frequent 'interference' harms administration, sources said. Despite the face that the state is facing so many issues like Covid-19 pandemic, flood and economic crisis, MLAs are finding difficult to meet the CM, said a leader condition on anonymity. Interestingly, assuming charge of a General Secretary or his office opening in any party is always a non-event in Delhi, while for Ravi's office opening, a large number of leaders came from Karnataka. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Industries Minister Jagadeesh Shettar, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Revenue Minister R Ashok and Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary attended the event held at& BJP Headquarters.

In 2008, Nangre Patil was Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone-I in South Mumbai where the terrorist attack unfolded on November 26. Talking about the attack on a web show on its 12th anniversary, he said that after receiving intelligence inputs about Taj Mahal hotel being a possible target, he had visited the hotel and carried out a security audit of the building. On September 30, 2008, he had had a meeting with hotel management, he recalled. A day prior to the attack, on November 25, he had evicted hawkers on Colaba Causeway outside the hotel, Nangre Patil said. During the attack, 11 people were killed inside the hotel, but not a single person died outside because people could escape from all four sides, he said. While praising the valour of Mumbai police who took on the terrorists, Nangre Patil said the city cops were trained to handle law and order situations, the underworld and other sorts of criminals, but a 26/11-like terror attack was never anticipated. On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/26/11-police-had-general-inputs-about-possible-targets-says-vishwas-nangre-patil-920306.html

Admitting that the central agencies are being misused, he said that he is keeping a close watch on the developments. “I am quiet, patient…but that does not mean that I am ineffective…and you start attacking my family,” said Thackeray, who heads the Sena-NCP-Congress alliance government that was formed after he broke ties with the BJP, its saffron ally of close to three decades. Asked whether the MVA government would respond, he said: “Why government, Maharashtra will respond….the thought of revenge does not exist in Maharashtra”. Thackeray said that in past Maharashtra had faced several problems, several crises. “Invaders came, what happened?....this is a land of tigers…we don’t want to get into revenge mode…if you have ‘pratishod-chakra’ we have ‘sudarshan-chakra’….don't compel us to hit back,” he said in what appears to be a stern message to the opposition BJP, that has been targeting the MVA government on a daily basis. When pointed out that West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC founder Mamata Banerjee too is putting up a fight, he said: “Maharashtra and Bengal has a history of revolutionaries…in Maharashtra, we draw inspiration from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He has taught us how to deal with situations…you do politics like politics.” The 60-year-old Thackeray said he is not going to be cowed down by threats of CBI and ED. “We also have names…we also have maal-masala…but do we pursue revenge? If you want to take revenge, take it, you will take one, we will respond with 10,” he made it clear. Asked about the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, the CBI probe, and Bihar elections, he said: “I pity them….it is unfortunate that a youth has died and you do politics over it. This is bad politics.” Thackeray refused to comment on a question related to Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut, who had targeted him, his family and the government. “I don’t want to speak on it, I don’t have time to speak on it,” he said, adding what has happened was an insult to Mumbaikars. This was an apparent reference to her comments equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. On the Anvay Naik suicide case in which anchor-editor Arnab Goswami was arrested, Thackeray did not take any name but said that a Marathi businessman had died and the case investigation would go on. “Those who speak on it, you target them with ED,” he said referring to the ED probe against his close aide and Shiv Sena leader Pratap Sarnaik. Raut also pointed out that the charges of BJP and state governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari appear to be the same, particularly on the issue of reopening of temples. “What do you mean…we have left Hindutva…is this a ‘dhoti’…Hindutva has to be in the blood….we follow Hindutva what has been taught by my father (Balasaheb Thackeray) and grandfather (Prabodhankar Thackeray)….don’t get into teaching Hindutva…In this country, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj unfurled saffron and laid foundation of (Hindavi) swaraj….this land does not follow Hindutva of ‘dalals’,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/dont-compel-us-to-hit-back-uddhav-thackeray-warns-bjp-over-misuse-of-central-agencies-920386.html
27-11-2020||West||Lifecycle study of criminal cases in Mumbai shows massive delays: Praja Foundation||A year-on-year comprehensive lifecycle study of cases in the financial capital of Mumbai has reflected inordinate delays bringing to light the shortage of police personnel, prosecutors and judges.The lifecycle study conducted for Sessions court cases from 2013 to 2017, shows that it took, on an average, 11.1 months from the FIR to charge sheet, while the same should be done within 90 days. Further, it took, on an average, 2.4 years from first hearing to judgement.The study was conducted by the Praja Foundation, which for the last two decades have been working for accountable governance.“In 2019-20 for example, there was an 18% shortage of police personnel in Mumbai compared to sanctioned posts. This, in turn, has an impact on the existing workforce, including extended work hours and working conditions that affect the overall health of police, reducing their ability to perform their duties effectively”, said Nitai Mehta, founder and managing trustee, Praja Foundation.“Vacancy in sanctioned posts also has a direct impact on performance in case of the judiciary, where there was a 28% shortage in public prosecutors and 14% shortage of Sessions court judges. In 2019, 2,49,922 cases were to be tried in courts for IPC in Mumbai in 2019 out of which judgement was given in just 6% of the cases,” added Mehta.One of the ways adopted to reduce high pendency of cases was passing of special laws with clear provisions for timely completion of cases through special courts -- however, these too have not been successful. One such example is the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 which, recognising the need for controlling and providing speedy justice in the case of sexual crimes against children, provided for these cases to be completed within one year from the date of cognisance while being tried in a special POCSO court.“However in 2019, while 1,319 cases of POCSO were registered, just 448 cases were tried in courts, of which only half (222) were tried in the special POCSO court. Moreover, only 20% of these judgements in POCSO courts were pronounced within one year (as required by the Act),”  said Mehta.To improve the policing and the judicial system it is first important to fill vacant posts and look at reforms that reduce the burden on the existing personnel and ensure better working conditions for them so that they can perform their duties effectively. This will in turn also lead to improved quality of investigation and timely justice.A second bigger, and more challenging aspect, is to sensitise and train the people operating within the system. What any victim first needs, is an unbiased, co-operative and sensitive police and judiciary.Third, like any other system or governance structure, monitoring is key to ensuring accountability in the system. In line with this, implementation of reforms such as the Police Complaints Authority at the divisional level to take complaints against the police (rank of a senior police inspector and below) needs to be done and the body needs to be given considerable and independent authority to make decisions.“We need people to be partners in policing through a police-public relationship of trust and collaboration, to not just effectively report and investigate crimes or maintain law and order, but to address and tackle the inherent and underlying causes of crime,” added Mehta.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/lifecycle-study-of-criminal-cases-in-mumbai-shows-massive-delays-praja-foundation-920390.html
27-11-2020||West||Goa's tourism industry struggles despite rising footfall||Even as the number of tourists visiting Goa is witnessing a steady rise of late, especially since Diwali, the tourism industry of the state that has been hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak, has failed to benefit much out of it owing to several factors, its stakeholders say. Due to the pandemic, most tourists visiting Goa from the neighbouring states prefer to spend only a day and return home by evening instead of staying at hotels, they said. Besides, the tourists prefer to carry home-cooked food instead of eating out in restaurants as the coronavirus fear still looms large, they said. Several beaches in the state, including Calangute, Candolim, Baga in North Goa district and Colva and Palolem in South Goa are popular among tourists. They have been witnessing a huge influx of tourists since Diwali vacations. However, the industry stakeholders say that the rise in footfalls has not benefited the sector so far, even as the months of November and December are normally considered the peak season of Goa's tourism. "The tourists visiting Goa come in their own vehicles and carry home-cooked food to avoid eating out. They buy liquor from wholesale wine stores. Due to these factors, the beach shacks are still wearing a deserted look," president of Traditional Shack Owners' Association, Manuel Cardoso, said. Shacks are temporary structures, which serve as restaurants and bars with sunbeds on the sand. They are removed during monsoon, only to be set up again during the tourist season. He said that many members affiliated to his association are yet to set up shacks as they are waiting to gauge the response of tourists. "Majority of the tables at the shacks that are operating now are empty. Hardly a few people are found entering the shacks for meal or drink," he said. Cardoso said that the rush of tourists is being witnessed only at the prime beaches. "But if you walk a little away from the main areas, other beach belts are mostly deserted," he said. Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Nilesh Shah said, "Hotels are reporting low occupancy despite November being a peak tourist season for Goa's tourism industry, which is considered the backbone of its economy." Shack owner Julio Fernandes from Calangute claimed that most of the tourists arriving here from the neighbouring states, who return home by evening. "The tourists don't stay back. They don't stay in hotel, which is why the hotel occupancy is poor even now," he said. TTAG feels that the guidelines issued by the government in neighbouring Maharashtra, making it mandatory for the people from Goa to carry Covid-19 negative certificates while entering that state, will further impact Goa's tourism prospects. Shah said that such guidelines would hit Goa in a big way even as the state expects a revival of tourism industry next month. The Maharashtra government on Monday made it mandatory for those seeking to enter the state from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa to carry RT-PCR negative reports, in a bid to stem any further spike in Covid-19 cases following a post-Diwali surge. However, Goa's Tourism Director Menino D'Souza said there will be no direct impact of Maharashtra's guidelines. "But it may leave some indirect impact on Goa's tourism business," he said. He said that the tourism industry, hit hard by Covid- 19, is slowly getting back on track.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goas-tourism-industry-struggles-despite-rising-footfall-920391.html

The Shiv Sena-controlled BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has demolished part of the bungalow in the Pali Hill area of Bandra on 9 September – that resulted in a major political issue in the state. The same day, she moved Bombay High Court that had asked the ongoing demolition to be stayed. In the order on Friday, the division bench comprising Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice R I Chagla said that the notice of demolition needs to be set aside. “The impugned notice (issued by Ward Officer Bhagyawant Late) dated 7 September alongwith the speaking order of demolition dated 9 September are quashed and set aside,” the bench said granting a major relief to Ranaut.  The bench said that Ranaut can take steps to regularize her property and make it habitable and appointed a valuer to decide on the compensation amount the BMC would pay to her for the action. “As regards the area which is not demolished by the BMC, if the BMC proposes to take any action, it may issue a notice giving 7 days time to the petitioner to respond to /comply with the same. In the meantime, the petitioner shall also be at liberty to make an application seeking regularization of the works already carried out but not demolished under section 53 (3) of the MRTP Act, 1966,” the order stated. “However, to the extent any demolished portion requires a planning permission and such permission is not in place, construction of such portion can only be made either in compliance with the sanctioned plan or after seeking approval of the BMC for the work proposed. In the event any application is made, the BMC shall decide the same within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of such application /plan,” it said. Justice Kathawala and Justice Chagla also appointed a survey to assess the extent of damage. “M/s Shetgiri and Associates are appointed as the surveyors / valuers to value and determine the extent and value of damage and loss caused to the petitioner and submit their report to this court on 9 March, 2021 to enable the court to award compensation to the petitioner. The surveyors / valuers shall hear both parties - the petitioner and the BMV before making their report. The charges of the surveyors / valuers shall initially be borne by the petitioner,” the court stated. Victory of democracy: Kangana Reacting to the verdict, actor Kangana Ranaut said that it was a victory for democracy. “When individual stands against the government and wins, it’s not the victory of the individual but it’s the victory of democracy. Thank you everyone who gave me courage and thanks to those who laughed at my broken dreams. It’s only because you play a villain so I can be a hero,” she said.   "When individual stands against the government and wins, it’s not the victory of the individual but it’s the victory of the democracy. Thank you everyone who gave me courage and thanks to those who laughed at my broken dreams. Its only cause you play a villain so I can be a hero," she said. BMC to study order Amid the BJP welcoming the Bombay High Court, Mumbai Mayor and Shiv Sena leader Kishori Pednekar said that the legal department would meet to study the order. “What we did was as per law, as per municipal rules…we will go through the order,” she said. Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya welcomed the development. “It’s a welcome order,” he said, demanding the resignation of Pednekar and removal of Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/relief-for-kangana-ranaut-as-hc-quashes-bmc-demolition-order-920398.html
27-11-2020||West||A year on, Uddhav Thackeray firmly in the saddle||As Maharashtra's Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministry turns a year-old on Saturday, political observers say Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is firmly in the saddle despite continued attempts by the BJP to unseat him. That the MVA government, comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress completed a year in office despite frequent murmurs of lack of coordination among the ruling alliance partners is being attributed to the rapport between Thackeray (60) and NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar. An avid photographer, the otherwise affable and mild-mannered Thackeray displayed combative traits of his father while dealing with the BJP over the issue of rotational chief ministership after the Assembly poll results were announced in October 2019. In poll rallies, Uddhav repeatedly voiced his resolve to fulfil Bal Thackeray's dream of making a Shiv Sainik the chief minister and ended up donning the mantle himself. He was sworn in as the chief minister on November 28 last year after a month-long political drama, which included a brief spell of President'srule and an 80-hour-long Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government. The coronavirus pandemic and natural disasters like the Nisarga cyclone which hit coastal Konkan, floods in east Vidarbha, parts of Marathwada and western Maharashtra kept the 'Thackeray Sarkar' on its toes since March. Apart from criticism that the chief minister operates from home, there has been no other charge against Thackeray. Attempts to implicate him and son Aaditya, who is a minister in the state government, in the Sushant Singh Rajput case proved futile, the observers say. A Rs 38,000 crore loan waiver for 40 lakh farmers and scrapping of the Aarey metro car shed and shifting it to Kanjurmarg are some of the major decisions of the MVA regime. The Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi corridor, a pet project of Thackeray's predecessor Devendra Fadnavis, was named after Bal Thackeray, while a probe was ordered in the Jalyukt Shivar water conservation scheme, another pet project of the BJP leader after the CAG slammed the way it was implemented. A senior cabinet minister said Uddhav Thackeray believes in taking everyone along and doesn't impose himself. "He believes in collective decision-making," the minister said. The year saw Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari coming under fire from the ruling alliance leaders who accused him of pandering to the interests of the opposition BJP. Koshyari's letter on delay in reopening places of religious worship and his questioning the chief minister over Hindutva prompted a swift retort by Thackeray and prominent MVA leaders, including Pawar. The Thackeray-led government has managed to sail steady despite rough weather, said an observer. The lynching of two sadhus in Palghar, Sushant Singh Rajput death case dominated the political headlines. Fadnavis and other BJP leaders targeted Thackeray and Aaditya and there were attempts to drag Aadityas name in the Sushant case. Thackeray also came in for flak from BJP over the arrest of TV journalist Arnab Goswami in a suicide abetment case and also for the Shiv Sena-led BMC's partial demolition of actress Kangana Ranaut's property in suburban Bandra. In October, Maharashtra government withdrew the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation, curtailing its powers in the state. Following the decision, the CBI will have to approach the state government on case-to-case basis seeking permission to conduct probe. Maharashtra is the third state after West Bengal and Rajasthan to take such an action. The move came a day after the CBI registered an FIR in the TRP scam case. The Mumbai police had registered the case earlier but the CBI took over the probe based on an FIR filed in Uttar Pradesh. The Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra are nearing the 18- lakh mark and have claimed around 47000 lives. Amid the pandemic, there was speculation over the stability of the MVA government, with some in the opposition BJP dubbing it a tottering three-wheeler. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut says there is no threat to the MVA government and it would collapse only if either of the three parties pull out. Despite this overt show of unity, there is frustration in Congress over being relegated to a minor partner in the MVA alliance. The party has been complaining about its ministers not getting funds to implement policies in departments headed by them. Political observers feel the recent ED action against Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, who was at the forefront in seeking action against Arnab Goswami in the 2018 abetment to suicide case, is an indication that the Thackeray-led regime will continue to face such 'speed bumps' in its quest for a smooth ride.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/a-year-on-uddhav-thackeray-firmly-in-the-saddle-920419.html

It said PVS Sarma, director of Sanket Media Pvt Ltd, was arrested on Thursday under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the case "related to cheating and forgery". A court in Ahmedabad sent him to ED custody till December 2, it said. The agency said it booked Sarma, his media company and others after studying a Gujarat Police FIR that was filed against him by the Income-tax department. Sanket Media Pvt Ltd, it said, prints and publishes 'Satyam Times' newspaper in Gujarati and English.   Probe found, the ED said in a statement, that "though the circulation of the newspapers was shown at 23,500 and 6,000-6,300 copies daily for the Gujarati and English editions respectively, actual circulation was only around 300-600 and 0-290." "Inflated figures of circulation were shown to attract more advertising agencies including the Directorate of Advertisement and Visual Publicity (DAVP) and other private advertising companies to publish their advertisements in the said newspaper," it claimed. The ED said Sarma, using his media company, has "indulged in conspiracy and cheated the government and private advertising companies and, by doing so, had received Rs 2.70 crore towards advertisement".  "For this purpose, bogus purchase of raw materials was shown by making false entries in the books of accounts from bogus companies and by creating bogus documents and making its usage as true," the ED said. The Income-tax department had raided the premises of Sarma in October on charges of alleged tax evasion. Prior to this action, Sarma had alleged that some I-T officials, jewellers and chartered accountants were involved in money laundering during the demonetisation exercise in 2016. Upset over the action, Sarma sat on the road near his apartment as a mark of protest. "I have nothing to hide. Officials are searching my house. They are scared and trying to intimidate me so that I don't disclose names of erring I-T officers and others who were involved in the scam. I have proof and I will disclose it soon," Sarma had told reporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ed-arrests-surat-bjp-leader-in-pmla-case-linked-to-fudged-newspaper-circulation-data-920544.html

Referring to the series of tweets of Kangana Ranaut against the Maharashtra Government and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the division bench comprising Justice SJ Kathawala and Justice RI Chagla, said: “Irresponsible statement made by a citizen in an individual capacity, however wrong or distasteful it may be, are best ignored.” Further, it went on to add: “Illegal and colourable action/s on part of the state or its agencies vis-à-vis a citizen, is far too serious and damaging to society to be overlooked.” In the detailed order, the court said: “Whatever be the folly of an individual, whether in the matter of unauthorized construction, or irresponsible statements hurting the sentiments of individuals or the public in general, no action against such individual by anyone, much less by the state, can lie except within the four corners of law. By no means, colourable exercise of power or resort to threats, use of muscle power and/or causing injury by unlawful means to such person or to his/her property, can be permitted in any civil society such actions are the very antithesis of the rule of law.”(sic) On the issue of statements of Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut and Saamana headline ‘ukhad dala’, the court said: “In the said news report, it is inter alia stated that the petitioner who was unnecessarily spoiling the name of Mumbai Police by comparing Mumbai with Pakistan Occupied Kashmir has received a good blow from BMC. The aforestated response of Raut and the language used by him show that because the petitioner tweeted that she was threatened by Raut and questioned, “Why Mumbai is feeling like Pakistan occupied Kashmir.

The state government told the court that it will respond to the suggestion soon. The division bench of chief justice Vikram Nath and Justice J B Pardiwala told the state government during a hearing on a suo moto public interest litigation that the mask rule was not being strictly complied with. It said that it could be the reason behind the second Covid-19 surge in the state as rule was not being enforced strictly. On Friday, the state recorded 1,607 new cases, its highest single-day spike and 16 deaths across the state. According to reports, Ahmedabad police fined over 1,300 persons on Thursday alone for not wearing masks in public. The bench's observation came after advocate Vishal Antani raised the issue of implementation of mask penalties and said that the rule is failing in creating a deterrence. Antani added that there should be a mechanism for repeat offenders to send them to Covid-19 centres and perform non-medical duties to understand the gravity of the situation. Chief Justice Nath sought advocate general Kamal Trivedi's opinion on Antani's suggestion who responded that he will revert after taking instruction from the government. The bench said that if the offenders were told to go to Covid-19 centres for community service, they will remember to wear a mask. The bench was of the opinion that such a provision will bring results. During the hearing, which was live-streamed on Youtube, Justice Pardiwala said, "People are not ready to understand...we requested them with folded hands, what do they expect now? We should fall down on our knees and request them? People are not worried, god knows what is wrong with their psyche...minimum eight days of community service at a Covid centre may be considered." At the end of the hearing, the bench mentioned in the order, "We feel that if such steps are taken, it will ensure greater implementation of compulsorily wearing masks, which will definitely help us in containing the spread of Covid-19."(sic) It is to be noted that the High Court has been passing orders forcing the government to take measures to contain the spread of the virus, create required infrastructure, among other things. It was the court's intervention that forced the government to increase the fine for not wearing masks in public places.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/send-repeat-offenders-of-mask-rule-to-covid-19-centres-for-community-service-gujarat-hc-tells-state-govt-920618.html
27-11-2020||West||Gujarat doctor held for sending mails in PMO officials' name||A doctor was arrested on Friday for allegedly creating email addresses in the name of officials in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and ordering Gujarat government officials to act promptly on his complaint. The Ahmedabad cybercrime branch arrested Dr Vijay Parikh, an M.D., from his house in Amreli, it said in a release. Some senior Gujarat government officials as well as IPS officers had recently received emails whose senders identified themselves as PMO officials. Parikh had purchased two offices in the Parimal Garden area of Ahmedabad from Nishith Shah, but the latter cheated him by not handing over possession, the emails said. Parikh had approached the PMO for justice, and state officials should "take prompt action on the application of Dr Parikh and help him take back the possession of his offices", the emails said. The PMO was "constantly monitoring the progress", they added. Upon verification, the cybercrime branch found that Parikh himself had created these email IDs to pressurize government officials and get possession of his properties, the release said. Further probe is on, it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-doctor-held-for-sending-mails-in-pmo-officials-name-920620.html

According to a government release, these changes were applied to the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 and Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act, 1979, to help industries hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. "In a bid to help industries hit hard in the current situation, and to attract fresh investments, the Gujarat government has announced a series of relaxations in labour laws, and more reforms are done and some are in the pipeline," said Vipul Mittra, additional chief secretary of Labour and Employment department. As per the new rules, entrepreneurs are not supposed to pay any "contract fee" if less than 50 contract labourers are employed, the release said. In more relief, entrepreneurs are now exempted from renewal of licence and from getting duplicate certificate of registration or temporary licences under the Contract Labour Act. Similarly, another notification amended the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) (Gujarat) Rules.

Sawant also told reporters that the Goa government was not interested in any ‘out of court’ settlement to resolve the matter, while adding that he had convinced C T Ravi, BJP’s in-charge of the Goa desk, that Karnataka had already diverted water from the Mahadayi river, against the orders of the apex court.  “There is no question of an out of court settlement. We have filed a contempt petition. We are firm on it... I know water in the Mahadayi basin has reduced now,” Sawant said.  Speaking about his brief conversation with the newly appointed Goa BJP in-charge C T Ravi, earlier this week, Sawant said that he had “convinced” Ravi, that Karnataka had already started diverting the water from the river’s basin.  “I have told C T Ravi, the Karnataka MLA. I have convinced him that the water has been diverted by (your state),” Sawant said. Ravi had arrived in Goa to meet party leaders soon after his appointment as the Goa in-charge.  The chief minister also said that he did not initiate any conversation with Karnataka government’s special representative in the national capital Shankargouda Patil, when the latter had called on him for an unrelated matter, earlier this week.  “I have not discussed anything regarding Mahadayi. I have told him we do not want to indulge in any discussion on the issue,” Sawant said. Patil had urged both the chief ministers to resolve the ongoing dispute via dialogue.  Goa and Karnataka are battling out a two decade-long dispute over the sharing of the Mahadayi river in the Supreme Court, after both parties expressed reservations about the award by the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal in 2018. Goa has also opposed the diversion of water from the Mahadayi river basin through the Kalasa-Banduri nala project claiming it would cause “ecological devastation” in Goa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/water-depleted-in-mahadayi-due-to-diversion-says-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-920691.html
