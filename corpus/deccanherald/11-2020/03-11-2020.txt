According to Forest department sources, the jumbo, which had strayed into the village, was returning to the forest, when it got stuck in the railway fence. An elephant died in a similar manner a few years ago, under Nagarahole National Park limits, near Veeranahosahalli of Hunsur taluk. It may be mentioned that there were a few video clippings doing the rounds showing the jumbos getting stuck and even hitting the railway fences, at some places in Moleyuru and surrounding areas. Veterinarian Dr D N Nagaraj conducted the post mortem, in the presence of Assistant Conservator of Forest Ravikumar and Range Forest Officer Puttaraju. Dr Nagaraju said, it is common for the jumbos to cross the barricades, entering villages and returning to forest. However, due to recent rains, the soil had turned slippery. The jumbo might have slipped, and could not get up and died, he opined.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/elephant-gets-stuck-in-rail-barricade-dies-910955.html

Even the district administration and Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) authorities are planning to impose restriction on lighting crackers. In addition, members of various organisation have launched an online campaign, urging the people to ‘say no to crackers’ and to celebrate ‘Green Dipawali’. The volunteers have taken to social media, to spread awareness about the effects of lighting crackers, which result in respiratory issues, due to air pollution.       M K Manoj, an volunteer, said, “I have mentioned a few points about the ill effects of crackers and how it creates respiratory problems. Due to the Covid crisis, it is important to breathe fresh air. Thus, I appeal to people no to bust crackers, to keep our atmosphere healthy.” With Dipawali nearing, assistant professor at JSS Medical College and a physician Dr C R Venkatesh is conducting a study on the link between air pollution and the spread of corona infection. He said, “Air pollution is the presence of toxins and micro particles in air, which we breathe. Airborne pollutants are poisonous and are mixed with inhaled air. These molecules are capable of carrying more than 300 chemicals. These cells cause respiratory problems and heart disease. In addition, bacteria and viruses present in the lungs will be released. These particles also contribute to the spread of coronaviruses that come out, when coughing and breathing. Considering the affects of crackers, the authorities of MCC are pushing for eco-friendly celebration. The authorities claim, "Due to repeated awareness drives, busting of crackers have come down. This time, we plan to intensify the drive due to the outbreak of Covid. Many Covid patients are quarantined in their houses and air pollution would affect their health. Thus, we ask people to light lamps and diyas to celebrate the festival.” According to Health department officials, many cases of wheezing, asthma and chronic disease are reported due to bursting of crackers. Meanwhile, members of Pragathi Pratisthan, Mysuru, prepared 5,000 eco-friendly Diyas from cow dung and coloured them with turmeric and kumkum recently. President of the Pratisthan B K Ajay Kumar Jain, JDJC president Kokila, Kavyashree, Rohini, members of Paradise Scout Group and Pragathi Guide Group came together to complete the Diyas. They will be distributed among the people free of cost for Dipawali celebrations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-like-minded-forums-team-up-for-eco-friendly-dipawali-910959.html

Kannadigas residing in Dubai have admitted their children to different institutions there. The students learn English, Arabic, Persian and other languages. A few people, who are passionate about Kannada have come together and launched Kannada Mithraru. The association started a Kannada school, six years back. It conducts a six-month Kannada course and the classes are held during weekends. The language experts conduct classes and examination is conducted to issue certificate.  Kannada Mithraru convener, Malavalli-origin, A N Bhanukumar told DH that a large number of people from Kerala are residing in Dubai and the students have an opportunity to learn Malayalayam. But, as only few Kannadigas are in Dubai, the students have no opportunity to learn Kannada. Thus, the school was launched. “First four years, the institution was run with the help of Suttur Mutt. The classes were conducted at JSS School building.

Prem Kumar, a resident of Lakshmikantha Nagar, Hebbal, here, who was treated at the Designated Covid Hospital, the new district hospital on KRS Road in Mysuru, has alleged that due to the negligence of the healthcare professionals, he is suffering from gangrene and is on the verge of losing both his legs. However, District Health Officer Dr T Amarnath said, “As saving the lives of Covid patients is the priority of the healthcare professionals in Covid hospitals, treatment for other illness like gangrene, is not possible there. While discharging Covid patients, if they have any other illness, we advise them to get treatment at the KR Hospital. There is no negligence in Covid Hospitals.” Meanwhile, one Bhaskarachari has alleged that his sister Padmamma (60), a resident of Nandipura of Hunsur taluk, may have died due to the negligence of the healthcare professionals in Periyapatna and the family members do not have information about her. He said, Periyapatna Taluk Hospital staff took Padmamma, who was tested Covid positive on September 8, stating that she would be sent to the Covid Hospital in Mysuru. “However, when we inquired about her, at the Designated Covid Hospital in Mysuru, we were told that there was no patient with the name ‘Padmamma’,” he said. “We are not aware of the existence of my sister. The officials concerned should conduct an inquiry,” he demanded.

03-11-2020||Karnataka Districts||Covid-19: Second wave may hit Mysuru during winter||With Covid-19 positive cases declining considerably in Mysuru district, people have relaxed, thronging markets, places of worship and other public places, deeming that the worst phase is over. But, experts warn that there is a danger of a second wave during winter months, if the norms are not followed strictly. The positive cases reported on November 2 was 100 and the number of active cases was 1,515. While 736 patients are under home isolation, the remaining are treated at the dedicated Covid hospitals, private hospitals, Covid health care and Covid Care Centres. Rampant tests conducted by the district administration may be a reason for the decline in figures. Earlier, around 1,500 samples were tested every day in Mysuru. But, with Mysuru Medical College and Research Centre extending support, around 4,000 samples are tested every day and the results are available within 24 hours. At a time, when a few countries are stepping into another lockdown, with Covid cases surging again, there is a need to ensure that the district administration does not lose hold on checking the spread. As winter may set in a few weeks, experts are worried about the possibility of a second wave due to a dip in mercury levels, as it is said to be conducive for the novel coronavirus. With the change in season, people are prone to catch cold, flu and other infections. The possibility of the spread of coronavirus is more during winter. Hence, it is vital to wear masks, build immunity by consuming healthy food, not to venture out unless it is important, maintain social distancing and hand hygiene, said Dr Govindaraju, a general physician. With Deepavali around the corner, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has warned the people not to neglect the Covid guidelines. "The decrease in positive cases may be temporary. There are possibilities of a rise in the cases, post festival season. People are attending functions without wearing masks and ignoring social distancing. If this continues, it would be a huge setback and Mysuru would return to the earlier situation. The Police department has been directed to impose fine on those violating the norms," she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-second-wave-may-hit-mysuru-during-winter-910964.html

03-11-2020||National||Irrespective of the winner of presidential polls, India-US relationship to remain strong||Irrespective of the outcome of the November 3 presidential elections, the relationship between India and the US is expected to continue at the same pace as it has in the last two decades and strengthen further, policy documents and remarks from the two campaigns indicate. President Donald Trump, in the first term of his presidency, has emerged as the best friend of India at the White House taking the relationship to a new level and his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is well known, which was reflected in the two addressing massive two joint rallies in the US and India in less than a year. Former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, has a strong track record of being an ardent advocate of a strong India-US relationship both as a Senator from Delaware for over three decades and then as deputy of President Barack Obama for eight years. From playing a key role in the passage of the India-US civil nuclear deal during a Republican administration to set up the goal of a USD 500 billion in bilateral trade, Biden has strong ties with Indian leadership across the aisle and has a large number of Indian Americans within his close circuit. The ground for the India-US relationship post-November 3 was laid down during the recently concluded 2+2 ministerial held in New Delhi. Officials from the two countries, both during and after the ministerial, underscored that the ties have bipartisan support and it is not based on which party occupies the White House or have a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is very well expected that there could be a change in nuances or emphasis on certain elements of the relationship, on who occupies the White House or have a majority in the Congress, the common national interest of the two countries in terms of democracy and threat being posed by China would drive the momentum between India and the US. Under the Trump administration, defence and energy are being identified as two key pillars of the relationship, along with the cooperation and collaboration in the health sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. However, differences in issues related to bilateral trade, foreign workers' visas would continue to remain. Notably, India is the only major country with which the Trump administration failed to arrive at a trade deal, even a mini-trade deal, despite the fact the top leadership of both India and the US expressed their desire to do so. Given the track record of differences between the two countries for the last three decades, the sharp differences are likely to remain the same even during a Biden administration. However, the bilateral trade is likely to grow at a fast pace between India and the US irrespective of who comes to power. Officials from the two countries are likely to pick up the thread from the trade negotiations that they have almost concluded this year. India will continue to place massive orders towards the purchase of defense equipment and take the bilateral energy trade to a new level. During a Biden administration, climate change would emerge as another pillar of co-operation. Because of domestic political compulsions, human rights issues are expected to gain more prominence under a Biden-Harris administration, which could emerge as a bump on the road for India-US ties. It is similar to that of the H-1B issue and issues like taxation in India, under the second term of the Trump administration. But none of the issues during either a Biden or a Trump administration are likely to be a deal-breaker. Biden, a day earlier, announced to convene a global summit of democracies in the first year of his presidency to counter the 'rising authoritarianism' in the world and address issues of election security and human rights. India, obviously, will play a key role in this summit. Similarly, under the Trump administration, India is likely to be a key partner of the US as it ramps up its global mobilisation against aggressive Chinese behaviour. And it might be surprising that Prime Minister Modi would be among the first few world leaders to talk over the phone and congratulate the winner as soon as it is known who would occupy the White House for the next four years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/irrespective-of-the-winner-of-presidential-polls-india-us-relationship-to-remain-strong-910585.html
03-11-2020||National||India’s poor hygiene standard turned beneficial to fight Covid-19: Study||With India having one of the world’s lowest Covid-19 case and death rates, two scientific studies have come out with an interesting proposition – India’s poor health and hygiene standards may be having a beneficial impact for lakhs of people as their immune system got naturally “trained” to fight the virus. Carried out by two separate groups, the studies open up a new window to look at the epidemic in the Indian context even though the researchers made it clear that they didn’t advocate poor health and hygiene standards as a natural corollary of the research findings. In one of the studies, scientists from the National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, and Chennai Mathematical Institute studied - across 106 countries - 25 to 30 parameters including demography, the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, BCG vaccination, sanitation, and Covid-19 deaths per million. "Per million population (deaths) number appears to be high in countries that are richer and having high GDP and (in) countries with low GDP, less number of people are dying, which is very paradoxical," said Shekhar Mande, a former NCCS director who is a co-author of the paper. The percentage of people above the age of 65, who are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, is significantly higher in high-GDP countries. Such countries also have a higher prevalence of auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. “There are interesting correlations, not causation, in this ‘yet to be peer-reviewed’ work. Importantly, we are not advocating a move towards weaker hygiene practices by any means,” said Mande, the director-general of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Rather, he said, the findings could lead to the exploration of "immune training with possibilities of microbiome (a big pool of bacteria) therapies" - a suggestion flagged by another research group in an independent study. Analysing data from 122 countries, medical researchers at Dr Rajendra Pradsad Government Medical College at Kangra have proposed that high microbial exposure can possibly induce a protective effect against Covid-19 through a chain of complex immune processes inside the body since countries with less mortality also tend to have lack of sanitation and high incidence of attendant diseases.  Out of the 122 countries they studied, 80 were high-income countries while 42 were low-income ones.  “There may be a need to look at the dynamics of Covid-19 pandemic using an immune perspective. The approach can potentially inform better policies including interventions,” the Himachal Pradesh researchers concluded.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-s-poor-hygiene-standard-turned-beneficial-to-fight-covid-19-study-910595.html

This year, that could spell disaster for the country’s battle against the pandemic. With some of the most polluted cities on the planet and more than 80 lakh confirmed coronavirus cases, India is battling a medical calamity. Temperatures are falling and cases and pollution are spiking across major cities, including the capital New Delhi, one of the worst-affected areas for smog from the rural burning. Delhi’s 2.8 crore people haven’t had a single day of clean air since early September, according to World Air Quality Index. In the past two weeks, readings for particulate matter of 2.5 microns or smaller, or PM2.5, have risen to more than 400 in some parts of Delhi, eight times the safe level. PM2.5 is closely watched because the particles are small enough to journey deep into the lungs and do the most damage. “Covid-19 and air pollution are a dangerous combination,” said K. Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India. Air pollution causes damage and inflammation in the lungs and other body tissues, reducing the body’s ability to resist the virus, which may result in more severe forms of the infection. With pollution and the virus both attacking lungs, India’s creaking health-care system may come under a double strain of patients competing for the same equipment and resources. An increase in respiratory illnesses due to air pollution will send more people to hospitals with symptoms similar to Covid-19, making identifying and isolating the virus cases difficult, according to Delhi-based pulmonologist Pankaj Sayal. India has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases, trailing only the U.S. While official data shows the country has seen a peak in the number of infections, a government panel of scientists attributed the recent slowdown to a harsh national lockdown earlier this year and warned that the “upcoming festival and winter seasons may increase the susceptibility to infection.” Low Oxygen The World Health Organization estimates that dirty air kills 7 million people a year globally, with even short-term exposure causing or aggravating diseases including reduced lung function, asthma and most importantly now, respiratory infections. “Now if I get Covid, I have less of a margin,” said Meet Malhotra, a 58-year-old Delhi-based advocate who developed asthma as a child. “If your oxygen level goes under 90, you need hospitalization. What happens if you’re already at 92-93 because of air pollution?” Vehicle and industrial emissions contribute year-round to India’s poor air, combining with dust from road construction millions of domestic fires lit by poor citizens for cooking. But a grim extra wallop comes late in the year as farmers burn hundreds of thousands of acres of crop stubble. While the practice has been banned in the states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan around the capital, it’s the cheapest and fastest way for farmers to clear the ground for the new crop. Bounded by mountains and hills, Northern India’s cold winter air then traps the smoke for weeks, with pollution topped up in the last quarter of the year when Indians set off millions of firecrackers to celebrate the festive season. That could make it easier for the virus to be transmitted, said Arun Sharma, a professor at the University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi. “The risk of transmission of infection will be higher” because more particles in the air give the virus more ways to travel from an infected person, he said. “The particle remains viable for longer.” An environment ministry spokesperson said the government had introduced a new law to establish a panel to tackle poor air quality. At the same time, officials from the Central Pollution Control Board had been divided into 50 teams to curb pollution, while a pilot project was underway to decompose rather than burn residue after the harvest, the spokesperson added. Growing Evidence Evidence has been mounting since March that air pollution worsens the effects of the virus, including a Harvard study indicating that Covid death rates are higher in polluted areas as well as studies linking mortality and pollutants in China and Europe. Even for those who overcome the virus, the air quality can slow or even prevent the chance of a full recovery in a small number of cases. Lung functions in some people who were in intensive care, are not returning to normal, according to Arvind Kumar, who started the Delhi-based Lung Care Foundation. Some patients continue to need oxygen. Others develop problems such as fibrosis and breathlessness. Environmental activists have been warning for years of the devastating effects of air pollution on health. With doctors around the world predicting that the world is likely to face more pneumonia-like viruses in future, the quality of the air we breathe is coming under increasing scrutiny. “Air pollution kills you slowly,” said Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder of Care for Air in Delhi. “Covid-19 just kills you faster.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/stubble-burning-is-set-to-make-covid-19-fight-deadlier-910651.html

The worst time, he said, was in the weeks after the federal government imposed a sweeping lockdown to contain the disease in late March, when roads were deserted, police made arbitrary checks and roadside restaurants, repair shops and motels were shuttered. But the oxygen he was carrying was saving the lives of thousands of those infected. "We were on duty," said the 33-year-old driver with Linde India Ltd, an affiliate of the world's largest supplier of industrial gases, Linde Plc. "It's not like we could just give up and go home." With India's Covid-19 infections surging since March and many patients struggling to breathe, hospitals have scrambled to secure supplies of medical oxygen, increasing pressure on people like Yadav and companies like Linde to deliver them in time. The government says demand for medical oxygen has jumped four times to about 2,800 tonnes a day, prompting some states to restrict movement of the commodity from local factories to other regions. Around half of the total liquid oxygen production in India is now being used for medical needs, up from only 15% earlier.  Linde, which competes with nearly two dozen oxygen suppliers in India, including France's Air Liquide, has responded by tweaking its production lines away from industrial gases like nitrogen and argon, company officials told Reuters. It has also deployed its entire fleet of trucks, bringing back even grounded vehicles, to deliver medical oxygen to hospitals across the country, many of them in the hinterlands with limited storage capacity. "Despite the limitations, there has not been a single stock-out situation for our partner hospitals," Linde India said. Still, as infections peaked in India in mid-September, hospitals in some parts of the country were left gasping for oxygen. The government says supplies have since stabilised. It has also floated a global tender to import 100,000 tonnes of oxygen. Linde said it is considering shipping in the commodity, besides bringing additional containers, from its facilities outside the country.   MAXIMUM OXYGEN India has the world's second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections at more than 8 million, behind only the United States. But India's deaths-per-million people ratio of around 88 is one of the lowest in the world among hard-hit countries, and the government has said getting oxygen to critical patients in time has played a key role. Linde India's factory in Selaqui, at the foot of the Himalayas in northern India, is set up to produce 154 tonnes of oxygen daily, but since the pandemic, the facility has churned out up to 161 tonnes. "We did maximum oxygen production," said Surendra Singh, a Linde India business head. "Almost 85-90% went to medical (clients)." It helped that industrial demand itself had come down because of the lockdown, though the reopening of the economy could change that. To ship the oxygen to hospitals - the furthest is 680 km (420 miles), a two-day drive away - and two regional depots, the factory depends on a fleet of 33 container trucks and a pool of 66 drivers. Its fleet has on-board cameras, GPS trackers and elaborate safety procedures to ensure timely deliveries - rare aids for Indian truckers. Then, its drivers discovered that all the roadside restaurants and motels where they would stop for a meal or a night's rest were shuttered. So the factory's small canteen provided them with packed meals, along with biscuits and dry fruit. Despite masks and protective gear, drivers also worried about catching the virus when they had to spend hours inside hospital compounds, transferring liquid oxygen from their vehicles to storage tanks, sometimes located next to mortuaries. Now, with India's daily coronavirus cases dropping, there is some comfort among Linde officials and its frontline drivers. But experts have warned that coronavirus cases may surge during the winter, again putting pressure on medical infrastructure, including oxygen supplies, even as industrial use of the gas picks up. And despite a challenging seven months on the highway, drivers like Yadav said they were prepared for more. "Doctors are working hard, the nurses are working hard, and we are doing our part," Yadav said. "If we give up, then the hospitals will close down."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/truckers-who-keep-indias-covid-19-patients-breathing-910675.html

Addressing an interactive dialogue with Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma on Monday said the hate speech by Pakistan is not merely directed towards one community in India but also against organisations, individuals and even against high ranking political leaders. “While the world has come to a standstill due to the pandemic, Pakistan has only enhanced support to cross-border terrorism taking advantage of the pandemic,” he said. Pakistan has resorted to “unbridled hate speech trying to foment violence and intolerance in our country," he told the UN forum. India strongly hit out at Pakistan for abusing the UN platform to forward its “nefarious political agenda.” Sharma said that Pakistan is trying to “create divisions among our religious communities as well. Fortunately, their provocation is falling on deaf ears since India has had a tradition of pluralism and co-existence where all communities live in harmony under a democratic framework. India called on Pakistan to practice co-existence in their own country and eschew all sectarian violence, discrimination and intolerance against their own people. Sharma said the world today is confronted not only by the challenge of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, but also the challenge of “infodemic”, which in many cases has been responsible for rise in hate speech and seeding hatred within communities. In June, India along with 12 countries co-sponsored the Cross-Regional Statement on “Infodemic” in the Context of Covid-19 - a first of its kind statement by UN Member States to counter the increase in hate speech and misinformation during the pandemic. “India is fighting Covid 19 pandemic in the most transparent manner with equal access to medical facilities to all citizens,” Sharma said at the Third Committee meeting of the General Assembly, adding that special efforts have been taken to ensure that vulnerable communities are provided adequate medical support.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-taking-advantage-of-coronavirus-pandemic-to-enhance-cross-border-terrorism-india-910680.html

Some of the blocked websites were being directly operated by outlawed organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). These websites were carrying pro-Khalistani content. "12 websites have been ordered to be blocked by the Ministry of Electronics and IT under section 69 A of the IT Act. They were supporting pro-Khalistani activities. The order was issued on Monday," the source - who did not wish to be identified - told PTI.

"We don’t want to exercise our jurisdiction, but we are not happy with how this recommendation has been pending for two years," a bench, presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao, said. "We want the Governor to pass orders. Inform us what can be done in such situations where Governor makes such recommendations. What is it the court can do in such cases? Can we ask the Governor to do that as has been done in earlier cases," the bench asked senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana. The court also asked the counsel, appearing for one of the convicts, A G Perarivalan, to tell what the laws were that could allow it to exercise its jurisdiction.  Posting the plea for parole filed by Perarivalan for consideration on November 25, the bench suggested the counsel go through the Shatrughan Chauhan case and do some research to enable the court to pass its order. Sankaranarayana said the remission file was pending after the recommendation of the state government for more than two years now. He said the petitioner wanted parole because of multiple co-morbid illnesses and high chances of getting Covid-19 infection in the prison. "We have no option but to approach this court now," he said. During the hearing, the court asked Tamil Nadu's Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan, "Why is the Governor taking so much time?" To this, Srinivasan said this was a case of a larger conspiracy and the Governor was waiting for a report from the CBI.  Notably, the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) was probing into unravelling a larger conspiracy into the case. The bench, however, reminded him that larger conspiracy only dealt with whether other persons were involved.  Sankaranarayanan, however, said he would file a compilation of cases. In Nilofer Nisha case, it was a batch of cases arising out of a remission notification and the court exercised their powers under 142 to release the prisoners. As far as remission is concerned, it is the prerogative of the Governor and is not under the Criminal Procedure Code, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-sc-expresses-unhappiness-over-pendency-of-convict-s-plea-for-pardon-910713.html

The Reserve Bank of India and the Finance Ministry have already filed separate additional affidavits in the apex court saying that the banks, financial and non-banking financial institutions will credit into the accounts of eligible borrowers by November 5 the difference between compound and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the moratorium scheme period. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah was requested by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the hearing in the loan moratorium case be deferred as he would be busy arguing on behalf of the Centre in other matter relating to the Central Vista project. "These moratorium matters were listed yesterday but they came up today. I am requesting for an adjournment considering I have a case (Central Vista) where I will be arguing" the law officer said. A letter seeking deferment of the hearing in the case was also circulated by advocate-on-record Anil Katiyar for the Centre to the parties and the bench. The top court acceded to the request and adjourned the hearing on pleas including the one filed by Gajendra Sharma on November 5. The pleas pertained to charging of interest on interest by banks on EMIs which have not been paid by borrowers after availing the loan moratorium scheme of RBI during March 1 to August 31. Earlier, the RBI had filed the affidavit saying that it has asked all banks, financial and non-banking financial institutions to take "necessary actions" to credit into the accounts of eligible borrowers the difference between compound and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the moratorium scheme. Prior to this, the central government had told the apex court that lenders have been asked to credit into the accounts of eligible borrowers the difference between compound and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the RBI's loan moratorium scheme by November 5. The government had said that the ministry has issued a scheme as per which lending institutions would credit this amount in the accounts of borrowers for the 6-month loan moratorium period which was announced following the Covid-19 pandemic situation. On October 14, the apex court had observed that the Centre should implement "as soon as possible" the interest waiver on loans of up to Rs 2 crore under the RBI's moratorium scheme and had said that the common man's Diwali is in the government's hands. The RBI had on March 27 issued the circular which allowed lending institutions to grant a moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic. Later, the moratorium was extended till August 31 this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-defers-hearing-on-pleas-related-to-loan-moratorium-scheme-to-november-5-910716.html

03-11-2020||National||Irrespective of the winner of presidential polls, India-US relationship to remain strong||Irrespective of the outcome of Tuesday's keenly-contested US presidential election, America's strategic relationship with India is expected to maintain the current momentum and strengthen further, policy documents and remarks from the two campaigns indicate. President Donald Trump, in the first term of his presidency, has emerged as the best friend of India at the White House taking the relationship to a new level and his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is well known, which was reflected in the two leaders addressing two joint rallies in the US and India in less than a year. Highlighting the great relationship that he has developed with Modi, Trump in September said that he has "great support from India". "Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine and he's doing a very good job. Nothing easy, but he's done a very good job," Trump said as he recollected his historic address at the 'Howdy Mody' event in Houston last September. Former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, has a strong track record of being an ardent advocate of a strong India-US relationship both as a Senator from Delaware for over three decades and then as deputy of President Barack Obama for eight years. From playing a key role in the passage of India-US civil nuclear deal during a Republican administration to setting up the goal of a USD 500 billion in bilateral trade, Biden has strong ties with Indian leadership across the aisle and has a large number of Indian Americans within his close circuit. At a fundraiser in July, Biden had said that India and the United States were natural partners. "That partnership, a strategic partnership, is necessary and important in our security," he said when asked whether India is critical to the US' national security. Referring to his eight years as the vice president, Biden said that he was proud to have played a role in securing Congressional approval for the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, which he said was a "big deal". "Helping open the door to great progress in our relationship and strengthening our strategic partnership with India was a high priority in the Obama-Biden administration and will be a high priority if I'm elected president," Biden had said. The ground for India-US relationship post-November 3 was laid down during the recently concluded 2+2 ministerial held in New Delhi. Officials from the two countries, both during and after the ministerial, underscored that the ties have bipartisan support and it is not based on which party occupies the White House or has a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is very well expected that there could be a change in nuances or emphasis on certain elements of the relationship, on who occupies the White House or have a majority in the Congress, the common national interest of the two countries in terms of democracy and threat being posed by China would drive the momentum between India and the US. Under the Trump administration, defence and energy are being identified as two key pillars of the strategic relationship, along with the cooperation and collaboration in the health sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. However, differences on issues related to bilateral trade, foreign workers visas would continue to remain. Notably, India is the only major country with which the Trump administration failed to arrive at a trade deal, even a mini-trade deal, despite the fact the top leadership of both India and the US expressed their desire to do so. Given the track record of differences between the two countries for the last three decades, the sharp differences are likely to remain the same even during a Biden administration. However, the bilateral trade is likely to grow at a fast pace between India and the US irrespective of who comes to power. Officials from the two countries are likely to pick up the thread from the trade negotiations that they have almost concluded this year. India will continue to place massive orders towards the purchase of defence equipment and take the bilateral energy trade to a new level. Under a Biden administration, climate change would emerge as another pillar of co-operation. Because of domestic political compulsions, human rights issues are expected to gain more prominence under a Biden-Harris administration, which could emerge as a bump on the road for India-US ties. It is similar to that of H-1B issue and issues like taxation in India, under the second term of the Trump administration. But none of the issues during either a Biden or a Trump administration are likely to be a deal-breaker. Biden this week announced to convene a global summit of democracies in the first year of his presidency to counter the 'rising authoritarianism' in the world and address issues of election security and human rights. India, obviously, will play a key role in this summit. Similarly, under the Trump administration, India is likely to be a key partner of the US as it ramps up its global mobilisation against aggressive Chinese behaviour, especially in the strategic Indo-Pacific region. It is expected that Prime Minister Modi would be among the first few world leaders to talk over phone and congratulate the winner as soon as it is known who would occupy the White House for the next four years.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/irrespective-of-the-winner-of-presidential-polls-india-us-relationship-to-remain-strong-910752.html

"We are ready to fly passengers to these countries whenever they ease restrictions," he added. On October 22, the Minister had said that the average fares on special flights operating between Kerala and Bahrain are between Rs 30,000 and Rs 39,000 as the Gulf country allows only 750 passengers to come from India per week. Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July.

The slide in active cases is supplemented by an exponential rise in recoveries, it said. The total number of recoveries has surged to 76,03,121 and exceed active cases by 70,61,716, the ministry highlighted. The national Covid-19 recovery rate has further escalated to 91.96 per cent. The ministry said new infections reported in a day have fallen below 40,000 as India registered a daily rise of 38,310 new cases on Tuesday. The country had reported 36,470 new cases in a span of 24 hours till 8 am on October 27. With a large number of coronavirus patients recovering every day and a sustained fall in the mortality rate, the ministry underlined, "India's steady trend of registering dipping active cases continues." These encouraging outcomes are the result of a collaborative, focussed and effective implementation by states and Union territories under the Centre's strategy of comprehensive and consistently high countrywide testing, prompt and effective surveillance and tracking, quick hospitalisation and effective adherence of the Standard Treatment Protocol issued by the Centre. This success was also a result of the selfless service and dedication of doctors, paramedics, frontline workers and all other COVID-19 warriors across all parts of the country, the ministry said. A total 58,323 patients have recovered and discharged in a span of 24 hours, 80 per cent of which are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs. Maharashtra is leading with more than 10,000 single-day recoveries followed by Karnataka where over 8,000 people have recuperated in a day. The ministry said 74 per cent of the new infections were from 10 states and UTs. Kerala, Delhi and Maharashtra have contributed the maximum to the new cases with more than 4,000 cases each. West Bengal reported over 3,000 new cases. Also, 490 fatalities have been reported in a day. Of these, nearly 80 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and UTs with Maharashtra registering the maximum 104 deaths. India's COVID-19 case fatality rate stood at 1.49 per cent. The country's COVID-19 caseload mounted to 82,67,623 with 38,310 fresh infections, while the death toll reached 1,23,097 after 490 new fatalities were reported, the health ministry data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-active-covid-19-cases-fall-below-55-lakh-recoveries-exceed-active-cases-by-70-lakh-910756.html

The annual "Malabar" wargames that India holds with the United States and Japan have been expanded to include Australia this year to cover all members of the Quad, an informal group of the four largest democracies in the Indo-Pacific. China has accused the United States, which has been leading the effort to forge a common front among its allies, of a "Cold War mentality" and ideological prejudice. Five ships of the Indian Navy, including a submarine, were deployed in the exercise along with US Navy's John S McCain missile destroyer, Australia's Ballarat frigate and a Japanese destroyer, the Indian ministry of defence said. There will be no contact between the military personnel of the four nations because of Covid-19 restrictions during the first phase of the drills running till November 6, it said. Later this month, India and the United States will deploy aircraft carriers in the drills, a military source said. "The exercise will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies, which is based on their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order," the defence ministry said in its statement. The exercises come at a time when the host, India, is locked in a military stand-off on the disputed land border with China. Thousands of troops are in close proximity in the western Himalayas, where India says Chinese troops have intruded across its side of the de facto border. Beijing denies any intrusion and says India has been building roads and other infrastructure in the disputed area, causing the crisis. Australia's diplomatic relations with China also worsened this year after Canberra led calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing imposed trade sanctions on Australian beef and barley. Separately, Japan is embroiled in a dispute with China over ownership of islands in the East China Sea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/malabar-exercise-india-us-japan-and-australia-kick-off-large-naval-drills-910763.html

The first phase of the Malabar exercises is due to begin in the Bay of Bengal off Visakhapatnam coast on Tuesday and end on November 6. The second phase of the mega exercise is scheduled to be held from November 17 to 20 in the Arabian sea. Asked about the commencement of the exercises, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here that “we hope that relevant countries' military operations will be conducive to peace and stability in the region instead of the contrary”. Last month, India announced that Australia would be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively makes it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition. China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent participant in the exercise in 2015. The annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019. For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in joining the exercise. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-hopes-malabar-naval-drills-will-be-conducive-to-peace-not-contrary-910773.html

The study conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) was based on a face-to-face survey of 6,098 respondents -- 3,965 crop farmers, 757 marine fishermen and 1,376 livestock owners. Responses from over 2 lakh farmers were also collected from through interactive voice response system. "The report provides an estimated income gain of nearly Rs 13,000 crore per year for agricultural and livestock farmers and an incremental benefit of nearly Rs 48,000 crore," the ministry said. The report was launched by Earth Sciences Minister Harsh Vardhan at an event here on Tuesday. A total of Rs 551 crore was spent on the National Monsoon Mission while Rs 990 crore was incurred on the High Performance Computing programme to better weather forecast. For every rupee invested in the National Monsoon Mission and high-performance computing facilities of the ministry, the country has gained benefits worth Rs 50, resulting in fifty-fold gains, it said. "On adding the economic gain accruing to agricultural households and fisher households, the present value of benefits accruing to the BPL households to rain-fed areas works out to be Rs 50,447 crore. "The current level of investment is far less in comparison to the realisable benefits over the period of five years," the report said. Speaking at the event, Vardhan said the information through these projects helped farmers at various levels -- from ensuring early or delayed sowing, changing the irrigation schedule, vaccination of livestocks and better fodder management for them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/50-fold-gains-from-investments-on-monsoon-mission-computing-facilities-of-moes-survey-910775.html

In the project however, heritage buildings would be conserved.  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, submitted before a bench presided over by Justice A M Khanwilkar that the current building was built in 1927, prior to the Independence and was intended to house legislative council and not the bicameral legislature. "Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are packed. When joint sessions are held, members sit on plastic chairs, diminishing the dignity of House," he said. Mehta said that the Central government has fully taken care of environmental concerns in redeveloping the Central Vista. He pointed out that the new Parliament building has a deadline of 2022 and is a standalone project. It can come up if the rest of the project is scrapped. Mehta maintained that the ownership of Parliament is with the Lok Sabha Secretariat. As numerous occupants and Lok Sabha Speakers have indicated the inadequacies with the present structure, there was no need for a separate independent study. "While the entire country has a stake in the project, the local communities are the ones who will be affected and public consultation under EIA would imply consultation with those who are directly impacted by the project," he said. Mehta also maintained that whether there should be new Parliament or not is a policy decision which the government is empowered to take.

The Railways is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to monitor and analyse the ticket booking pattern. "If there is a rush in the particular train on a route, then a clone train will be operated on the same route to enable wait-listed passengers to get a berth," said a top official in Railways. Due to Covid-19 protocol Railways is only allowing confirmed ticket holders to travel and wait-listed passengers are not allowed to enter the station.  "Their stoppages will be limited to operational halts or the Divisional Headquarters en route, if any, thereby reducing their journey time," the official said. "The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), IT arm of Railways, is monitoring the ticket booking pattern through AI. The Railways also trained some of its staff on using AI in the transport network whether in ticket booking and movement of trains," said Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav. Of the total 736 special passengers train operated by the railways at present, 327 have a waiting list, 19 trains have occupancy below 30%, 44 have occupancy between 30%  and 50% and 83 trains have occupancy between 50% and 75%. The Railways is monitoring 327 trains, which have the highest waitlist and will run clone if required, he said. Yadav also dismissed complaints of Railways collecting more fare from passengers from festival season special trains. "In 2015, the Railways issued an order fixing fare for special trains. Since the Railways is operating only special trains at present, the fare is as per 2015 order. There is no change in it," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-ensure-confirmed-tickets-for-wait-listed-travellers-910832.html

Gowda held a review meeting of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) in Delhi. PMBJP has achieved sales of Rs 358 crore (as against sale of Rs 433 crore in FY 2019) worth of pharma products through 6600 Jan Aushadhi stores during first seven months of this fiscal (up to October 31st) and is likely to surpass sales of Rs 600 crore for the entire fiscal year. He also emphasised on creating more awareness of people regarding efficacy and quality of Jan Aushadhi medicines, increasing coverage with a focus on remote and rural areas, and for making sure availability of medicines at each Jan Aushadhi shops. He asked BPPI to prepare and submit a detailed action plan to achieve this goal.

03-11-2020||National||Army Chief Gen MM Naravane begins 3-day Nepal visit on Wednesday||Army Chief Gen MM Naravane will begin a three-day crucial visit to Nepal on Wednesday that is largely aimed at resetting strategic ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries. The Chief of Army Staff is scheduled to call on President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, besides holding talks with several other civilian and military leaders during the visit, officials said. Gen Naravane's engagements in Nepal include a visit to the headquarters of the Nepalese Army, an address to the young military officers at Nepali Army's Staff College and attending a banquet to be hosted in his honour by Chief of Nepalese Army Gen Purna Chandra Thapa, they said. In continuation of an age-old tradition that first started in 1950, Gen Naravane will be conferred the honorary rank of 'General of the Nepal Army' by the Nepalese President on Thursday. India also confers the honorary rank of 'General of Indian Army' to the Nepal Army Chief. Officials said Gen Naravane will call on President Bhandari at the presidential palace following the ceremony. He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Oli on Friday. His meeting with Prime Minister Oli is seen as important as it could lead to the resetting of ties leaving behind the map row.   Gen Naravane is also scheduled to hold extensive talks with Gen Thapa on a range of key issues such as ways to enhance military-to-military cooperation and boost the management of the nearly 1,800 km-long border between the two countries, they said. It will be the first high-level visit from India to Kathmandu since ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory. It will also be Gen Naravane's second diplomatic mission. Last month, he travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very significant visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmarese Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties. Nepal had protested after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal claimed that the road passed through its territory. Days later, it came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.   In its reaction, after Nepal's lower house of parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country. India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to "reclaim" them from India. The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district. India and Nepal have a robust defence and military relationship. The Indian and Nepalese armies have been holding 'Suryakiran' military exercise since 2011. The last edition of the exercise was held in Nepal in December last year. Both the countries also hold regular meetings under the 'Nepal-India Bilateral Consultative Group on Security' with an aim to deepen the defence cooperation. Nepal is important for India in the context of its overall strategic interests in the region and the leaders of the two countries have often noted the age-old ‘Roti-Beti’ relationship between the nations. Land-locked Nepal relies heavily on India for the transportation of goods and services. Nepal’s access to the sea is through India, and it imports a predominant proportion of its requirements from and through India. According to official data, Nepal's imports from India in 2017 were worth USD 6.52 billion, while its exports to the country were pegged at USD 420.18 million. The figure for China, which was second on the list of countries from which Nepal imported its requirements, was five times lower than that of India.  On the security side, India's strategic thinkers are concerned over reports of China grabbing Nepalese territories in a number of locations along the borders between the two countries, though Kathmandu had clarified recently that there were no such encroachments. According to reports, the Nepali, districts which have been victims of China's land-grabbing plan include Dolakha, Gorkha, Darchula, Humla, Sindhupalchowk, Sankhuwasabha and Rasuwa.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-gen-mm-naravane-begins-3-day-nepal-visit-on-wednesday-910860.html

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chairman and Chief Executive Councillor, Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC)-Kargil, Feroz Ahmad Khan and attended among others by principal of IISM-Gulmarg Colonel J S Dhillon, the spokesman said. “A winter sports institute would be established in Kargil district on the lines of IISM Gulmarg. It was also decided to identify and earmark snow ski slopes at Naktul area near Kargil town, Lamochan and Goshan area in Drass besides Sankoo and Panikhar areas,” the spokesman said. Colonel Dhillon informed the meeting that he has been deputed by the Union Ministry of Tourism to submit a detailed report regarding the winter tourism potential of Ladakh UT so that winter sports and adventure sports can be initiated there through IISM. The meeting had a threadbare discussion regarding the identification of suitable sites for winter and adventure tourism, the spokesman said, adding that the LAHDC chairman assured that he would direct the authorities of the revenue department to identify land at the suggested areas and submit the report to the Tourism ministry in the coming days. The spokesman said the meeting also decided to organise snow ski camps for at least 100 boys and girls in the district this year for which the Principal of IISM-Gulmarg assured that they will provide skis and other equipment needed for the coaching camps and workshops. He requested LAHDC chairman Khan to send a letter in this regard to the Tourism Ministry. The Principal also assured that the skis and equipment would reach Kargil well before the closure of Srinagar-Leh national highway so that the proposed camps would be organised in due course of time, the spokesman said. Meanwhile, the spokesman said the meeting decided that a national level ice hockey championship will be organised by IISM at Drass Ice Hockey Rink this winter season. It was also decided that other than skiing and ice hockey, adventure sports like hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and trekking would be explored in the district so that maximum number of adventure sports lovers from across the country and abroad come here and more employment opportunities can be created for the unemployed youth, the spokesman said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ladakh-govt-to-set-up-snow-ski-institute-in-kargil-to-promote-winter-sports-910861.html

West Bengal, whose performance over the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission was termed as "dismal" by the ministry last week, did not attend the meeting, the minister told reporters. Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar and Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb were present at the meeting. "Our political commitments could be different but the enthusiasm the states have shown in implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission is extraordinary," he said. Shekhawat said since the mission was launched in August last year, 2.55 crore households have been provided tap water connections. "Despite the pandemic, states have performed well," he said. The Minister said that the Goa has already achieved the target of providing tap water connections to all rural household. Telangana, Puducherry, Gujarat, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are among the states that have shown a good pace in implementation of the mission. He said the 15th Finance Commission has allocated Rs 30,375 crore as 'tied grant' in 2020-21 for critical sectors like supply of drinking water, rain water harvesting and water recycling. Rural local bodies are being urged to utilise the grant on water and sanitation activities in villages, Shekhawat said. The total mission outlay is Rs 3.6 lakh crore, of which the central share is 2.08 lakh crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gajendra-shekhawat-holds-meet-with-state-ministers-over-jal-jeevan-mission-implementation-910863.html

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar granted time till December 2 after the agencies informed that they are awaiting the replies of the LRs that have been sent to the countries. A Letter Rogatory (LR) is a formal communication sent by Court to a foreign court requesting judicial assistance in a case. The agencies informed the court that a reminder has been sent to both the countries to expedite the report. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the agencies, told the court that Enforcement Directorate had sent three reminders -- September 17, October 12 and October 30 to Singapore to expeditiously execute the LR, and to the UK on October 12, October 19 and October 30 and their replies are awaited. "Our officers are very actively and rigorously following it up. So, the request to your honour is to keep the matter after three weeks," he said. The case relates to alleged irregularities in the grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approval in the Aircel-Maxis deal.  The approval was granted in 2006 when P Chidambaram was the Union Finance Minister. According to the rules and the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in force at that time, Chidambaram was allegedly empowered to give approval to proposals involving foreign investment only up to Rs 600 crore. The CBI and the ED had alleged that Chidambaram, as finance minister had granted approval to the deal beyond his capacity benefiting certain persons and received kickbacks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/court-grants-month-to-cbi-ed-to-obtain-lrs-in-aircel-maxis-case-910869.html

During the same period, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh were the top states which registered a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases, it said. At a press briefing, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said there has been a continuous decline in average daily new Covid-19 cases as well as deaths for the last seven weeks. The average daily new cases of Covid-19 have declined from 90,346 recorded between September 16 and September 22 to 45,884 registered between October 28 and November 3, he said. "The average daily new deaths due to Covid-19 have declined from 1,165 recorded from September 16 to September 22 to 513 registered between October 28 and November 3." "More than 11 crore Covid-19 tests have been conducted so far. The cumulative, weekly and daily positivity rate is constantly declining and stands at 7.4 per cent, 4.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively," the health secretary said. Asserting that a large part of the country's population was still susceptible to the coronavirus infection, NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul, who also heads the National Task Force on Covid-19, urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and asked people to get themselves tested if they observe any symptom of the viral disease. "We are susceptible (to the virus) to a very large extent and the situation in America and Europe is showing (that). We don't know the behaviour of virus completely. So, we need to save the gains that we have earned in our fight against the pandemic till now," Paul said. "I request you to kindly get yourself tested if you have any symptoms of Covid-19. It has been proven that even if you contract the disease, there is recovery. Beds are available. We have facilities to carry lakhs of tests. People who you came in contact in the past 8-10 days they must self-quarantine themselves and not expose others," he said. In these times, even the smallest of symptoms, such as cold, cough and sore throat is Covid-19 unless proven otherwise. "It might be other flu too, but if we miss even one positive case, that may result in thousands of cases," Paul said. Responding to a question over shortage of ventilators in the national capital, Bhushan said in terms of hospital beds, a daily review of beds in central government hospitals is done. As on date, 80 beds in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, 140 beds in Safdarjung Hospital and more than 1,200 beds in AIIMS are still vacant, he said. Regarding private hospitals, there is a strategy in place which is implemented by the Delhi government. Under this, the total number of Covid beds and the vacant beds are made public, the Union health secretary said. "As far as ventilators are concerned, we have provided a sufficient number of ventilators to Delhi. If there is any demand in future, we would be in a position to provide additional ventilators too," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/kerala-delhi-bengal-manipur-showing-increase-in-covid-19-cases-from-october-3-to-november-3-health-ministry-910886.html
03-11-2020||National||Overqualified for job: SC upholds disqualification of graduate peon at bank||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to accept the contention that overqualification cannot be a ground for disqualification as it upheld an order of the Punjab National Bank terminating the service of a peon who had suppressed the fact that he was a graduate. The top court set aside two orders of the Orissa High Court by which it had asked the bank to allow the peon to discharge his service, saying “a candidate having suppressed the material information and/or giving false information cannot claim the right to continuance in service”. A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah allowed the appeal filed by the bank, noting that it had stated in its job advertisement that the applicant should not be a graduate. The court also observed that instead of challenging the qualification criteria, Amit Kumar Das had applied for the job and hidden his qualification. On the ground that Das "deliberately, wilfully and intentionally suppressed the fact that he was a graduate, the High Court has erred in directing the appellant Bank to allow the respondent - original writ petitioner - to discharge his duties as a peon”, the court said. Referring to an earlier verdict of the top court, the bench said that the suppression of material information and making a false statement have a clear bearing on the character and antecedents of the employee in relation to his continuance in service. It said, “An employee is expected to give correct information as to his qualification. The original writ petitioner failed to do so. He was, in fact, overqualified and therefore ineligible to apply for the job”. The top court said that another righteous candidate has suffered due to this mischievous act by Das. Das relied on the top court's verdict of 2000 and said that a higher qualification cannot be a ground for his disqualification from the job as rightly held by the Orissa High Court. The bench noted that the Bank has invited the applications for the post of peon by giving a newspaper advertisement in which it was specifically mentioned that a candidate should have passed 12th class or its equivalent with basic reading/writing knowledge of English and should not be a graduate as on January 1, 2016. It said that as per the eligibility criteria mentioned in the advertisement, a candidate with a graduate degree was not eligible even to apply.   The bench said that Das applied for the post of peon but in his application/bio-data did not disclose that he was a graduate degree holder since 2014 and only mentioned his qualification as 12th pass. It said looking at the nature of the post of peon, a conscious decision was taken by the bank providing eligibility criteria/educational qualification that a graduate candidate shall not be eligible for the post of peon/subordinate staff. The top court said that Das never challenged the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement and instead participated in the recruitment process.   “Therefore, once having participated in the recruitment process as per the advertisement, thereafter it is not open for him to contend that acquisition of higher qualification cannot be a disqualification and that too when he never challenged the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement,” it said. The top court stated that it is for the employer to determine and decide the relevancy and suitability of the qualifications for any post and it is not for the courts to consider and assess. “Greater latitude is permitted by the courts for the employer to prescribe qualifications for any post. There is a rationale behind it. "Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the need and interest of an institution or an industry or an establishment as the case may be. The courts are not fit instruments to assess expediency or advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications,” it said. The bench, however, said that at the same time, the employer cannot act arbitrarily or fancifully in prescribing qualifications for the posts. “Therefore, the High Court has clearly erred in directing the appellant Bank to allow the respondent original writ petitioner to discharge his duties as a peon, though he as such was not eligible as per the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement,” it said. It noted that Das in his bio-data did not mention that he was a graduate and “very cleverly” he suppressed the material fact and declared his qualification as Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC), whereas as he was holding a degree in the Bachelor in Arts. “Had it been known to the bank that he was a graduate, he would not have at all been considered for selection as a Peon in the bank. That thereafter when scrutiny of the documents was going on and when the respondent - original writ petitioner produced a graduation certificate, at that time, the bank came to know that he was a graduate and therefore not eligible,” it said. The top court said that therefore the bank rightly cancelled his candidature and he was not allowed to join the bank in the subordinate cadre. The court said it was not imposing costs on Das though his mischievous act had deprived another candidate of the job.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/overqualified-for-job-sc-upholds-disqualification-of-graduate-peon-at-bank-910890.html

A bench of Justices R K Agrawal, Arun Mishra, both retired and A M Khanwilkar, on December 1, 2017 had dismissed the PIL filed by Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR), terming it as “derogatory, contemptuous and scandalous” and had asked it to deposit the fine of Rs 25 lakh with the registry in six weeks. The amount was to be transferred to Supreme Court Bar Association Advoates' Welfare Fund." In a fresh plea filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, the CJAR has submitted that it has submitted the demand draft of Rs 25 lakh, dated November 2, with the apex court' registry and sought the condonation of delay over two-and-half years year in depositing the same. “Condone the delay in paying the costs imposed on the petitioner organization vide order dated December 1, 2017,” the application said, adding that “Rs 25 lakhs may be retained and given to the Supreme Court Bar Association”. The plea, however, referred to subsequent events in the FIR registered by the CBI against former Orissa High Court judge I M Quddusi and five others on a charge to fix judges to get a favourable order from the top court and sought recall of the 2017 judgement by which the cost was imposed on CJAR. “After this matter was disposed of by this Court by observing that the petition was 'frivolous', 'without any reasonable basis', and 'gross abuse of the process of the court', the CBI in fact went on to charge sheet the medical college officers and retired Justice I.M. Quddusi and on the basis of the charge sheet a Special CBI court took cognizance of the case in July, 2019,” the plea said. One sitting judge of the High Court, who had dealt with the subject matter of the FIR in the High Court, was indicted by an in house committee and his impeachment was recommended, the plea said. “In the light of the full circumstances stated in this application, recall the order of exemplary costs because it unfairly impairs the reputation of some very distinguished people who are unblemished in any way,” it said. The apex court has also dismissed the review and the curative pleas of CJAR in the case. The petitioner had claimed that allegations of bribery were levelled for securing settlement of cases relating to medical colleges in which retired Orissa High Court judge, Justice Quddusi, was also an accused.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cjar-deposits-rs-25-lakh-fine-imposed-by-sc-for-frivolous-pil-in-medical-college-scam-910892.html

VGIR 2020 will focus on discussions around India's economic and investment outlook, structural reforms and the government's vision for making the country a $5 trillion economy. "All the major global investors, including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds of the world, would be participating. We have confirmation from such investors who would be participating in this virtual conference. "As a matter of fact, assets under management for these funds would be more than $6 trillion," Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj told reporters at a virtual event. The Indian side at the roundtable will be represented by business leaders, financial market regulators, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. The global institutional investors representing key regions including the US, Europe, Canada, Korea, Japan, Middle East, Australia and Singapore will participate in VGIR 2020, Bajaj said. Some of these investors would be engaging with the government for the first time, he added. Some of the prominent funds participating in the event include Temasek, AustralianSuper, CDPQ, CPP Investments, GIC, Future Fund, Japan Post Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Korean Investment Corporation, Nippon Life, Mubadala Investment Company, Ontario Teachers, Teachers Retirement Texas and Pension Denmark, he said. Apart from this, there will be six major Indian industrialists -- Deepak Parekh (HDFC), Dilip Shanghvi (Sun Pharma), Mukesh Ambani (RIL), Nadan Nilekani (Infosys), Ratan Tata (Tata Group) and Uday Kotak (Kotak Mahindra Bank) to share their experience, he said. "The whole idea of this conference is... to give them (investors) information about various investment opportunities in India, the present economic situation in India and what opportunities they have," he pointed out. The event will provide an opportunity to leading global investors and Indian business leaders to engage and deliberate with senior policymakers on how to further accelerate the growth of international investments in India, he added. "If they have any concerns, we would also take care of those concerns and try and answer them. I would also like to tell you that we have been interacting with these funds for the last five or six months. We have undertaken a lot of activities on the basis of our interactions with them," Bajaj emphasised. Based on past interactions, the government has done away with dividend distribution tax and extended tax exemption to sovereign wealth funds and pension funds with certain conditions, he said. VGIR 2020 will also provide an occasion for all stakeholders to further cement the strong partnerships that have been built and foster engagement with international institutional investors who are looking to increase their Indian investments.

03-11-2020||National||Face masks can be worn during morning walk or exercise: ICMR||Face masks can be worn during exercises and morning walks as they don’t lower the oxygen levels in the blood, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said here on Tuesday, countering unsubstantiated claims on the dangerous effects of such protective clothing while exercising. “Masks can be worn during morning walks and exercises as scientific data shows no change in the oxygen level in the blood,” said Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research. The assurance comes in the wake of multiple scientific studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the protective face cover. One such study carried out by the researchers at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week concluded that face mask was not associated with a decline in oxygen saturation even in participants whose age were 65 years and above. There are several other studies documenting how masks can prevent the cough droplets from spreading out. “For communities to reopen safely, control measures to reduce transmission will be needed for some time, including face masks and social distancing,” said a study published in the Lancet in September in which the experts reviewed strategies for easing the restrictions in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Bhargava and NITI Ayong member V K Paul noted that a combination of wearing masks, avoiding crowds and maintaining social distances in the festival season would be as effective as a vaccine. On Tuesday, the number of new cases dropped below the 40,000 mark for the second time in the past eight days. With 38,310 new cases, India’s Covid-19 tally goes up to 82.67 lakh while death toll stands at 1,23,097 out of which 490 were added in the past 24 hours. The Health Ministry officials said Kerala, Delhi, West Bengal and Manipur had been showing an increase in the number of coronavirus infections between October 3 and November 3 while Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh registered a decline in the same period. However, in absolute terms Maharashtra and Karnataka have more number of cases. Asked about India’s vaccine preparedness, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said currently 28,000 cold chain points, 700 refrigerated vans and 70,000 vaccinators were available with the government and talks were on with the private sector to further ramp up the capacity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/face-masks-can-be-worn-during-morning-walk-or-exercise-icmr-910911.html

Naravane's visit is largely aimed at resetting relations with the Himalayan nation after the ties came under severe strain following a bitter border row. Gen Naravane is visiting Nepal at the official invitation of Nepal Army chief Gen Purnachandra Thapa. Indian Embassy spokesperson Naveen Kumar said that Gen Naravane’s visit "will deepen the long-standing and customary bonds of friendship between the two armies.” “His visit will provide an opportunity for both sides to discuss the bilateral defence partnership and explore avenues to further strengthen it for mutual benefit.” Gen Naravane will pay homage at the martyrs’ memorial at the Army Pavilion on Thursday morning and receive a guard of honour at the Nepal Army headquarters, according to Nepal Army sources. He will hold formal talks with his Nepalese counterpart at the Nepal Army headquarters on Thursday. Mutual interests between the two armies and bilateral relations will mainly feature during the talk, Nepal Army sources said. The Indian Army chief will also gift an ambulance and medical equipment for a mobile field hospital to be operated by the Nepal Army. He will also hold interaction with senior officials at the Nepal Army headquarters. In the afternoon, the Indian Army chief will be conferred with the honorary rank of General of Nepal Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari amidst a special ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He will also pay a courtesy call on President Bhandari after the ceremony. Gen Naravane will attend a dinner reception hosted by Nepal Army chief at Nepal Army headquarters. Gen Naravane will address the student officers at the Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri, in the outskirts of Kathmandu on Friday morning. In the afternoon, Gen Naravane will meet Prime Minister and Defence Minister K.P Sharma Oli at the Prime Minister's Official Residence at Baluwatar before wrapping up his visit. "I am delighted to be visiting Nepal on their kind invitation and to meet my counterpart Gen Purna Chandra Thapa, Chief of the Army Staff of the Nepali Army. I am sure this visit will go a long way in strengthening the bonds of friendship that the two armies cherish," Gen Naravane said in New Delhi ahead of the visit. The Chief of Army Staff said he was also grateful for the opportunity to call on Prime Minister Oli. India's decision to send the Army Chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region. The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories. After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it. In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it. In its reaction after Nepal's lower house of parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country. India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. Nepal Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to "reclaim" them from India. The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula distric||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-gen-mm-naravane-to-begin-3-day-nepal-visit-on-november-4-910918.html
03-11-2020||National||Delhi govt mulling collecting Covid-19 samples from restaurants, markets after huge surge: Sources||The Delhi government is mulling to collect samples from people while they are at restaurants, markets, and other public places in a bid to strengthen its Covid -19 surveillance mechanism amid a massive surge in daily cases in the last few days, sources said on Tuesday. In a high-level meeting on Monday, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the current Covid -19 situation was discussed threadbare. It was decided to concentrate efforts in certain key areas, such as targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive and critical zones such as restaurants, market places, barbershops and salons; gear up the availability of medical resources including beds, ICUs, and ventilators as a preemptive measure; and ensure a high degree of contact tracing along with monitoring of quarantined contacts so as to suppress and break the chain of transmission, the home ministry had said in a statement. A source in the Delhi government's health department said, in targeted testing, samples are collected at regular intervals from a restaurant or a market place in an area, from where high number of cases are getting recorded, or where safety protocols may not have been adhered to diligently. "Right now, no instruction has been given, but to conduct RT-PCR tests on a targeted audience, a kiosk perhaps would be made in a market place or near designated restaurants to collect samples from shoppers and visitors, at regular intervals," a source said. According to experts, if in a public place, a person removes the mask and the prescribed distance of 2 m is not followed, the virus transmissibility increases. "In a restaurant, if a guest sneezes while eating or talking and his face is not covered (in a closed-door environment), the droplets let out from his mouth or nose can get suspended in air due to winter and pollution, and all other guests sitting in the restaurant are then susceptible to get infected," a senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital who did not wish to be named said. Also, at market places, a safe distance of 2 m is difficult to maintain especially with crowding due to the festive season, so people would have to be very careful, he said. Delhi recorded 4,001 Covid -19 cases on Monday with a positivity rate hovering around 11 per cent, even as the Centre attributed the sudden surge in daily incidences in the last few days to greater movement of people during the festive season and laxity in adhering to safety norms. Delhi had recorded over 5,000 daily cases for five days on the trot, ending Sunday when the count stood at 5,664. The highest single-day spike till date here - 5,891 cases -- was recorded on Friday. The home ministry in the statement also had emphasised that Metro travel should be carefully regulated as per the SOPs. “The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe Covid behaviour,” it said. The number of containment zones in Delhi increased to 3,416 on Monday from 3,359 on Sunday. "We are in the process of follow-up action in view of the recent meetings and experts suggestions over ways to check the increase in the number of Covid -19 cases. A more targeted approach has been suggested by the experts,” a Delhi government official said. The district officials said although no specific directions have been received by them, they were already carrying out intensive testing and enforcement drives for Covid -19 appropriate behavior in the city. "The revised strategy to deal with a spurt in Covid -19 cases, has emphasised on focused testing, raising RT-PCR tests and mass awareness to encourage people to wear masks, maintain social distance," said a district magistrate on the condition of anonymity. The sudden spike in cases comes amid the festive season and rising pollution level. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, Diwali and Chhath fall in November. The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of Covid -19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. The Delhi government had recently begun work to augment capacity of beds at various Covid -19 facilities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-govt-mulling-collecting-covid-19-samples-from-restaurants-markets-after-huge-surge-sources-910922.html

The apex court, which said sexual assault on the minor girl was “very severe” and the conduct of the convict could be termed as “perverse and barbaric”, observed that he did not consciously cause any injury with the intent to extinguish the victim's life. “We therefore, find that though the appellant (convict) is guilty of the offence punishable under section 302 (murder) IPC, since there was no requisite intent as would bring the case under any of the first three clauses of section 300 IPC, the offence in the present case does not deserve death penalty,” a bench headed by Justice U U Lalit said in its 139-page verdict. The bench, while affirming the view taken by the trial court and the high court in convicting the accused who was a maternal uncle of the victim, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment for the offence of murder and 25 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence of rape. The bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Krishna Murari, delivered the judgement on an appeal filed by the convict against the October 2015 verdict of Bombay High Court which had confirmed the death sentence awarded to him by a trial court. The bench noted in its judgement that about 67 cases were dealt with by the top court in last 40 years where the offences were of rape and murder and age of the victims were 16 years or below. It said that out of these 67 cases, the apex court had affirmed award of death sentence to accused in 15 cases. It said in three out of these 15 cases, death penalty was commuted to life term by the apex court in review petitions. It noted that out of remaining 12 cases, death sentence was confirmed in two cases and review pleas were rejected. The bench said as on date, death sentence was confirmed in 12 out of 67 cases where the principal offences allegedly committed were of rape and murder and victims were aged about 16 years or below. It further said that out of these 67 cases, in at least 51 cases the victims were aged below 12 years. The top court said in 12 out of those 51 cases, death sentence was initially awarded. An FIR was lodged in the case by the victim’s father in February 2013 and it was found that there were bite marks on the victim’s body. The accused, who was 21-year-old at the time of incident, had claimed that he was being falsely implicated in the case. “The circumstances proved on record are not only conclusive in nature but completely support the case of the prosecution and are consistent with only one hypothesis and that is the guilt of the appellant (convict). They form a chain, so complete, consistent and clear, that no room for doubt or ground arises pointing towards innocence of the appellant,” the bench said. “The circumstances are clear, consistent and conclusive in nature and are of unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the appellant. The evidence on record also depicts an exceptional case where two and half years old girl was subjected to sexual assault. The assault was accompanied by bites on the body of the victim,” the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-commutes-mans-death-sentence-for-rape-murder-of-minor-girl-to-life-term-910924.html

Aaditya Thackeray made the comment on Twitter following reports of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade of the Centre writing a letter to the states chief secretary claiming that the land concerned belongs to the Union government. The Kanjurmarg land allotted by the Collector to MMRDA for Car depot of Metro has always been with Govt of Maharashtra as per revenue records. The Collector, Mumbai Suburban, has done due diligence of all land records and all sub-judice matters in all competent courts. The MMRDA will therefore carry on with its work for Metro joint Car Depots at Kanjurmarg as earlier decided, tweeted Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the Tourism Minister. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last month announced the scrapping of the Metro-3 car shed at the Aarey Colony in suburban Goregaon. He had said that the project would be shifted to a government land in Kanjurmarg and no cost will be incurred for the purpose.

"It is distressing to see J&K steep so low on administrative performance published in Public Affairs Index 2020, in spite of the bluster of the incumbent J&K government on governance," NC provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani said in a statement. Expressing concern over the report that has placed J-K at sixth position among UTs in governance and administrative performance, he said, it has vindicated the stand of the National Conference that the state of governance and administration has gone for a toss in J&K.  "The findings of the public affairs index have corroborated our estimation of the prevailing situation in J&K. It is not just governance and effective administration that has suffered reverses, the government has also defaulted on the promise of giving jobs to unemployed," he said. “The promised dawn of development, employment extravaganza, stepping up of infrastructure is nowhere perceptible on ground. Not to speak of adding to the infrastructure, and boosting the efficacy of the government apparatus to serve the people better, the administration is not able to keep up with the good work done by the Omar Abdullah led government on multiple fronts ranging from job creation to infrastructure augmentation. Not just the local government, the central government too is responsible for the mess,” he added. Wani said J&K had also featured at the bottom in NITI Aayog's Export preparedness index 2020 previously in August and that the recent report has only revealed that the situation is not getting better. The report also reveals that J&K has miserably performed on other four parameters that include policy, business ecosystem, export ecosystem, and export performance, he said. “Not much before the state was stripped off its status, it was among the country's best or just a notch below the best on the parameter of governance, development, HDI. In economic parameters like per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) it was better than most states. It is for all to see what has been done since August last year. The figures speak for themselves,” Wani said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/j-k-bagging-6th-slot-among-uts-debunks-admin-s-claim-of-good-governance-nc-910926.html

He said the Railways will set up a Centre for Excellence in this regard in the next three months. The Railway Board has taken a decision to appoint a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in every zonal Railways whose mandate will be to keep track of emerging technologies in analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) and use it in the rail system, Yadav said. “We have passengers-related data, train operations-related data, freight data and even asset-related data. We want to analyse all this data with the help of AI and analytics and use it in our Passenger Reservation System (PRS), the introduction of new trains and even predictive asset maintenance. We have tied up with the Indian School of Business (ISB) for this,” he said. The Indian School of Business in Hyderabad has been assigned to plan an introductory capacity building program and formulate a report on the industrial practices of AI on rail transport and benchmarking. It will also develop a report on establishing the centre for excellence and an advanced capacity building program. Meanwhile, the Railways has already trained 88 officials over the last two months for this purpose and such training will be provided for identified officials in every zone and division. The training modules include cloud computing, data science, big data analytics, AI using reinforcement learning and AI for autonomous vehicles. According to officials, the Railways has not only planned to have a CTO in zonal headquarters but also an assistant chief technology officer (ACTO) in divisions directly reporting to the General Manager and Divisional Railway Managers respectively. Six to ten officers in divisions and about 20 in zonal headquarters will be identified for training in data analytics and AI. They will be formally trained in institutes like IITs, ISB, IIMs, IIIT in the two subjects (of data analytics and AI).

"On lines of Allahabad High Court's order, Karnataka will enact a law banning religious conversions for the sake of marriage. We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of Our Sisters. Anyone involved in the act of conversion shall face severe & swift punishment, said Karnataka Tourism Minister and BJP national general secretary C T Ravi. While the Karnataka leader refrained from using the word "Love Jihad" while promising the law, Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh--Yogi Adityanath, Manohar Lal Khattar, and Shivraj Chouhan have made no bones about it.  Within four days of the Allahabad High Court order, four BJP-ruled states have promised a law to deal with a religious conversion for marriage and more states ruled by the BJP are likely to follow suit. Earlier this month, key BJP strategist and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma promised the state government will start a strict fight against 'Love Jihad' if the party comes back to power again in the assembly elections due in March- April 2021. In September Goa BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Tendulkar had said "Love Jihad" was a curse to the society.  The spate of the recent comments of the BJP leaders follows a judgement of the Allahabad High Court, which on October 30 said that conversion just for the sake of marriage is not valid.  The court had passed the order last month in a petition filed by Priyanshi alias Samreen and her partner. Earlier also the High Court in a separate case in 2014 held that conversion just for the purpose of marriage was unacceptable. Before the Allahabad High Court order, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma had a fortnight ago raised the issue of the alleged rising number of 'love jihad cases" in the Opposition-ruled Maharashtra during her meeting with Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Her comment that there is a 'rise in love-jihad cases' in Maharashtra had kicked up a row. So far there is only a promise of enacting the law but it remains to be seen whether the law as being promised by the ruling party leaders will stand the scrutiny of the apex court. "Justice V Gopala Gowda, former Supreme Court judge said, "it is a totally unconstitutional move. It is also violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution, which guaranteed equality, equality of opportunity and equal protection of the law and no discrimination on the ground of caste, creed, colour, and religion." Gowda argued that a boy and girl, who attained the majority under the Indian Majority Act, can enter into a contract and choose their partner.  With regard to Allahabad High Court judges that there should not be conversion just for the purpose of marriage, Justice Gowda says you cannot regulate and control a person who attained the majority to choose what is good and bad for him. Particularly, Articles 25 to 29 allowed a person to preach his religion as a fundamental right. How can you prohibit one section from preaching his religion to other religions, he said. However, UP CM Adityanath latched on to the Allahabad judgement and addressed a rally ahead of the November 3 by-elections raised the temperature saying his government would deal with “love jihad” with a firm hand. "We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities, if they do not mend their ways, the Ram Naam Satya journey will start," the CM said on October 31 promising that the posters of those involved in love jehad will be put on all road crossings and that the "court’s verdict will be followed". The very next day Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on November 1 his government is also considering legal provisions against it to ensure the "guilty" cannot escape.  The state Home Minister Anil Vij had tweeted on Sunday that Haryana is contemplating a law against love jihad (Haryana me love jihad ke khilaf kanoon banane par vichar kiya ja raha hai). On Monday (November 2), Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the state government will make legal arrangements to curb the alleged practice of love jihad in the state. There will be no jihad in the name of love, whoever does such an act will be set right. Legal arrangements will be made for this, Chouhan said. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, however, thinks the Allahabad HC judgement was "passing reference". "They cannot ban inter-community or inter-religious marriage under the Special Marriage Act. We have to first see the framework of the law. The point is there is freedom of religion in India, you can choose your religion for whatever reason. Banning conversion would therefore be prima facie unconstitutional. We have to see what they are trying to do by criminalising or penalising it." He further argued whatever they want to bring in would be nothing more than an anti-conversion law. Anti-conversion law that has been upheld is against offering inducement only. Possibly it weighed on the minds of Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan when he said, "it's a technical matter that involves legalities. We will see what the other states do in terms of what provisions are invoked or added. Here, the final call will be taken by the chief minister.” The issue of love Jihad also got fillip last week after a recent incident of a daylight killing of a Hindu girl by a Muslim youth  Haryana after the family members charged that that the man was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. A VHP delegation, who met the family members demanded Rs 1 crore compensation to the victim's family and alleged that she was "murdered by Islamic jihadists". Yoga Guru Ramdev also called it a case of "love jihad", demanding public hanging of the accused. Bajrang Dal held a protest march.  But the BJP and VHP have been raising the issue of "Love Jihad" for quite a long time. In UP, 'love jihad" had found a place in the BJP campaign even in 2014 Lok Sabha polls.  Among all the CMs, Aditynath in particular has been raising the issue for quite a long time. Not only in UP, he had also raised the issue of "love Jihad" during campaigning in Kerala to target the Left in 2017. VHP Working President Alok Kumar says the increasing incidents of love jihad, religious conversions and atrocities on Hindus is a cause of serious concern. It is difficult to see how many Hindu girls will fall victims in the hands of anti Hindu Jihadists."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/four-bjp-ruled-states-promise-law-on-love-jihad-legal-experts-find-the-move-unconstitutional-910937.html

Nearly a month after his video went viral, 80-year-old Kanta Prasad, the owner of 'Baba Ka Dhaba' in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar, filed a complaint against the YouTuber for misappropriation of funds. Talking to PTI, Prasad said he has received a cheque of Rs 2.33 lakh from Wasan. When asked about the remaining amount, he said he is not aware of how much donation was collected on his behalf and only Wasan and people who donated the money exactly know about this. "I have given a complaint to police and they are investigating the matter. I don't know how much money was collected as donation on my behalf," Prasad said. Denying allegations against him, Wasan, who shot the video and posted it online urging people to help the elderly couple, said, "They are defaming me by making such false claims. They said I received Rs 25 lakh as donation in my bank account, which is not true." The YoutTuber said that if it is true, then it should reflect in his bank account and transactions, claiming that the entire amount he received for Prasad has been handed over to him. When asked about the exact amount he received through fundraiser, Wasan said he got approximately around Rs 3.78 lakh, which also includes the amount received via Paytm. Wasan claimed that he has given two cheques - one of Rs 1 lakh while another of Rs 2.33 lakh to Prasad. He said apart from this, Rs 45,000 was also given to Prasad via Paytm. "I am being accused of misappropriating funds. I am being called a thief. People are now pointing fingers at my family. This is not right," he said. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, "We are scrutinising the bank accounts and other details. The enquiry is still ongoing." After the video shot by Wasan on October 7 went viral, Baba ka Dhaba was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebs from showbiz, who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal. In his complaint to police, Prasad had alleged that Wasan "intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation through different mode of payments i.e bank account/wallets without providing any information to the complainant".

Hi, this is Ahmed Shariff and you are listening to, From The Newsroom — your daily evening news catch up show from Deccan Herald. Here are the top news of November 3, 2020: Some unruly elements threw onions at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar when he was canvassing for his party nominees in Madhubani district on Tuesday. This was arguably the first-of-its-kind incident, where onions were hurled at Nitish while he was addressing the gathering, soliciting support for the NDA candidates. “Aur phenko. Jitna mann ho, utna phenko. (Throw more....as much as you like),” Nitish told the angry youths, and at the same time asked his security men, who, by then, had encircled him as security cover,to move aside and let him have a direct contact with the unruly mob------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In what could escalate the tensions between the BJP-led NDA government and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the Centre has put a spanner in the shifting of the Mumbai Metro car shed from Aarey forest of Kanjurmarg. The Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has written to Maharashtra’s chief secretary Sanjay Kumar asking the MVA government not to work at the Kanjurmarg site as it is against the interest of the Government of Ind... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gunmen opened fire on people enjoying a last night out at Vienna's cafes and restaurants before a coronavirus lockdown Monday in what authorities said was a terrorist attack that left at least two dead — including one of the assailants — and 15 wounded. “We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,” Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said hours after the gunfire erupted. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday alleged they have "looted" Bihar, and claimed that people have decided to vote them out of power. Addressing a poll rally Katihar, the former Congress president criticised the NDA government over demonetisation, the migrant crisis, GST, handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the three new farm laws. He said neither Modi nor Kumar did anything to help migrant labourers when they were walking thousands of kilometres to return homes during the coronavirus lockdown. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nearly half of Indians have primarily depended upon borrowed money to run their households during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report. With job losses and pay cuts across industries, the lower middle-income group has been affected severely and the pandemic has led to a shift in perspective towards loans and borrowing preferences, said the report by Home Credit India, a local arm of the international consumer finance provider with operations spanning over Europe and Asia. The report, based on a survey, showed that 46 per cent respondents borrowed money primarily to run their households. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- India, the United States, Japan and Australia began their largest joint naval exercises in over a decade on Tuesday, Indian government sources said, seen as part of efforts to balance China's vast military and economic power in the region. The annual "Malabar" wargames that India holds with the United States and Japan have been expanded to include Australia this year to cover all members of the Quad, an informal group of the four largest democracies in the Indo-Pacific. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: DHNS/ PTI ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is it today, From the Newsroom.

03-11-2020||National||India urges Gulf nations to facilitate return of Indian workers willing to resume work||India on Tuesday urged the Gulf countries to facilitate the return of Indian workers and professionals who are now eager to resume their work following the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions. The issue figured at a virtual meeting External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a leading regional organisation comprising almost all Arab countries. In the meeting, Jaishankar assured the Gulf nations on continuing the supply of food, medicines and essential items from India. The Ministry of External Affairs said Jaishankar thanked the GCC countries for taking care of the large Indian diaspora during the Covid-19 pandemic. "The External Affairs Minister mentioned that a large number of Indian workers and professionals are now eager to return to the GCC countries to resume their work. "He urged the GCC leadership to facilitate their return through sustainable travel bubble arrangements with India," the MEA said. Thousands of Indians had returned home from the Gulf region in the last few months following the coronavirus pandemic. The MEA said the leaders also exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual concern. While the Indian delegation was led by Jaishankar, the GCC was represented by Secretary-General of GCC Nayef Falah M Al-Hajraf, Foreign Minister of Bahrain Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani and Foreign Minister of UAE Anwar bin Mohammed Gargash. Senior representatives from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar also participated in the meeting. "They agreed that the India-GCC partnership in political, economic and other domains would be further strengthened. The GCC welcomed India’s inclusion in the UNSC as a non-permanent member from January 2021," the MEA said. "Both sides affirmed their commitment to reform multilateral institutions to reflect the realities of the 21st century and to work together to address contemporary challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, sustainable development and terrorism," it added. In a series of tweets, Jaishankar said that continuing the flow of food, medicines and essential items were assured to the Gulf region. The MEA said Jaishankar also apprised the GCC leaders about the progress made by India in vaccine development as well as in the development and manufacturing of diagnostic and other equipment related to Covid-19. "Both sides reaffirmed that they will continue to work together to tackle Covid-19 situation," it said. Jaishankar also apprised the GCC leaders of the improving situation in India, both on the health and the economic side. He hoped for an early return to trade normalcy between India and the GCC. India had ensured that the supply chains from India to the Gulf were not disrupted despite the lockdowns during the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-urges-gulf-nations-to-facilitate-return-of-indian-workers-willing-to-resume-work-911001.html
03-11-2020||National||Monsoon Mission: Investment of Rs 1,000 crore gives a return of more than Rs 50,000 crore||An investment of nearly Rs 1,000 crore on the National Monsoon Mission gives an economic benefit of more than Rs 50,000 crore because of the economic benefits that farmers and fishermen accrued in five years, suggests new analysis by an economic think tank. Quantifying the economic gains of the mission, the report by the National Centre for Applied Economic Research, Delhi observed that an investment of Rs 990 crore fetched economic benefits worth Rs 50,447 crore – a jump of 50 times. The benefits were estimated with inputs from two lakh farmers, livestock owners and fishermen out of which 6000 plus were interviewed face to face while 1.94 lakhs gave their inputs through an automated telephonic system. The assessment is released months before the launch of the third phase of the National Monsoon Mission for which the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences would seek funding more than what was spent on the ongoing phase of the mission. One of the aims of the next phase is to upgrade the supercomputing facility from the existing level of 10 petaflops to 40 petaflops (one petaflop is one quadrillion floating-point operations per second) for the purpose of giving out the accurate weather forecast at the district and block level. “We do have the option of third party assessment of our programme and decided to review the monsoon mission to find out how it helped the farmers and fishermen,” M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences told DH. The NCAER report was released by the Union Science and Technology minister Harsh Vardhan here on Tuesday. It showed that 80% of the farmers and 83% of livestock owners who received information on natural calamities reported having reduced losses occurring due to them.   Almost 98% of farmers and 76% of livestock owners made modifications to at least one of the critical practices based on the weather advisories and had income gain. Similarly, 95% of the fishermen avoided empty trips by following ocean service advisories. Most of them received timely information on cyclones and floods and at least 86% of them were able to minimise their losses. “The total economic benefits to the agricultural households (farmers and livestock owners taken together) for a five year period works out to be Rs 48,056 crore whereas it is Rs 2391 crore for fishermen,” said Poonam Munjal, NCAER economist and one of the coauthors of the report. “With our programme, we can reach out to 43 million farmers at the moment. Our aim is to reach out to more than 93 million farmers,” said Vardhan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/monsoon-mission-investment-of-rs-1000-crore-gives-a-return-of-more-than-rs-50000-crore-911004.html

Captain Gautam Mubayi, along with more than 100 brave soldiers, laid down their lives in the battle and their efforts were honoured with a total of five Maha Vir Chakra, three Vir Chakra, 13 Sena Medal and 11 Chief of Army Staff commendation, the spokesman said. He said senior officers of the Bhimber Gali Brigade led their men in paying homage to the soldiers who laid down their lives for the country. O P Hill provided a foothold to Pakistan to launch further operations towards the Mendhar sector after they occupied it at the first opportunity of finding it vacant, the spokesman said. He said Pakistanis referred to this complex as 'Che-e-Nar'. The Bhimber Gali Brigade of the Indian Army was assigned the task of capturing the feature and throw out Pakistani troops, the spokesman said. After an intense battle, O P Hill was captured on November 2-3, 1965, the spokesman said. He said the troops relentlessly fought with extraordinary bravery and stubborn resolve to dislodge the enemy. The battle remains one of the finest ever fought, the spokesman said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-pays-tributes-to-its-personnel-for-capturing-op-hill-in-poonch-from-pakistan-in-1965-war-911010.html
03-11-2020||National Politics||Bypolls: Voting underway in 54 assembly seats across 10 states, strict Covid-19 norms in place||Voting was underway on Tuesday for by-elections to 54 assembly constituencies spread across 10 states, including 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh where the BJP is locked in a keen contest with the Congress to save its government. All Covid-19 guidelines were in place as polling began with election staff in personal protective equipment (PPE) suits, more polling booths to prevent overcrowding, thermal screening, sanitisers and masks and gloves for voters as well as markings to ensure social distancing, officials said. Voting started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm, except in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Nagaland. The number of people allowed in a polling booth has been restricted. The last hour has been reserved for voters who have tested positive for Covid-19, officials said. The votes will be counted on November 10.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to vote in large numbers. "Today, there are bypolls taking place in various places across India. I urge those voting in these seats to vote in large numbers and strengthen the festival of democracy," he said in a tweet. BJP president J P Nadda also urged voters to come out in large numbers to exercise their franchise. Uttar Pradesh and Haryana Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar echoed them in their appeal to voters. In Uttar Pradesh, over 18 per cent of votes were cast till 11 am in the bypolls to seven Assembly seats. Haryana also witnessed low voter turnout in the initial hours. The bypolls in Uttar Pradesh are the first electoral test for the Azad Samaj Party, which evolved from Chandrashekhar Azad’s Bhim Army that has fielded Mohammed Yameed from Bulandshahr. The seven assembly seats include Naugaon Sadat, which fell vacant after the death of cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan who had tested positive for Covid-19. The BJP has fielded his wife Sangeeta Chauhan. The other significant seat is Bangarmau (Unnao), which fell vacant after Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted in a rape case. In Haryana, 1.8 lakh voters are eligible to decide the fate of 14 candidates, including wrestler and BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt, in Baroda. The seat fell vacant in April after the demise of Congress’s three-time legislator MLA Shri Krishan Hooda. Madhya Pradesh All eyes are on Madhya Pradesh where the BJP, which has 107 MLAs in the assembly with an effective strength of 229, needs at least eight more MLAs for a simple majority. The stakes are high for the Congress, too, as it had sitting MLAs in 27 of the 28 seats going to the polls. Twenty-five resigned early this year and joined the BJP after a rebellion by Jyotiraditya Scindia, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath government. They are now contesting as BJP candidates. In the three other seats, the by-election was necessitated following the deaths of the sitting legislators. Twelve state ministers are among the 355 candidates contesting in the central India state, where bypolls are being held for so many seats in one go for the first time. In most seats, there is a direct fight between the BJP and Congress. In Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, the saffron party is fielding 31 candidates who had won from a Congress ticket but switched sides and resigned, necessitating the bypolls. Gujarat In Gujarat, bypolls are being held in eight seats after Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls in June. Five of them later joined the BJP and are contesting again. Assembly bypolls are also underway in Chhattisgarh (one),  Nagaland (two), Jharkhand (two), Karnataka (two), Nagaland (two), Odisha (two) and Telangana (one). Karnataka In Karnataka, voting is underway in Rajarajeshwari (RR) Nagar in Bengaluru Urban district and Sira in Tumakuru district, where a total of 31 candidates are fighting. The death of Sira MLA B Satyanarayana, who was from the JD(S), and the resignation of RR Nagar Congress MLA Munirathna from the assembly, last year, led to the by-elections. The RR Nagar seat, part of the Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency represented by Congress state chief D K Shivakumar’s brother D K Suresh, is a prestigious issue for both the Congress and the BJP. The BJP has fielded former Congress MLA Munirathna while the Congress has put forward H Kusuma, wife of the late IAS officer D K Ravi. The JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy. The BJP had earlier held this constituency, which Munirathna had won as a Congress MLA. Chhatisgarh In Chhattisgarh, the death of former chief minister and JCC(J) legislator Ajit Jogi necessitated the by-election in the Marwahi assembly seat. Telangana Over 20 candidates are in the fray in the state’s Dubbak assembly constituency but the main contest is among the TRS, BJP and the Congress. The by-election is necessitated by the death of sitting TRS MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy due to health problems in August this year. The TRS has fielded his widow Solipeta Sujatha. Jharkhand Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren's home turf Dumka is seeing a contest between his younger brother Basant Soren and former cabinet minister Lois Marandi of the BJP. It is expected to be a straight fight between BJP's Yogeshwar Mahato and Anup Singh of the Congress in Bermo seat in Bokaro district. Odisha In Odisha, the BJD and the BJP are fighting for the Tirtol and Balasore seats won by the two parties, respectively, in the 2019 assembly elections. Nagaland In the northeast state, eight candidates are in contesting the by-election to two Assembly seats -- three from the Southern Angami-1 seat and five from Pungro-Kiphire constituency. The Southern Angami-I seat fell vacant following the death of Assembly speaker Vikho-o Yhoshu last December. The Pungro-Kiphire seat was declared vacant following the death of sitting opposition Naga Peoples Front MLA, T. Torechu. Voting started at 6 am in these seats and will end at 4 pm.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bypolls-voting-underway-in-54-assembly-seats-across-10-states-strict-covid-19-norms-in-place-910683.html

The polling started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm, officials said.           Around 1.81 lakh eligible voters will decide the fate of 14 candidates, including Olympian wrestler and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominee Yogeshwar Dutt, in the fray for the bypoll. The Baroda seat fell vacant in April after the demise of Congress MLA Krishan Hooda, who had won the seat in the 2009, 2014 and 2019 Assembly polls. A total of 280 polling booths have been set up, of which 151 have been categorised as "vulnerable". Security personnel, including three companies of paramilitary force, have been deployed to ensure a peaceful bypoll, the officials said. Voters are being screened through thermal scanners at polling booths in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Masks and gloves are also being given to voters and they have been asked to maintain physical distancing at the polling stations. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar appealed to Baroda voters to ensure maximum participation in the voting process. "In democracy, each vote is valuable and your one vote is also valuable. I appeal to all of you to participate in the 'utsav' of democracy with your family in large numbers and cast votes,” Khattar tweeted. Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, in a tweet, also urged voters to exercise their franchise by following Covid-19 related safety precautions. BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt cast his vote in the morning. Before exercising his franchise, the wrestler-turned-politician performed 'puja' at his academy. Talking to reporters, Olympian wrestler Dutt appealed to people to cast their votes and said that his objective was to serve people. Elders, women and youth started coming to polling booths after voting began in the morning. The ruling BJP has fielded wrestler-turned-politician Dutt, who is also backed by saffron ally JJP. The opposition Congress has fielded former Sonipat Zila Parishad member Indu Raj Narwal and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has put its money on Joginder Malik. There are a total 1,80,529 voters, including service voters. Out of which, 99,726 are men, 80,801 women and two transgenders, the officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/polling-underway-for-baroda-bypoll-khattar-hooda-appeal-to-people-to-vote-in-large-numbers-910694.html

The Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has written to Maharashtra’s chief secretary Sanjay Kumar asking the MVA government not to work at the Kanjurmarg site as it is against the interest of the Government of India. Last month, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had scrapped the Mumbai Metro car shed Line 3 at the Aarey Milk Colony and shifted it to Kanjurmarg. Both the Centre and Maharashtra government are claiming ownership of the piece of 102-acre land in Kanjurmarg. DPIIT Secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra in the letter stated that the decision of the Collector of Mumbai Suburban district and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has caused loss to the Centre. “I would request you to take necessary steps and to direct the collector to withdraw the orders passed in this regard in order to protect the interests of the Government of India,” he has stated. The Salt Commissioner, that reports to the DPIIT, is claiming the ownership of the land. However, the Maharashtra government has been claiming that the land is free of any dispute. With this development, the tussle between the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government and the Centre has escalated to a new level. “The land does not belong to the Government of India, it belongs to the Maharashtra Government,” said state’s Environment, Tourism and Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray. Senior Shiv Sena leader and Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar stated that it’s a conspiracy against the MVA government. “An affidavit was filed in Bombay High Court during the tenure of the previous BJP-led government saying that the Kanjurmarg land belongs to the State Government,” she said. NCP chief spokesperson and Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said that way back in 2002 the Centre had transferred large tracts of salt-pan lands to the State government.  “First the BJP said it belonged to private owners, now they say it belongs to the Central government. The BJP is only creating hurdles in the execution of the Mumbai Metro car shed… It’s the BJP’s conspiracy to stop the Metro project,” Malik said. State Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant said that it is nothing but the Centre is creating hurdles for the project. The BJP had targeted the MVA government on the issue. “The MVA government first put development projects in a limbo, then stop them and later misguide people…The government is telling lies,” BJP leader Kirit Somaiya claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/war-between-maharashtra-government-and-centre-intensifies-910829.html
03-11-2020||National Politics||BJP trying to halt Metro car shed work through Centre: Nawab Malik||The Centre has written to Maharashtra chief secretary saying the Kanjurmarg Metro car shed land belongs to it, state minister Nawab Malik said on Tuesday and accused the BJP of conspiring to halt the project work through the Union government. However, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government was creating a "delusion" about its functioning and slowing down major infrastructure projects. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last month announced the scrapping of the Aarey Metro car shed. He said the project will now be shifted to government land in Kanjurmarg and no cost will be incurred for the purpose. Earlier, the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led state government had finalised land in the Aarey Colony, Mumbai's green lung, for the car shed. Malik said the letter sent by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to state Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar on the issue contends the land has been allotted for the car shed project in a "wrong manner". Malik said the salt pan land concerned belongs to the state and the project will take shape on that site only. "Initially, people in the BJP said it is a private land. Now, the Centre is saying (in the letter) that the saltpan land belongs to it," he said. "Seeing all this, it seems the BJP people want to lay roadblocks in the Metro works," the NCP national spokesperson said in a video message. "The Kanjurmarg car shed will merge two lines of Mumbai, a car shed that will benefit 20 lakh people. It is clear now that the BJP has started conspiring on how to stop it through the Centre," he alleged. Malik also said that as per his information, the Centre had in 2002 transferred several salt pan lands to the state government. "It is our governments land...The previous government had affirmed it. The car shed will come up there only," the minister said. Talking to reporters, NCP's Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule also insisted that the land belongs to Maharashtra. "It is unfortunate. The Centre is intervening in the development of Maharashtra. This is an injustice to Maharashtra," she alleged. However, BJP MLA Shelar in a statement questioned the state government's intention of planning to shift the Metro-3 car shed to the Kanjurmarg land, which is a salt pan and comes under the salt commissioner. There is no information in the public domain that the state has received this piece of land from the department concerned for construction of Metro-3 car shed, he said. "Is there any hidden agenda of the state on salt pans in the name of shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg? It looks like this government is creating a delusion about its functioning and, in fact, slowing down the major infrastructure projects," Shelar alleged. The former state minister also alleged that the Shiv Sena-led MVA government has not yet given clear answers on whether a fresh development plan for the Kanjurmarg land has been prepared, or if the technical study has been completed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-trying-to-halt-metro-car-shed-work-through-centre-nawab-malik-910856.html
03-11-2020||National Politics||Opposition calls Punjab CM Amarinder Singh's move to lead 'dharna' in Delhi as 'drama, photo op'||Punjab opposition parties SAD, BJP and AAP on Tuesday dubbed the decision of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to lead a relay 'dharna' in Delhi as “drama and photo op”. Earlier in the day, Amarinder said he will lead a relay 'dharna' of Congress MLAs at Delhi's Rajghat on Wednesday following President Ram Nath Kovind's refusal to meet a delegation led by him over the Centre's farm laws. The CM also said the protest in Delhi will also highlight the power crisis and scarcity of essential supplies in the state due to the suspension of goods trains by the Centre. Reacting to the CM's decision, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, in a statement, asked Amarinder not to indulge in “sham” relay 'dharnas' in Delhi but start an indefinite hunger strike at Rajghat to demand immediate repeal of the central agriculture laws. Asking the CM if he was really serious about the protest or was just playing to the gallery, the SAD chief said “if the purpose is to demand repeal of the agriculture laws and ensuring assured government purchase of food grains as per minimum support price (MSP), then the chief minister should lead an indefinite hunger strike and not give in till the demands of the farming community are accepted in toto”. Stating that the chief minister was, however, unlikely to take up this proposal as he did not want to take up cudgels against the BJP-led central government, Sukhbir said “this is the reason why Amarinder Singh is indulging in one 'tamasha' after another instead of doing anything concrete to find a solution to the ongoing crisis being faced by the farming community as well as trade and industry.” Instead of approaching the Centre and demanding the immediate restart of goods trains to Punjab, the CM wants to waste time in photo ops, he claimed. The SAD chief also asked the chief minister why he had “misled” the legislators and unilaterally announced the November 4 appointment with the President when the latter had not even given the same. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab unit chief and MP Bhagwant Mann said the CM was, instead of going to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issues of “black laws”, heading to Rajghat for “enacting another drama” in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue to “mislead” the people of Punjab, especially the farmers, saying it was a “well thought-out ploy to derail the peasant struggle.” He also dubbed the CM as a “great dramatist”. BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh alleged that the CM was responsible for “creating anarchic situation” in the state by “fomenting discontent” among farmers and “misleading” them on the facts of the three agriculture bills. While condemning the decision of a relay 'dharna' in Delhi, Chugh said the CM was leading the state to “anarchy by subverting” the democratic norms.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/opposition-calls-punjab-cm-amarinder-singhs-move-to-lead-dharna-in-delhi-as-drama-photo-op-910933.html

Taking to Twitter, Poonawala said that he has filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India via his lawyer Deepali Dwivedi. There was no immediate word from the EC on the complaint. Poonawalla, who is widely known as a Congress sympathiser, filed the complaint, taking objection to Modi's remarks that the "friends" of the votaries of 'jungle raj' don't want the people of Bihar to chant "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" and "Jai Shri Ram". "We have in front of us people who start running temperature at hearing these chants. The friends of 'jungle raj' don't want people of this land who worship 'chhathi maiya' to hail 'Bharat Mata' or chant 'Jai Shri Ram'," Modi told a rally in Saharsa on Tuesday. Modi was apparently responding to RJD's ally in Jharkhand, Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who recently told an election rally that he goes insane (dimag kharab ho jata hai) when he hears "Bharat Mata Ki Jai" and "Jai Shri Ram".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tehseen-poonawalla-files-complaint-with-ec-over-pms-bihar-poll-rally-speech-910934.html
03-11-2020||National Politics||PM Narendra Modi takes a dig at Congress as BJP grows in strength in Rajya Sabha||As BJP grew in strength in Rajya Sabha, shoring its number to 92 as against 38 of Congress after the November 2 elections for the Upper House, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took a swipe at the main Opposition party saying public anger has reduced the party to such a sorry state that it has been left with less than 100 MPs in both Houses of Parliament together. Congress currently has 51 members in Lok Sabha and 38 in Rajya Sabha, totalling 89, which is its lowest strength in Parliament so far. Of the 11 Rajya Sabha seats including 10 in Uttar Pradesh for which elections were being held, the BJP has won the nine, which has made the NDA cross the 100-mark in the Upper House, where it has many times struggled for support to get the key legislations passed.  NDA allies JDU has five seats while RPI-Athawale, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Mizo National Front (MNF), National People's Party (NPP), Naga People's Front (NPF), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) have one seat each in the Upper totalling seven seats. This gets the total of 104 seats for NDA, which is still short of seven seats for the halfway mark of 121 in the 242-member House. Besides these, polling will be held on December 1 for the lone vacant seat in Karnataka in December, which the ruling BJP will now easily win. 11 seats will fall vacant in 2021 and 68 in 2022 in many Rajya Sabha seats in Opposition-ruled states will fall vacant, from where the BJP could look forward to increasing its tally. It will still be two years for the next general elections in 2024 and hence BJP will have ample time to push its core agenda issues before that. Even now since the BJP has a state-level alliance with AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, which has nine MPs, which makes the job somewhat easier for it in Rajya Sabha with 113 MPs supporting it. Besides, there are friendly parties like BJD (09), TRS (07) with seven MPs and YSRCP (06). There has been a strong buzz that YSRCP may join the NDA during the next reshuffle of Union Cabinet. Congress has slipped from its dominant role in the Rajya Sabha and the over-all Opposition numbers are also not good in the House. While Congress lost two seats in the RS polls this time, SP lost three and the BSP one. Modi, who addressed his last election rallies in Bihar on Tuesday ripped into the Congress saying that the people are punishing the party for its "false promises of poverty eradication and farm loan waiver". "Public anger has reduced the party to such a sorry state that it has been left with less than 100 MPs in both Houses of Parliament together while in states like UP and Bihar, they have been relegated to the third, fourth or fifth position, and are piggybacking on other parties for survival," Modi said. Congress is the second-largest partner in the RJD-led alliance in Bihar and both parties have promised farm loan waiver during the ongoing state polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-narendra-modi-takes-a-dig-at-congress-as-bjp-grows-in-strength-in-rajya-sabha-910939.html
03-11-2020||National Politics||JD(U) submits memorandum to Election Commission against Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap||The ruling JD(U) on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission demanding registration of an FIR and cancellation of nominations of Tejashwi Yadav and his brother Tej Pratap Yadav for allegedly concealing information about some properties in their election affidavits. A JD(U) delegation led by state Information and Public Relations Department (IPRD) minister Neeraj Kumar met Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), H R Srinivasa and submitted a memorandum to him which was addressed to the Election Commission of India. Kumar said that the CEO assured them that he would communicate the Commission about the information furnished by them in the memorandum for necessary action. The JD(U) team also annexed documentary proofs in support of the charges against the two sons of Lalu Prasad, who are contesting assembly election from Raghopur and Hasanpur constituency respectively. They furnished details of the concealed properties with there locations. The party has demanded "institution of an FIR against Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav besides cancelling their nominations as non-disclosure of assets amounts to an undue influence and corrupt practice under Section A 123(2) of the Representation of Peoples Act," he said. Besides, failure to furnish information in the affidavit is a penal offence under section 125A of the RPA which prescribes a penalty of maximum six months or fine or both, he said. "Non-disclosure of information has also been categorized as a corrupt practice amounting to disqualification under Section 8A which, means that candidates who do not disclose certain information can be disqualified", Kumar said. "It's a 'political fraud'," the JD(U) leader said taking a swipe at Tejashwi and his brother. The delegation comprised of party's national returning officer Anil Hegde, national general secretary Afaque Ahmad Khan, national secretary Sanjay Verma, state unit general secretaries Navin Kumar Arya, Suheli Mehta and spokesman Arvind Nishad. RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari dismissed the allegations and said it reflected the desperation of the ruling party in the face of a certain defeat in the onging polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/jdu-submits-memorandum-to-election-commission-against-tejashwi-yadav-tej-pratap-910954.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||49% jump in stubble burning cases in Punjab this paddy season, says data||Punjab has witnessed 49 per cent more stubble burning incidents from September 21 to November 2 as compared to the corresponding period last year, according to official data. The overall count of incidents of stubble burning in the state during this paddy season so far -- from September 21 to November 2 -- has reached 36,755 as against 24,726 in 2019, according to the data of the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. The state had seen 29,156 and 24,428 incidents of paddy residue in 2017 and 2018 respectively, it said. Many farmers in the northern state continue to set paddy straw on fire despite a ban on the practice. Punjab on Monday reported 3,590 incidents of farm fires with the highest number of such incidents recorded in Sangrur district at 696, as per the data. Sangrur is also the epicentre of the farmers' protest over the central government's new farm laws. Bathinda, Ferozepur, Mansa and Patiala districts reported 425, 307, 301 and 287 stubble burning incidents, respectively. Small farmers have been maintaining that it is economically unviable for them to buy farm machinery like happy seeders, rotavators and super straw management systems on combine harvesters to manage crop residue. Farmers are demanding Rs 200 per quintal of bonus on paddy and Rs 6,000 per acre for stubble management. The Punjab government has been seeking from the Centre Rs 100 per quintal as compensation to enable farmers to manage paddy straw without burning it. Punjab alone generates 20 million tonnes of paddy stubble annually. Meanwhile, Punjab Pollution Control Board chairman A S Marwaha said rather than pointing at Punjab for pollution in the national capital, the Delhi authorities should check internal sources of pollution. The chairman, in a statement here, said the air quality index (AQI) is 'satisfactory’ to ‘moderate' in Punjab, while in Delhi it is 'very poor'. He questioned how a state with better AQI could create pollution in another state. Marwaha said cities like Panipat, Sonepat, Jind and Karnal in Haryana have 'poor' AQI as compared to Punjab's Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Patiala. He said the contribution of stubble fire in Punjab could not be the major contributing factor in the deteriorating air quality of NCR, especially Delhi. Rather, he said, it is due to the internal polluting sources of the national capital region and climatic conditions that develop during the month of October till March every year, which deteriorate the atmosphere in Delhi. Marwaha added that if stubble burning would have been the major reason for deteriorating air quality, the ambient air quality of Punjab would have also shown similar trends.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/49-jump-in-stubble-burning-cases-in-punjab-this-paddy-season-says-data-910599.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Cold wave? Delhi's minimum temperature drops to 10 degrees Celsius||As the minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 10 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest so far, on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it will declare a cold wave in the city if the situation persists for another day. The weather department also said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years. “The trend of below normal minimum temperature continues. A similar situation is expected to prevail for another four to five days,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting center of IMD, said. For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. “The criteria for Tuesday has been met. We will declare a cold wave in Delhi if the situation persists on Wednesday,” Srivastava said. He said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years. Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14.8 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials. The senior IMD scientist said the minimum temperature is expected to be recorded in single digits in the next three to four days. Delhi has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover, he said. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and  radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Also, there has been snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh in the last three to four days, so cold winds from that region have started affecting Delhi's weather, he said. On Monday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.  Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cold-wave-delhis-minimum-temperature-drops-to-10-degrees-celsius-910662.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Uttar Pradesh records 8% polling till 9 am in byelections||About eight per cent votes were cast in the first two hours as voting for the bypolls to seven assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh began on Tuesday amid the coronavirus pandemic. The polling started at 7 am amid tight security and special arrangements for Covid-19. Till 9 am, 7.87 per cent voters had exercised their franchise, Ramesh Chandra Rai, joint chief electoral officer of UP, said. The voting percentage in various assembly constituencies till 9 am was 8.27 per cent in Bangarmau, 7.80 per cent in Bulandshahr, 10.00 per cent in Deoria, 5.00 per cent in Ghatampur, 7.50 per cent in Malhani, 8.50 per cent in Naugaon Sadat and 8.00 per cent in Tundla. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday appealed to voters to participate in the "mega festival of democracy". "Voting in the bypolls to seven assembly seats in UP has begun. All the voters must participate in the mega festival of democracy. Everyone should exercise caution and discharge the duty of casting vote," he said in a tweet in Hindi. "Democracy will win, while coronavirus will be defeated," the CM added. The Samajwadi Party also urged voters to come out of their homes and vote in large numbers. "Those in power and responsible for worried farmers, insecure women power, poor health facilities, jobless labourers, collapsed law and order should be given a reply during the ongoing bypolls to UP Legislative Assembly. Come out of houses, and vote," the SP said in a tweet in Hindi. The electoral fortune of 88 candidates, including nine women, will be decided by 24.34 lakh voters, including 13.03 lakh male voters on Tuesday. This is the first democratic exercise to be held in the state post Covid-19 pandemic when the voters will be eligible to exercise their franchise at 3,655 polling booths spread over 1,754 polling centres. The seats are Tundla, Ghatampur,  Naugaon Sadat, Bulandshahr, Bangarmau, Deoria and Malhani. Six of these seats were held by the BJP. Malhani seat was with the Samajwadi Party. "All preparations to ensure a free, fair and peaceful polling keeping in mind coronavirus pandemic have been made. Voters will have to adhere to the Covid-19 protocol and maintain safe distance among themselves while casting votes," Chief Electoral Officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said. Adequate security forces have been deployed to maintain peace and ensure orderly polling at the booths, including 371 "critical" booths. Counting of votes will take place on November 10. The Yogi Adityanath government has been facing opposition flak over the law and order situation in the state, particularly after the Hathras and Balrampur rape and murder cases. Naugaon Sadat seat fell vacant after the death of cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan. The BJP has fielded his wife Sangeeta Chauhan for the bypoll hoping to encash sympathy votes. In Ghatampur (Kanpur), the bypoll was necessitated due to the death of sitting MLA and cabinet minister Kamal Rani Varun, while in Tundla (Firozabad), MLA S P Singh Baghel was elected to Lok Sabha. Both Chetan Chauhan and Kamal Rani Varun had succumbed to Covid-19. Bangarmau (Unnao) seat fell vacant following the conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar in a rape case. He had won on a BJP ticket but the party dumped him following a hue and cry after his conviction. The seats of Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani will go to bypolls due to the demise of sitting MLAs Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejay Singh and Parasnath Yadav (SP). Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad's Azad Samaj Party is testing its electoral popularity in Bulandshahr by fielding Md Yameen in the run up to the 2022 UP assembly polls when the party would look forward to consolidating its hold among the Dalits. While Bulandshahr has the highest number of 18 candidates, Ghatampur has the lowest number of six contestants. Sixteen candidates are in the fray in Malhani (Jaunpur), 14 each in Naugawan Sadat (Amroha) and Deoria, 10 each in Bangarmau (Unnao) and Tundla (Firozabad). UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said in course of campaign that the public has decided to teach the ruling BJP a lesson. "This will be visible in the bypolls. These outcome of these bypolls will mark the commencement of the decline of the BJP and resurgence of the Congress," he had said while slamming the state government over the law and order situation.         Bahujan Samaj Party supremo has appealed to people to vote for her party candidates and send a political message to rivals, while SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has said that these bypolls should be taken seriously. "The results of the bypolls will determine the path of UP politics. Voters have to choose between development and destruction," Yadav had said. Facing opposition criticism over the law and order situation in the state, Chief Minister Adityanath has said that his government will come out with a law to deal with "love jihad" and used the Hindu funeral chant "Ram Naam Satya Hai" to threaten those who don't respect their daughters and sisters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-records-8-polling-till-9-am-in-byelections-910666.html

03-11-2020||North and Central||Posters not to be pasted outside homes of Covid-19 positive persons: AAP govt tells Delhi High Court||The AAP government on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court that it has instructed all its officials not to paste posters outside homes of Covid-19 positive persons or those in home isolation and those pasted have been ordered to be removed. The Delhi government, represented by its additional standing counsel Satyakam, also told the high court that its officials have also not been allowed to share details of Covid-19 positive persons with their neighbours, resident welfare associations or Whatsapp groups. In view of the submission made by the government, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad disposed of the PIL seeking framing of guidelines to do away with pasting posters outside homes of Covid-19 positive persons or those in home isolation.  The bench was of the view that pursuant to steps taken by the Delhi government the issue raised in the plea, by lawyer Kush Kalra, need not be monitored any longer.  Kalra, in his plea through advocate Kush Sharma, had contended that freely circulating to RWAs and on Whatsapp groups, the names of persons who tested positive for Covid-19 was "leading to stigmatisation and drawing of unnecessary attention". The petition had stated that Covid-19 positive persons "ought to be given privacy to cope with and recover from the illness in peace and away from prying eyes". "Rather they are being made the centre of public attention..,"it had said. It had also claimed that this has resulted in persons "shying away and deliberately choosing not to test themselves" to shield themselves from the "public embarrassment and stigmatisation" which is also caused by pasting posters outside homes of Covid-19 positive patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/posters-not-to-be-pasted-outside-homes-of-covid-19-positive-persons-aap-govt-tells-delhi-high-court-910696.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality turns 'very poor' after marginal improvement||The national capital's air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement over the last 24 hours.   Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant night-time conditions led to accumulation of pollutants. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 332 at 10 am. The 24-hour average (AQI) was 293, which falls in the "poor" category. It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi's pollution.  An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a “significantly” large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution was 16 per cent on Monday. It had soared to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. Stubble burning accounted for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday. Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometers per hour on Tuesday.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 8,000 meter square per second on Tuesday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. In a bid to control pollution, the Delhi government has also said that only “green firecrackers” can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital in accordance with a 2018 Supreme Court order. 'Green crackers' are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide. Fireworks can take place between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab etc. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The National Green Tribunal has also issued notice to the Centre, Central Pollution Control Board, and the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, asking if crackers could be banned between November 7 and November 30 in the interest of public health and environment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-turns-very-poor-after-marginal-improvement-910711.html

Dilip Mistry extracted the 7.44 carat stone from a mine in Jaruapur, while Lakhan Yadav mined a 14.98 carat one in Krishna Kalyanpur area, diamond inspector Anupam Singh said. The stones were deposited at the diamond office on Monday and will be auctioned off, the official said, adding that the labourers would get the proceeds after a deduction of 12.5 per cent royalty. While the exact value of the diamonds will be decided by the authorities, the stone weighing 7.44 carat will fetch around Rs 30 lakh and the bigger one will fetch double the amount, he said. Meanwhile, both labourers were thrilled about their discovery. For Yadav, who is a small farmer with a two-acre land, this is a first diamond extraction. "I will use the money from the proceeds to educate my children," he said. Mistry said, "I am a part of a group of four persons and we have been working hard to extract diamonds on our private land for the last six months.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said encroachment on water bodies is a serious issue and this needs attention of the authorities at the state level and special plan and drive is necessary. “It is high time that the issue is seriously addressed. We also find that the authorities are stuck up in cumbersome procedure of revenue law without invoking prompt and summary procedure of environmental law,” the bench also comprising Justice S K Singh said. The NGT said there is no monitoring at higher level and a conscious decision needs to be taken in this regard at higher levels of the administration and if found necessary, powers need to be given to the Forest Department or the District Magistrate or any suitable department which can promptly retrieve the water bodies. “In view of the above and having regard to the significance of the issue and failure of the authorities so far in performing their public trust obligation, we direct the Chief Secretary, UP to hold a meeting with all District Magistrates by video conferencing within one month from today to address the issue and to prepare a uniform action plan applicable throughout State of UP for identification and protection of water bodies,” the bench said. The NGT said the action taken by state pollution control board is neither adequate nor in right direction and it appears that the concerned officers are not conversant with the law of the land which is resulting in serious damage to the environment. “Water bodies are the life line of the environment for ground water recharge, storage of water for different purposes, for micro climate, aesthetics, etc,” it said. The tribunal also asked the Monitoring Committee headed by Justice SVS Rathore, former Judge of the Allahabad High Court, to monitor compliance and furnish its independent report in the matter by e-mail. The direction came after perusing a report filed by District Magistrate of Ghaziabad stating that large number of water bodies were encroached.  “Percentage of encroached water bodies is around 72.90 per cent  (183 water bodies). Action has been initiated under Section 67 of the UP Revenue Code, 2006. Only 49 out of 261 water bodies are free from encroachment in Ghaziabad District,” the report said. The green panel was hearing a plea filed by Ghaziabad resident Sushil Raghav alleging that water bodies are being diverted in Ghaziabad for industrial purposes in violation of law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ngt-directs-up-chief-secy-to-prepare-action-plan-for-protection-of-water-bodies-910731.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Avoid bursting firecrackers as much as possible this Diwali, Gopal Rai appeals to people||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday urged Delhiites to avoid bursting firecrackers as much as possible this Diwali in the interests of public health and environment. The minister launched an "anti-cracker" campaign and inspected various places to ensure that only "green" firecrackers are manufactured and sold in the city. "Only 'green' firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in Delhi this Diwali as per a Supreme Court order issued in 2018. However, I appeal to everyone to avoid bursting firecrackers as much as possible," Rai told reporters. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), all district magistrates and the Delhi Police have been asked to ensure that only "green" crackers are sold, Rai told reporters. Enforcement teams will also ensure that traders procure green firecrackers from authorised manufacturers. In 2018, the Supreme Court had banned the use of polluting firecrackers and allowed the sale of "green" firecrackers in a bid to control air pollution. The "green crackers" are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute was tasked with the job of developing "green crackers". But only a few varieties were available in the market last year due to licensing requirements. Earlier, the DPCC had said that people can burst firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab, he said. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only. "Only licensed traders can sell firecrackers compliant with PESO (Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation) prescribed standards. No e-commerce websites can accept any online orders," it had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/avoid-bursting-firecrackers-as-much-as-possible-this-diwali-gopal-rai-appeals-to-people-910733.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Madhya Pradesh bypolls: Congress, BJP supporters clash in Morena, 1 injured||Congress and BJP supporters clashed at a polling booth in Madhya Pradesh even as voting was underway for by-elections in 28 Assembly seats of the state on Tuesday, officials said. One person was injured in the clash, they said. A total of 26.86 per cent voters exercised their franchise till 12 pm on Tuesday, an election official said. BJP's Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress in March this year and joined the saffron party, cast his vote at a booth in Gwalior district. Former MP chief minister Kamal Nath and other senior Congress leaders, including Digvijaya Singh, were monitoring the polling from a control room set up at the state party office in Bhopal. In Morena district, Congress and BJP supporters clashed at Jatavara polling booth and an unidentified person fired a bullet during the incident, Superintendent of Police Anurag Sujania said. "A person was injured but it was not clear whether he received the injury due to the gunshot or was hit by a stick. It will be clear only after medical examination. The injured person was referred to the district hospital for treatment," the official said. Polling began in the 28 constituencies at 7 am with Covid-19 prevention protocols in place and will continue till 6 pm, an election official said. The last hour of voting will be for Covid-19 patients and people suspected to be suffering from the disease, he said. Authorities have set up 250 flying squads, 173 surveillance teams and 293 police check-posts to ensure smooth polling, he said. Altogether 355 candidates, including 12 ministers, are in the fray, the official said, adding around 33,000 security personnel have been deployed in 19 districts. There are 63.67 lakh voters in the 28 constituencies and 9361 polling booths, including 3038 booths placed under the critical category, he said. The by-elections in Madhya Pradesh were necessitated after 22 MLAs of the erstwhile Congress government switched over to the BJP in March this year, leading to the fall of Kamal Nath's 15-month-old government. Three other Congress MLAs followed the lead of Scindia and his supporters and joined the BJP. Another three seats in the Assembly are vacant due to the deaths of incumbent MLAs. Campaigning for the bypolls was marked by acrimonious exchanges between the main rivals BJP and Congress. It is for the first time in Madhya Pradesh that bypolls are being held in as many as 28 Assembly seats in the 230-member House in one go, an official said. Congress MLAs who quit from 25 seats are now in the fray as BJP candidates. One more Congress MLA resigned recently. The BJP currently has 107 MLAs, while the Congress has 87 legislators in the House.

Chauhan demanded that this type of "fake voting" should be stopped as it was "very dangerous" for democracy. "Fake voting is going on, but the administration is unable to understand this," she told reporters. "We are repeatedly saying this, but no one is listening to us." Chauhan suggested that the voting should be done only after removing face veil of the burqa so that the identity could be matched with the voter cards, adding that the process was justifiable. Chief Electoral Officer Ajay Kumar Shukla told PTI that he would look into the allegations. Naugaon Sadat in Amroha district seat fell vacant after the death of cabinet minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan. The BJP has fielded his wife Sangeeta Chauhan for the bypoll, hoping to cash in on the sympathy votes. There are as many as 14 candidates in the fray for the by-election. Thousands of people on Tuesday battled coronavirus fears and queued up outside polling booths across 10 states to vote in by-elections to 54 assembly constituencies, including seven in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-candidate-sangeeta-chauhan-alleges-fake-voting-in-naugaon-sadat-bypoll-910746.html

The department, headed by Cabinet minister Rajendra Pal Gautam, has warned of action against officers failing to comply with the order issued last month. The move comes after it was observed that some district officers were sending the status of their live location through text only and also, they were not sharing the location of their field visits. "District officers were directed to send their daily attendance, in morning and evening through live location via WhatsApp in a group created specifically for this purpose since October 5...," the DWCD said in a letter to all district officers. According to the department, the status of live location sent by various district officers have been analysed. "Hence, all district officers are directed to post their daily arrival and departure attendance through live location as well as field visit location, failing which it would be assumed that the officer is not attending to his or her duty, and further action would be initiated against the erring officers as per rules," it stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/send-live-location-through-whatsapp-daily-to-mark-attendance-delhi-govt-to-wcd-dist-officers-910776.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Farm laws: President Ram Nath Kovind declines meeting request, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh to lead dharna at Rajghat||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh will lead a sit-in protest at Rajghat on Wednesday to highlight the state’s “power crisis and critical essential supplies” situation amid the Centre’s alleged refusal to allow movement of goods trains due to farmers’ agitation. Punjab is bracing for massive power cuts after running out of coal stocks in the state completely as a result of the prolonged suspension of goods supply trains by the Railways. The chief minister’s announcement of the protest on Tuesday came after President Ram Nath Kovind turned down Singh’s request for a meeting along with the MLAs of the state to push for assent to the three laws passed by the Punjab assembly to negate the Modi government’s farm sector reforms. The farmers’ agitation and crippled coal supplies to power plants, but Singh accused the Centre of refusing to resume rail traffic despite farmers’ organisations agreeing to allow passage of trains carrying coal and fertilisers for the rabi sowing season. The chief minister said that Punjab had run out of coal, urea and DAP and other essential supplies due to Railways decision not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement. As the crisis resulted in complete shutdown of all power plants as well as curtailment of agricultural and vegetables supplies, the Chief Minister said, he had decided to hold a “symbolic relay dharna” at the Rajghat to bring the state’s grim situation to the Centre’s notice. Singh appealed to MLAs of all political parties to join in the ‘dharna’ in the state’s interest, which was facing a grim situation as the last of the private power plants will also shut down on Tuesday. GVK announced it will close down operations at 5 pm since it had run out of coal stocks, a Punjab government statement said adding that other public and private power plants in the state have shut down earlier. According to a government spokesperson, the daytime demand for power was about 5100-5200 MW and night demand about 3400 MW. Singh also accused Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal of refusing to meet a delegation of MPs from Punjab to discuss issues related to the state such as pending GST dues and suspension of railways.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farm-laws-president-ram-nath-kovind-declines-meeting-request-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-to-lead-dharna-at-rajghat-910781.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Aim of new land laws to change J&K's demography: PAGD||The recently floated People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), on Tuesday, alleged that the real objective behind the Center repealing the land laws in Jammu and Kashmir was to effect demographic change and disempower the people of the region. On Monday, J&K government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said the new land laws will not only afford protection to over 90% of the land in J&K from being alienated to outsiders but will also help revamp the agriculture sector, foster rapid industrialization, aid economic growth and create jobs. While reacting to Kansal’s assertions that the previous land laws were “anti-people”, the PAGD termed the previous laws the most "progressive, pro-people and pro-farmer" in the entire subcontinent. The PAGD is an alliance of seven parties - the National Conference (NC), PDP, CPI, CPM, People's Conference, People's Movement and Awami National Conference -- which was formed on October 15 to work towards restoring the special status of J&K which was revoked last August. “Jammu and Kashmir was first in the country to implement the concept of ‘land-to-tiller’ by enacting the Big Landed Estates Abolition Act, 1952 followed by the Agrarian Reforms Act,1976, restricting the landholding to twelve and half acres and ending the exploitative practice of ‘absentee landlordism’. Whosoever calls it archaic would be guilty of ignorance of the history of Jammu and Kashmir,” a spokesperson of the PAGD said in a statement. He said it is because of the timely land reforms in J&K that there are no starvation deaths, no farmer suicides and everyone in the region has fundamental necessities -- food, clothing and shelter. “The position that is now sought to be reversed by making massive assault on the land law regime,” he said. “How can alienation of the Land Act be termed as archaic when it prohibited transfer of land to a non-state subject thus protecting the interests of permanent residents of J&K and at the same time made a provision for transfer of land by mortgage to organisations like the Industrial Development Bank of India, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India to keep pace with industrial development?” asked the PAGD. The PAGD said the repealing of the Act now allows the land to be transferred to non-state subjects, “denuding the residents of J&K of their most precious rights". “The claimed protection of rights in agricultural land, it is stated, is mere eyewash as the amendment introduced in the Land Revenue Act provides for permission to sell the agricultural land almost at mere asking without difficulty,” he said. The PAGD claimed that the laws now introduced through amendments are not only against the people of Jammu and Kashmir but “undemocratic, unconstitutional and backward-looking with the only aim to disempower people and change the demography.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aim-of-new-land-laws-to-change-jks-demography-pagd-910785.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Uttar Pradesh assembly bypolls: Over 53% voters cast franchise, sealing fate of 88 candidates||An average of over 53 per cent voters exercised their franchise on Tuesday in the Uttar Pradesh assembly byelections for seven seats with 88 candidates in the fray. The polling, which began at a slow pace at 7 am amid tight security and adherence to anti-Covid precautions, picked up momentum as the day progressed and an overall 53.62 per cent of registered voters cast their votes. The polling concluded at 6 pm amid an allegation of bogus voting at three polling booths of Naugaon Sadat assembly constituency in Amroha district and over a six-hour-long poll boycott at a polling booth for Tundla seat in Firozabad district. A total of 50.59 per cent votes were cast in Bangarmau, 52.10 per cent in Bulandshahr, 51.05 per cent in Deoria, 49.42 per cent in Ghatampur, 56.65 per cent in Malhani, 61.50 per cent in Naugaon Sadat and 54 per cent in Tundla, said Joint Chief Electoral Officer Ramesh Chand Rai after the conclusion of polling. Counting of votes will be undertaken on November 10. Six of these seven seats were held by the Bharatiya Janata Party, while the Malhani seat in Jaunpur district was held by the Samajwadi Party. The voting began in the morning with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urging voters to participate in the "mega festival of democracy" in large numbers. "Everyone should exercise caution and discharge the duty of casting vote," Adityanath tweeted earlier in the day. "Democracy will win, coronavirus will lose," he said. The SP also appealed to voters to vote in large numbers. "Those in power and responsible for farmers' worries, women's insecurity, poor health facilities, labourers’ joblessness and collapsed law and order should be given a reply in today's assembly bypolls," it tweeted. Earlier in the day amid the ongoing polling, Chief Electoral Officer Ajay Kumar Shukla said, "All preparations to ensure a free, fair and peaceful polling, keeping in mind the coronavirus pandemic, have been made." "Voters will have to follow the anti-Covid protocol and maintain safe distance among themselves while casting votes," he added. The voting began with the deployment of "adequate" number security personnel at polling booths, including 371 "critical" ones. Amid the ongoing polling, BJP candidate Sangeeta Chauhan for Naugaon Sadat seat in Amroha district alleged “fake voting” at three polling booths – Booth No 240, 24 and 242 -- in her constituency and demanded that those wearing burqa should show their faces to enable poll officials ascertain their identities. "Fake voting is going on, but the administration is unable to understand this," she told reporters. "We are repeatedly saying this, but no one is listening to us," she added. The chief electoral officer told PTI that he would look into these allegations. People at booth number 30 at Rudhau Mustkil of Tundla constituency in Firozabad district boycotted the by-election for over six hours, alleging no development in their area and insisting that they will not vote unless they get an assurance for the development. Chanting "vikas nahi, to vote nahi" (no development, no vote), voters at the Rudhau Mustkil booth, voters boycotted the polling. In a video clip that surfaced on social media, area's Sub-divisional Magistrate Ekta Singh was purportedly seen talking to the people and urging them to vote. The Yogi Adityanath government has been facing the opposition flak over the law and order situation in the state, particularly after the Hathras and the Balrampur rape-and-murder cases. The Naugaon Sadat seat fell vacant after the death of state Cabinet minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan. The Ghatampur bypoll in Kanpur Nagar district was necessitated due to the death of state minister Kamal Rani Varun. Both ministers had died of Covid-19. The Tundla seat fell vacant after its MLA S P Singh Baghel was elected to the Lok Sabha, while the Bangarmau seat in Unnao fell vacant after the conviction of BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in a rape case. The BJP had dumped Sengar soon after he was found involved in the rape case. The bypolls to the Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani seats were necessitated due to deaths of sitting MLAs Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejay Singh and Parasnath Yadav (SP) respectively. Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad's Azad Samaj Party is testing its electoral popularity in Bulandshahr by fielding Mohammad Yameen, looking forward to consolidating its hold among Dalits in the run-up to the 2022 assembly polls. While Bulandshahr has the highest number of 18 candidates, Ghatampur has the lowest number of six contestants. Sixteen contenders are in the fray in Malhani, 14 each in Naugaon Sadat and Deoria, 10 each in Bangarmau and Tundla.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-assembly-bypolls-over-53-voters-cast-franchise-sealing-fate-of-88-candidates-910801.html

The cadres, who were active in Malangir area committee of Maoists, surrendered before police and CRPF officials, citing that they were impressed by the local police's surrender-cum-rehabilitation campaign 'Lon Varratu' (return to your home/village) and disappointed with "hollow" Maoist ideology, Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava said. Of the surrendered ultras, five were collectively carrying a reward of Rs 10 lakh on their heads, he said. With this, 187 Naxals have so far surrendered in the district since the drive was launched in June, the official said. Among the 10 cadres, Madvi Aayta (20), a section deputy commander, Bhima Korram (22) and Mukka Madvi (26), both jan-militia commanders, and Naresh Markam (23) were allegedly part of the squad that attacked police personnel escorting a three-member team of national broadcaster Doordarshan near Nilawaya village on October 30, 2018, ahead of the state Assembly polls, Pallava said. Three policemen and a DD cameraperson were killed in the attack. Aayta carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head, while Rs 1 lakh each had been announced for Madvi and Korram, he said. Two other surrendered cadres Kosa Madkam (25), an area committee member (ACM) of Maoists and Deva Mandavi (22), head of Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan (DAKMS), were carrying a reward of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1 lakh respectively on their heads, he said. "They all were allegedly involved in several IED blasts targeting security forces in the area," the official said. The surrendered ultras, in their statement, had said that they were disappointed with "hollow" Maoist ideology and their colleagues' recent surrender as a part of the Lon Varratu campaign had also encouraged them to quit violence, he said. They were given immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 and will be provided facilities as per the government's surrender and rehabilitation policy, he added. Under the Lon Varratu initiative, the Dantewada police have put up posters and banners in native villages of 1,600 Naxals, mostly carrying cash rewards on their heads, and appealed them to return to the mainstream.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/10-naxals-surrender-in-chhattisgarhs-dantewada-district-910804.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||SC stays NGT order slapping penalty on Noida industrial unit unit for unauthorised water extraction||The Supreme Court has stayed an NGT order slapping a penalty of Rs 25 lakh on an industrial unit in Noida for unauthorised extraction of water. A three-judge bench headed by Justice R F Nariman issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government, New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) and others while seeking their replies on the appeal against the NGT order. "Issue notice.There shall be stay of the impugned order, in the meantime," the bench, also comprising Justices Navin Sinha and Krishna Murari, said. The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Advant Navis Business Park challenging the NGT order. The tribunal had noted that there is no operative non objection certificate (NOC) as far as Noida Golf Course and Advant Navis Business Park are concerned. It had said Noida Golf Course and Advant Navis Business Park have to pay an interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh, which may be deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) within one month. The green panel had perused a report filed by a committee of the CPCB and Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, which said that groundwater is being illegally drawn and the allegation that misuse of groundwater for horticulture purpose is taking place is not disputed. It is not clear whether conditions of NOC are being complied with, the NGT had said. The tribunal had referred to its previous directions that groundwater cannot be used for a playground like cricket ground, particularly in over-exploited, critical and semi-critical area, which also applies to Golf Course. "In view of depleting groundwater, there is a threat of irreversible damage to the acquifiers and salinity of the water. Moreover, it is leading to scarcity of drinking water, thereby depriving a section of the society from access to potable water which is already scarce. The rainwater harvesting systems have to be regularly maintained as per norms," the bench had said. The NGT said that the state pollution control board has failed to assess and recover compensation for illegal removal of groundwater. "The assessment of quantity of water drawn needs to be made realistically and adverse inference has to be drawn for absence of water meter... "Water audit may be conducted to ascertain the extent of use and replenishment of groundwater in the last three years by the same Committee with an additional representative of CPCB and Indian Institute of Technology- Delhi," the NGT had said. The Committee may also assess compensation to be paid and may also look into the water quality aspects of the rainwater harvesting systems and suggest remedial measures as may be found necessary, the tribunal had said. The NGT had earlier directed a committee to submit a report on a plea alleging illegal extraction of groundwater by the Noida Golf Course without requisite permission from the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA). The tribunal's order had come on a plea filed by environment activist Vikrant Tongad alleging illegal extraction of groundwater without requisite permission by the Noida Golf Course in Sector 43 in Gautam Buddh Nagar. Despite the availability of treated STP water, Golf Course at Noida continues to extract groundwater without a valid no objection certificate from the CGWA, the plea had stated, seeking action against the violator.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-stays-ngt-order-slapping-penalty-on-noida-industrial-unit-unit-for-unauthorised-water-extraction-910810.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Stubble burning share in Delhi's pollution drops to 10% due to change in wind direction: SAFAR||The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution dropped to 10 per cent on Tuesday due to a change in the wind direction, according to a central government forecasting agency. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said 3,068 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Monday. The boundary layer wind direction became southwesterly on Tuesday morning after a long spell, which is unfavourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, according to the agency. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution has "decreased significantly" and is estimated at 10 per cent for Tuesday, it said. SAFAR said it was a typical example of high fire count and its low impact on Delhi's air quality due to unfavourable transport level winds, "demonstrating how meteorology can play a decisive role". Stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi's pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. SAFAR has predicted a marginal deterioration in the air quality on Wednesday and Thursday. The national capital's air quality slipped back into the "very poor" category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement over the last 24 hours. Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant nighttime conditions led to accumulation of pollutants. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 311 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average (AQI) was 293, which falls in the "poor" category. It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi's pollution. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/stubble-burning-share-in-delhis-pollution-drops-to-10-due-to-change-in-wind-direction-safar-910811.html

According to the police sources here, the four youths sneaked into the sprawling Idgah grounds at Govardhan town in the district at around 10am and recited the hymns, taking the people who were present there by surprise. The youths, who hailed from Govardhan town, later uploaded the video of their act on social media platforms. Acting swiftly after the video went viral, the police nabbed all of them a little later, sources said. ''We have done nothing wrong....if they (Muslims) can offer namaz in a temple, then we can also recite devotional hymns in a mosque,'' said one of the youths. ''We will take stern action against the offenders,'' said a senior police official in Mathura. Two Muslim youths had allegedly offered prayers inside the Nand Mahal temple at Nandgaon in the district on Sunday. The police, on Tuesday, arrested one Faisal Khan from Delhi in connection with the case. In another incident, apparently aimed at vitiating the communal atmosphere in the state, some miscreants painted around half a dozen places of worship for the Muslims in saffron in Agra town, according to the reports. Police later restored the original colour of the places of worship.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-namaz-offered-at-temple-4-youths-recite-hanuman-chalisa-at-an-idgah-in-mathura-910816.html

Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan responded to Singh, stating that the Congress has already sensed its defeat in these bypolls and hence its party leader is finding fault with EVMs which are being used in India during polls for decades. "In a technological age, developed countries dont trust the EVM, but elections in India and some smaller countries are conducted by EVMs. "Why don't developed countries use (EVMs)? Because they don't trust EVMs. "Why? Because the chip in it can be hacked, Singh tweeted and posted a news item mentioning the list of countries using these devices. Reacting to Singh's tweet, Chouhan, while talking to reporters at the BJPs state headquarters here, said, "The Congress has started making ground for its imminent defeat in the bypolls by blaming the EVMs. Digvijaya Singh is raising questions on the EVMs now." Chouhan said, These are the same EVMs that led to the Congress victory on 114 seats in MP in 2018. These EVMs were fine at that time. The BJP leader said the same EVMs were used in the 2018 assembly polls in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, where the results when in favour of the Congress. The ruling BJP and the Opposition Congress are locked in a bitter fight for supremacy in the bypolls in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP has to win at least nine of the 28 seats to reach the halfway mark (116) in the 230-member state assembly.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-digvijaya-singh-questions-the-use-of-evms-910817.html

"We must get ready to respond in the same language... the police will do what they have to do but we can not wait for the police action," controversial BJP legislator Sangeet Som said. In a virtual address to the party workers from his Assembly constituency of Sardhana in UP's Meerut district, Som, whose name had also figured in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar communal riots, which had claimed 60 lives, termed 'love jihad' as "another form of terrorism". "We can not depend only on the police to deal with cases of love jihad," the MLA said. Som, who often courted controversy by his remarks, accused the Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi of turning a blind eye to the cases of 'love jihad'. The MLAs' remarks come barely a couple of days after Adityanath's 'Ram Naam Satya' warning and hint that the state government would soon enact a stringent law to deal with the cases of 'love jihad'. Saffron outfits have been quite vocal against incidents of alleged 'love jihad'.

Coal supplies to the thermal power plants were severely affected after the Railways suspended the operation of freight trains in the wake of the blockade of some tracks by farmers in protest against the three central farm laws. With the situation turning grim, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is imposing power cuts of two-three hours due to the mismatch between demand and supply, an official said. "The power cuts will increase to four-five hours," PSPCL chairperson A Venu Prasad said. "The power situation is critical." "We will impose three-hour power cuts today evening," Prasad added. Private utility GVK Power has announced that it would close down operations at 3 pm on Tuesday since coal stocks had completely run out. Two other private thermal plants -- Nabha Power at Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo in Mansa -- have already shut down their operations due to coal shortage. Two state-owned utilities -- Lehra Mohabbat and Ropar power plants -- also have coal for just one or two days, officials said. At present, the demand for electricity in the state stands at 6,000 megawatts against a supply of 5,000 MW from other central sectors, hydro and biomass, leading to a shortage of 1,000 MW. In a statement, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said the situation on the ground was grim as the state had run out of coal, adding that the people of Punjab were staring at a "dark" festival season. The suspension of freight trains has not only hit the coal supplies for thermal power plants, but also adversely affected supply of fertilisers for Rabi crops and movement of foodgrain stocks. The non-operation of goods trains has also impacted the state industry as it was unable to get raw material and send finished goods. Several farmer outfits had announced a fortnight ago to ease their rail blockade by allowing the movement of goods trains in the state. However, members of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) continued to squat on two rail tracks that are used for coal supplies to two private thermal plants at Rajpura and Mansa. Protesters under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee are also sitting on a rail track in Amritsar. Railways Minister Piyush Goyal had sought the state government's assurance of the safety of trains and their crew members to restore freight services after Singh had asked him to intervene. However, the Railways later decided to extend its suspension of goods train operations, saying protesting farmers were still blocking the tracks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/situation-critical-punjab-stares-at-long-power-cuts-910855.html

The move comes as a major relief to the restaurant industry in Delhi, especially after a major economic downfall due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier directed officials to take steps to remove hassles faced by the restaurant industry in the capital. "In terms of the decision taken by the chief minister, GNCT of Delhi in the meeting dated 07.10.2020 regarding Ease of Doing Business for Restaurants, the Voluntary Scheme of Granting Approval to the Stand-alone Restaurants being implemented by the Tourism Department, GNCT of Delhi is hereby discontinued, with immediate effect," the order said. According to officials, the scheme for granting approvals to restaurants was being implemented by the Ministry of Tourism under the Centre on an all-India basis. However, the scheme was discontinued from June 30, 2003, and states were asked to formulate their own guidelines if they wished to implement the scheme. The scheme was adopted by the Delhi government's Tourism Department and was formally launched in 2004 for all restaurants having more than 30 seats. Various reviews and reconsiderations were done by the Tourism Department over the years on the request of restaurant associations. However, owing to the recent circumstances, Kejriwal has ordered the removal of the voluntary scheme of granting approval for stand-alone restaurants, officials said. On October 7, Kejriwal had a meeting with a delegation of the National Restaurant Association of India during which the office bearers had raised the hassles they face in terms of seeking approvals from various places.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/restaurants-sector-in-delhi-gets-a-boost-after-covid-19-slump-910897.html
03-11-2020||North and Central||Sikh activist, who tried hoisting tricolour on PDP office, detained||A Sikh activist, who tried to hoist the national flag atop the PDP office here during a protest against remarks by its chief Mehbooba Mufti on the tricolour, was detained by police on Tuesday, officials said. On October 24, Amandeep Singh had hoisted the national flag on the boundary wall near the main entrance of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) office and a day later, he along with some youths attempted to hoist it on the party's headquarters, but were stopped by police. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Jammu, Sridhar Patil confirmed Singh's detention. He has been detained under some other case and not for disturbance to law and order, the officer said. Police, however, did not give details of the charges against the Sikh activist. Singh has been either booked for violation of Covid-19 protocols and the Disaster Management Act or for trespass, sources said. While the activist was being shifted in a vehicle, he told reporters that he is being "arrested" by police under pressure from the PDP. Led by the station house officer of Gandhinagar, a police team raided Singh's house at Sanjay Nagar and took him in the presence of journalists. Singh's father, who rushed to the Gandhinagar police station following the police action, told reporters that he was not being allowed to meet his son. "They are not allowing me to meet my son. I have the right to know under which case they have booked my son. This is the worst state of rule in which patriots and nationalists unfurling the tricolour are being sent to jail," his father said. Singh's wife alleged that "this is the treatment given to nationalist and patriotic people in Jammu." "Is this a lesson for being a nationalist and hoisting the national flag," she asked. Protests were staged outside the PDP officer last month after Mehbooba, a former chief minister, said she is not interested in contesting elections or holding the tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year are rolled back. She had said she would hold the national flag only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir is restored. The Centre on August 5 last year had abrogated the erstwhile state's special status and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh Following the PDP chief's statements, the BJP had accused her of making "seditious remarks" and had demanded her arrest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sikh-activist-who-tried-hoisting-tricolour-on-pdp-office-detained-910899.html

The voting percentage was of till 6 pm, the official deadline for polling, he said. However, the final turnout might go up as many voters, mostly those infected with Covid-19, were still in the premises of some polling stations to cast ballots even after the end of official voting time, he said. The bypoll for the seat reserved for Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates, which falls in the newly-formed Gaurela- Pendra Marwahi district, became necessary following the death of sitting Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi on May 29. Eight candidates are in the fray. "The voting began at 8 am amid tight security and with Covid-19 protocols in place. After the deadline for voting ended at 6 pm, around 77 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the Marwahi seat," the official said. No untoward incident was reported in the constituency during the polling, the official said. In the 2018 assembly election, the constituency had recorded a voter turnout of 81.15 per cent. A total of 1,91,004 voters were eligible to cast ballots of which 93,735 were men, 97,265 females and four from the third gender. As many as 286 polling stations were set up, of which 126 were categorised as sensitive, the official said. The results of the bypoll will be announced on November 10. The seat, a bastion of the Jogi family for several years now, is witnessing a straight fight between the Congress and the BJP after the nomination papers of Amit Jogi, the son of Ajit Jogi, and his wife Richa were rejected by the returning officer, who said their caste certificates were invalid. The Congress has fielded Dr K K Dhruw, a former medical officer from the area, while Dr Gambheer Singh, an ex- professor of the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Medical College, Raipur, is the BJP nominee. The strength of the Chhattisgarh Assembly is 90. The other candidates in the fray are Ritu Pandram of the Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP), Dr Urmila Singh Marko of the Rashtriya Gondwana Party, Pushpa Khelan Korche of the Ambedkarite Party of India, Beersingh Nagesh of the Bharatiya Tribal Party, Lakshman Porte of the Bharatiya Sarvajan Hitay Samaj Party and independent Sonmati Salam. In the 2018 Assembly polls, Ajit Jogi had bagged 74,041 votes in Marwahi, beating the BJP's Archana Porte by a margin of 46,462 votes, with the Congress coming third.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/77-voter-turnout-in-bypoll-to-marwahi-assembly-seat-in-chhattisgarh-910903.html

A division bench of justices S K Gupta and Pankaj Bhatia gave the direction on a plea by Sultana Mirza and Kiran Rani of Shamli. The petitioners said they have been in a live-in relationship for several years but facing resistance from their family and society because of their sexual orientation. In their pleas, they also apprehended harassment and threat to their lives because of their relationship. Petitioners relied on Navtej Singh Johar case in which the Supreme Court considered the plight of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender). The bench gave its order relying on the principles laid down by the apex court in the case that any kind of discrimination based on the sexual orientation of a person is unconstitutional. In the Johar case, the apex court had also ruled that “the sexual orientation is an intrinsic element of liberty, dignity, privacy, individual autonomy and equality, and the intimacy between consenting adults of the same sex is beyond the legitimate interests of the state”. While allowing the petition, the bench said that “a constitutional court is duty-bound to monitor and observe the constitutional morality as well as rights of the citizen which are under threat only on account of the sexual orientation”. "We direct the Shamli superintendent of police to extend suitable protection to the petitioners in the event they approach for necessary protection and ensure that no harassment is caused to them," the court ruled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/allahabad-high-court-asks-shamli-superintendent-to-give-protection-to-a-same-sex-couple-910929.html

The petition also sought action against senior police officials, including Director General of Police, Bihar and Superintendent of Police, Aurangabad for their alleged inaction. The plea has also sought lodging of FIR in the matter against the erring police officials and direction to all state governments to ensure and take safety and security measures for the judicial officers of the Subordinate Judiciary in their respective states. The petition, filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari, said that at Aurangabad, Bihar, a District Judge was allegedly abused, threatened and chased by a police sub-inspector (SI) and other police personnel when he was on evening walk last month.  The Bihar Judicial Services Association had written a letter to the DGP seeking action against erring officers, but no step was taken yet in connection with the incident, it claimed. The plea also claimed that the SI had a grudge against the judicial officer as he had taken action against him and a few other police officers for dereliction of duty a few months back. “Attack and assault upon the judges and magistrates by police not only lowers the dignity of the judiciary but it also leaves the impression in the minds of the public that when the judicial officers are not safe from police atrocities than what safety public will aspect.  “The judges of Subordinate judiciary are a vital part of our judicial system... Assault upon them with the feeling of a grudge is the assault upon the dignity and supremacy of the Judiciary of this country which cannot be tolerated and requires strict punishment against the erring police officials under the contempt law,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/plea-in-supreme-court-seeking-contempt-against-police-officials-for-assaulting-judge-in-bihar-910938.html

The Directorate of School Education, Jammu (DSEJ) in collaboration with the American India Foundation (AIF) is going to implement the programme in Jammu, Kathua and Samba districts, he said. He said it is an award-winning education programme aimed at creating 'problem solvers' and enabling the students to discover a range of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers, such as fraud detective, data scientist and software engineer. "This will enhance the pathway not only to STEM, but to a promising future for girls," the spokesperson said. "Under this programme, AIF will hold online training sessions for girls, as well as provide relevant teaching-learning materials to teachers and schools," the spokesperson said.  He said through its education interventions, AIF works with children studying in Grades 6 to 10 and strives to create an effective and integrated STEM learning environment. "Encouraging cooperation and collaboration among students, the intervention also builds the capacity of government school teachers on STEM, use of technology and Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) for enhancing learning outcomes of children," the spokesperson said.  He said the initiative would be supervised by the Counselling Cell of the Directorate of School Education Jammu. Elaborating on the initiative, Director School Education, Jammu, Anuradha Gupta said girls' participation and awareness in STEM-related careers in India is not up to the mark and with the fast-moving economy, it is important to provide equal access to women in quality education at all levels. "Career and vocational guidance integrated with the STEM approach can go a long way in attaining this objective," she said. Appreciating Guidance and Counselling Cell head Romesh Kumar, Gupta said this programme would not only bring rural girl students at par with their urban counterparts by exposing them to the world class technology curriculum but also sensitise them about cyber security.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/10000-girls-to-benefit-from-girls4tech-programme-in-jammu-910971.html

In a letter submitted to members of the Board, the employees stated that an assurance was given to solve the impasse but no salaries were paid although the deadline of November 4 given by them was close. "No solution of pending salaries has been found by the members or chief executive officer of the Board so far. If there is no solution of pending salaries and other issues by the evening of November 4, all the employees will go on an indefinite strike from November 5," the letter read. No reaction was immediately available from the Delhi government on the issue. "The contract based employees have not received wages since February and the permanent ones were last paid salaries in April. We have been facing untold financial hardships and finding it difficult to meet our daily expenses," an employee of Delhi Waqf Board said. The financial transactions of the Board are conducted through an account jointly operated by its chairman, member and a government official, according to sources. The seven-member Board has remained headless after Okhla MLA and its then chairman Amantullah Khan completed his term as a member with the Delhi Assembly election in February.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar made the request to Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a meeting to review the progress of the Centre's mission held through video conferencing. The mission was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 last year from the Red Fort. Khattar urged Shekhawat to provide relaxation in the condition in the mission that drinking water connections will be provided in areas with a population of 100. He also assured the Centre that Haryana was steadfast in achieving the target of 'Jal Jeevan Mission' in all the villages with a population of 6,841 in the state by December 31, 2022, and is formulating plans for it. Khattar also informed the Union Jal Shakti minister that Haryana has set a target of providing 100 per cent drinking water connections in three districts -- Ambala, Kurukshetra and Panchkula -- by March 31 next year. About the implementation of the national campaign of the prime minister's 100-day Jal Jeevan Mission, a target has been set to provide drinking water through taps in Anganwadi Centres and schools and for lavatories. Sharing information about the status of the campaign in Haryana, the chief minister apprised the Centre that out of 12,953 schools in the state, 12,918 schools have drinking water. Similarly, out of 25,962 Anganwadi Centres, water is being provided in 20,800 such facilities. By December 31 next year tap water connection will be provided in the remaining Anganwadis, the chief minister said. "Water scarcity will be a major issue in the coming days.

03-11-2020||Opinion||Ambani vs Bezos: A fight or a waiting game?||By Andy Mukherjee A vanilla commercial dispute is setting the stage for a clash between the world’s No. 1 and No. 6 richest men. But the legal wrangling is a sideshow. What Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani are really fighting over is pole position in the only billion-plus-people consumer market available to both of them: India. The ostensible battleground is a $3.4 billion deal Indian tycoon Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. stitched up in August to acquire assets of debt-laden local retailer Future Group. Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. is trying to block the transaction. That, in itself, is a bit of a dampener. Expectations were building for the two billionaires to work together. In September, Bloomberg News reported that Ambani had given Amazon an option to buy as much as 40% of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd., seeking to repeat the success he had earlier this year in bringing in Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. as partners to his digital platform. By seeking to stall Ambani’s purchase of Future, Bezos may be signaling that he would rather remain a rival. Or, that he’s buying time to sweeten the offer currently on the table. The actual quarrel is only interesting when you read between the lines of the claims and counterclaims. Amazon bought a 49% stake last year in a private firm controlled by Kishore Biyani, a pioneer of modern-format retailing in the country. The investment gave the U.S. e-commerce giant the right to acquire Biyani’s shares in the publicly traded Future Retail Ltd. from the third year. Another of Bezos’s conditions was that Biyani wouldn’t sell his assets — about 1,500 stores nationwide — to restricted persons, including Reliance, which operates India’s largest retail chain. After the Future-Reliance deal was announced, Amazon alleged breach of contract and obtained an interim stay against the sale from an arbitrator in Singapore, a preferred neutral venue in Asia for settling disputes in cross-border agreements. The U.S. company then wrote a letter to Indian stock exchanges and the regulator, asking them to not approve the transaction. Future Retail has challenged Amazon’s position by saying that the Singapore ruling has no legal basis in India, and that anyway, it wasn’t a party to the founder’s agreement. Given the debilitating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on operations, the retailer says it’s doing the right thing by all stakeholders in selling assets to Reliance. As for Amazon’s claim of $193 million in damages plus interest, that liability, if awarded by the arbitrator, should fall on Biyani’s private firm that did the deal, Future Retail argues. Biyani is just a pawn in a much bigger power play. Future's cash crunch didn't emerge suddenly. Amazon had ample opportunity to tiptoe around India’s legal restrictions on foreign ownership of retail chains to act as a white knight. But it didn’t. Amazon may still be interested in partnering with Ambani — at the right price. Other investors, such as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co., have written him checks worth $5 billion in total. They may have feared losing out on what could become India’s most successful mix of physical and digital shopping, a strategy that leverages Reliance Retail’s own outlets together with independently owned neighbourhood stores connected to Ambani’s 4G phone network of 400 million users. However, the portion offered to Amazon would mean a $20 billion commitment. Bezos could afford to see how well Ambani executes his plan. Amazon’s India website kicked off its annual festival season last month to record sales in the first couple of days. Reliance Retail’s revenue also jumped 30% in the September quarter from the previous three months. But although India’s nationwide lockdown has ended, not all stores have reopened fully. Footfall has yet to recover, especially in fashion and lifestyle and at stores inside malls. In Macquarie’s estimates, the next fiscal year’s earnings per share for Reliance Industries, the holding company, may be 23% below the consensus street forecast. A reason, the brokerage says, is stiff competition, high investment and low margins in retail. Reliance Industries shares fell 8.6% in Mumbai on Monday.  Amazon’s letter to the Securities and Exchange Board of India makes a reference to India’s “ease of doing business,” which has been a sore point with foreign investors from Vodafone Group Plc to Cairn Energy Plc. The regulator needs to hold listed firms accountable for their dealings, Amazon said in the letter, according to Reuters, which has seen a copy. The last thing India wants is more of a bad rap. The Seattle-based firm already has to operate with one hand tied behind its back: As a foreign e-commerce player, it can’t own inventory or openly discount merchandise. Even harsher rules — covering data and algorithms — may be on their way. It’s important for regulators to not give Amazon the chance to paint a commercial feud as another sign of India’s unfair treatment of global investors. In more ways than one, a waiting game by Bezos may not be a bad idea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/ambani-vs-bezos-a-fight-or-a-waiting-game-910628.html
03-11-2020||Opinion||India can’t ease up on Covid-19 fight now||By Mihir Sharma As Europe braces for a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that in parts of the continent looks to be more intensive than the first, it is tempting to assume that the developing world has gotten off lightly. In India, which has the world’s second-highest total of Covid-19 cases, the number of new infections has been trending downwards since September. Other large developing nations flattened their curves even earlier: Brazil peaked in August and South Africa in July. Back in March, we would have gratefully accepted this outcome: There were very real and logical fears that once the virus began to spread in poorer countries in Asia and Africa, their limited healthcare systems would struggle far more than Italy’s and Spain’s. It looks as though the world has dodged a bullet. Yet, I am not at all sure that we should be confident about the winter and next year. Even in the best-case scenario, a vaccine will not be available in much of the developing world before the second half of 2021. There is more than enough time for new waves of transmission to strike between now and then. That’s why the causes of Europe’s second wave and the continent’s response are so worrying. European nations opened up too much and, when curves began climbing again, they were much slower to lock down than they had been in the spring. Experts warned as early as August that summer vacations were causing new cases to spike. The response was tragically slow. An unwillingness to lock down again is understandable even without appealing to some nebulous notion of “pandemic fatigue.” The plain fact is that we all understand now, a little better than in the spring, the enormous human and economic costs of strict lockdowns. It is also true that the costs paid by the developing world, particularly those countries which instituted broad nationwide lockdowns, were even harsher. In South Africa, for example, where President Cyril Ramaphosa responded early and firmly to the virus, GDP fell by over 50% in annualized terms. India, which also shut down in late March, took a huge hit from its national lockdown, which was gradually eased over the summer. In developing countries with minimal or leaky welfare systems, such costs are disproportionately borne by those who can least afford it. In Bangladesh, the poverty rate has risen 10 percentage points to almost 30% of the population since last year. According to the Dhaka-based think tank SANEM, it may cross 40% before the pandemic is done — a doubling of poverty that would bring the country back to where it was in 2005. If and when another wave arrives in the developing world, then, which national leaders will be able to respond as strongly as they did in the spring? In India, politicians dread the thought of reimposing harsh restrictions on movement. The Indian state of Bihar is headed for elections and, given that a significant proportion of its 100 million people are migrant workers who were left stranded by the March lockdown, the government’s “callousness” has become a major issue in the polls. That’s why it’s even more important for the developing world to avoid a second wave: The only tool that worked to control Covid-19’s spread may no longer be available. Earlier this year, poorer nations could at least benefit from Europe’s experience; public health techniques and therapeutics developed on the fly in the West could be adopted swiftly. And their younger populations helped keep hospitals from being over-burdened.   This time, the lessons from Europe are different. Most importantly, even if their primary focus has shifted to the economy and jobs, leaders must appreciate the difficult trade-offs to be made. Reopening for travel and leisure might seem like it is essential for struggling economies. But, as Europe’s second wave proves, the eventual costs of allowing the virus to spread through such laxness are even higher. If the developing world wants to avoid lockdowns later, it will have to resist the urge to reopen fully now. That means no large indoor gatherings, no uncontrolled travel, no potential super-spreader events, continued strictness on social distancing. Whether you’re thinking in terms of lives or livelihoods, that’s the only choice available.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/india-can-t-ease-up-on-covid-19-fight-now-910629.html

He learned music from his father. Arriving in Chennai in 1942, Krishnan made the city his home.    Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the demise of T N Krishnan. "The demise of noted violinist Shri TN Krishnan leaves a big void in the world of music. His works beautifully encapsulated a wide range of emotions and strands of our culture. He was also an outstanding mentor to young musicians. Condolences to his family and admirers.

His works beautifully encapsulated a wide range of emotions and strands of our culture. He was also an outstanding mentor to young musicians. Condolences to his family and admirers. Om Shanti. Not just in performing music, he also excelled in the field of teaching music as a professor at the Music College in Chennai and later as Dean of the School of Music and Fine Arts, University of Delhi. "He strode the world of violin and music like a colossus. The living legend Sri T N Krishnan passes on, leaving the music world bereft. Atma Shanti," Carnatic musicians Ranjani-Gayathri said.

He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1973, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1974, the Sangeetha Kalanidhi in 1980, and Padma Bhushan in 1992. A regular at the prestigious Music Academy during the Margazhi season, Krishnan, many of his fans said, will be missed most on the Christmas Day (December 25) as the morning slot (9 am to 11.30 am) had always been his for several years.  "Another legend, Sangita Kalanidhi Sri.#TNKrishnan mama, one of the greatest violin maestros, aged 92 moved on to another world.

This is how residents of Painganadu-Thulasendrapuram prayed for the victory of US Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Tuesday's elections. The village, 350 km from here, is where Harris' grandfather, P V Gopalan, was born and raised. The Dharma Sastha Ayyanar Temple in the village was decked up with flowers on Tuesday as people converged at its premises to pray for Harris' "grand victory" in the US elections. Firecrackers also went off during the special poojas. The first abhishekam was organised by the villagers, while the second one was conducted by Kalidas Vandaiyar, whose grandfather shared close ties with Gopalan and his family. "The abhishekam and poojas are a demonstration of our love towards the Gopalan family that has brought accolades to our village. This is also a display of our belief in God," Vandaiyar, also President of the Thanjavur District Cricket Association, told Deccan Herald. While nearly 100 people took part in the two abhishekams, more than 200 people had their lunch at the temple premises at the mass feeding ceremony. Rajesh, a resident of the village, said the poojas were conducted seeking divine intervention for Harris' victory. "The abhishekams were conducted with 11 items including curd, milk, dates, and tender coconut water. More than 100 villagers participated in two poojas on Tuesday. We feel Kamala Harris is a daughter of this village as her grandfather hailed from here. We are sure the Dharma Sastha Ayyanar will help her win the elections," Rajesh added. Harris' aunt, Dr Sarala Gopalan, who had broken 108 coconuts in 2010 when her niece first contested the California Attorney General Democratic primary election, also sought divine intervention by visiting the Varasiddhi Vinayagar Temple in Besant Nagar here last month. "She (Sarala Gopalan) visited the temple last month and made a donation in the name of Kamala Harris," Rajagopalan, one of the caretakers of the temple, said. Though having migrated from the village long back, the Gopalan family had never lost touch with the village having contributed money to the temple's consecration. "I keep receiving vibhuti (sacred ash), kumkum (sindoor) and prasadam from the temple every year. The temple administration sends them via courier to me and my sister (Dr Sarala Gopalan) who lives in Chennai," Balachandran Gopalan, Harris' uncle and Gopalan's son, told DH from New Delhi. Ramani, who is one of the caretakers of the temple, said the family has been sending donations to the temple every now and then. "Contributions are made in the name of P V Gopalan. And I keep sending the prasadams to both Balachandran and Sarala Gopalan every year in the month of May or June," Ramani said. Dr Sarala Gopalan was not reachable on Tuesday, but she had told DH on August 12, the day Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate, that her sister Dr Shyamala Gopalan would be smiling in heaven. “She (Kamala Harris) is a person who never forgets her roots and believes in family values. Even today, she calls me chithi (mother’s younger sister) and she has always been a caring person. Obviously, we are thrilled and happy. Since my sister is not alive today, we will always be available for Kamala and Maya, when they need us," she had said. Gopalan's daughter Dr Shyamala Gopalan married a Jamaican Donald Harris and the couple had two daughters Kamala Harris and Maya Harris, a lawyer by profession. Kamala Harris and her sister had accompanied Dr Shyamala to Chennai often to meet their grandparents at their home in upscale Besant Nagar. Gopalan had taken them for a walk on Elliot's Beach in Besant Nagar.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/us-election-kamala-harriss-ancestral-village-in-tamil-nadu-prays-for-her-victory-910658.html

As per initial reports, the incident took place at around 6 am. The Thunderbolt commandos were said to be on a routine patrolling in the forest areas near Banasura when the suspected Maoists were spotted. There were at least three of them. In a subsequent exchange of firing, one was killed while others managed to escape. Some weapons were also recovered from the spot. Senior police officers rushed to the spot and combing was launched in the area. The identity of the deceased was not yet known. However, it was suspected that the deceased was a non-Malayali. The fresh incident took place close on the heels of allegations that the killing of a Maoist local leader C P Jaleel at a resort at Lakkidi near Vythiri in Wayanad last year was a fake encounter. Three Maoists, including a woman, were killed in another encounter at Palakkad district last year. Meanwhile, the incident on Tuesday also triggered protests with Congress raising suspicions of a fake encounter and alleging that the Pinarayi Vijayan government was killing Maoists.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/suspected-maoist-killed-encounter-in-kerala-910670.html

The national and state leadership are learned to be scratching their heads to find an amicable solution. The most serious voice of dissent was that of senior leader Sobha Surendran, who was even considered as a state president probable once. Ever since K Surendran was made the state president, Sobha has been quite inactive after she was sidelined and made the state vice president. Sobha finally broke her silence recently by openly stating that she had conveyed her displeasure to the party leadership. She said that she was a member of the BJP national executive committee but she was made the state vice president without her consultation and that it was against the precedents. Close on the heels of this development, BJP national council member P M Velayudhan alleged that K Surendran had ditched him by offering him key posts in the party to gain his support for the state president's chair. Velayudhan also said that people like him and Sobha, who had been working for the party for years, were being sidelined when people from other parties joined the BJP. While Sobha Surendran came out in the open against the party leadership, K Surendran, in his initial reaction to the media, said that those were internal matters of the party and hence he did not want to have any public discussion on them. However, with more leaders coming out against the leadership, Surendran was forced to break his silence. He said that he would personally talk to all those who have any sorts of concerns and would try to address the issues. The resentment among the party's long-time leaders aggravated following the appointment of A P Abdullakutty and Tom Vadakkan as national vice president and national spokesperson respectively. Both of them had recently joined the BJP from the Congress. Senior Kerala BJP leaders like Kummanam Rajasekharan and Sobha Surendran were expecting posts at the national level. Sources in the BJP said that the national leadership would soon be taking steps to appease all the prominent leaders with any sort of concerns by even offering them posts at the national level. The BJP, which got one win in Kerala for the first time in 2016, is eyeing to improve its position. In the local body polls as well, the BJP has high hopes from the Thiruvananthapuram city corporation which it had lost to the Left Front by just eight seats.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/resentment-may-cast-shadow-over-kerala-bjps-electoral-hopes-910808.html

The NBW was sought in a case registered in connection with allegedly smuggling out $1,90,000 to Egypt via Oman from the state capital with the help of two accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case. In a report submitted under sections 156 and 157 of the CrPC before the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate submitted former finance head of UAE consulate, Thiruvananthapuram, Khaled Mohamed Ali Shoukri, had taken out $1,90,000 (equivalent to Rs 1.30 crore) concealed in his handbag. Shoukri, an Egyptian national, was accompanied by prime accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh and Sarith PS, till Oman during his travel from Thiruvananthapuram International airport by Oman Airways on August 7, 2019. The Customs said the issue came to light during the course of investigation in the case of seizure of 30 kg gold through Air Cargo Complex, Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. Suresh, in her voluntary statement given under Section 108 of the Customs Act, 1962, stated and admitted she and Sarith had accompanied Shoukri from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to Muscat on August 7, 2019,the agency said in the report. The main purpose of their trip to Dubai via Oman was to facilitate Shoukri in the hassle-free clearance at Thiruvananthapuram airport to cross the security check,it said. During custodial interrogation, Suresh, a former employee of the UAE consulate, stated she had seen many times Khalid himself screening his handbags in the X-Ray machine available at UAE Consulate Office, Thiruvananthapuram, in the presence of Sarith, to ensure the currency concealment would not be detected during security check by the CISF at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, the agency said. Based on their statements, Customs registered a case and launched an investigation. The agency submitted that Shoukri may be added as an accused in the case and the report may be accepted. "Since the respondent is out of India, his presence cannot be secured by the Department under the provisions of the Customs Act.Therefore he needs to be extradited. For this purpose the court having jurisdiction of the case has to issue a non-bailable warrant against the said respondent, so that the issue can be taken up through appropriate authorities as mandated under bilateral conventions," the agency said in the report. It said a detailed investigation is warranted to identify as to whether more people are involved in the smuggling of huge quantities of foreign currency out of India, which is a grave threat to the economy and national security. As the currency value exceeds Rs 1 crore, the offence committed by the Egyptian national is non-bailable as per provisions of the Customs Act, the agency added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/customs-seeks-non-bailable-warrant-against-ex-uae-consulate-employee-910812.html

After chairing a high-level meeting, convened to discuss details of the setting up of the proposed factory, state Forest and Dairy Development Minister, K Raju said here on Tuesday that it had been decided in principle to form the multi-crore facility in association with the NABARD. The Rs 53.93 crore facility would be set up in northern Malappuram district, under the MILMA's Malabar Regional union using NABARD's infrastructure investment fund. Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (KCMMF) is popularly known as MILMA. According to the Dairy Development Department sources here, a milk powder production factory is essential in the southern state at a time when Kerala was heading to self- sufficiency in milk production. Milk procurement, through co-operatives, has set an all-time record in the state and the excess milk has to be powdered and stored, an official statement said here. "There was a major crisis due to lower milk consumption during the time of Covid-19 pandemic. In this backdrop, the idea of having an own milk powder production factory was conceived on the instructions of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan," it said. The existing milk powder factory in the state has been non-operational for long due to outdated technology.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-to-set-up-own-milk-powder-factory-with-nabard-support-910828.html

The hand-written letters are being sent to the Poes Garden residence of Rajinikanth for the past two days, even as RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy dropped more hints about the actor's political plunge in the form of a cartoon in Tughlak, a Tamil magazine edited by him. The magazine also published an article saying Rajinikanth's decision has brought smiles on the faces of the DMK and AIADMK which are happy about not facing a "strong challenge" and split of votes respectively. The article and cartoon comes two days after Gurumurthy met Rajinikanth and discussed the political situation in the state. The cartoon, though in poor taste, depicts two donkeys looking at a newspaper article titled "Rajinikanth launching a party is doubtful." The cartoon also depicts the "two donkeys" as saying "If this is true, one from our gang will come to power. There will be no problem." Twitter users shared the front page of the magazine and interpreted the cartoon as depicting the two Dravidian parties -- DMK and AIADMK -- as "donkeys" and condemned it. Gurumurthy is widely believed to have been advising Rajinikanth on his political entry. On October 29, Rajinikanth had dropped enough hints that his much-anticipated entry into politics may not happen during the 2021 Assembly polls as announced three years back, citing his vulnerability to the novel coronavirus. After his statement, fans have been appealing to Rajinikanth to take the political plunge with some even claiming that he does not have to come out of his home for the campaign as technology allows him to garner votes by sitting at home. While a few wore t-shirts asking Rajinikanth to come to politics and posed for pictures outside the actor's bungalow, some have resorted to sending letters. The 'inland' letter cards ask Rajinikanth to take the plunge to "retrieve Tamil Nadu's pride" and to make Tamil Nadu "corruption-free." The statement on Thursday last was a clear indication that Rajinikanth was reconsidering his decision to take a plunge in politics by launching his own political party. The actor had on the last day of 2017 announced he will launch a party ahead of the 2021 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/take-the-plunge-and-reclaim-tamil-nadu-fans-encourage-rajinikanth-910843.html

The incident took place in the Padinjarathara forest areas of Banasura, about 30 kilometres from Kalpetta town, by around 9.15 am. The deceased is yet to be identified, while a search is being carried out for other members. Police sources said that the incident took place by around 9.15 am. The Thunderbolt commandos were carrying out routine patrolling in the forest areas near Meenmutty waterfalls near Banasura when the suspected Maoists were spotted. There were around five Maoists and most were in uniform. In a subsequent exchange of firing one was killed while others managed to escape. A riffle was recovered from the spot. Senior police officers rushed to the spot and combing was launched in the area. Police claimed that the Maoists opened the fire initially and hence the Thunderbolt commandos were forced to retaliate in defence. Though the identity of the deceased was not yet known, it was suspected that the deceased, aged around 35, was a Tamilnadu native and a member of the Kabani Dalam of the Maoists in the region.  The police have cordoned off the area and the public and media were not allowed to proceed to the spot.  The fresh incident took place close on the heels of allegations that the killing of a Maoist local leader C P Jaleel at a resort at Lakkidi near Vythiri in Wayanad last year was a fake encounter. Three Maoists, including a woman, were killed in another encounter at Palakkad district last year. Meanwhile, the incident on Tuesday also triggered protest with Congress raising suspicions of a fake encounter and alleging that the Pinarayi Vijayan government was killing Maoists. Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that as many as eight Maoists were killed after the Pinarayi Vijayan government came to power in Kerala and it was quite surprising that Maoists were being killed during the regime of a Communist government. A detailed probe was required into the present incident especially since there were allegations of fake encounter with regard to the earlier incidents. A section in the CPM, as well as the CPI, were also not favouring killing of Maoists. According to an official statement from the police, the deceased has been identified as Velmurugan, 33, of Anna Nagar colony at Periyakulam in Theni district of Tamil Nadu. He was involved in instigating the tribal community members to fight against the government, imparting arms training and recruiting people to such groups. Cases are pendingagainst him at several police stations in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/maoist-killed-in-encounter-with-kerala-police-at-wayanad-910857.html

According to police, 28-year old Jeevanandam of Thondamuthur on the outskirts hanged himself at his house on Monday night after losing money in online gambling even as his wife had been objecting to the man indulging in it. The deceased, running a computer sales and service centre in partnership, had set aside Rs 50,000 to be given to his friend. However, he lost Rs 20,000 in online rummy. Unable to bear the loss and due to mental depression, Jeevanandam hanged himself in his house. Similarly, 32-year old Jayachandran, a lathe operator in Sundarapuram, hanged himself at his house Monday night. Jayachandran had borrowed money to undergo heart surgery two years ago and was not able to repay it in full. It was said that Jayachandran has become an online gambling addict recently and had stopped going to work, police, quoting his relatives, said. As he was not not able to win the required amount, he became mentally upset and ended his life. Further investigations are on, police said. A private bank employee of Seereanaickenpalayam in the city had died by suicide in his house for similar reason a couple of days ago. The opposition Pattali Makkal Katchi had recently urged the Central government to take immediate steps to prohibit all kinds of online gambling alleging it was highly addictive and several people, who lost their money have ended their lives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/two-men-addicted-to-online-gambling-end-lives-in-tamil-nadu-910868.html

The team has unravelled the mechanism by which insulin overload in the body causes insulin resistance that is associated with diabetes. The results of the research work that was funded by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) grant have recently been published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. "Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is used by cells to absorb glucose from the blood. Type 2 diabetes results when cells lose their ability to use insulin due to a variety of reasons. Insulin resistance is intricately linked to a condition called hyperinsulinemia, in which there is excess insulin traversing the bloodstream. The relationship between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is cyclic - each increases the occurrence of the other," said Prosenjit Mondal, Associate Professor, School of Basic Sciences, IIT Mandi. "While it is obvious how insulin resistance leads to hyperinsulinemia - when cells cannot use the insulin, it just remains in the blood - the converse of how hyperinsulinemia increases insulin resistance has hitherto remained unclear. We have known that one of the causes of insulin resistance is inflammation," he added. The researchers identified a critical protein molecule - SIRT1 which is repressed in hyperinsulinemia.  "The team has found that low dose naltrexone (LDN), a drug commonly administered for opiate addiction, can activate SIRT1, thereby reducing inflammation and increasing insulin sensitivity of cells.The significance of this discovery is enormous," Mondal said. Naltrexone is already an Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that is used for the treatment of opioid addiction and can easily be repurposed for inflammation reduction and diabetes control. "The research team intends to study this thread further to understand the mechanistic aspects of LDN's effects on hyperinsulinemia-induced inflammation and resulting insulin resistance," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/anti-opioid-addiction-drugs-can-reverse-adverse-effects-of-type-2-diabetes-iit-mandi-research-910873.html

Assistant Solicitor General L Victoria Gowri told the court that the trial will commence on November 11 as the CBI has filed its report with regard to the case. She informed the court while it was hearing the bail petitions of suspended policemen S Murugan and Raghu Ganesh. The court refused them bail.  P Jeyaraj (61), and his 31-year-old son Emmanuel Bennix were arrested on June 19 by Sathankulam police and they died within a few hours of each other a few days later, succumbing to injuries sustained in the police custody. The Madurai Bench took suo motu cognisance of the case and asked the CB-CID to begin investigations till the time the CBI took over.  The CBI had last week concluded that the father-son duo was arrested "illegally" and was tortured during the police custody.  Busting "every lie" of the police version, the CBI investigation concluded that Jeyaraj and Bennix were innocent having committed no crime but were arrested due to a "criminal conspiracy" hatched by the policemen, and beaten up and tortured for hours by making them "bow down" on a wooden table with just underwear on them. The father-son duo was tortured inside the police station by nine policemen, who took turns to beat them up, at the instigation of inspector Sridhar, who "prodded the staff" to start "fresh rounds of beating" when there was a lull, the charge sheet said. Besides Sridhar, the charge sheet blamed sub-inspectors K Balakrishnan, P Raghuganesh, head constables S Murugan, A Samadurai, and police constables M Muthuraja, S Chelladurai, X Thomas Francis, and S Veilumuthu for the crime.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/trial-in-father-son-duo-custodial-death-to-commence-on-november-11-910900.html

The incident happened on Monday when Chandra Babu, a resident of Ochira in Kerala's Kollam district, had kept his mobile phone, which was connected to a charger, under his pillow while sleeping. According to local sources, the pillow caught fire with Babu, a truck diver by profession, suffering minor burns on his shoulder and left arm. The phone was also partially charred. Babu was admitted to the nearby government hospital. The phone was quite old and an electric short circuit from the phone could have been the reason behind the mishap, they said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-man-suffers-burns-after-charging-mobile-phone-kept-under-pillow-catches-fire-910916.html

The voting percentage in the rural assembly constituency could be revised with a compilation of the final voting numbers. Dubbaka had recorded over 86 per cent voting in the Telangana assembly elections of December 2018. The BJP appeared upbeat with the high voter turnout. “Dubbaka voters have today decided that the BJP is the right party to take on the dictatorial regime in Telangana,” state unit chief Bandi Sanjay said. The BJP, which has set the target of claiming power in Telangana in 2023, took the by-polls as a challenge and has canvassed extensively. The ruling TRS and the BJP were engaged in a high voltage campaign for the polls that emerged as a close contest between the two. TRS leaders who initially stated the BJP's effort to save deposits were seen concentrating their political attacks on the saffron party over the last two-three weeks. BJP contestant Raghunandan Rao stood third in Dubbaka in the previous polls, whereas TRS's Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy won in 2014 and 2018. The by-polls were necessitated by the death of Ramalinga Reddy in August, due to cardiac arrest. The TRS has fielded Solipeta's widow Sujatha as its candidate. 23 candidates were in the by-polls arena, including the Congress nominee Cheruku Srinivas. Raghunandan's attachment to the constituency over the last two assembly polls and the 2019 general elections when he was the Medak Lok Sabha candidate and his connection with the youth are said to be working in BJP's favour. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's nephew and finance minister Harish Rao has led the TRS campaign promising development in the constituency sitting in contrast with the neighboring, high profile Gajwel, Siddipet, and Sircilla – all three constituencies represented by CM Rao's family. Covid-19 patients were allowed to vote between 5 and 6 PM and all those in the queue lines by 6 PM were also permitted to vote. The Telangana turnout is the highest in the country on Tuesday Phase-2 polls, after Nagaland.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dubbaka-by-poll-bjp-upbeat-with-the-high-voter-turnout-910990.html

Adding further to the woes of the industry, which has already suffered losses this year due to the lockdown and dip in sales owing to Covid-19 scare, is a fresh case before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking a ban on bursting of crackers in the National Capital Region (NCR). Rajasthan contributes to 12 percent of the market share for the fireworks' manufactures who rake in nearly Rs 400 crores a year by selling crackers in the northern state. The manufacturers in Sivakasi, 540 km from here, say the industry would suffer a "permanent damage" if other state governments follow suit. They said the ban by Rajasthan Government is wrong at "many levels" as majority of the products that go out of their factories have been certified as "green crackers" by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), a constituent lab of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Green crackers are found to reduce emission of 2.5 particulate material by 30 to 35 percent and emit 125 decibels compared to 160 emitted by conventional crackers. "Even a single state banning firecrackers is a setback for the industry. We will implead in the case before NGT. We will tell the court on how the industry has followed the Supreme Court instructions on producing green crackers and argue that the ban was unnecessary since green crackers are proved to be less emission crackers," P Ganesan, President, Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA), told DH. He added that TANFAMA would move the Supreme Court if they do not get a favourable order from NGT in the case filed by Indian Social Responsibility Network. Deepavali will be celebrated across India on November 14. Another manufacturer said if the ban in Rajasthan is not lifted and a ban in NCR comes into effect, production for next year will be delayed by a few months, resulting in losses to the tune of crores of rupees yet again. "We begin production based on orders from dealers. If the ban in Rajasthan is not lifted, why will the dealers there place new orders when they have huge stockpile. The dealers will wait till the stock is over. If there is no orders, the production will not begin. Banning firecrackers at the last minute will finish off the industry as over 80 percent of stocks have already been moved to north Indian states," he said. P N Deva, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) secretary of Virudhunagar district, said any delay in production would affect the labourers more than the manufacturers. “Already the labourers went jobless for 55 due to lockdown and if the factories do not open immediately after Deepavali, they will be put to severe inconvenience. Labourers depend on daily wages and any further shut down of factories will only aggravate their sufferings,” he said. Fireworks' manufacturers in Sivakasi begin production for the next Deepavali a few weeks after the festivities end based on advance payment from dealers and buyers across the country. T Kannan of The Indian Fireworks' Manufacturers Association (TIFMA) said Rajasthan is one of the major markets for the industry and questioned the need for banning firecrackers which is burst on the day of Deepavali while allowing polluting industries to run through the year. "We want to know why are we being targeted all the time. Why is that a petition is being filed at the last minute? Our firecrackers are approved by government-appointed bodies and yet we are accused of polluting the air. Firecrackers dissipate within a few hours but what about industries that continue to pollute round-the-clock?" he asked. The fireworks' industry is worth anywhere between Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore and was hoping to recover from the losses due to a slew of court cases this year. But Covid-19 threatens to spoil the anticipated recovery.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rajasthans-ban-on-crackers-and-case-in-ngt-give-jitters-to-sivakasi-911006.html

"We don’t want to exercise our jurisdiction, but we are not happy with how this recommendation has been pending for two years," a bench presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao said. "We want the Governor to pass orders. Inform us what can be done in such situations where the Governor makes such recommendations. What is it the court can do in such cases? Can we ask the Governor to do that as has been done in earlier cases," the bench asked senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayana. The court also asked the counsel, appearing for one of the convicts, A G Perarivalan, to tell what the law and cases were which can allow it to exercise its jurisdiction.  Posting the plea for parole filed by Perarivalan for consideration on November 25, the bench suggested the counsel to go through the Shatrughan Chauhan case and, do some research to enable the court to pass its order. Sankaranarayana said the remission file was pending after the recommendation of the state government for more than two years now. He said the petitioner wanted parole with multiple co-morbid illnesses and high chances of getting Covid-19 infection in the prison. "We have no option but to approach this court now," he said. During the hearing, the court asked Tamil Nadu's Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan, "Why is the Governor taking so much time?" To this, Srinivasan said this was a case of a larger conspiracy and the Governor was waiting for a report from the CBI.  Notably, the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) was probing into unravelling a larger conspiracy into the case. The bench, however, reminded him that larger conspiracy only dealt with whether other persons were involved.  Sankaranarayanan, however, said he would file a compilation of cases. In Nilofer Nisha case, it was a batch of cases arising out of a remission notification and the court exercised their powers under 142 to release the prisoners. As far as remission is concerned, it is the prerogative of the Governor and is not under the Criminal Procedure Code, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-sc-expresses-displeasure-on-pendency-of-remission-matter-with-tn-governor-for-two-years-911008.html

Enraged over his wife’s reported illicit relationship, Shivakumar, a private school teacher in Holalkere of Chitradurga district, had murdered his wife Shwetha (26) and her paramour Vedamurthy (27) at different locations. In less than 48 hours of the double murders, the Davangere police had nabbed Shivakumar from his sister’s house in Bengaluru. Kumar was furious after his wife Shwetha eloped with Vedamurthy. He planned to bump off the duo. Accordingly, he took his brother Shivaraj’s help and strangled Vedamurthy to death in Honnali on October 28. The duo threw Murthy’s body in Tungabhadra river. A day later, Kumar killed his wife in similar fashion and threw her body in a well off Birur Road on the outskirts of Channagiri, Superintendent of Police Hanumantaraya told reporters. Hunt is on to apprehend Kumar’s brother and the partner in the crime Shivaraj.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/dgere-twin-murders-police-nab-one-hunt-for-accomplice-910980.html

After coming to power last year, the Yediyurappa administration had frozen works approved for all 224 Assembly constituencies under a special grant of Rs 943.48 crore by the Congress-JD(S) coalition.  In the first phase, the government has released funds worth Rs 368.87 crore to 65 constituencies, mostly those represented by the BJP, according to data tabled in the recent legislature session.  The list also includes Badami that is represented by Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and Channapatna that elected JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy. State Congress president DK Shivakumar’s Kanakapura is conspicuously missing.  “Basically, the first round of unfreezing was done based on political considerations,” a senior official from the Rural Development & Panchayat Raj (RDPR) department said. “Works of the ruling party MLAs and, selectively, those of other legislators were unfrozen.” The unfreezing of development funds comes at a time when legislators, especially in the BJP, are miffed with the administration as their constituencies are starved for grants. Also, grants are being freed up amid persistent chatter that Yediyurappa will not hold the top post until the next Assembly election.   The Covid-19 pandemic had forced Yediyurappa to put a leash on fund use, stipulating that all releases must be vetted by the finance department controlled by him. “He is set to unfreeze most of the funds now,” the official said, adding that Opposition MLAs were approaching the CM individually to get their constituency works cleared.  Apparently, Yediyurappa is likely to unfreeze works of constituencies that have JD(S) legislators in a move seen as the CM's gesture of goodwill towards the regional party for going soft on the government and a possible political realignment going forward.  This tilt towards the JD(S) is evident in the list of 50 Assembly segments that have been given Rs 187 crore under the 3054 head of account that deals with road maintenance: nine JD(S) segments against six of the Congress.  The BJP has rejected reports that the party's central leadership was considering changing Yediyurappa, who is a Lingayat. However, a group called Lingayat-Veerashaiva Samanvaya Vedike on Sunday held a meeting to discuss names the BJP can consider for the CM’s post.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-unfreezes-rural-grants-to-douse-legislators-ire-910589.html
03-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Now, gangrene risk for some Covid-19 patients||Doctors are increasingly seeing Covid-19 survivors with digital ischemia (or blue-toe syndrome) which is a painful and often disfiguring condition. In the case of a 58-year-old woman, however, the “blue” toes actually signified a more serious and rare condition that nearly took her life. Dr C N Manjunath, director of Jayadeva Hospital, explained that ischemia, which means decreased blood supply, is caused by the formation of a blood clot which accumulates in the arteries of the legs and the hands. In Covid-19 survivors, it is triggered by heart inflammation. The ischemia is evinced by an unmistakable blue or purple-coloured discolouration, but the condition also leads to tissue loss and can affect a patient’s quality of life. “It depends on where the clot forms. If it is in the heart, it can trigger a heart attack,” Dr Manjunath said. He added, “If it is in the brain, it can lead to a neurological problem, and if it is in the extremities, it can lead to gangrene. While Covid-19 is commonly thought of as being a pulmonary disease, we see ischemia in one-third of Covid-19 survivors. Age is not a factor.” According to Dr U Vasudeva Rao, a vascular surgeon at Manipal Hospitals, Jayanagar, a delay in getting treatment for ischemia led to the amputation of limbs of a Covid-19 survivor in his late 50’s as gangrene had set in. The problem of ischemia is serious enough, but in the case of one senior citizen who was diagnosed with Covid-19 on September 1, its appearance concealed something more sinister. As a Covid patient, she had fever while also suffering from poorly controlled diabetes and mild renal failure. Following oxygen therapy, she was discharged 15 days later. However, on October 20, she turned up at Manipal Hospitals in Jayanagar, reporting severe pain in the left lower limbs and a swelling of both lower limbs. Dr Rao, who was assigned to her case, found that she had probable abscess in the spleen. Over the next few days, she developed bluish discoloration of toes on the left foot. The medicos initially thought that she might have the blue-toe syndrome. “A CT Scan of the abdomen confirmed a large abscess in the spleen. Antibiotics and anticoagulation drugs were used but there was no significant improvement even after five days,” Dr Rao said. When the doctors repeated an echocardiogram, they discovered bacterial growth in the patient’s mitral valve of the heart. “We were stunned to find that she had a rare condition called Subacute Bacterial Endocarditis,” Dr Rao added. The “blue toes” were due to micro emboli from the bacterial infection getting released in the circulation, he added. According to Dr Manjunath, Bacterial Endocarditis is rare. Only a handful of cases have been reported worldwide.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/now-gangrene-risk-for-some-covid-19-patients-910590.html

He said the government will not remain silent when 'Jihadis' strip the dignity of women in the state. The statement comes days after the Allahabad High Court held that conversion of religion for the purpose of marriage was illegal. Earlier, BJP-ruled states UP, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh had announced their intention to introduce legal provisions against 'love jihad'. "On the lines of Allahabad High Court's order, Karnataka will enact a law banning religious conversions for the sake of marriage. We will not remain silent when Jihadis strip the dignity of our sisters," Ravi tweeted. He said any one involved in any act of conversion shall face severe and swift punishment. The Allahabad High Court in its order on October 31 said that religious conversion just for the sake of marriage was not valid. The court made the remark while dismissing a plea by a newly married couple in Uttar Pradesh that had approached it to direct police and the woman's father not to disturb their marital life. In the petition, it was stated that the couple got married in July this year, but family members of the woman were interfering in their marital life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-to-enact-law-banning-religious-conversions-for-marriages-c-t-ravi-910748.html

Poor voter turnout marked the Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypoll with a polling percentage of only 39.15, whereas in Sira 77.34 per cent voting took place till 5 pm, according to the office of the Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar. The death of Sira JD(S) MLA B Satyanarayana in August and the resignation of RR Nagar Congress MLA Munirathna from the assembly last year led to the bypolls. Till 9 am the voting did not pick up in both the constituencies as about 8 per cent voting took place. It picked up in Sira at 11 am with 23.63 per cent but there was slight increase in RR Nagar with 14.44 per cent polling. By 3 pm, the voting percentage was 62.1 in Sira and 32.41 in RR Nagar. According to information received from the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, polling started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm in the two constituencies with a voting population of 6,78,012, including 3,26,114 women. There are 1,008 polling stations, comprising 678 in RR Nagar and 330 in Sira, Chief Electoral Officer Sanjiv Kumar said in a statement. In view of the pandemic, the standard protocol of face masks was made mandatory for the voters as well as the polling staff. Arrangements were made for thermal screening and hand sanitisers made available at the polling stations. Security was beefed up around the polling stations. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (city corporation) had made separate arrangements for coronavirus- infected people to cast their votes in RR Nagar. There are 31 candidates in the fray in the bypolls -- 15 in Sira and 16 in RR Nagar, including those from the Congress, BJP and the JD(S). In RR Nagar, the BJP has fielded former Congress MLA Munirathna as its candidate whereas the Congress has given a ticket to H Kusuma, wife of former IAS officer late D K Ravi in the seat traditionally held by the party. The JD(S) has fielded V Krishnamurthy. In Sira, the BJP, Congress, and JD(S) have fielded radiologist Dr Rakesh Gowda, former minister T B Jayachandra and former (JD-S) MLA B Satyanarayana's wife Ammajamma respectively.

03-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka promulgates land reform ordinance again||Karnataka has re-promulgated the controversial ordinance on land reforms, allowing non-agriculturists to buy farmlands. The Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, was given assent to by Governor Vajubhai R Vala and gazetted on November 2. The government had first promulgated the ordinance in July. A Bill seeking to replace it was passed in the Legislative Assembly, but failed to get approval in the Legislative Council during the monsoon session of the legislature in September. As a result, the government had to promulgate the ordinance anew. The ordinance allows non-agriculturists to buy agricultural land and removes the income limit for purchase of land. In response to protests from some farmers’ groups and the Opposition Congress, the government withdrew the proposed amendment to increase the ceiling on land holding from 10 units to 20 units for an individual without family or a family up to four people and from 20 units to 40 units for large families above five people. Each unit of land is 5.4 acres. Similarly, the government would have to re-promulgate two other ordinances that did not get legislative approval: one on freeing up agricultural trading and another on labour reforms. The Industrial Disputes and Certain Other Laws (Karnataka Amendment) Ordinance, would make only those establishments that employ 300 or more persons to seek the government's permission for closure, retrenchment or layoff. Similarly, worker thresholds will be increased from 10 to 20 in units which use power and from 20 to 40 in factories that do not use power. Also, the overtime work of any quarter will go up from 75 to 125 hours. The Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation and Development) (Amendment) Ordinance curtails the powers of local Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) and private individuals can start agricultural trading - buying and selling - if they hold a permanent account number. An ordinance will be valid for six months, after which it has to be enacted as a law. An ordinance will lapse after six weeks once both houses of the legislature are in session.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-promulgates-land-reform-ordinance-again-910908.html

03-11-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka Bypolls: Sira clocks 82% polling, RR Nagar stops at 45%||A contrast in voting patterns marked the Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar bypolls on Tuesday. While the Sira constituency in Tumakuru district witnessed brisk polling with a total voter turnout of 82.31%, voting in the urban Rajarajeshwari Nagar segment, characteristic of urban centres, was at a slack pace, ending at 45.24%. According to the Election Commission, Tuesday's voter turnout was the lowest in Rajarajeshwari Nagar since the 2013 assembly election (56.8%), the 2015 BBMP election (50.17%), the 2018 assembly election (54.34%) and the 2019 Lok Sabha election (53.65%). Sira recorded 84% turnout in the 2018 assembly polls. The bypolls were among the first in Karnataka since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. They were held with special precautions and arrangements were made for even Covid-19 patients to exercise their franchise. As many as 148 Covid-19 positive voters, clad in PPE kits, voted in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In Sira, 38 Covid-19 patients exercised their franchise. The outcome of these bypolls will not matter much to the ruling BJP in terms of its numerical strength in the Assembly. However, for Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, winning both seats would stamp his authority amid talk of a change in leadership. The bypolls are seen as a litmus test for KPCC president DK Shivakumar - this is his first electoral challenge after taking over as the chief. Also, both seats have a sizable number of Vokkaligas, the community he belongs to. It is also said that the outcome of these bypolls will be a precursor to the upcoming BBMP and gram panchayat elections. Poll managers say the Sira contest could be a photo-finish because of the triangular contest. Based on the turnout at Sira, the JD(S) camp was upbeat and the party hopes to retain the seat riding on sympathy for its candidate and support from Vokkaliga voters. The Congress is also confident of a victory, without ruling out a good fight from the BJP, a party that has never won here. In Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the low turnout could bode well for the ruling BJP. However, the Congress claims to have made ground in the run-up to poll day, just enough to claim that its candidate might just make it narrowly. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel was confident of the party securing wins in both the constituencies. "Voters who have seen the development programmes of the state government and the manner in which it handled the Covid-19 pandemic will definitely back the party," he said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-bypolls-sira-clocks-82-polling-rr-nagar-stops-at-45-910942.html

The decision to reopen colleges from November 17 was taken on October 28, but till date, no official order has been issued to the universities or colleges. This has created confusion over-communicating to students. Speaking to DH, the vice-chancellor of a state-run university said, “We have non-Karnataka students, to whom we need to communicate early. But there is no clarity yet about the reopening yet, as we have not received the official order.” “It is not easy to conduct classes. We need to prepare accommodation for students along with food. It is like rearranging everything after 6 months and it takes time. It would be helpful for us to be prepared if we get the official order,” said another vice-chancellor. Officials from the department of higher education said, “the SOP is getting ready and the order, along with SOP, will be issued by Wednesday.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-government-delays-issuing-of-sops-colleges-worried-910969.html

A team headed by Dr Roy Patankar, director and gastroenterologist, Zen Multispeciality Hospital extracted the tumour by performing a rare surgery. Now, the patient has been discharged and can eat and swallow properly. The line of treatment needed to be precise so that there was no damage to the food pipe and surrounding important blood vessels as complications could have led to a risk to life. The patient, Mohammad Asif Khan, a working professional, was living a smooth life until he faced bleeding and vomiting from food pipe. After an endoscopy was performed, it was confirmed that a tumour was growing in the food pipe. He was facing difficulty in swallowing food. He was having acid reflux in the upper portion of the abdomen. After taking treatment at various hospitals in Mumbai, he was referred to Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Chembur, Mumbai. Said Patankar said, “On arrival in an emergency, the patient was vomiting and had difficulty in breathing. An endoscopy carried out suggested that there was a tumour located in the food pipe. A tumour may occur when the cells in the lining of the esophagus grow out of control. It was later confirmed to be a rare kind of tumour called leiomyoma.” “During surgery, an endoscopy was done to see the tear in the food pipe. This is a rare laparoscopic surgery as usually this type of tumour requires opening the chest and extracting the tumor by creating passage. In case of delay in treatment, the tumor may spread, and cure may become next to impossible,” Dr Patankar added. “After surgery, he is able to swallow and eat food properly. We thank the doctors for saving his life,” said the patient’s brother Tarique Khan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/rare-surgery-performed-to-remove-tumour-from-esophagus-910631.html

Abhimanyu Pawar, BJP legislator from Ausa in Latur district, in a complaint to Latur SP Nikhil Pingle said action should be taken against Bachchan and Sony Entertainment Television over a question asked during Friday's Karamveer special episode. "There was an attempt to insult Hindus and create discord between Hindus and Buddhists who have been living in harmony," Pawar tweeted, posting a copy of his two-page letter to the police official. The episode had social activist Bezwada Wilson and actor Anup Soni in the hot seat opposite Bachchan, who asked the following question, worth Rs 6.40 lakh: On 25th December 1927, Dr B R Ambedkar and his followers burned copies of which scripture? The options were: (A) Vishnu Purana (B) Bhagavad Gita, (C) Rigved and (D) Manusmriti. Bachchan then said, "In 1927, Ambedkar condemned the ancient Hindu text Manusmriti to ideologically justify caste discrimination and untouchability and burned its copies." "All the four options pertained to Hindu religion. It is clear that the motive behind this question was to hurt the sentiments of Hindus," Pawar said in his police complaint. "This question spreads the message that Hindu religious scriptures are meant for burning and triggers enmity between Hindus and followers of Buddhism," said Pawar, who was a close aide of Devendra Fadnavis while he was Maharashtra chief minister. The KBC episode question annoyed some netizens who accused the show of running a "leftist propaganda", while others said it hurt Hindu sentiments. Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri shared a clip from the show on micro-blogging site Twitter, claiming KBC was "hijacked by Commies". "Innocent kids, learn this is how culture wars are won.

The police have claimed that the money was supplied by a Congress worker to influence voters ahead of polling. Karjan is one of the eight constituencies in the state where voting commenced at 7 am. "We have arrested two persons with unaccounted cash of Rs 57,700. We suspect that it was meant to influence the election process," inspector A A Desai of Karjan police said. While Sohail Chauhan (27) and Vidhnesh Patel (27) were arrested, one Meet Patel, who had allegedly supplied the cash, is still at large, it was stated. The accused have been booked under section 188 of the IPC for violating a notification by the Election Commission regarding possession of cash during voting. According to the FIR, the accused's car was intercepted by the police near Ropa village at around midnight and cash was allegedly found in their possession. When asked about the source of the money, the duo claimed that it was given to them by Patel, a Congress worker, the report stated. The duo told the on-duty police that Patel had asked them to call him once they reached the village, as only he knew to whom the cash was to be handed over to, the FIR said. Meanwhile, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) for Gujarat S Murali Krishna took cognisance of two viral videos, which purportedly suggest that BJP workers are distributing money to influence voters in Karjan. In one of the videos, a man can be seen handing over currency notes to four persons sitting in an autorickshaw and asking them to vote for BJP by "pressing the button with the lotus symbol". "I have seen both the videos. I have asked the Vadodara district election officer to conduct an inquiry into it. A detailed report is awaited," Murali Krishna told reporters in Gandhinagar. While polling is taking place in a peaceful manner at all eight constituencies, the CEO said Morbi district election officer has been asked to probe a claim that BJP's pamphlets were distributed near a polling booth. A detailed probe was also ordered into an allegation of bogus voting at Gedi village under Limbdi constituency of Surendranagar district, he said. However, the primary investigation has suggested that the claims were false, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/two-held-with-cash-of-over-rs-57000-ahead-of-gujarat-bypoll-910770.html

A bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik heard victim Nisar Ahmed Bilal's advocate B A Desai on Tuesday and posted the application for a detailed hearing on November 25. Former Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Purohit, opposed Bilal's application. Rohatgi argued that Purohit had sought for quashing of charges against him as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) failed to get a prior sanction under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to prosecute him. Since the plea was on the procedural ground of the sanction, it did not warrant any intervention by the victims, Rohatgi told the bench. Section 197 of the CrPC lays down the procedure for prosecution of public servants and mandates that a prior sanction be sought from the government. Advocate Desai, however, urged the bench to implead his client as a party to the case and admit the intervention application since the victim had a right to be heard. In his plea, Bilal said he had lost his son in the Malegaon blast and therefore, he was an "aggrieved party" in the case who deserved to be heard. He also said he was an intervenor in the trial in the case that is going on before a special NIA court in the city. In September this year, Purohit filed a pleain the HC seeking that all charges in the case against him be quashed. He said the NIA, the prosecuting agency in the case, did not seek prior sanction under the CrPC to prosecute him. Therefore, the court couldn't have taken cognisance of the charges against him, he said in his plea. During the first hearing on his plea in September, advocate Rohatgi also told the bench that Purohit had been working for the Indian Army's military intelligence unit. He said Purohit had attended conspiracy meetings before the 2008 Malegaon blast as part of "discharging his duties" as a military intelligence officer. Therefore, the NIA should have sought prior sanction under section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute him. Rohatgi also said the Army reinstated Purohit in 2017 after the Supreme Court granted him bail. He further said the Supreme Court had recorded in its bail order that Purohit had been attending the meetings as part of discharging his duties. However, the NIA had opposed Purohit's plea. In an affidavit filed in the court in September, the agency said in attending the conspiracy meetings, Purohit was not working for the Army and therefore, no sanction under 197 of the CrPC was required for his prosecution. Purohit was arrested in the case in 2009. Six people were killed and 100 others injured when a bomb strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon town of Maharashtra's Nashik district on September 29, 2008. As per the NIA, the bike belonged to Purohit's co-accused and BJP MP Pragya Thakur.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/malegaon-blast-victim-moves-hc-to-intervene-in-purohits-plea-910791.html

Fearing arrest after the NCB summoned her in the case, Prakash has filed an anticipatory bail plea. In its reply before the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court, the central agency opposed Prakash's pre-arrest bail plea. It also moved an application seeking her presence during the hearing. Prakash's lawyer Abad Ponda said she was ready to cooperate with the investigation and to remain present at the NCB office. The prosecution assured the court that the NCB will not take any "coercive action" (such as arrest) against her till the next date of hearing. Judge G B Gurao adjourned the matter for hearing on November 7. The NCB, which had questioned Prakash earlier in September, has summoned her again "to join the investigation" but she did not turn up. City police had said on Monday that Prakash was "untraceable". According to NCB sources, Prakash was summoned again after the central agency allegedly seized 1.7 gm of hashish during a search at her residence here last month. The NCB, which is probing alleged nexus between drug peddlers and Bollywood celebrities which came to light after actor Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide in June, had summoned Prakash on October 28.

The DRT has cited an order passed by Gujarat high court in which it had fined a lawyer Rs 10,000 for smoking during the hearing while sitting in a car. The high court passed an order to circulate instructions to all lawyers to maintain a "dignified decorum while conducting the matter through video conferencing." The order had specified that lawyers should attend the proceeding either from their residence or office space. It barred appearing in the proceedings while sitting in a vehicle or open ground.
