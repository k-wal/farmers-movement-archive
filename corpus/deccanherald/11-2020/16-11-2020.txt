16-11-2020||In Perspective||Demystifying the ‘specialist’||As the Coronavirus pandemic in the United States continues unabated, one saw President Donald Trump angrily retort against Dr Anthony S Fauci for his views on how to contain the spread.  The President sounded disdainful of Dr Fauci’s expertise and has in the past questioned his scientific credentials and professionalism.   The Covid crisis has also seen a number of professionals writing articles, running webinars and appearing on television explaining the crisis and what can be done about it.  Though the world has never before seen any crisis of this magnitude and uncertainty, each of these professionals seemed to have a view on what needed to be done or not done.   Experts from organisations like the WHO globally or ICMR locally added to the ongoing discussions.  One is also seeing groups of professionals coming together and debunking the voices advocating wearing masks or practicing social distancing.  Amidst all this, how does one come to terms to the growing need for specialised professional competence in several areas of human existence?  The last century has shown how professionals have become essential to the very functioning of society itself.   Whether it is designing and building a house, styling your hair, fighting a war, policing the streets, educating children or curing disease, judging and punishing violators of law or those running the government, society is today increasingly conducting its business through professionals specially trained for these purposes. Whether it is our space programme or managing natural disasters, we have come to expect our specialists and the agencies that they populate to provide us with the solutions.    While dependence on such professionally-run institutions and individuals has grown over the last several decades, one is also seeing the growing crisis of confidence among the professions over the last decade and more.  Notwithstanding the several incidents of visible failures of professional action encountered in the recent past, the current Covid crisis itself needs to be analysed from this perspective.  From promoting the use of ventilation to the flawed recommendation of the use of several medicines like HCQ to experimenting with different anti-virals to advocating herd immunity, one can see how experts have delivered widely disparate and conflicting recommendations.    Information explosion and the growing belief that this enables societal betterment has further consolidated the specialist’s claim to extraordinary knowledge in matters of human importance.  Hyping up concepts like ‘scientific revolution’ and ‘knowledge economy’ have furthered the growth of elites and cemented their long-standing claim to a monopoly of knowledge.   Systems to determine professionals’ rights and freedoms, licensing mechanism setting norms on who will be allowed to practice and who needs to be kept out, has further mystified the world of specialisation and insulated the professionals from the ‘masses’ and created a halo effect.   Objective view Taking an objective view of the several national crises that are around us - the deteriorating cities, poverty, pollution, energy shortage – shows how they all seem to have roots in the very practices of science, technology and public policy that are being called upon to alleviate them.   Over time, some specialists have also tended to misappropriate knowledge in their own interests and the interest of a power elite intent on preserving its dominance over the rest of the society.   The ongoing Covid situation and the varied manner in which public health specialists, epidemiologists, virologists, cardiologists, mathematicians, policy experts, pharmacologists, public administrators and economists expressing views of their own has brought out the inadequacy of their specialisation and demonstrated how insulated each of them are from the others.  Apart from the resulting confusion, it has also exposed the claims of specialists in providing timely solutions to society in times of crisis.    Considering the reality of the ‘specialists’ having crowded out the people with traditional wisdom and community knowledge, it is now critical that they come to terms with not just their expertise but also their lack of expertise. This is a timely moment for professionals to learn not just to operate from the zones of their competence but also from their zones of incompetence.   They need to learn to work collaboratively, explore embedded community knowledge systems and learn to be less prescriptive and more reflective.  As India moves towards implementing the national education policy, universities need to now embed these sensitivities in their graduates and make higher education immersive and experiential.    While the coronavirus pandemic has thrown life out of gear and made each individual experience the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) scenario firsthand, this may also be the opportunity to take a relook at this world increasingly driven by experts and specialists.   This could be the opportune time to find the balance between competence and common sense, between being directive and seeking engagement, between knowing and seeking to know and between having solutions and seeking them from communities.  Only by demystifying and democratising knowledge can the world of specialists regain their losing credibility and help in making this world a better place.   (The writer is the founder and Chairman of GRAAM, a public policy thinktank and is a visiting professor at Cornell University, USA)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/demystifying-the-specialist-916009.html

16-11-2020||Main Article||The state of states: Quest for equitable society||The Public Affairs Index (PAI) 2020, the annual assessment of sub-national governance released by the Public Affairs Centre last recently, provides interesting evidence-based insights on the state of the states. While the best-ranked states - Kerala (large states), Goa (small states), and Chandigarh (Union Territories) - made the headlines, the more important processes of economic and social transition underway in the country and its implications for future development praxis that the PAI points to, were mostly missed.  This is ironic because what the states do and how, or what they fail to do and why, are concerns that can scarcely be exaggerated. The PAI 2020 in essence, reflects these concerns through a scientific data analytics framework. It examines the central development challenges at the subnational level - growth, equity and sustainability - especially questions of what is happening in the disadvantaged geographies despite the best endeavours of the Central and state governments. A case in point would be the aspirational districts, to use the Niti Aayog’s euphemism, that are at the risk of being left behind in the development process. The PAI 2020, therefore, serves an important purpose: it draws attention to the reality that is India, or an approximation of it, and therefore not to be set aside lightly. If the governments are able to draw actionable insights from it that enable them to improve governance in the years ahead, it would be better still. A good starting point is to go back to basics: First, real obstacles stand in the path of a fuller understanding of the persistent inter-generational deprivation and loss of opportunity challenges, that appear to reproduce themselves, in parts of some states. To begin with, the influence of a ‘one size fits all’ approach on our development outlook has been pervasive; and the overwhelming majority of interventions, including the Centrally-sponsored schemes, designed and implemented uncritically and mechanically, unwittingly perhaps, subverting the doctrine of objective pluralism.  Second, the objective conditions for development across the states are not uniformly conducive to competitive federalism that the Niti Aayog aspires to. Consider these facts: On the human development index (HDI), India ranks 129 among 189 countries (UN HDI Report, 2019). Since the HDI is also a measure of multi-dimensional poverty, it is important to address the emerging factors - technology, climate change, and gender - of inequality. India faces a long road to a more equitable HDI across states, certainly longer than the road to a $5 Trillion economy.  There is a need to understand better why economic growth has not had the same poverty-reducing impact in some states relative to other similarly placed states. A sense of urgency must circumscribe the response to these persistent inequalities if the government’s emphasis on ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ is to translate to reality.  The evidence from PAI 2020 on the wide disparities in human development across the states, suggests that inequality is significantly more pronounced in India, than might first be supposed. If there is just one principle that we might draw from the PAI report, it must be to recognise the loss in percentage HDI due to inequality, especially high from both education and health. Third, there is a process of convergence occurring, even if slow, between the high performing states and the traditionally low performing states on several aspects of growth and equity. This is cause for cautious optimism. Indeed, if this trend were to continue, it can be argued that demographics favour the hitherto slow growing states because they have relatively younger populations.  It is therefore likely that the future growth drivers will come from some of these populous and resource endowed, but currently less developed states. It is also noteworthy that the progress made by some of these states on specific indicators has outpaced the high performing states. For instance, in the large states’ category, Bihar has emerged as the state with the most improvement on some of the equity indicators despite being at the bottom of the PAI 2020 rankings on the equity pillar.  Reducing malnutrition The state has shown improvement in reducing malnutrition besides being a top performer in the number of children enrolled in organised learning under the ICDS programme.  Contrast this with Kerala, dropping to the bottom of the delta rankings on equity, pointing to the fact that the state has shown the least improvement on some equity indicators in the time period studied. The stagnation in progress is attributable to specific indicators such as reduction in malnutrition, participation in organised learning, increase in the cases of crimes against SCs and STs, and cases of rapes. Finally, there is a pattern of a perceptible slowing down in progress on certain indicators in the traditional high growth states, and this should be a cause for concern. The worst performer in terms of the delta value in the growth pillar is Tamil Nadu which occupies the last position on the growth pillar in Delta rankings.  Similarly, Kerala and Karnataka - states that feature at the top of the PAI 2020 growth rankings - are eighth and tenth, respectively, in terms of Delta performance. This suggests that the states may be experiencing stagnation in growth which must be corrected.  From a political practice perspective, the evidence is clear: India represents a federal polity. In its development endeavour, sub-national governance is assuming a distinctly more significant role than before; and more specifically on human development, one that is proximate and arguably, more important than national governance.  The states constitute the foundational architecture for human development and must be trusted and supported. Yes, political economy collisions will occur from time to time, in a union of states of the kind India represents, sometimes resulting in an uneasy equilibrium, but one that under the circumstances must serve as the basis for cooperative federalism. In the quest for a just and equitable society, viewing the states as subalterns is not the best way of achieving this.

16-11-2020||National||A man of 'uncommon wisdom, decency,' Barack Obama describes Manmohan Singh||He adds that he had developed a “warm and productive” relationship with Congress leader after they first met in New Delhi in November 2010. “A gentle, soft-spoken economist in his seventies, with a white beard and a turban that were the marks of his Sikh faith but to the Western eye lent him the air of a holy man, he had been India’s finance minister in the 1990s, managing to lift millions of people from poverty. For the duration of his tenure as Prime Minister, I would find Singh to be wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest,” he reminisces in the book. “While he [Mr. Singh] could be cautious in foreign policy, unwilling to get out too far ahead of an Indian bureaucracy that was historically suspicious of US intentions, our time together confirmed my initial impression of him as a man of uncommon wisdom and decency; and during my visit to the capital city of New Delhi, we reached agreements to strengthen US cooperation on counterterrorism, global health, nuclear security, and trade,” he writes on Manmohan Singh’s foreign policy stance. Commenting on Singh’s rise to power, he says, “What I couldn’t tell was whether [Manmohan] Singh’s rise to power represented the future of India’s democracy or merely an aberration.” Manmohan Singh’s “restraint” against Pakistan after the November 2011 Mumbai attacks had cost him politically, Obama writes. “He [Mr. Singh] feared that rising anti-Muslim sentiment had strengthened the influence of India’s main opposition party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” Obama notes, quoting Singh further, “In uncertain times, Mr. President,’ the Prime Minister said, ‘the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it’s not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else.” The book mostly describes Obama’s first term from his perspective and hence lacks references to the rise of Narendra Modi and the former President’s relationship with the current Prime Minister. The second part of his memoir is expected to outline his relationship with Modi, however, a release date for the book is unknown.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/a-man-of-uncommon-wisdom-decency-barack-obama-describes-manmohan-singh-916078.html

He also said that democracy cannot survive without a free and fearless press. Naidu made the remarks in a video message at a webinar on 'Role of media during the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on media" organised by the Press Council of India to mark the National Press Day. He said press in India has always been at the vanguard of protecting and strengthening the foundations of democracy. "A robust, free and vibrant media is as important as an independent judiciary in consolidating democracy and strengthening constitutional rule of law," the Vice President opined. At the same time, Naidu advised the media to be fair, objective and accurate in its reporting. "Sensationalism should be avoided and the tendency to mix news with views needs to be curbed. Also, there should be greater space for development news in our reporting," he said. "Democracy cannot survive without a free and fearless press. Therefore, any attack on the freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests and should be opposed by one and all," he said. "My deepest appreciation to each and every journalist, cameraman and others, who have been striving constantly to disseminate news and information," he said. Naidu also stressed the importance of conveying the right information at the right time in a pandemic, "especially when there is a plethora of fake news". Pointing to the need to guard against unverified and unsubstantiated claims, the Vice President said media has a huge role in educating the masses in this regard. He also conveyed his condolences to the families of the journalists who succumbed to coronavirus. Referring to the adverse impact of Covid-19 crisis on the media industry, he said it has led some newspapers to curtail their editions and go digital. "There have been unfortunate instances of employees being laid off in both print and electronic media," Naidu said. Stating that journalists should not be left "high and dry" in these difficult times, the Vice President appealed to all stakeholders to come together and find innovative solutions to the extraordinary situation created by the pandemic. Observing that the pandemic has underscored the need for media organisations to adopt flexible and resilient business models, Naidu pointed out that more and more people were staying at home and increasingly relying on the media and the entertainment industry for the latest information and to fight the isolation caused by a lack of social interactions. Citing the huge popularity of the re-telecast of teleserial Ramayana and Mahabharata as an example, the Vice President suggested to the media industry to tap into increased audience base and explore alternative ways to improve its financial health.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/attack-on-freedom-of-press-detrimental-to-national-interests-vp-venkaiah-naidu-916147.html
16-11-2020||National||SC issues notice on plea against arrest of Kerala scribe on way to Hathras||The Supreme Court on Monday frowned upon people directly approaching the top court instead of the high courts and trial courts for seeking remedy against alleged illegal detention. Taking up a habeas corpus plea by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists' New Delhi unit against the arrest of scribe Siddique Kappan, a bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde, asked its counsel, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, why he hadn't approached the high court. "We are trying to discourage the Article 32 petition. There is a spate of Article 32 (writ jurisdiction) petitions (of the Constitution)," the bench said. "You have (earlier) interfered under Article 32," Sibal told the court in his defence. The counsel also pointed out that this was about a journalist who continued to be in jail. These are exceptional circumstances, he said, adding the lawyers were denied even meeting with the scribe. On this, the court issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and put the matter for consideration on Friday. "We will hear the matter this Friday. Let State of UP government counsel be here then," the bench said. In its applications, the association claimed there was a violation of fundamental rights, human rights, rule of law, creating "a lot of helplessness among the journalistic fraternity in discharging their duty fearlessly considering the fate of the present detenue".  It sought orders for the immediate release of Kappan and allowing its lawyers and his family members to regularly meet with the detenue. It also asked for a visit by the district judge to the New  Mathura jail to enquire about the violation of human rights as well as Covid-19 guidelines. The Uttar Pradesh police claimed to have arrested Sidhique and three others, Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Alam, on October 5 for allegedly having links with the Popular Front of India (PFI) and trying to disturb the peace and fomenting communal disharmony in the state. The association, for its part, claimed that Kappan was on his way to Hathras to cover the gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-issues-notice-on-plea-against-arrest-of-kerala-scribe-on-way-to-hathras-916154.html

Be it positive criticism or highlighting success stories, the media has been continuously adding strength to India's democratic ethos, the prime minister added in his written message on the day, being celebrated virtually with a webinar organised by the Press Council of India.   “From creating mass awareness about important issues to contributing to a behavioural change in society for the larger good, we have seen how the media as a valued stakeholder has furthered the efforts of the government and helped many initiatives like Swachh Bharat and water conservation grow into mass movements in the last few years," he said. In his message, read out by PCI chairperson C K Prasad, Modi said he was heartened to learn that the Council was celebrating the day. The webinar being held on the theme 'Role of media during the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the media' with participants from several other countries also reflects the "enabling power of technology”, he said.  The prime minister added that at a time the world is up against an unprecedented crisis in the form of Covid-19, the nation's fight against the pandemic is powered by the restraint and resolve of its 130 crore citizens.  “In such a scenario, the media has been continuously doing exceptional service by spreading awareness against the Covid pandemic. “In a post-Covid world, India is marching ahead with its resolve to build a strong and 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'. Media is giving our resolve the shape of a big campaign and carrying forward the message of 'Vocal for Local',” he said. The prime minister said the world is rapidly changing and there is need to harness India's entrepreneurial energy, intent and talent to expand this vision across all sectors. “With digital technology showing the way, Indian media's endeavour towards ensuring a stronger presence globally will strengthen our vibrant media landscape,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/media-doing-exceptional-work-in-spreading-awareness-against-covid-19-pm-narendra-modi-916171.html

Pant, who took over the role of India's cybersecurity chief, said every day, 4 lakh malware are found and 375 cyberattacks are witnessed. "In such unprecedented times, you mentioned two Cs – the challenge of corona and challenge of cyber. Actually, at the perch which I sit, there are 3 Cs. The third 'C' of course is on our northern border, which is another challenge that we are facing. "In such an environment, cyberattacks have gone up multi-fold. There are 4 lakh malware, we find every day. 375 cyberattacks take place," Pant said at an event organised by largest private sector lender HDFC Bank. He said apart from falling prey to voice call-based frauds, people should also be very careful about the clickbaits, which are deployed to extract information from an internet user. "This disease of just clicking on the link, this is another reason where the malware drops," he said, asking everybody to study the recent cases of frauds at City Union Bank where a person entered the core banking system through a click, and also the ones at Bangladesh Bank and Cosmos Bank. Vulnerabilities will continue to exist and the only solution against those is personal cyber hygiene and technological steps, Pant added. HDFC Bank launched the 'Mooh Bandh Rakho' campaign to create awareness through various mediums, including over 1,000 secure banking workshops and also a rap-song. Bank officials said the target is to focus on the youth. "The issue is some of us get unawares and that's how problems start occurring. It's a question of being conscious all the time, not a question of not knowing," its chief risk officer Jimmy Tata said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cyberattacks-up-multi-fold-in-current-environment-indias-cybersecurity-coordinator-rajesh-pant-916178.html
16-11-2020||National||India's daily Covid-19 recoveries more than daily fresh infections for 44 days in a row||India's trend of registering daily Covid-19 recoveries outpacing the daily infections continued for the 44th day as 43,851 patients recuperated in a span of 24 hours as against 30,548 newly detected cases, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday. This translates to a net reduction of 13,303 in the active Covid-19 caseload which now stands at 4,65,478 and accounts for 5.26 per cent of the total cases. "Daily new cases numbering 30,548 is a historic low that assumes significance given many countries in Europe and America are experiencing a continuous steep rise in daily new cases," the ministry said. The government's efforts to continue to maintain high levels of comprehensive testing have resulted in bringing down the net positivity to sustained low levels. The recovery rate has improved to 93.27 per cent as the total recovered cases have surged to 82,49,579. The ministry said that 78.59 per cent of the recovered cases reported in a span of 24 hours are from 10 states and union territories. Delhi saw the greatest number of recoveries as 7,606 confirmed cases recovered. Kerala registered 6,684 daily recoveries while West Bengal followed by reporting 4,480 new recoveries. Over 76 per cent of the new cases have been reported from 10 states and UTs. Kerala recorded 4,581 new cases. Delhi which saw a surge in new cases over the last few days reported only 3,235 new cases on Sunday, followed closely by West Bengal which reported 3,053 new cases. As much as 78.85 per cent of the 435 new deaths are concentrated in 10 states and UTs. About a fifth, 21.84 per cent of new fatalities reported are from Delhi which reported 95 deaths, overtaking Maharashtra. Maharashtra reported 60 fatalities, which is 13.79 per cent of the new fatalities, the ministry said. Fourteen states and UTs have death per million higher than the national average of 94 and 13 states and UTs have a case fatality rate higher than national average, the ministry said. The Union government is working in close coordination with these states and UTs to improve their clinical care management of the critical patients in the ICU, through a carefully developed standard of care protocol which covers the private and government hospitals and provides guidelines for hospitalised cases and those in home isolation. Multi-disciplinary central teams are also deputed to states/UTs to provide them support in Covid-19 management. High-level meetings are regularly conducted for review of the public health response measures being taken by the state and UT governments. The total coronavirus cases mounted to 88,45,127 with 30,548 infections being reported in a day while the death toll climbed to 1,30,070 with 435 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-daily-covid-19-recoveries-more-than-daily-fresh-infections-for-44-days-in-a-row-916182.html

Without naming Pakistan, he said one of India's immediate neighbours was indulging in state-sponsored cross-border terrorism. "We have in our immediate neighbourhood, a particularly egregious example of state-sponsored cross-border terrorism. The world is gradually becoming aware of the global nature of international terrorism," he said, in a virtual address at a programme organised by the Indian School of Business (ISB) here. The Minister added: "Our relentless efforts have kept it in the spotlight bringing out the related aspects like terror finance, radicalisation, and cyber recruitments". Talking about the Vande Bharat mission, he said India brought back more than 24 lakh of its nationals from other countries during the Covid-19 lockdown. The country also extended help in sending back over one lakh foreigners to their respective countries during the pandemic, he said. "More than 24 lakh of our people have been repatriated through flights by land and sea. From Air India to the Indian Navy, we pressed all our resources to achieve this goal," Jaishankar said. "The intention was very simple, today's India will not leave any Indian abroad in distress. After all we are in many ways a unique economy that is heavily reliant on mobility and migration. Our credibility depends on the assurance we provide to those abroad who contribute to progress at home," he added. Jaishankar said there were many lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic experience which will be reflected in coming times. The country's immediate focus was on economic recovery and the figures for September and October have "really been encouraging", he said. There was also a greater awareness globally about a more resilient supply chain and India can exploit the sentiment for additional engines of growth, by creating better conditions for production, he said. Explaining about India's capabilities in terms of medical equipment in the aftermath of Covid-19, he said the country currently has 15,000 dedicated facilities with 1.5 million isolation beds. Over a million of the population was being tested for the virus in more than 7,000 testing centres across the country. The challenge now is to take this ability to rise to the moment of crisis and transform that into a more routine set of practices and procedures, he opined. The world was not going to carry business as usual as the winds of change were blowing again. Those with the more self- centred views of world politics will have to come to terms with the needs of the day, he said without mentioning any country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-relentless-effort-has-kept-spotlight-on-state-sponsored-cross-border-terrorism-s-jaishankar-916190.html

The government's plan for the distribution and use of the vaccine against Covid-19 is ready, he said. An effective vaccine against the coronavirus is keenly awaited across the globe. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said India is hosting clinical trials for all major vaccines, and about 20 of them are in different stages of development. Deswal told PTI in an interview that the central security forces including the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) are prepared to assist the government in this mega drive as they have in the past few months by treating patients. "The government has already made a plan for the distribution and use of the vaccine throughout the country and the CAPFs have a role in it by the way of vaccination of own troops, their families as well as helping out people," he said. "The scheme is already in place. The government is waiting for the vaccine, and its distribution and use will not be a problem since a plan has already been laid out," he added. The forces will undertake all measures to assist the government in the vaccination drive and will render any task that is given to them, Deswal said. The CAPFs include BSF, CRPF, CISF and SSB apart from two other central forces NDRF and NSG. These forces have a combined strength of about 10 lakh and are deployed for a variety of internal security duties and guarding the country's borders. A senior official privy to the vaccine plan said the CAPFs will be directed to hold camps and help local government authorities in the identification of beneficiaries for the drive once it is rolled out. The about 90,000-personnel strong ITBP is credited with creating the first quarantine centre for Covid-19 in southwest Delhi's Chhawla area in January. Indian citizens and nationals of other countries evacuated from Wuhan in China, where the outbreak first emerged, were lodged at the centre. The border force, primarily tasked with guarding the 3,488-kms long Line of Actual Control with China, is at present running three such large facilities in the National Capital Region (NCR) including the 10,000-bed Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in Delhi's Chhatarpur area and a coronavirus Referral Hospital for police personnel in Greater Noida. "We started with the establishment of the Chhawla quarantine centre which was initially established for evacuees from Wuhan and students, citizens and children from India and other countries were accommodated here," Deswal said. "At that stage, there was very less information about the disease and it was very scary as per information coming from abroad... but the centre went very well and this facility is continuing. We are now hosting our own men here, who are in transit or who come back from leave, for quarantine," he said. The facility hosted and treated over 1,200 people including nationals of nine other countries. The ITBP chief said when Delhi was facing a shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients, the Union home ministry asked it to establish the Sardar Patel facility in the southern part of the national capital. "It has treated over 10,700 patients from the national capital region till now. It is a zero expenditure hospital and patients from every strata of the society can come here," Deswal said. A team of ITBP doctors and paramedics runs the centre along with Delhi government officials and volunteers of the Radha Soami Beas. The third such facility, Deswal said, is the Referral Hospital in Greater Noida which has been "converted" into a Covid hospital. "It has treated more than 2,000 police personnel, their relatives, family members, retirees of various forces and their families and officials from the Union home ministry. "This facility has a very good success rate... there have been only two patient deaths who suffered from comorbid conditions," he said. Deswal said these three facilities will "continue to function as long as it is required". "Apart from these facilities, the network of our hospitals all across the country is treating coronavirus patients and we have linked these centres with Ayushman Bharat," he said. Officials in various CAPFs said about 75-80 doctors and over 100 paramedics from various central forces will soon be sent to Delhi after Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reviewed the situation in the city arising out of the spurt in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/capfs-will-play-major-role-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive-itbp-dg-916199.html

Speaking at a webinar organised by the Press Council of India (PCI) on the 'Role of media during the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on media’ on National Press Day, the minister said freedom comes with responsibility and asked news organisations to avoid sensationalism. “Freedom of press is the soul of democracy. Freedom of press is very important but any freedom comes with responsibility. So, there has to be a responsible freedom and no sensationalism by the press,” the minister said in the video message. “The news should not be to deliberately defame anyone. The way freedom of press is being attacked these days is not good,” he said. Talking about the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation by some news channels, the minister said a committee formed by the ministry will soon submit its report on the issue. “To check the TRP manipulation and address the issue, we have formed a committee which will give its report very soon,” he said. Javadekar also touched upon the issue of the absence of a regulatory body for TV channels and said a decision may be taken on bringing a code of conduct for them. “The Press Council of India is a self-regulatory body that has representations from various media houses as well as parliament. There have been discussions on giving more power to the PCI,” he said. “But for TV channels there is no self-regulatory body like PCI. We are getting suggestions to make a code of conduct for all TV channels but we are yet to take a decision on it,” the minister said, adding that the government doesn't want to interfere but “press should present responsible journalism.” Javadekar further said just like TV, there is no regulatory body for over-the-top (OTT) platforms and the government is receiving suggestions on how to regulate its content. OTT platforms such as Netflix, Hotstar, and others were recently brought under the ambit of the information and broadcasting ministry. “Neither there is any PCI nor any other body for OTT platforms which have very good content as well as very bad content. So, something needs to be done about it,” he said. “Discussions are going on and we are getting suggestions from a lot of people on what should be done to regulate the content on OTT platforms,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-press-day-free-press-soul-of-democracy-says-union-minister-prakash-javadekar-916204.html

Besides him, two Deputy Chief Ministers, both from the BJP, were administered oath. Though as per the constitutional provisions, Nitish can have 36 ministers in the 243-member House, only 15 ministers took oath here at the Raj Bhavan. This includes five from the JD(U), seven from the BJP and one each from the two new smaller allies - HAM and the VIP. The two new Deputy Chief Ministers – Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi – are four-term BJP MLAs from Katihar and Bettiah respectively. Incidentally, both have studied up to Intermediate, but have been associated with the BJP for the last four decades. Former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, who was not included in the Nitish’s Cabinet at the behest of the BJP top leadership, was, however, present at the swearing-in, which was also attended by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda. This was Nitish’s fourth consecutive term, although technically he was administered the oath for the seventh time in the last two decades. This includes his swearing-in as CM of the undivided Bihar in March 2000, when he could not muster the majority and resigned within a week.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nitish-kumar-takes-oath-as-bihar-cm-for-the-fourth-consecutive-term-916211.html

Last year, around 48 per cent people surveyed had bought Chinese products during the festive season, the survey of more than 14,000 people stated. "When a similar question was asked in November 2019, 48 per cent consumers had admitted to buying China-made products during the festive season last year which dropped down to 29 per cent this year. This is a 40 per cent year-over-year decline in terms of absolute number of Indian consumers buying Made in China products during the festive season," LocalCircles founder and chairman Sachin Taparia said in a statement. The survey was conducted across 204 districts of the country between November 10-15, LocalCircles said. Even among the 29 per cent respondents who bought China-made goods, 71 per cent said that they did not consciously purchase 'Made in China' products this festive season and 66 per cent consumers admitted to have purchased them because they offered higher value for money, the survey said.   "After over 20 Indian soldiers were martyred in Galwan valley by their Chinese counterparts in June this year, the anti-China sentiment grew in India. In the LocalCircles survey conducted thereafter, 87 per cent Indians said they would be willing to boycott China-made products for the next one year," the survey said. Most of the consumers surveyed by the LocalCircles said that the Indian counterpart for a Chinese product is generally more expensive though it might be of better quality. However, many festival-related items like LED lighting, tealight candles, plastics, are one-time use products and hence quality is not the top criteria for many consumers etc. "While on an overall basis, the Indian consumer did spend less on Chinese products this year, the key takeaway for the government of India and MSMEs is to make manufacturing more competitive in India and improve scale. "If the high quality products that are Made in India can be produced at scale and cost of capital for Indian MSME is reduced through Government support, products Made in India will definitely find preference amongst Indian consumers," the report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indians-interest-in-china-made-products-declines-in-this-festive-season-survey-916213.html

All pensioners under EPS-95 (Employees Pension Scheme-1995) are required to submit Jeevan Pramaan Patra (JPP) / Digital Life Certificate (DLC) each year to continue drawing pension. In the current scenario of Covid-19, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has facilitated multiple options for EPS-95 pensioners to submit their DLC close to their home or at their doorstep, the ministry said in a statement. JPPs submitted through all these modes/agencies are equally valid, it added. In addition to the 135 regional offices and 117 district offices of the EPFO, EPS-95 pensioners can now submit DLC at pension disbursing bank branch and nearest post offices. The DLC can also be submitted at nation-wide network of over 3.65 lakh Common Services Centres (CSCs). EPS-95 pensioners can also submit DLC using the UMANG app. Recently, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) launched doorstep DLC service for pensioners. The pensioners can now submit online request for availing the doorstep DLC service on payment of a nominal fee. A postman from the nearest post office will visit a pensioner and complete the process of generating DLC at his/her home itself. As per fresh guidelines, EPS pensioners can now submit DLC at any time during the year, as per their convenience. The life certificate will remain valid for one year from date of submission. The pensioners who have been issued Pension Payment Order (PPO) in 2020 need not upload JPP till completion of one year. Earlier, all pensioners were required to submit the DLC in the month of November. This resulted in difficulties faced by pensioners due to long queues and rush for submission of the life certificates. This pro-pensioner step has been taken to provide hassle-free social security cover to pensioners, it added. Senior citizens are at a higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus. These initiatives will benefit approximately 67 lakh EPS pensioners, out of which about 21 lakh are widows/widowers, children and orphan pensioners, it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/epfo-provides-pensioners-multiple-options-to-submit-digital-life-certificates-amid-covid-19-pandemic-916220.html

With educational institutions world over resorting to online teaching and learning, there was a need to study and adopt the best practices by institutions like the University of Hyderabad, he said. Expressing concern that only a few Indian Higher Education Institutions figure in the world rankings, he said multidisciplinary universities should strive to be amongst the best. "It is a matter of concern that only a few Indian Higher Education Institutions figure in the world rankingsIIT Bombay and IIT Delhi and IISc figure in the QS rankings in the top 200. Our multidisciplinary universities should pull up their socks and strive to be amongst the best," he said. For achieving better rankings, Higher Education Institutions must promote the culture of innovative research and focus on quality publications in the top journals and not just numbers, the vice president stressed. He appreciated the UoH for achieving the status of institution of eminence.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that “China opposes all forms of terrorism and calls on the international community, especially regional countries, to cooperate in fighting terrorism and safeguard collective security.” The CPEC connecting China’s Xinjiang province to Pakistan’s strategic Gwadar port in Balochistan is an “important pioneering project of the Belt and Road (BRI) initiative," Zhao said in response to a question on Pakistan’s claims that India was behind some of the terror attacks in that country, including causing disruption to the CPEC projects. India on Sunday mounted a hard-hitting attack on Pakistan for accusing it of involvement in some of the terror strikes in that country and said the so-called claims of ‘proof’ are figments of imagination. External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan's "desperate attempt" will find few takers as the international community is aware of its tactics, and proof of Islamabad's terror sponsorship has been admitted by none other than its "own leadership". "This is yet another futile anti-India propaganda exercise. The so-called claims of 'proof' against India enjoy no credibility, are fabricated and represent figments of imagination," Srivastava said in response to media queries on the allegations. Responding to another question, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: “It (CPEC) is important for the common development of China and Pakistan, it's also beneficial to regional connectivity and common prosperity. “We are confident that with the support of the international community, China and Pakistan can ensure the success of CPEC. We also believe that Pakistan will continue to take effective measures to ensure the safety, security of the CPEC.” Pakistan has formed a Special Security Division comprising 15,000 troops, including 9,000 Pakistan Army soldiers and 6,000 para-military forces personnel to provide security to the CPEC projects. India has protested to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. In his media briefing, Zhao, on Pakistan’s allegation of heavy firing by India along the Line of Control (LoC) resulting in four deaths, urged Pakistan and India to exercise restraint, resolve differences through dialogues and work together to safeguard regional peace and stability. “India and Pakistan are major countries in South Asia. Their peaceful coexistence is of paramount importance to regional peace, stability and development,” he said. “China is a neighbour to both countries, we urge both sides to exercise restraint, resolve differences through dialogues and work together to safeguard regional peace and stability. “Our position on the Kashmir issue is clear and consistent. It is an issue between India and Pakistan left over from history. It should be properly resolved in accordance with the UN charter, UNSC resolutions and bilateral agreements. It should be properly resolved in peaceful ways,” Zhao added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-silent-on-pakistan-s-terrorism-claims-against-india-calls-for-effective-security-for-cpec-916236.html

Here is the top news of November 16, 2020: Moderna Inc said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second US company in a week to report results that far exceed expectations. Together with Pfizer Inc's vaccine, also shown to be more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available by the year's end.   The head of the World Health Organization said Monday that a vaccine would not by itself stop the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic is raging months after it broke out, with infections soaring past 54 million and claiming more than 1.3 million lives. "A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them," director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."   Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, being developed by Bharat Biotech is now undergoing phase-3 trials, Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director, Bharat Biotech said on Monday. Speaking virtually at a programme organised by the Indian School of Business, Ella said the company is also working on another vaccine for Covid-19 which would be in the form of nasal drops and can be ready by next year. "We partnered with ICMR for Covid-19 vaccine as we speak it entered the phase 3 trials," he said. Bharat Biotech is the only vaccine company in the world which has BSL3 production facility (Biosafety level 3), he said.   The wholesale price-based inflation rose to an eight-month high of 1.48 per cent in October, as manufactured products turned costlier. The WPI inflation was 1.32 per cent in September and zero per cent in October last year. This is the highest level of Wholesale price index-based (WPI) inflation since February when it was 2.26 per cent. While food article prices softened in October, manufactured items witnessed hardening of prices, according to data released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry on Monday.   Relentless efforts by India helped in keeping the spotlight on cross-border terrorism it faced and the world was gradually becoming aware of the global nature of international terror, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Monday.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on the orders of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, has taken over the investigation in 12 cases registered by the state CID on the complaint of B Rajasekhar, the registrar general of the court, the officials said. It was alleged in the complaint that "key personnel, who are occupying posts of prominence in the state of Andhra Pradesh, by intentionally targeting the judges, made interviews/posts/speeches attributing motives, caste and corrupt allegations to some of the Supreme Court judges and High Court judges in delivering orders/judgments and they posted abusive, life threatening and intimidating postings against judges in social media i.e Facebook, Twitter over recent orders and judgments delivered by judges of High Court of Andhra Pradesh". On October 12, the high court directed the CBI to probe the case and submit a report to it in a sealed cover within eight weeks. The next hearing of the case is on December 14. Taking cognizance of the alleged defamatory posts, the court had directed the CBI to probe the role of prominent persons in the southern state, who were intentionally targeting the Supreme Court and high court judges. "...the postings were made to bring hatred, contempt, incite disaffection and ill-will against the High Court and Hon'ble judges," the court had noted. A bench comprising justices Rakesh Kumar and J Uma Devi had passed the order after a series of alleged derogatory posts were made on social media platforms against judges and the judiciary, following some court verdicts that went against the state government. On the directions of the high court, its registrar general got a complaint lodged with the CID, giving names and related evidence, but the state police wing reportedly booked only nine people. "Their comments are perilous to democracy and amounted to an attack on the judiciary. If some ordinary person makes any comment against the government, cases are promptly registered against such persons. "When persons in positions made comments against the judges and the courts, why have cases not been filed? Looking at things, we are left to infer that a war has been declared on the judiciary," the bench commented orally during a hearing. The CBI office in Visakhapatnam registered the case under various sections, including 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 67 of the Information Technology Act. While handing over the probe to the central agency, the high court had expressed serious displeasure over the CID investigation in its October 12 order. It had noted that the speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and the deputy chief minister had also not restrained themselves from making "scathing remarks" against the judiciary. "Member of Rajya Sabha, namely, Vijayasai Reddy, has joined together in a move to make scathing remarks against the High Court. "Such comments from the key personnel who are occupying posts of prominence, authoritative and constitutional in nature, targeting the judges, had severely affected the reputation of the judiciary as an independent institution. Thus, it appears that a concerted effort has been made to malign the institution, having a larger conspiracy," the court had noted. It had also named YSRC MP (Lok Sabha) Nandigam Suresh, former MLA Amanchi Krishna Mohan, standing counsel for the Andhra Pradesh Assembly Metta Chandrasekhar Rao and others in the case and found fault with the CID that no proper action, as mandated under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), was taken against the accused till date.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cbi-books-16-for-defamatory-content-against-sc-andhra-hc-judges-on-social-media-916246.html

The report titled 'Finance Commission in COVID Times' would be submitted to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday. "The Chairman and Members of the 15th Finance Commission today presented a copy of the Commission's report for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26, to Prime Minister Narendra Modi," an official statement said. On November 9, the Commission had submitted its report to President Ram Nath Kovind. 15th Finance Commission Chairman N K Singh along with members of the commission, Ajay Narayan Jha, Anoop Singh, Ashok Lahiri and Ramesh Chand, were present on the occasion. "The report will be placed on the Table of the House along with Explanatory Memorandum by way of ATR (Action Taken Report) as prescribed under the Constitution," the statement added. Finance Commission is a constitutional body that gives suggestions on centre-state financial relations. The 15th Finance Commission submitted two reports - the first report consisted of recommendations for the financial year 2020-21 and the final report with recommendations for 2021-26. While the previous 14th Finance Commission had recommended states be given 42 per cent of all taxes, the 15th Finance Commission had for 2020-21 recommended a total devolution of Rs 8,55,176 crore to the states, which is 41 per cent of the divisible pool of taxes. The recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission for period 2021-22 to 2025-26 have not been disclosed as it has not been tabled in Parliament. The 14th Finance Commission had increased states' share by 10 percentage points to 42 per cent and it remains to be seen what its successor would do considering the Centre is hard-pressed for funds at a time when it is looking to boost the economy through expenditure. The Commission was asked to give its recommendations on wide-ranging issues. Apart from the vertical and horizontal tax devolution, local government grants, disaster management grant, it was also asked to examine and recommend performance incentives for states in many areas like power sector, adoption of direct benefit transfer, solid waste management etc. The Commission was also asked to examine whether a separate mechanism for funding of defence and internal security ought to be set up and if so how such a mechanism could be operationalised.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/15th-finance-commission-submits-report-on-tax-division-ratio-to-pm-modi-916272.html

Kumar, the JD(U) chief was sworn-in for the seventh time during the day. He was administered the oath of office at the Raj Bhavan here by Governor Phagu Chauhan, a day after he staked claim armed with the unanimous support of all legislators of the NDA despite JD(U)'s poor showing. Tejashwi and his RJD have been alleging that the counting process was compromised under pressure by Kumar. The charges have been refuted by the poll panel. With Kumar taking over as the chief minister on Monday, Tejashwi again questioned his election and suggested the JD(U) chief has been nominated rather than being elected as the chief minister. Best wishes to Nitish Kumar ji on being nominated as the chief minister. I hope he makes his priority positive issues such as aspirations of the people of Bihar, the NDAs promise of 19 lakh jobs-employment, education, health, livelihood, irrigation and justice rather than his ambition for the chair, Tejashwi wrote in a social media post. Kumar's JD(U) had clinched just 43 seats, 31 less that its ally the BJP. RJD had won 75 seats to emerge as the party to have won the largest number of seats of the 243 member assembly. RJD and four other Mahagathbandhan constituents, boycotted Nitish Kumars swearing-in ceremony alleging that the mandate in the Bihar polls was against the NDA an was changed through fraud. LJP president Chirag Paswan too took a dig at Kumar as he congratulated him on being administered the oath of office. Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party had walked out of the NDA in Bihar vowing to oust Nitish Kumar from power in the state, also congratulated BJP on "making" him the chief minister. Congratulations to Nitish Kumar Ji on becoming chief minister again. I hope the government completes its term and you continue to remain the chief minister of NDA only, Paswan tweeted after Kumar was administered the oath of office.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tejashwi-yadav-wishes-nitish-kumar-on-being-nominated-bihar-cm-916283.html
16-11-2020||National||Harassment, humiliation: Artists cry foul as govt asks to vacate accommodation||Leading artists who have been asked to vacate their government allotted residences, including Padma Shri awardee Bharati Shivaji, on Monday said they were feeling "harassed", "humiliated" and "pained" by the government's treatment. In October this year, 27 eminent personalities, including artists, dancers and musicians were sent notices from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, to vacate their government allotted accommodations across Delhi by December 31, "failing which eviction proceeding will be initiated as per Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act". Other major artists who have been sent these notices are Jatin Das, Pt Bhajan Sopori, Pt Birju Maharaj, Rita Ganguly, and Ustad F Wasifuddin Dagar. Mohiniyattam dancer Bharati Shivaji said she was in "a state of shock" and yet to determine her "plan of action". "This is harassment. I don't have a separate land or institute, and I have been doing all creative activity from my home. But it seems the powers that may be have no value for the traditional art forms," Shivaji, who has accommodation in Asian Village, said. She said the least any government can do is to provide accommodation to artistes who have worked and toiled hard for preserving the traditional art. Many of them objected to the use of the term "unauthorised" to define their current state of residence. Kuchipudi dancer Vanashree Rao, the wife of Kuchipudi dancer Guru Jayarama Rao, in whose name their accommodation was allotted, said the term seemed to imply they were occupying the space "illegally". She explained that following the first three years of allotment, they were given extensions till 2014 after which they were paying rent for the premises as directed by the government. "In 2018, the government sent us a retrospective rent amount of some Rs 8-9 lakh for the last four years. We have also been paying that, sometimes Rs 60,000, and sometimes Rs 1 lakh, because having so much money at one time is also not possible for us. "Despite doing everything we're being treated like squatters. We are not squatters," she said. Noted Indian dance historian Sunil Kothari shared Rao's sentiments. "I am a Padma Shri and Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee. I have written several books on Indian classical dance forms and allied art forms and have been part of many committees, and this is what my government gives me in return. "I feel humiliated that at the age of 88 I have been sent, what I call, a 'get out' notice, and asked to leave the place which has been home to me for the past 20 years,” he said. Das said he felt "ashamed" to have been treated like "a criminal". "I feel so ashamed to think that after 16 years of putting everything into my work and my country, I might be on the streets if I am unable to vacate my house. "I have been on so many advisory boards of so many cultural committees for the government, and all of them have been honorary positions. I never got paid. If I had a house in Delhi, do they think I would still be living here," the painter, whose Pankha collection is world-renowned, asked. Explaining why they don't have their own house in the city, Das, Shivaji and Rao said that the money they earn goes back towards creating more art. "I am not a commercial artist. I am not in the business of art. Whatever I earn from my painting, I use it to buy supplies for my next painting," Das, who will turn 80 next month, said. Shivaji said whatever they earn from performances has to be shared with musicians who accompany them and they have little leftover. Another major grievance shared by all artistes was the poor timing of the notice. They said the fact that they are all above 65 years of age and have been asked to uproot their lives without a ready alternative to relocate to, while there is a pandemic, is unfair. "Throughout the pandemic, the prime minister has insisted that landlords across the country should not evict their tenants, and even reduce the rent, and they are doing this to us,”" Rao said. To draw attention to the "insensitivity" of the order, the artistes have also written to the prime minister and the president of the country. The letters dated October 14 requested them to "look into the matter" and "support the arts community". "We are concerned about our future security and professional work if we are not given permission to continue. "Many times the government and our country refer to us as legends, and cultural ambassadors, so we feel that our government, especially the Culture Ministry should recommend our extension immediately," the letters read. Similar letters were also sent to the culture minister, the culture secretary and other officials but "no one got back". "The Culture Minister does not even want to meet us... I have been paying my rent, which from 2014 has been Rs 15,000 per month. I am not married, I live alone but I have thousands of books, where should I go? If they want this space, they should at least provide us with separate accommodation," Kothari said. When asked about the government's next course of action, Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said they had done "whatever was possible for these artistes from our end". "We requested the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to waive the dues accumulated by the artistes. But they have to vacate the premises by December 31, if they fail to do so they will have to pay rent according to market rates. We have done whatever was possible from our end," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/harassment-humiliation-artists-cry-foul-as-govt-asks-to-vacate-accommodation-916284.html

The Azim Premji University on Monday released its field study on Myths of Online Education, which was undertaken in five states across 26 districts covering 1,522 schools, the university said in a statement. These public schools have more than 80,000 students. The objective of the study was to understand the experience of children and teachers with online education. "The study finds an overwhelming majority of the teachers and parents stating that the online mode is inadequate and ineffective for education," the statement read. The study also reveals that most parents are eager to send their children to schools with necessary health safeguards and do not think that the health of their children would be affected in such an event, the university added. "Online education is ineffective because of the basic character of education, and not merely because of lack of access to the net and online resources, especially for school-age children," said Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor of the Azim Premji University. He explained that education required physical presence, attention, thought and emotions, all to be sewn towards learning goals, step-by step, often back-and-forth, and differently for each student. Behar added that education required intense verbal and non-verbal interactions amongst teachers and students, which is possible only in actual classes. According to the University, more than 80 per cent teachers expressed the impossibility of maintaining emotional connect with children during such classes, thus eliminating the very basis of education, and more than 90 per cent teachers felt that no meaningful assessment of childrens learning was possible during online classes. The University stated that more than 60 per cent children cannot access online education opportunities. The reasons include non-availability of or inadequate number of smartphones for dedicated use or sharing, and difficulty in using the apps for online learning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/teachers-and-parents-find-the-online-teaching-inadequate-and-ineffective-reveals-study-916346.html

"We are in dialogue not only with Moderna, but also with Pfizer, Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila over the progress of the clinical trials of each of the vaccine candidates and where their vaccines stand in terms safety, immunogenicity and efficacy, and regulatory approvals," a source said. According to the New Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 2019, any new drug or vaccine which has been tested and got regulatory approval outside India, will have to undergo bridging phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for its secure regulatory approval here. "As per law, the CDSCO, under the New Drugs and Cosmetics Rule 2019, can omit, relax or abbreviate the regulatory requirement or conditions of submitting pharmaceutical and clinical data of a vaccine candidate in Indian population in case of any emergency or pandemic like situation," the source said. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna's announcement comes just a week after Pfizer and Biontech said their Covid-19 vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 in participants. “This is a pivotal moment in the development of our Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Since early January, we have chased this virus with the intent to protect as many people around the world as possible," said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. "This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent Covid-19 disease, including severe disease,” he said. Based on these interim safety and efficacy data, Moderna intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks and anticipates having the EUA informed by the final safety and efficacy data (with a median duration of at least 2 months).

Making an appeal to the government on the occasion of the National Press Day during virtual celebrations, he said that reporting on COVID-19 is unprecedented and difficult for the media not only from the content perspective but also challenging for the media persons to work in gathering the information, especially from ground zero. The virtual celebrations of the National Press Day were held through a webinar organised by the Press Council of India (PCI) on 'Role of media during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on media.' Truth, accuracy, fairness, impartially and humanity, service and accountability are a few fundamentals that the journalists or any media person should keep reminding themselves in covering stories on Covid-19, said the PCI in a statement later in the day. While highlighting their plight, the PCI also raised the financial and job security-related concerns affecting journalists during the pandemic. Apart from Indian participants, Justice Mamtaz Uddin Ahmed, Chairman Bangladesh Press Council and Sule Aker, President, World Association of Press Councils (WAPC), an umbrella organisation of Press Councils and similar bodies of various countries, participated in the event. They also highlighted the efforts put by the media in the Covid-19 pandemic and how the world media took up the challenge and fulfilled their journalistic duties with utmost priority and speed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pci-chairman-appeals-to-centre-to-help-journalists-who-have-contracted-covid-19-916359.html

A 14-member council of ministers headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was administered the oath of office at the Raj Bhavan here by Governor Phagu Chauhan. Sushil Modi, who has been Nitish Kumar’s deputy in all the NDA government he has led in Bihar, was not among the 14. He was invited for the swearing-in ceremony though, and he came, but did not look his usual self. Otherwise a vibrant politician, Sushil Modi watched, not betraying much emotions, as Kumar and others were administered the oath of office. The BJP has replaced Sushil Modi as the deputy chief minister, bringing in two new faces for the post – multiple-term BJP MLAs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi. At one point of time, Kumar spotted his long-term deputy and asked him to come near him. The two walked together for some distance, much to the glee of the paparazzi, but their paths were different this time and they separated. Kumar and Sushil Modi's pair as CM and Deputy CM since 2005, barring a 20-month gap when Kumar was in alliance with the RJD, has been the hallmark of the ruling coalition in the state. The smooth sail of the successive JD(U)-BJP governments in the state has, to a large extent, been attributed to the good chemistry the two leaders shared. However, this rapport was resented by a section of his Sushil Modi’s own partymen who would have otherwise confronted the JD(U) boss on some issues. Senior BJP leader Rajnath Singh had recently compared their partnership with the successful opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag in cricket. But all that is past now as the saffron party leadership thought differently this time and replaced Sushil Modi as the deputy chief minister. When mediapersons approached Sushil Modi for his comments on the swearing-in, he refused to say anything, unlike until recent days when he was ready with a viewpoint on any political subject. After the ceremony ended, while Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP chief J P Nadda, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and others went inside the Raj Bhavan for refreshments, Sushil Modi left immediately. When reporters asked Kumar about Sushil Modi, he said "It’s BJP‘s decision as who will be their ministers." In reply to a question as whether the new government should have utilised Sushil Modi's vast experience in governance, Kumar said "This question should be asked to BJP leaders." Later, Sushil Modi, an avid social media user, took to Twitter to congratulate Kumar and all new ministers through a series of posts in Hindi. "Congratulation Nitish Kumar on becoming the chief minister for the seventh time. Bihar will march ahead under your leadership. Bihar will keep getting cooperation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi." Though, there is no word from the BJP on the next assignment for Sushil Modi, there are talks in the political circles he has been dropped from the ministry as a part of the party’s plans to chart an independent course in Bihar, moving away from the perception of playing second fiddle to the JD(U) all these years in the NDA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/at-nda-s-swearing-in-ceremony-sushil-modi-looked-dejected-916360.html

The warning came in vaccine transport guidelines issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is pushing governments to replace travel curbs and quarantines with testing. "If borders remain closed, travel curtailed, fleets grounded and employees furloughed, the capacity to deliver life-saving vaccines will be very much compromised," the IATA document said. Moderna Inc said on Monday its experimental Covid-19 vaccine had proved 94.5 per cent effective in a clinical trial, a week after rival drugmaker Pfizer reported 90 per cent efficacy findings for its vaccine. Once approved, both vaccines are likely to require transport and storage well below freezing, posing logistical hurdles. Widespread grounding of passenger flights that normally carry 45 per cent of global cargo in their holds has taken out capacity, thinning the air freight network and driving up prices. Existing immunisation campaigns have struggled with the partial shutdown. The World Health Organisation and UNICEF "have already reported severe difficulties in maintaining their planned vaccine programmes during the Covid-19 crisis due, in part, to limited air connectivity," IATA said. Vaccines will need to be shipped to developing countries reliant on passenger services for cargo, IATA's head of cargo Glyn Hughes told Reuters. Even in industrialised states, vaccine dispersal may be a tighter bottleneck than production, requiring shipments to secondary airports on passenger jets. In preparation for the challenge of mass vaccine distribution, governments should move to reopen key passenger routes backed by robust testing, the airline body argues. "There are several more months for governments to go through the planning cycle," Hughes said, leaving enough time to "get passenger networks safely resumed, looking at safe travel corridors (and) mutual acceptance of testing procedures."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/travel-restrictions-challenge-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-airlines-warn-916367.html

In August, Sibal was one of the 23 leaders who wrote to the Congress chief, calling for organisational reforms and demanding an "active, full-time and visible" party president. On being asked about the letter and what the party has done to resolve that dissatisfaction, Sibal said, "There has been no dialogue and there seems to be no effort for a dialogue by the leadership and since there is no forum to express my views, I am constrained to express them publicly." "Some of us put our pen to paper and said what should be done in the Congress on the road ahead. Instead of listening to us they turned their back on us. The results are for all to see," he said. He added that the Congress needed to discover itself and the Congress Working Committee should inculcate a democratic system of appointment rather than nominations as nominated members would not question the work and performance of the party the way democratically elected ones would do. "If we are not able to recognise our shortcomings, then even the electoral process will not lead to the desired results. The culture of nominations must go. Elections through nominations will not lead to the desired results," he said. Underlining the lack of response from the Congress leadership over their performance in the Bihar election and state bypolls, Sibal said that the Congress had failed to be an "effective alternative".  "I don’t say introspection because that time is over... Maybe they (Congress) think all is well and that it should be business as usual," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/instead-of-listening-congress-turned-its-back-on-us-kapil-sibal-916106.html

Sibal added that organisationally, Congress needs to focus on articulation in the media by putting up people who people want to listen to. He stressed that the party should also look at “providing an active, thoughtful leadership who can articulate with a lot of circumspection.” “We must ask ourselves what we are doing wrong and then correct ourselves. To be on a correction course, we must have a conversation with those wedded to the Congress party and experienced enough to contribute. It’s not difficult to do but it requires reaching out both within and without,” he told the publication. Earlier today, criticising the party, Congress leader Tariq Anwar blamed the delay in finalising seat-sharing for the Bihar election for the Mahagathbandhan's poll performance.  He asserted that the Congress must learn from it and complete alliance formalities well in advance for upcoming Assembly polls.

Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal feels that people of the country don’t consider the party to be an effective alternative. “Organisationally, we know what is wrong. I think we have all the answers. The Congress party itself knows all the answers. But they are not willing to recognise those answers. If they do not recognise those answers, then the graph will continue to decline. That is the sorry state of affairs that the Congress is in and that is what we are concerned about,” Sibal told the publication. The 35-year-old party has been seeing a downfall for the last five to six years with Rahul Gandhi stepping down as the party chief. Small cracks in the party were the main reason for Congress’ fall. Sibal asserted that there is reluctance in the party to address issues because the Congress Working Committee (CWC) is a nominated body. “You don’t expect nominated members to start questioning and raise their concerns about the reasons for the constant decline of the Congress in elections after elections,” he added. Explaining one of the reasons for not introspecting the party’s decline, Sibal stated that “every organisation needs a conversation” and if the people stopped listening to others. “we cannot succeed in taking forward our agendas.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-unwilling-to-recognise-downfall-says-kapil-sibal-after-bihar-polls-performance-916111.html

Karti, son of former union minister P Chidambaram, in a tweet said, "It's time we introspect, ideate, consult & act @INCIndia." The Lok Sabha MP from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu made the cryptic comment while tagging a tweet by senior party colleague Kapil Sibal on his interview to English daily "Indian Express" about the Bihar poll outcome. Karti's comment comes a day after senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar said the delay in finalising seat-sharing for the Bihar election adversely impacted the grand alliance's poll performance. Congress won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar. RJD's Tejashwi Yadav-led 'Mahagathbandhan' of which the Congress was the second major partner ended up with 110 seats while the NDA retained power in a close contest, bagging 125 seats in the 243-member assembly in the recent polls. Anwar had on Sunday told PTI in an interview that Congress must learn from it and complete alliance formalities well in advance for upcoming assembly polls. Party's general secretary and a veteran leader from Bihar, Anwar acknowledged that there were shortcomings due to which the Congress performed worse than other 'Mahagathbandhan' constituents. He asserted that the high command was serious about introspection as well as a thorough analysis of the results. Former union minister Sibal in his tweet tagged the interview in which he said, "We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual." Sibal was part of the group of 23 senior Congress leaders who had in August written to party chief Sonia Gandhi making suggestions to revive the organisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/karti-chidambaram-pitches-for-introspection-in-congress-916170.html
16-11-2020||National Politics||Do you support 'anti-national' views of NC, PDP: BJP to Congress||The BJP on Monday hit out at its rival parties in Jammu and Kashmir, saying their stand on a number of issues, including the demand for restoration of Article 370, is the same as that of countries like Pakistan, and asked the Congress if it agrees with the "anti-national" views of the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party over its support to. Addressing a press conference, senior BJP leader and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited a number of pro-people central laws that have been brought in force in the union territory following the 2019 repeal of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and asked if the Congress supports their annulment by bringing back Article 370. "I want to ask Sonia Gandhi (Congress president) and Rahul Gandhi, do they want restoration of Article 370? Please tell the nation categorically and clearly does the Congress support annulment of pro-people laws?" Prasad asked, attacking the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, an amalgamation of various Jammu and Kashmir parties whose demands have drawn some support from the Congress. He noted the "anti-national" views of National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, who had favoured China's support for Article 370's restoration, and PDP's Mehbooba Mufti, who had said she would not raise the national flag if the separate flag of Jammu and Kashmir is not restored, and sought to know the Congress' stand over them. Prasad said women were earlier deprived of property rights in the Union Territory if they married outside and anti-corruption laws, reservation for the disadvantaged sections of society and various other "humanist" central laws were not implemented in the region and accused the Gupkar alliance of working to push Jammu and Kashmir towards "narrow conservatism". "If a Muslim or Hindu girl from Jammu and Kashmir married a boy from outside, then she would have no right in the property of her father. We have changed it and restored her right to property," he said. The alliance of about 10 regional parties have demanded restoration of Article 370, a demand supported by some senior Congress leaders, including P Chidambaram. Earlier, while targeting the Congress over its ties with the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also had a go at its leader Rahul Gandhi over comments of the likes of former US president Barack Obama to RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari and Congress' Kapil Sibal. When Obama got to know him (Rahul) in four-five days, then it is obvious that those who interact with him almost daily would also have realised what he is, Patra told reporters. Congress leaders were praising him while carrying a burden of "100 tonnes of stone" on their chest, and now they feel suffocated, he said. "The BJP had been saying so for long. Now a friend of Congress like Shivanand Tiwari is saying that he is a non-performing picnicking president," Patra said. Tiwari had on Sunday questioned the campaign run by the Congress and also had taken a swipe at Gandhi for not spending much time electioneering in the state. Sibal is part of a group of leaders in the Congress who have demanded an overhaul of the party's organisation. Targeting the tie-up of the Jammu and Kashmir parties, known as 'Gupkar Alliance', the BJP spokesperson described it as "unholy", saying that it is aimed at opposing the implementation of laws duly passed by Indian Parliament. "This Gupkar Alliance wants exactly what Pakistan and anti-India countries want. Pakistan has gone to every forum and spoken against the removal of Article 370. The Gupkar Alliance says the same thing," Patra said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/do-you-support-anti-national-views-of-nc-pdp-bjp-to-congress-916198.html

"Mr Cabral, I am reaching Goa tomorrow by 2 pm on your invitation, to have a public debate with you, on Delhi electricity model vs Goa electricity model. I haven’t yet heard from you about the place and time of the debate where I should come," Chadha tweeted on Monday. Chadha has been shadowing Cabral over the last few days in the social media, requesting the latter for a debate, even tagging Chief Minister in his posts. "Pramod Sawant ji (@DrPramodPSawant), kindly intimate whether your party high command has given permission for the public debate between Goa Power minister and myself. I am reaching Goa tomorrow afternoon," said Chadha, who is the vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board and a Delhi lawmaker. In response to Chadha's overtures, Cabral on Monday broke his silence and said that he would engage in a public debate only with the Delhi government's Power Minister and if Chadha wanted to meet him, an office appointment could be facilitated. "I have learnt through the press that he (Chadha) is challenging for a debate. I have no issue in debating with like-minded people and who understands power problems," Cabral told reporters here. "A person who is an MLA and who is the vice-chairperson of a Jal corporation who is not connected with power at all, I don't seek to debate with him. I can only say that the power minister of Delhi, if he is here, can come and debate with me," the Goa Power Minister also said. AAP had failed to win a single seat in the 2017 state assembly polls, but the party is witnessing a spell of a resurgence in Goa, thanks to close chaperoning of Goa AAP's affairs by top party leaders and strategists, including Delhi MLA Atishi and key members of the party's social media wing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/aaps-raghav-chadha-dogs-goa-minister-for-debate-over-power-tariff-916238.html

In an interview to the newspaper, Sibal was critical of the Congress leadership after the party's poor poll show in Bihar. In a series of tweets, Gehlot said the party has seen various crises, including in 1969, 1977, 1989 and 1996, but has come out stronger every time due to its ideology, programmes, policies and the firm belief in its leadership. "There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country," he said. "We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji, we shall overcome this time too," Gehlot said, while asserting that there are various reasons for electoral loses. "But each time rank and file of the Congress Party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crisis. Even today, Congress is the only party which can keep this nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development," he said. In the interview, Sibal complained about the lack of introspection by the Congress in the last six years. Sibal was part of a group of 23 senior Congress leaders, who had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August, making suggestions to revive the organisation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sibals-comments-on-congress-have-hurt-party-workers-across-country-ashok-gehlot-916301.html

IMD officials attributed the rise in the minimum temperature to the presence of clouds in the region under the influence of a western disturbance. Until now, Delhi had been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures this month due to the absence of cloud cover. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The maximum temperature is expected to settle at 26 degrees Celsius, the IMD said. The minimum temperature is likely to drop below 10 degrees Celsius by Friday, according to the IMD. "As the western disturbance withdraws from the region, the wind direction will again change to northwesterly. Cold winds from hilly regions, which have received a fresh spell of snowfall, will start blowing towards the national capital," an IMD official said. On Sunday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, and a maximum temperature of 29.1 degrees Celsius. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded 0.4 mm rainfall on Sunday. The weather stations at Palam, Lodhi Road, Ridge, Jafarpur, Najafgarh and Pusa recorded 1.8 mm, 0.3 mm, 1.2 mm, 1 mm, 1 mm and 2.5 mm rainfall respectively. Fairly widespread rain was recorded in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and few parts of Uttar Pradesh, which should help improve the air quality, the IMD official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-minimum-temperature-settles-at-16-degrees-celsius-due-to-cloud-cover-916107.html

In his written message on the occasion of the National Press Day, the president also appreciated the Press Council of India (PCI), which regulates the print media, for safeguarding the independence of the press. "I am happy to learn that the Press Council of India is celebrating National Press Day on November 16 on the theme 'Role of Media during Covid-19 and its Impact on the Media'. "Rendering its service for nearly 55 years, PCI has been the watchdog safeguarding the independence of the press while trying to ensure quality journalism. Its role is important in the working of our democracy," Kovind said. The president said the theme of this year's National Press Day celebration deals with the most serious crisis facing the world and India. "In dealing with the issues concerning Covid-19, media has played a very important role in educating people and thereby it has helped in mitigating the impact of the pandemic.

He also said that a long-term solution to the problem of pollution "cannot be found in a day".    "Around 70 per cent of the residents of the city did not burn firecrackers after the government imposed a ban on the same. I hope that the results will be better next year," he told reporters. The Delhi government had on November 5 banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city till November 30.   The National Green Tribunal had also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases". Rai, who launched the Phase 2 of 'Red light on Gaadi Off' campaign along with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Monday, said Pusa bio-decomposer has emerged as a long-term solution to the problem of stubble burning.   According to scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore prevent stubble burning. The minister said the Delhi government will submit the Pusa bio-decomposer impact assessment report along with a petition to the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Adjoining Areas on Monday, and urge it to issue directions to all state governments to implement it. Sisodia stressed the need for steps to reduce "pollution at its source" to effectively address the issue of bad air quality.    "There are multiple sources that contribute to pollution. If it is due to vehicles, their number should be reduced or these should be turned off at red light... If it is stubble burning, a solution such as Pusa bio decomposer is needed," he said. The AAP government has extended the 'Red light on Gaadi Off' campaign to curb vehicular pollution till November 30.  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had launched the campaign on October 21, saying that even if 10 lakh vehicles in the city join the campaign, the PM10 levels would fall by 1.5 tonnes and PM2.5 by 0.4 tonnes in a year. Rai had earlier said that switching vehicles off at red light can reduce vehicular pollution by 15-20 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/around-70-people-in-delhi-didnt-burn-firecrackers-on-diwali-gopal-rai-916158.html

The avalanche warning has been issued in Kupwara, Bandipora and Baramulla districts of north Kashmir, and Ganderbal district in central Kashmir, officials said. While a medium danger avalanche warning has been issued for the higher reaches of Kupwara and Bandipora districts, a low danger avalanche warning has been issued for the higher reaches of Ganderbal and Baramulla districts, they said. The warning was issued in view of snowfall which started on Saturday and continued till Monday morning, they added.

16-11-2020||North and Central||Snowfall, landslides block Jammu and Kashmir highway||The Jammu-Srinagar National Highway, the only all-weather road connecting Kashmir with rest of the country, was closed for traffic on Monday following snowfall around Jawahar Tunnel and landslides from the hillocks at several places in Ramban district, officials said. The alternate link between the valley and the rest of the country, Mughal Road, also remained closed for the third day as high-altitude areas experienced snowfall, while plains of Jammu and other parts were lashed by rains since Sunday afternoon, the officials said. The snowfall started around Jawahar Tunnel, the gateway to the Kashmir Valley, late Sunday evening and was continuing intermittently, forcing authorities to suspend the traffic on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway due to slippery condition of the road, the officials said. However, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) which is maintaining the road stretch between Zig-Banihal, including the Jawahar Tunnel area, have pressed its men and machines to clear the road. The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which is responsible for road maintenance, has deployed its workforce to clear the road but the incessant rains hampered the clearance operations, the officials said, expecting the road to reopen for traffic later in the day. The officials said the Mughal Road, connecting the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu region with south Kashmir's Shopian district, remained closed for the third day in view of heavy snowfall in Peer Ki Gali and adjoining areas. The snow clearance operation is likely to start later in the day given the prediction of improvement in weather from this afternoon, they said. Reports of snowfall from high altitude areas were received from Ramban, Doda, Poonch, Rajouri and Udhampur districts, while the plains including Jammu city were lashed by rains since Sunday, ending over two-month-long dry spell in the region. A Meteorological Department official said the highest 37.4 mm of rainfall was recorded in Banihal during the past 24 hours ending 8.30 am Monday, followed by 35 mm in Katra town, the base camp for the pilgrims visiting Vaishno Devi shrine. Jammu city recorded 26.6 mm of rainfall during the same period, while the highway town of Batote recorded 33.6 mm of rainfall. After the snowfall, Banihal was the coldest recorded place in Jammu region with a low of 0.2 degrees Celsius, the official said, adding that Katra recorded a minimum of 9.2 degrees Celsius and Jammu 12.6 degrees Celsius.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/snowfall-landslides-block-jammu-and-kashmir-highway-916192.html
16-11-2020||North and Central||Delhi's third Covid-19 wave has peaked, says Health Minister Satyendar Jain||The latest surge of coronavirus infections in the Indian capital, which has swamped its intensive care wards and killed hundreds of people, has passed its peak, the city's top health official said on Monday, dismissing fears of another lockdown. "I can definitely tell you that the peak is gone and cases will slowly come down now," Satyendar Jain, minister of health in the city government, told Reuters partner ANI, pointing to a decline in the city's positivity rate. New Delhi has seen a surge in novel coronavirus infections this month, what authorities have called a third wave that has killed more than 600 people dead in the past week, even as cases in other parts of the country have declined.  India has reported more than 8.8 million confirmed cases - the second highest in the world, after the United States - but the number of new daily cases has fallen since a peak in mid-September. India has recorded 129,635 coronavirus deaths. On Monday, the federal health ministry posted a daily rise of 30,548 infections. Economic activity has slowly picked up as authorities relax restrictions after a harsh lockdown was imposed across the country in late March to slow down the spread of the virus. The hardest-hit state of Maharashtra reopened places of worship on Monday with instructions to maintain social distancing and people trickled in wearing masks. In Delhi, Jain said that there was "no chance" of another lockdown, even as authorities prepared hundreds of additional intensive care beds and ramped up capacity to conduct more than 100,000 tests a day. "We are analysing the data daily and keeping a watch on the positivity," Jain said. Delhi has been carrying out an average of 55,000 tests a day. The city's positivity rate - the percentage of people who test positive of all those tested - has declined since early November. But it rose again on Sunday, when fewer people were tested owing to a major festival on the weekend, possibly skewing the findings, an official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-third-covid-19-wave-has-peaked-says-health-minister-satyendar-jain-916200.html

Police personnel, including the Provincial Armed Constabulary, have been deployed in large numbers to keep tabs on the simmering tension at Chakeri locality after the incident late Sunday evening. Taking strong note of the incident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath issued instructions that the accused be booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA). He also announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the family of the deceased. Four people have been arrested and efforts are on to ascertain the identities of the key accused, said Raj Kumar Agarwal, Superintendent of Police (East). Recapping the events of the evening, he said Pintu Nishad, 25, and his friend Sandeep left their homes in Wajidpur area and accidentally stepped on a water pouch lying on the road. The water splashed on Amaan, a resident from the same area who was passing through, sparking a clash. Hearing about the altercation, dozens of other locals reached the spot and pelted stones at each other, injuring Nishad and several others, he said. The injured were taken to Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital where Nishad was declared brought dead, Agarwal added.

16-11-2020||North and Central||After gap of nearly eight months, colleges and universities reopen in Punjab||Colleges and universities in Punjab reopened on Monday after being shut for nearly eight months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said. The decision to open these educational institutions in areas outside Covid-19 containment zones was taken by the state government earlier this month. Institutions have been directed to strictly observe Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs) framed by their respective administrative departments in consultation with the state health department and the Union health ministry. Earlier an official spokesperson had said that "all higher education, medical education and research and technical education institutions, including all universities and colleges in areas outside containment zones in the state would be allowed to re-open from November 16". The educational institutions in the state were closed from March 24 due to the coronavirus outbreak. In the first phase of reopening, only final-year students of departments such as science, medicine, engineering and technology where hands-on training is an essential part of the curriculum will be called for attending classes, followed by students of other courses, according to the SOPs. In hostels, not more than one student will be accommodated per room to begin with and educational institutes have kept separate gates for entry and exit of students and staff. Thermal screening, hand sanitising, wearing of masks, social distancing in classrooms, with not more than 50 per cent of total strength of students being called to attend classes, are part of the SOPs. Even though attendance was thin on the first day, majority of students across the state said they were happy to attend regular classes. "Online classes have helped us during these months, but these cannot match regular classes where we meet our teachers face-to-face in a campus environment. There are distractions and limitations while studying at home," said a student outside a government college in Bathinda.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/after-gap-of-nearly-eight-months-colleges-and-universities-reopen-in-punjab-916271.html

16-11-2020||North and Central||Rain, gusty winds bring 'significant' improvement in Delhi-NCR's air quality||Delhi's air quality improved "significantly" on Monday due to light rain and favourable wind speed and was recorded in the 'poor' category after a 15-day spell of 'very poor' and 'severe' air days. The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) improved to 221, which falls in the 'poor' category. It was 435 on Sunday and 414 on Saturday (Diwali). The last time Delhi's AQI was recorded in the 'poor' category was on November 2. The AQI reached the 'moderate' category by 6 pm. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said AQI improved "significantly" after Diwali owing to rainfall and strong winds and is likely to remain in the 'moderate' category on Tuesday.  The air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally and hit the 'poor' category on Wednesday. In Delhi-NCR, the levels of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – were 88 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 6 pm. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3. PM10 level stood at 135 µg/m3 at 6 pm. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 is considered safe in India and 500 µg/m3 is the emergency threshold. The last time Delhi recorded such low PM10 levels was on September 28. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (186), Ghaziabad (207), Greater Noida (226), Gurgaon (246) and Noida (243) recorded their AQI in 'poor' and 'moderate' categories after braving 'severe' air quality on Saturday and Sunday. Delhi had recorded the worst pollution levels on Diwali in the last four years due to the combined effect of stubble burning, firecrackers and unfavourable meteorological conditions. The air quality on the day after Diwali was also the poorest since 2016. In a special report, the Central Pollution Control Board said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day this year as compared to 2019. It could be attributed to bursting of firecrackers, higher share of stubble burning and unfavourable meteorology during the festival season, the CPCB said. However, rain and high-velocity winds came to Delhi's rescue this year. Winds gusting up to 40 kilometers per hour swept away the pollutants, while light rainfall in the afternoon and evening on Sunday washed everything down. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department, said the wind speed was favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Monday as well. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, had also predicted that pollution levels may recede to the 'poor' category "in case of enough rains and washout".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rain-gusty-winds-bring-significant-improvement-in-delhi-ncrs-air-quality-916317.html

A top official of the Delhi government said a revised plan of the containment strategy is expected to be finalised after discussions in the coming days.  With Delhi witnessing a fresh spike in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Centre on Sunday announced a slew of steps, including making available 300 additional ICU beds, doubling the number of daily PCR tests and a house-to-house survey in the national capital. The announcement came after an emergency meeting attended by Shah and Kejriwal. The home minister emphasised that the entire set of containment measures instituted earlier should be reviewed continuously, so that there are no gaps in implementation. "The Delhi government is discussing on revising the containment strategy, a plan of which is likely to be announced in a day or two," the official said. There has been a significant rise in the number of containment zones in Delhi since the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. On November 1, the number of containment zones was 3,359, which rose to 4,358 by November 15. Officials said a door-to-door survey is likely to be launched soon in areas that reported a high number of Covid-19 cases. "The survey will identify suspected Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas and groups to test and isolate them if they test positive for the disease," the official said. Kejriwal had said after the meeting that the current number of around 60,000 daily Covid-19 tests will be increased to over a lakh. The Centre will help the Delhi government in scaling up the testing capacity, he had said. The current testing level is to be doubled through a renewed focus on the door-to-door survey and aggressive contract-tracing, officials said. The survey will be conducted by teams of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the city government and the municipal corporations of Delhi, and all the symptomatic persons found in the survey would be tested and provided the necessary treatment, officials had said on Sunday. The chief minister had also said around 750 ICU beds will be arranged at the DRDO centre by the Centre and the required machines will be provided by it to help the Delhi government increase the number of ICU beds at its facilities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govts-revised-covid-19-containment-strategy-to-be-announced-soon-officials-say-916357.html
16-11-2020||Opinion||Rule of law in India – a distant dream||A King who observes his duty of protecting his people justly, according to law, goes to heaven, unlike the one who does not protect his people, or inflicts unjust punishment”  - Kautilya Kautilya’s declaration, although mystical, reflects upon the current socio-political climate in India. The World Justice Project, an independent agency, has ranked India 69 out of 128 countries worldwide on the Global Rule of Law Index 2020. Other developing countries like Brazil, Nepal and South Africa have scored better. The report reflects the deep divide that exists between the theory and practice of rule of law in India.  The WJP report serves as an alarm to the government of the repeated attempts being made to dilute the rule of law in India. Likely, there is only one answer to the question, ‘Howdy, Modi?- Everything is not alright with your India, Sir.’  Let us analyse the rule of law situation in India on the basis of WJP’s eight parameters. Constraints on government powers: The ‘Question Hour’ in Parliament was suspended this monsoon session. Further, ignoring the farmers and labour unions’ demands for in-depth discussion, the government bulldozed its way through and ultimately got the farm and labour bills passed.  The Opposition’s efforts to exercise check and control over the government’s brazen action was not allowed in Rajya Sabha. Moreover, the apathetic treatment meted out to Amnesty International severely limited scrutiny by independent agencies over governmental powers.  Absence of corruption: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy, in a letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, made allegations against a judge of the Supreme Court of judicial impropriety. Further, the question remains whether the Lokpal would actually be permitted to function independently such that it does not end up protecting the ‘big fish’ instead of punishing them. Displaying a sign of diminishing accountability, Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar, when asked whether the government had provided any compensation to the families of the migrant workers who had lost their lives during the pandemic, brazenly retorted: “the question does not arise as no such data (on deaths and job losses) is maintained”.  In yet another attempt to limit public intervention, the government has chosen not to call the Prime Minister Cares Fund a ‘public authority’, unlike other similar charity funds, in order to exempt its operations from public scrutiny and accountability under the Right to Information Act, 2005.   Further, within a few days of submitting his resignation from the IPS, the DGP of Bihar, Gupteshwar Pandey, joined the ruling Janata Dal(U)-led government leaving the citizens aghast and inquiring if he at all was apolitical and objective while discharging his public duties. Fundamental rights: The Uttar Pradesh police proudly tweeted in December 2019 that it had got 103 criminals killed, 1,859 injured in 5,178 police engagements in the last two years. Extra-judicial, arbitrary or summary executions and enforced disappearances are antithetical to the rule of law.  Facebook and Google disclosed that the government had sought information of user accounts. Spyware Pegasus was used to hack security system of social media accounts and infect smartphones of social activists, journalists, political opponents etc, their personal data was recorded and locations tracked at all times.  Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs was said to have authorised 10 security and intelligence agencies to intercept any information stored in any computer resource. As such, the government agencies have access to an individual’s entire world stored in one’s smart phone or computer.  Order and security: The glaring lapses on the part of the Delhi Police with respect to taking timely action to control the February 2020 Delhi riots and the subsequent delays in investigating the scale of the violence, the loss of life and property and the resulting communal divide has cast serious doubts on the country’s order and security preparedness.  The government’s tacit support to instances of `Ghar Wapsi’, `Love Jihad’ and mob lynching has only strengthened the resolve of the miscreants.  Regulatory enforcement: Specialised independent regulatory authorities in India like the Reserve Bank of India and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) were created for efficient and effective governance in their specific sectors. However, over time, most have been reduced to mere bureaucratic and toothless agencies.  The Trai has been unable to curb telecom major Reliance Jio’s alleged anti-competitive practices thereby raising serious questions on its capabilities. Further, by directing transfer of surplus capital maintained by RBI to pay its own debts, the government is systematically attacking its independence.  Civil justice: Reflecting the huge case backlog, the National Judicial Data Grid shows that more than 96 lakh and 36 lakh civil cases are pending, respectively, in the district and taluk courts, and the high courts. With the lower strength of judges, insufficient judicial officers and inadequate court infrastructure coupled with the cumbersome procedure and delays associated with the adversarial legal system, civil justice dispensation has been inaccessible, unaffordable and unavailable for millions of Indians.      Criminal justice: The citizens have been witnessing a crumbling of the criminal justice system in the country. In the Hathras rape case, the Uttar Pradesh police’s delay in filing the FIR, half-hearted and shoddy investigation, non-consideration of the victim’s dying declaration, casteist attitude towards the Dalit victim and her family, collusion with the alleged rapists, and the hasty cremation of the victim’s body depict the deep ills that plague the criminal justice system in the country. The WJP Rule of Law report card for India is worrisome, yet the government is stubborn. Even if it is not for the citizenry, the government must obey and uphold rule of law.

16-11-2020||Opinion||The post-presidency of a con man||It’s hard to tell whether Donald Trump is attempting a coup or throwing a tantrum. Crying voter fraud, his administration has refused to begin a presidential transition despite his decisive electoral defeat. Some Republicans have floated the idea of getting legislatures in states that Joe Biden won to disregard vote totals and instead appoint pro-Trump electors to the Electoral College. The president has decapitated the Pentagon, putting fanatical loyalists in some of its highest ranks. Anthony Tata, who called Barack Obama a “terrorist leader” and tweeted a lurid fantasy about the execution of former CIA Director John Brennan, is now the Pentagon’s policy chief. This is all supremely alarming. But there’s cause for comfort, of a sort, in signs that the president is preparing for life outside the White House in exactly the way one would expect — by initiating new grifts. Trump has been sending out frantic fundraising requests to “defend the election,” but as The New York Times reports, most of the money is actually going to a political action committee, Save America, that “will be used to underwrite Trump’s post-presidential activities.” Axios reports that Trump is considering starting a digital media company to undermine Fox News, which he now regards as disloyal. These moves suggest that while Trump may be willing to torch American democracy to salve his wounded ego, at least part of him is getting ready to leave office. When he finally does, some political observers and Republican professionals assume he’ll remain a political kingmaker, and will be a favorite for the party’s nomination in 2024. The Times reported, “Allies imagined other Republicans making a pilgrimage to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida seeking his blessing.” Sen. Marco Rubio told The Daily Beast’s Sam Brodey, “If he runs in 2024, he’ll certainly be the front-runner, and then he’ll probably be the nominee.” Maybe. There’s no doubt that Trump has a cultlike hold on his millions of worshippers, and a unique ability to command public attention. But there are reasons to think that when he is finally ejected from the White House, he will become a significantly diminished figure. Once Trump is no longer president, he is likely to be consumed by lawsuits and criminal investigations. Hundreds of millions of dollars in debt will come due. Lobbyists and foreign dignitaries won’t have much of a reason to patronize Mar-a-Lago or his Washington hotel. Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch could complete the transition from Trump’s enabler to his enemy. And, after four years of cartoonish self-abasement, Republicans with presidential aspirations will have an incentive to help take him down. “His whole life he’s been involved in a bunch of litigation,” said superstar liberal attorney Roberta Kaplan. But post-presidency, “I have to assume that, given the amount of civil litigation and potential criminal exposure, it’s going to be at a completely new dimension.” Kaplan is pursuing three high-profile lawsuits against Trump, including writer E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case. Carroll, you might remember, accused Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room during the 1990s. Trump called her a liar, and she’s suing him for damaging her reputation. Under Attorney General Bill Barr, the Department of Justice has tried to shut down the suit, arguing that Trump was acting in his official capacity when he said Carroll had made up the story to sell books. In October a judge rejected the department’s theory, but had Trump been reelected, Kaplan expected an appeal. Once Biden is president, Kaplan told me, “It’s hard for me to imagine that the DOJ won’t change its position.” So the case is likely to proceed. Kaplan expects it to go into discovery shortly after Biden’s inauguration. She anticipates deposing Trump and collecting his DNA to compare with male DNA found on the dress Carroll was wearing at the time of the alleged attack. If Kaplan and Carroll prevail at trial, it would be a high-profile legal validation of Carroll’s claims. Her suit has not, so far, been a major news story — there’s too much else going on. But a verdict in her favor could be the #MeToo version of the civil judgment against O.J. Simpson — not justice, exactly, but a powerful rejection of impunity. Carroll’s suit is not the only one that could force Trump to answer for his predatory history with women. The former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos, who says Trump groped and kissed her against her will, is, like Carroll, suing for defamation because Trump called her a liar. (Her lawyer is Beth Wilkinson, who defended Brett Kavanaugh when he was accused of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation fight.) In addition to Carroll, Kaplan is representing Mary Trump, the president’s niece, who is suing Trump, his sister and his late brother Robert’s estate for fraud and civil conspiracy, saying they cheated her out of an inheritance. And she’s representing a group of people who are suing Trump and his three oldest children for enticing them to invest in an alleged pyramid scheme, run by a telecommunications company called ACN, which sold clunky videophones. The plaintiffs are poor and working class, including a hospice caregiver who paid thousands of dollars to ACN because she trusted Trump’s fulsome endorsements, having no idea that ACN was paying Trump millions. As with the other suits, there is obviously no guarantee of success. But Trump’s alleged involvement in a multilevel marketing scheme that traded on a false image of his business acumen will be a minor subplot over the next few years. It’s too much to expect any sudden exposure of Trump. There will be no cathartic moment when everyone realizes that the emperor was always naked. But the question isn’t whether Trump’s support will evaporate. It’s whether it will erode, especially once he loses the ability to make Republican dreams come true. Besides, the threats to Trump are not only to his reputation, such as it is. In Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” he wrote that Trump’s former lawyer John Dowd implored the president not to testify in Robert Mueller’s probe because he believed him to be an inveterate liar. (Dowd has denied this.) Should Trump face depositions in these civil cases, however, he’ll have no choice about submitting to interviews. Andrew Weissmann, Mueller’s former deputy, told me he expects Trump to pardon himself for any federal crimes he might have committed. That would mean that even if a Biden Department of Justice wanted to take the extraordinary step of prosecuting a former president, it would also have to litigate the constitutionality of self-pardons, a complicated, time-consuming process. But he might face state charges that he can’t pardon his way out of. New York state Attorney General Letitia James has a civil investigation into possible financial chicanery by the Trump Organization. Trump is under criminal investigation by Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance. While the scope of the inquiry is unknown, his office’s filings suggest Vance could be looking at tax fraud, insurance fraud and falsification of business records. The “Manhattan DA’s office is a really good office, and they’ve done a lot of white-collar cases,” said Weissmann. “If they were to prove — this is now hypothetical — but if they were to prove tens of millions of dollars in tax fraud or bank fraud, people go to jail for that.” Let’s say Trump, ever the escape artist, avoids prison, setting himself up as the warlord of MAGA-world at Mar-a-Lago. His post-presidency still won’t be easy. As The Times has reported, he’s personally on the hook for $421 million in debt, most of it coming due in the next four years. If a long fight with the IRS goes against him, he could owe at least $100 million more. “Trump still has assets to sell,” The Times reported. “But doing so could take its own toll, both financial and to Trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner.” Trump is already trying to profit off his avid base, and he will surely continue. But it’s an open question whether, without the intoxicating aura of presidential power, he can sustain their devotion. There are several examples of once-formidable right-wing leaders reduced to footnotes after leaving office. As Republican House majority leader, Tom DeLay was frequently described as the most powerful man in Congress. Then, in 2005, he was indicted on a charge of campaign money laundering. Though his 2010 conviction was eventually overturned on appeal, the last time he had any significant public profile was when he appeared on “Dancing With the Stars” in 2009. Sarah Palin, too, was once a Republican icon; in many ways she presaged Trump. “Win or Lose, Many See Palin as Future of Party,” said a New York Times headline just before the 2008 election. It quoted right-wing activist Brent Bozell: “Conservatives have been looking for leadership, and she has proved that she can electrify the grassroots like few people have in the last 20 years.” But since resigning as Alaska’s governor in 2009, Palin has lost her luster. Once a likely presidential prospect, she recently made headlines for wearing a pink and purple bear costume on the Fox reality show “The Masked Singer.” Trump is in for years of scandals and humiliations. We will doubtlessly find out more about official misdeeds he tried to keep secret as president. Republicans who hope to succeed him will have reason to start painting him as a loser instead of a savior. He’ll have to devote much of his energy to trying to stay out of prison. After all that, could he be back in 2024? Of course. Trump is, if nothing else, relentless. But this election was just the latest reminder that he is far from invincible. When he is no longer in office, there will be many more.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-post-presidency-of-a-con-man-916018.html
16-11-2020||Opinion||US Election: When a leader just won’t go||In Nancy Mitford’s comic 1960 novel “Don’t Tell Alfred,” the wife of the new British ambassador to Paris arrives at the embassy to find that she has a vexing problem: Her predecessor has refused to move out. Indeed, Pauline Leone, the wife of the previous ambassador, is so unhinged by the prospect of a status-free future that she has set up her own rival court, grandly receiving a stream of visitors as if for all the world she were still Madame L’Ambassadrice, the social arbiter of Paris. “At the beginning one thought it was a lark — that in a day or two she’d get tired of it,” a British official says crossly. But no. “She’s having the time of her life,” he adds, “and quite honestly I don’t see how we shall ever induce her to go.” As the nation ponders the awkward case of Donald J. Trump, a president who will not admit that he has been fired, it is helpful to consider him through the experiences of other people, fictional and otherwise, who have been unable to accept the arrival of unwelcome developments in their personal and professional lives. Is Trump like King Lear, raging naked on the heath and desperately hanging on to the increasingly diminished trappings of power even as they are stripped from him? Or is he more like Bartleby the Scrivener, the inscrutable model of passive resistance who one day declines to do any more work or indeed leave the building, declaring: “I would prefer not to?” Is he like Nellie, the character in “The Office” who installs herself at the desk of the regional manager when he is out of town and unilaterally appoints herself boss? Or how about George from “Seinfeld,” who quits one of his many jobs in a huff, unsuccessfully tries to get it back and reports to work anyway, as if nothing had happened? Timothy Naftali, a history professor at New York University, said that one way to view Trump would be as a version of Miss Havisham, the jilted bride from “Great Expectations” who lives forever in the past, never taking off her tattered wedding gown even as her house decays around her. “He’s wearing the cloak of the presidency and he’s stuck in his room, getting dusty, while everyone else has moved on,” Naftali said. No president in US history has ever before refused for so long to concede an election he has obviously lost. But when it comes to hanging on to an alternative version of reality, Trump has plenty of nonpresidential company. There was Eteocles, a son of Oedipus in Greek mythology, who remained on the throne of Thebes, reneging on his promise to share it with his twin brother, leading to a battle in which they killed each other. There was Gov. Edmund J. Davis of Texas, a Republican, who refused to leave office after losing the election of 1873, claiming that he had several months left in his term and barricading himself on the ground floor of the State Capitol. (The newly elected governor and his supporters installed themselves on the first floor, using ladders to enter through the windows.) There was the Hiroo Onoda, the Imperial Japanese Army officer who would not surrender after the end of World War II, remaining in combat-readiness in the jungle for 29 years until his by-then elderly former commanding officer arrived and rescinded his no-surrender order. And there was the entire government of Moldova, which in 2019 decided not to make way for a new government, leading to a bizarre situation in which both groups claimed for a time to be in charge of the country. The impasse finally ended when the former prime minister grudgingly stepped down in the face of growing national outrage and international pressure. While US presidential transfers of power have traditionally been smooth, well-run affairs, world history is replete with examples of dictators and strongmen employing nefarious means to remain in office. Sometimes such rulers refuse to accept the results of honestly conducted elections. Sometimes they throw out term limits and just keep on governing. Sometimes they jail, torture, kill or disappear their political opponents. (Sometimes they do all of those things.) Trump has spoken admiringly about at least some of these practices, saying, for instance, that he was “probably entitled” to a third term “based on the way we were treated.” (That was before he lost the election.) But given the news wafting like the occasional smoke signal from the White House, where some of the president’s advisers and relatives are reportedly attempting various psychological techniques to get Trump to accept the fact that he is now a lame-duck president, his behavior seems less like a putsch and more like an extended whiny tantrum. As Dan Rather, an elder statesman of American journalism, said on Twitter: “Dude. You lost.” “He cannot bear being the loser and so now is doing everything within his power to assault the reality he hates,” said Joseph Burgo, a clinical psychologist who has studied Trump and written about his appeal to voters. “Once he has exhausted all possible avenues to challenge the election, he will spend the rest of his life insisting the system conspired to deprive him of his victory,” said Burgo, the author of “The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age.” “He will take refuge in blame, self-pity and righteous indignation to shore up his sense of self, thereby warding off the humiliation of true defeat.” Meanwhile, many Republican legislators, loath to upset Trump, are helping to prop up the illusion that he is still somehow in power, in a way reminiscent of the courtiers who flattered, lied and enabled their way through the final days of Emperor Haile Selasse’s reign in Ethiopia in Ryszard Kapuscinski’s “The Emperor.” Interestingly enough, there appears to be some precedent for this within the Trump family itself. When the president’s father, Fred, developed Alzheimer’s, the family reportedly conspired to help him believe that he still ran the Trump organization. According to Vanity Fair, the elder Trump would show up for work every day, signing blank papers and using an office phone connected only to his secretary’s line. “Fred pretended to work,” a family friend told the magazine. With his vast coterie of enablers willing to believe his baseless assertions about the election, Naftali said, Trump might be better compared to the Wizard in “The Wizard of Oz.” “Many of us assumed that Trump’s behind-the-curtain moment — when Dorothy arrived and, thanks to Toto, found out that the Wizard was a humbug — would come because of his handling of the COVID emergency,” he said. “But one of the reasons the president is able to continue this fantasy that he won a second term is that 73 million people don’t agree that he was a humbug. Even though the Wizard is on his way out, Oz still exists.” All these things raise the question (asking for a friend): How do you get someone to face reality and get out of the White House?   For clients who have lost their jobs during this unsettling time, said Megan Walls, an executive coach and career adviser in Chicago, she works to help them accept what has happened and move on. “The reality is that we can’t control COVID or jobs or business — we can only control ourselves,” she said. However, she added, Trump would not be a good candidate for the kind of coaching she offers. “I won’t work with people who are avoiding the situation or acting like a victim,” she said. “Anyone who is digging their heels in — I can’t help him until they help themselves. Maybe they don’t need a coach; they need a psychotherapist.”   How about flattery? On Twitter, the Trump-admiring journalist Geraldo Rivera compared the president to a heavyweight champion who knows he has lost but grittily fights on in case he can eke out a victory. His lyrical description — “Still, he’s going to answer the final bell, looking for the knockout he knows is a long shot” — inadvertently brings to mind the delusional Black Knight in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” who won’t surrender even after his arms and legs have been hacked off. (“Tis but a scratch,” the knight declares. “What are you going to do, bleed on me?” King Arthur responds.) As for the former ambassador's wife who overstays her welcome in “Don’t Tell Alfred,” embassy officials decide that the best way to evict her is to deprive her of the attention she craves. “We must bore her out,” an official says. Finally, reluctantly, she leaves, taking on a diva-ish air of wounded glamour as she encounters a crowd of guests arriving for a party to which she has not been invited. “She shook hands, like a royal person,” Mitford writes, “as she sailed out of the house forever.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-election-when-a-leader-just-won-t-go-916023.html
16-11-2020||Opinion||Donald Trump, the absolute worst loser||Donald Trump lost the election. He knows it. But he won’t admit it. He still hopes and believes that there is a way for the courts to erase enough votes to tip the election in his favor. This will not happen. His legal challenges in swing states across the country are largely being met with defeat and setback. In court, you have to provide evidence. Lies, accusations, and conspiracy theories don’t cut it. Trump has spent his life gaming the system. It is unfathomable to him that this system can’t be gamed. In the end, Trump hopes to push his case to the Supreme Court, where he has seated three conservative justices. That is also not likely to be a winning strategy. Trump believes he can use the judiciary as a weapon against the American people. The judiciary is not likely to allow itself to be used. Barring that, he is committed to destroying faith in the electoral process itself. If he didn’t win, he insists he must have been cheated because, in his mind, failure is not a possibility. Like he has done for the entirety of his presidency, he is lying, concocting a narrative detached from reality. His Twitter feed since the election — he has made precious few appearances or official statements during this time — has been an unprecedented attack on election integrity and the voting franchise as a whole. He keeps complaining that the election was rigged, that it was stolen from him, that computer software switched millions of votes from him to Joe Biden. On Sunday, in reference to Biden, he tweeted: “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!” But Trump has gone further, appearing to attack the voters who cast their ballots for Biden. He retweeted a post by a Richmond, Virginia, television station that read: “Virginia Wesleyan University business professor and dean Paul Ewell wrote that anyone who chose Biden for president is ‘ignorant, anti-American and anti-Christian.’ ” To that tweet, Trump appended, “Progress!” Trump will no longer be president on Jan. 20. That is a hard fact, an unmovable date. Biden will be sworn in and will become the president. But Trump is not going to allow this transition to be smooth. He rose in spectacle and he will flame out in it. We should put nothing beyond him. He will do everything he can do not to assume the posture of the defeated. He will do everything to secure a future for himself and his family that is comfortable and secure. He will do everything with the last bits of power from his presidency. His attack on the election system is doing damage to our democracy. So is his refusal to concede. So is his sulking. But, of course, Trump doesn’t care about our democracy. He doesn’t care about democracy, period. He cares about money and power. He cares about managing the mob. He cares about adoration. But the problem here is bigger than Trump. Republicans in Congress are indulging Trump’s delusion, which has the effect of granting his derangement credence in the eyes of his loyal followers. Trump became president in part because the Russians interfered with our election to help him in 2016. That was a fact. Trump repeatedly called the investigation into that interference a hoax. Election officials have deemed this election “the most secure in American history.” That is a fact. Trump keeps claiming it was wracked with corruption. Trump is depressingly predictable: constantly lying and denying, constructing a world in which he is the winner and hero. We know why Trump does what he does. He is depraved. Republicans in Congress, by going along with this nonsense, are proving once again that they are so cowardly and craven that they will join Trump in his depravity. They underscore that the Republican Party is a thing that now exists in name only. This is Trump’s party, bought and paid for. In other years, the rising stars of the party would emerge in this period offering a post-loss vision for an alteration that would ensure victory the next time out. Not this year. They are all too afraid to tell the loser that he lost. And, if Trump declares soon that he will run again in 2024, as some have speculated, it will further cow other 2024 contenders. Any suggestion that they would run would put them immediately in a fight with the man who just received a record number of Republican votes. After Republicans lost in 2012, they produced an autopsy report designed to grow the party. With Trump, they threw that out and doubled down on being the party of white grievance. This year’s election and Trump’s reaction to it is not likely to produce an autopsy but induce a séance. The Republican Party is dead. Trump killed it. MAGA is dancing on the grave. The way to remember that party is in spirit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-absolute-worst-loser-916041.html
16-11-2020||Opinion||Why we should watch out for Will Pucovski’s debut ||Will Pucovski is not a familiar name to most Indian cricket fans. However, that could change by the time India finish their forthcoming tour of Australia. Barring an unfortunate turn of events, Pucovski will get the big stage opportunities and shine in them. The 22-year-old Victoria batsman is one of the five uncapped players Australia have named in their 17-man Test squad for the upcoming India series. Pucovski will get the opportunities because there is little doubt that he is ready for them. Every serious Australian cricket watcher, including former captains Ian Chappell, Kim Hughes and Michael Clarke, is convinced on that count.  The list of reasons why Pucovski should shine is longer. There is the talent that’s been evident ever since he made his first class debut four years ago. It has invited comparisons with Ricky Ponting and prompted Brad Hodge to speak of Pucovski as a “once-in-a-generation” player. There is the ability to harness that special talent, deploy it to score tall and do so frequently. It shows in Pucovski’s First Class average of 55, the decades-old records he has shattered, the luminaries, among them Donald Bradman and Dean Jones, whose feats he has emulated. And then there is current form, manifested in the back-to-back double hundreds he has notched in a productive domestic season in a new role as opener. More than anything else though, it is Pucovski’s self-awareness that sets him up for great things. Somewhat ironically, the self-awareness has displayed itself in the manner Pucovski has managed his inner torments. In a remarkable show of maturity, the youngster has opted for mid-season mental health breaks twice, both in circumstances in which others would have been tempted to continue. The first time was in late 2018, within a month of a Sheffield Shield double hundred; the second time in early 2019, in the middle of a Test where he didn’t make the final XI. Not many early career professionals, certainly not those in high pressure jobs and high stake industries, publicly acknowledge headspace issues. They especially don't do so when they are on a roll and on the cusp of bigger things. The fear that the chance may not come again, that the world may think lesser of them, that everything could slip away, that others could step in, checks them. Pucovski’s investments in self-care and long-term career perspective speak of remarkable self-belief and sagacity. Those qualities can only stand him in good stead, as a cricketer and a human being. So, this is the fittingly interesting backdrop that fate has set for the international debut of an individual talked of as the future of Australian batting.  What can go wrong? A resurfacing of the demons in the head could necessitate another mental health break. In itself, another break wouldn’t be a bad thing. That's unless it sparks doubts over Pucovski’s fitness for top flight cricket and triggers questions around whether the country should start looking for less fragile even if more humbly gifted options.  Selectors and administrators have been understanding so far and could remain supportive a little longer, but there will come, realistically speaking, a point where empathy would have to cede to real-world considerations. They can maybe – just maybe – accommodate a third or a fourth inconveniently timed withdrawal but beyond that, there will lie what-could-have-been questions.  Opponents will undoubtedly have heard about the bouncers that have concussed Pucovski. Twice. There is nothing to suggest that the concussions and mental health breaks are related, but top-flight sport is desperate enough to suspect a link and ruthless enough to probe the chink it hints at. Expect the strong Indian pace attack to test the upcoming star with the short stuff. The Australian tracks will support the endeavour. It will make for a trial by fire, a memorable occasion to rise up to and prove mettle. Of course, class, temperament, form, nothing really guarantees a productive debut. Despite much going for him, Pucovski could still find runs hard to come by. A forgettable debut, however, need not mean the end of the world. Two of his country’s, indeed the sport’s, greatest ever had little to show after their first outings. Master leg-spinner Shane Warne returned figures of 45-7-150-1 in his first Test; Bradman got 18 and 1 in his. Not all flights begin with a soar. Some splutter before taming gravity.

16-11-2020||Panorama||Off the record: November 16, 2020||A ‘whiplash’ on the wrist   Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel received a ‘whiplash’ on his wrist from a person in Kumhari town in the state on Sunday. The whiplashes were part of a ritual observed after the Gaura-Gauri worship a day after Diwali. Locals believe that by receiving whiplashes, the key person in the family can help ward off evil. Baghel posted a video of him receiving whiplashes in Janjgiri village, where he prayed for the welfare of the state and warding off the evil of Covid-19. A village senior Bharosa Thakur used to whiplash Baghel on the wrist every year. After Thakur’s death, his son Birendra followed the family tradition this year. Missing in action After the disastrous electoral performance in the Bihar Assembly elections, Congress social media team became busy in countering reports of Rahul Gandhi’s Diwali holiday plans at an exclusive resort in the desert near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Reports from Jaipur carried the itinerary of Rahul and his friends – right from arrival on a private jet to spending the evening in a tent pitched in the desert. Congress social media warriors dismissed the reports as ‘fake news’, while Rahul made an unannounced visit to Kannur in Kerala to express condolences to AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal on his bereavement. Moving out  The iconic statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament House premises will find a new temporary home as the construction of a new building is set to begin next month. Three more statues within the Parliament premises too would be shifted to new locations. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has asked construction agencies to take proper care while shifting the statues and ensure that they are not damaged. Also, special instructions have been given to ensure that no damage is caused to the existing Parliament building, which is a heritage structure inaugurated in 1927. The construction of the building had begun 99 years back in 1921. Warding off death The statement of National Conference president and former CM Farooq Abdullah said that he would not die until the constitutional rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were restored, drawing the attention of netizens in the Valley. In a lighter vein, they asked the octogenarian Abdullah whether “Malkulmout” (angel of death) has offered “external support” to Gupkar Alliance! The flamboyant Abdullah, who underwent a kidney transplant more than half a decade back, was questioned last month by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged money laundering case. On that day his son Omar tweeted, “This on a day when my father turns 84.” So the netizens must have taken a cue from junior Abdullah’s tweet while reacting to the senior one’s assertions. Bizarre theft In a bizarre incident, an antique showpiece silver pistol was stolen from the Jalmandir Palace, the palace of Chhatrapati Udayanraje Bhosale, the 13th descendent of legendary Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. However, the alert Satara police arrested the accused within hours. Udayanraje Bhosale is a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. The non-firing pistol was by a labourer, who is now cooling heels.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/off-the-record-november-16-2020-916013.html
16-11-2020||Right in the Middle||Childhood reminiscences||Off I went to pack my things in a huff to my room, not heeding to my parent’s call.  I was just three years old then. My aunt was visiting us and the affection she showed me moved me to such an extent that I wanted to visit her place for a few days. My parents were against this idea as I was too young to take care of myself and they thought that I would be a burden on my aunt who had three little kids to care for. “ I am a grown-up girl to take care of myself!” so saying, I took my stand firmly with a  shabbily packed backpack by my side, all set to go. My dear Aunt was more than willing to take me with her. With a heavy heart, they had yielded to my stubbornness. You see, I only moved well with my aunt and not with my dear cousins and uncle. My aunt worked the night shift and it did not occur to me what I would do when she was away. Only after reaching her house did I realise that my parents were no longer around.  I always followed my aunt wherever she went. She tried her best to make me play with her children but I had felt at home only with my aunt.  Eventually, I had to face the inevitable – my lovely aunt going to work. She tried her best to pacify me, but my little heart was not prepared for this and my eyes gave way to tears. Her house was near a railway line. She consoled me by saying that she would be back home before the tenth train passed by. You see! She knew that I could not count. As she was on a night shift, she had expected me to doze off soon. I, on the other hand, though I could not count, I sat near the window, watching trains pass to and fro almost the whole night. Somehow, I could not control my sleep and had, at last, dozed off in the wee hours of the morning. The next day when I opened my eyes, much to my joy, I could hear the voices of my parents in the drawing hall. I rushed and we had a tearful reunion. My mother and father knew me inside out. Though I could put up a brave front, it did not last long. I learnt a nice lesson-- and that was to listen to my parents, but everyone learns this the hard way.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/childhood-reminiscences-916010.html
16-11-2020||Second Edit||Peace process takes a hit||The arrest of the “mastermind” in the attack at Kabul University on November 2, which left 25 students dead and dozens of others injured, has laid bare the hand of the Haqqani Network. The ‘mastermind’ was reportedly recruited and provided weapons by the Haqqani Network. Its leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is also a member of the Taliban’s top decision-making body and a deputy to its chief, Haibatullah Akhundzada, had, in an op-ed piece in the New York Times, written in mid-February about the Taliban’s strong commitment to the peace process. Indeed, he seemed to be speaking on behalf of the insurgent group, confirming that the Haqqani Network is fully integrated into the Taliban. In recent months, the Taliban has been engaged in talks with the Afghan government. Yet it has continued to attack Afghan forces and civilians. It has repeatedly indicated that it places little value on human lives.  The carnage in Kabul early this month reaffirms what was long feared: the Taliban/Haqqani Network’s verbal commitment to peace is insincere. Sirajuddin Haqqani has close links with the Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence and his group has carried out dozens of attacks in Afghanistan on the ISI’s orders. It is unlikely that the Haqqani Network, given its dependence on Pakistani financial and other largesse, would have carried out an attack as significant as the one on Kabul University, on its own. It would have had the ISI’s blessings and logistical support. Islamabad is said to have played a major role in getting the Taliban/Haqqani Network to the negotiating table and is determined to keep control of the process and its outcome. Reports indicate that moderate elements in the Taliban are keen to shake free of the ISI’s iron grip. Was the attack on Kabul University aimed at sending a message to the Taliban’s political wing that it is the ISI, not the moderate Taliban that will determine the course of the peace process? Hardliners in the Taliban and the Haqqani Network, as well as the ISI who are opposed to the peace talks, are trying to sabotage it. Many ISI officials have built their careers and made fortunes out of Pakistan’s decades-old support to the Taliban and the war in Afghanistan. They stand to lose enormously if the war winds down.  Attacks such as the one at Kabul University are likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Afghan government will be under enormous pressure to pull out of the talks. Leaders are already raising questions about the Taliban’s commitment. The peace process has hit turbulence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/peace-process-takes-a-hit-916007.html
16-11-2020||South||Kerala police's gesture brings helping hands to differently-abled woman||A differently-abled woman who has been eking out a living for her family comprising of ailing husband and two kids by moving around in a wooden plank fitted with wheels to sell lottery tickets in Kochi is now receiving many helping hands after her plight was noticed following a humane gesture of two police personnel. Forty-three-year-old Sarada, who is from Andhra Pradesh, moved to Kochi about five years ago with her family in search of a job as they had financial obligations caused by treatment of her husband's kidney ailment. Owing to a disability of her legs, Sarada used to move around in a wooden plank fitted with wheels as she could not afford to buy a wheelchair. She used to sell lottery tickets to take care of the family as well as to repay around Rs 4 lakh debt of the family. Sarada's plight was noticed last Monday when she was unable to cross a barricade set up by the police in Kochi in view of protests against Kerala Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel. Since she could not cross the barricades owing to her disability, two police personnel lifted her along with her wheels fitted wooden plank and carried her to the other side of the stretch so that she could continue her journey to eke out a living. Sarada was moved by the gesture of the police personnel and she thanked them by touching their feet. With some local media publishing a picture of this gesture and the Kerala Police sharing it on their social media page, many came up with offers to help her financially as well as by providing motorised wheelchair. However, the police had no idea about her whereabouts, even as many had often spotted her in the busy Kochi city. On Saturday the police traced her. Kochi assistant commissioner of police K Lalji visited her at her rented house and enquired about her whereabouts. Lalji told DH that many offers to support her were already received. What she immediately required was a motorised wheelchair. The offers would be scrutinised and only those from genuine agencies and individuals would be entertained, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-polices-gesture-brings-helping-hands-to-differently-abled-woman-916049.html
16-11-2020||South||'AIADMK will never allow yatras or rallies with divisive agenda'||AIADMK on Monday made a scathing attack on its ally, BJP, by accusing it of pursuing “divisive agenda” by taking out Vetrivel Yatra across Tamil Nadu and asked the saffron party to understand that the state never accepts dividing people in the name of religion or caste. In a hard-hitting piece in the party's mouthpiece, Namadhu Amma, the AIADMK sent out a clear message that it will not allow the Vetrivel Yatra, which the BJP claims is to “expose” people behind Karuppar Kootam, a YouTube channel that made a derogatory video on Kandha Shasti Kavasam, a devotional song dedicated to Lord Murugan. “Tamil Nadu will never accept rallies and yatras by vested interests that seek to divide people in the name of religion and caste. This should be understood by certain people. People of Tamil Nadu which is the land of Dravidian ideology have been showing to the country every now and then that religion is only to reform or regulate people and not to instigate them,” the article said. The government had refused to grant permission for the month-long yatra citing Covid-19 regulations. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has not buckled under pressure this time despite BJP state chief L Murugan meeting him thrice in the last two months seeking permission for the yatra. The hard-hitting article which is in response to BJP Mahila Morcha chief Vanathi Srinivasan's comments that the AIADMK should not treat BJP the same way it did with Karuppar Kootam. The timing is significant since it comes days before Union Home Minister Amit Shah is set to visit Chennai to interact with party leaders on election strategy. “When every religion teaches the same by propagating the message of peace and equality, In such a scenario, the AIADMK will not allow anyone to use religion to increase their vote base. Those people who want to take out Vel Yatra should understand this. Be it Karuppar Kootam or those who hold the saffron flag – everyone should act accordingly as people believe in peace and harmony,” the article added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-will-never-allow-yatras-or-rallies-with-divisive-agenda-916103.html
16-11-2020||South||SC judge U U Lalit recuses himself from hearing pleas against Andhra Pradesh CM||Supreme Court Justice U U Lalit on Monday recused from hearing a batch of petitions seeking contempt action against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, on the grounds that he had earlier represented the politician as a lawyer. As soon as the matter came up for consideration, Justice Lalit, heading a three-judge bench opted out of the case citing the reason that he had appeared for Reddy. The matter is now likely to be put before a separate bench. Reddy is accused of misusing his office by making public his October 6 letter to the CJI on October 10, alleging top court and HC judges of unfair dealing with cases concerning the state. The petitions were filed by advocate G S Mani and others, NGO Anti-Corruption Council and advocate Sunil Kumar Singh for initiating contempt action against Reddy. The petitioner Mani and advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav sought an internal inquiry and order for removal of Reddy as Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister for misusing his power and position for "making a false, vague, political and scandalised remarks and allegations openly in the public and media against the senior most sitting judge of this court". Advocate Singh sought a direction against Reddy not to make "frivolous and unsubstantiated allegations against the institution of judiciary and judges". He claimed Reddy committed contempt of court by levelling allegations as a prohibitory order was passed by the Andhra Pradesh HC on September 15 in this regard. Separately, on a request made by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, Attorney General K K Venugopal had on November 2 declined a consent for contempt proceedings against Reddy. He said it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter as the CJI was seized of the matter, though he agreed that the timing of the letter was "suspect" and conduct was "contumacious". He, however, said Upadhyay may seek contempt action against Reddy, himself over two dozen criminal cases, in his pending plea for expediting trial against MPs and MLAs. Earlier, lawyers bodies of the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court and others condemned the decision by Reddy to make public the letter, containing allegations against the judges of high court and the top court. In a resolution, the Supreme Court Advocate-on-Record Association noted with "deep anguish" the contents of the letter concerning Justice N V Ramana, next in line to be the Chief Justice of India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sc-judge-u-u-lalit-recuses-himself-from-hearing-pleas-against-andhra-pradesh-cm-916125.html

It is the first annual pilgrimage season at the hill temple after the coronavirus outbreak. "Sannidhanam", the temple complex which used to witness a sea of devotees on the first day of the Malayalam month of Vrichikam, saw only a few devotees this morning. Pilgrims were allowed to trek the hills since 3 am from Pampa, the base camp, through a virtual queue system, temple officials said. Pilgrims from neighbouring states were among the most who flocked to the shrine in the initial hours, Devaswom Board sources here said. Mask-wearing employees of Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the shrine and police personnel keep vigil at various points from the base camps to the temple complex to ensure that devotees followed the Covid protocols in a strict manner. The rituals began with tantri (head priest), Kantaru Rajeevaru, performing the 'Ashtadravya Maha Ganapathy homam' at the Sannidhanam, they said. Though the shrine opened last evening, there was no special pooja on Sunday and devotees were permitted inside the complex only this morning. Marking the beginning of the 62-day-long pilgrimage season, Melshanti AK Sudheer Namboothiri had opened the doors of the sanctum sanctorum and lit the lamps in the presence of the Tantri on Sunday evening. The newly-elected melsanthi V K Jayaraj Potti and Malikkapuram Melsanthi M N Raj Kumar, who were the first to climb the holy 18 steps and offer prayers, took charge Sunday evening itself. Each day, only 1,000 pilgrims, who have booked through the virtual queue system, would be allowed to offer prayers. They have to carry Covid-19 negative certificates obtained 48 hours before they reach Nilackkal and Pamba, base camps. Covid-19 kiosks were opened at the base camps for testing and the pilgrims won't be allowed to stay at the temple premises, official sources said. According to Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which manages the hill shrine, about 85,000 devotees would be offering prayers during this pilgrim season. During Saturdays and Sundays, 2,000 people would be allowed for darshan and on Mandala pooja and Makaravilakku days 5,000 pilgrims would be permitted, it added. In view of the pandemic, the Health Department has made elaborate arrangements for antigen tests in various centres including all bus stands and railway stations at Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruvalla, Chengannur and Kottayam, where pilgrims arrive to proceed to the Ayyappa temple. As per Covid protocols, those in the 10-60 age group would only be allowed to offer prayers at the shrine, where lakhs of devotees visit each year during the pilgrimage season. Doctors, including specialists, were posted on a rotation basis for seven days each while all other staff were posted on a rotation basis for 15 days from November 15 to January 19 next year, sources added. The auspicious Mandala pooja would be held on December 26. After the Makaravilakku ritual on January 14, the temple would be closed on January 20, marking the end of the season.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/adhering-to-covid-19-protocol-devotees-trek-sabarimala-pray-at-lord-ayyappa-temple-916130.html

Police said a case of rape attempt had been registered, but did not divulge further details. The hospital sources said the staff had been suspended in the wake of the complaint by the patient. The woman told TV channels that the staff of the hospital first sent some offensive messages and then tried to sexually harass her on Sunday night. Wearing a personal protection equipment (PPE) kit, he had allegedly taken her to a deserted floor in the hospital, under the pretext of meeting doctors, and tried to misbehave with her, but she managed to escape, she said. The woman claimed though she had complained to some doctors about the phone messages by the staff,they ignored it, a charge which the hospital authorities rejected, saying they did not receive any written complaint. According to hospital sources, the woman was hospitalised on November 12, a day after her parents too were admitted to the same facility on testing positive for the viral infection. Supporters of various political parties and fronts, including the ruling LDF, UDF and BJP, staged demonstrations in front of the hospital at Ulliyeri in the northern part of Kozhikode district, condemning the alleged molestation bid. In September, a woman Covid-19 patient was allegedlyraped by an ambulance driver while shifting her to a first line treatment centre in Pathanamthitta district.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hospital-staff-suspended-in-kerala-after-woman-covid-19-patient-alleges-molestation-bid-916235.html

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that of the 510-kilometre Mangaluru line that passes through Kerala, the last stretch over Chandragiri river in Kasargod was completed by Saturday. It is expected to be commissioned by December first week. The Koottanad-Walayar stretch of Bengaluru pipe line is likely to be commissioner by 2021 January. So far, 94 km work of the line was completed, he said. Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for clearing the obstacles of the project, Vijayan said that state would get Rs 500 crore to Rs 720 crore tax revenue. The project that was launched in 2009 was getting much delayed owing to protests against pipe line laying. The cost of the project had also almost doubled to reach around Rs. 5750 crore. Vijayan continues attack on central agencies The Chief Minister reiterated his attack against central investigations agencies, especially the ED, for probing into Kerala's flagship projects. He also alleged that the Kerala Fibre Optic Network project that aims at providing high-speed internet free of cost to 20 lakh families was being sabotaged with the intention of favouring private players. In a related development, Chief Minister's former principal secretary M Sivasankar, who was already arrested by ED, said in a statement before a court in Kochi considering his bail application that central agencies were forcing him to name politicians.

16-11-2020||South||Central agencies should not dance to the tune of a few defective minds: Kerala CM||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday hit out at the central agencies probing various cases in the state, including the Life Mission and K-Fon projects, and said they should not dance to the tune of a "few defective minds." Vijayan, who met the media through video conference after the Covid-19 evaluation meet here, slammed the probe agencies which have sought the details of various developmental projects and the CAG report on KIIFB. Recently, in a draft report, the CAG had allegedly said the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) was raising loans "unconstitutionally". Various central probe agencies are investigating different projects of the state government including its ambitious K-Fon project aimed at providing free and quality internet to everyone in the state. Vijayan said the K-Fon project intends to provide internet connection to all houses and offices in the state and some people were upset about the project. "We understand that some people may have some vested interest in the matter.But how can an investigating agency in the country have that vested interest. Why are they trying to interfere in this? It is funded by KIIFB and is implemented by one of the Navartna Companies in the country, BHEL," Vijayan said. He said the Left government would fulfill its responsibilities entrusted upon it by the people of the state. "They (the investigating agencies) are implicitly telling us that there are other private agencies to engage in this business.I would like to tell them don't come here advocating for any corporate company. The investigation agencies should not dance to the tune of a few defective minds," Vijayan said. He said the state government intends to take Kerala forward from what it was in 2016 and not backwards. "We will fulfill our responsibility no matter what," he said. He also criticised the Opposition Congress and the BJP and claimed both the parties are unhappy with the development works happening in the state. Vijayan mocked the "unity" between the Sangh Parivar and the Congress on the KIIFB issue. "I would like to ask the Opposition leaders including the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly whether they require projects under KIIFB in their constituency or not. However, our policy is to provide the developmental projects to all constituencies irrespective of the elected member and their parties," Vijayan said. He claimed investigating agencies were targeting the officials behind the various projects of the state. "Over the years our state has received multiple awards for good governance.This was possible due to the involvement of our officials at the executive level. Now all the investigation agencies in the country are hovering above these officers.They are interfering in a way the officers become indifferent towards the continuation of the projects," Vijayan said. The chief minister cited various developmental activities undertaken by the government using KIIFB funding and said the people are happy about it. "Look at our schools.The people of our state are happy with the international standards of our government schools. Our health sector was improved with funds from KIIFB...roads, other basic facilities improved using funds from KIIFB," Vijayan said. Earlier in the day, Kerala Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac had also lashed out at the Congress and the BJP over the KIIFB controversy and said it was "joint agenda" to destroy the investment board and hinder Kerala's growth. Meanwhile, Congress legislator V D Satheeshan moved a breach of privilege notice against the minister for making public the details of the draft CAG report before it was tabled in the assembly. "It was the RSS leader Ram Madhav, who gave the green signal to Swadeshi Jagran Manch leader to move against KIIFB in the High Court. Congress leader Mathew Kuzhalnadan has taken the case to derail the development of Kerala through KIIFB," Isaac said in a Facebook post. Isaac hit out at Congress leader Mathew Kuzhalnadan, who is also the lawyer of a Swadeshi Jagran Manch leader, for moving a petition in the High Court against the KIIFB. "It's astounding how someone has gone public with such logic-defying accusations.With each passing day, the BJP-Congress joint agenda to destroy KIIFB and hamper Kerala's growth becomes clearer. LDF will undertake the political task to unmask this nexus," Minister said. The CPI(M) alleged it was the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, led by the BJP and the RSS, that claims that the loans taken by KIIFB from abroad "is unconstitutional and they are aided by theKerala Pradesh Congress Committee." "Instead of probing the gold smuggling matter, the agencies are hindering the projects of Kerala," the CPI(M) State Secretariat said in a statement. The party also claimed the opposition was spreading fake news that the state government had denied permission to the CAG to audit the KIIFB.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/central-agencies-should-not-dance-to-the-tune-of-a-few-defective-minds-kerala-cm-916349.html

Palaniswami, referring to the Institutes of National Importance-Combined Entrance Test (INI-CET) to be held on November 20, said some students from Tamil Nadu have been allotted examination centres in faraway places, in Andhra Pradesh's Chittoor and Nellore districts. The test is for admission to MD, MS, DM, MCh in Institutes of National Importance for medical education including the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) at New Delhi. All new AIIMS, Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) at Puducherry, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research at Chandigarh, and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) at Bengaluru are the other institutions. The Chief Minister in a letter to Modi said, "I would like to point out that examination centres like Madanapalle in Chittoor District and Nellore are not well connected from various locations in Tamil Nadu, as well as they are 175 to 250 kms away from their home towns." This has caused 'tremendous' and 'avoidable stress' to the aspiring medical students, Palaniswami said. "Hence, I request you to kindly intervene in the matter and direct the health ministry to allot the examination centres of their choice, by creating additional centres, within Tamil Nadu, if necessary."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/allot-more-centres-in-tamil-nadu-for-pg-medical-entrance-test-palaniswami-urges-pm-modi-916358.html

Speaking to media persons after visiting APMC yard in Baikampady, he said that the agriculture produce markets should be used effectively. In case of necessity, the government is ready to bring in amendments to facilitate effective use. The amendment to the APMC act allows farmers to sell their produce anywhere.

"The minister has responded positively," he told mediapersons. The minister visited the DKMUL office and interacted with the officials and directors on Sunday. The DKMUL receives five lakh litres of milk, of which 80,000 litres are converted into powder. To convert milk into powder, the Union sends the milk to Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. As a result, it has to spend Rs 10 per litre for producing the powder. If the unit is set up in Mangaluru, then it will reduce the cost of expenditure. "Hence, we had appealed to the Minister to set up the milk powder manufacturing unit," Hegde. The DKMUL has stock of milk powder and butter worth Rs 25 crore. As the schools are yet to reopen, the Ksheera Bhagya scheme could not be implemented. Without Ksheera Bhagya, the Union is facing the threat of loss. "Hence, we have asked the minister to include milk powder and butter in the ration items, to be distributed to the students," he added. Hegde said that 10 to 12 acres of land of Mangaluru Dairy had been leased from the government. Former minister late V S Acharya had submitted a proposal to district administration to sanction the land to the DKMUL. After his death, the proposal remained in cold storage. The President appealed to the Minister to sanction the land to the DKMUL. The Minister promised to get it approved in the Cabinet if the proposal was sent again.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/sanction-milk-powder-manufacturing-unit-to-dkmul-916131.html

16-11-2020||West||Covid-19: Places of worship reopen in Maharashtra; devotees visit temples||With prayers on their lips and devotion in hearts, people in Maharashtra visited places of religious worship which reopened on Monday after remaining shut for nearly eight months due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, marking further easing of restrictions in the state. The state government has put in place strict Covid-19 protocols for devotees to ensure there was no spread in the infection when the temple and other places of worship are thrown open for members of the general public. Wearing of face masks and maintaining social distancing at shrines have been made mandatory. Places of religious worship were shut nationwide in late March due to the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. Devotees were seen visiting the famous Siddhivinayak temple and the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai, and some other prominent religious places in the state. The reopening of the places of worship coincided with Diwali 'Padwa' (Marathi New Year), an important festival in the state, and 'bhai dooj' which were celebrated on Monday. Early in the morning, devotees were seen visiting Lord Vitthal's temple at Pandharpur in Solapur district, Saibaba's shrine in Shirdi, Goddess Tulja Bhavani's temple in Osmanabad and the Siddhivinayak temple and the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. The renowned Grishneshwar Temple at Ellora in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district also saw a stream of devotees. The Grishneshwar temple trust's chairperson, Shashank Topre, said all Covid-19 norms, including social distancing and wearing of masks, were being followed strictly and devotees not adhering to them were being turned back. The Siddhivinayak Temple Trust's chairman, Aadesh Bandekar, on Sunday said only 1,000 devotees will be allowed inside the temple every day in staggered time slots to be booked through a mobile phone application. Talking to PTI over the phone on Monday, Bandekar said, "We have received good response today...we are letting in 100 people per hour (to ensure physical distancing). Body temperatures and QR codes of devotees are being checked." "The temples access barrier is being opened only if a devotee is wearing mask. A proper system is being followed, he said. The temple trust will review the situation after two days and may allow more devotees to have darshan of Lord Ganesh based on the assessment, Bandekar said.   He urged senior citizens, pregnant women and children -- considered as more vulnerable to novel coronavirus infection -- to take care of themselves given the prevailing situation. "Senior citizens can download our mobile app, they can get darshan of Bappa live 24X7...hence, they should not hurry (into visiting the temple). Bappa is there to take care of you, but take care of yourselves," he said. Bandekar said the trust has not said "no" to senior citizens for visiting the temple. "But, it should be avoided given the pandemic situation," he added. Body temperatures of devotees were also being checked and their hands sanitised outside the Haji Ali Dargah. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of COVID-19 containment zones have been allowed to reopen as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced reopening of the places of worship, but also cautioned people, saying it cannot be forgotten that the "demon of coronavirus" still persists and called for following discipline. The opposition BJP had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray governments decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to resume services. The chief minister, however, had defended his decision, saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship. Last month, the issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and Governor B S Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned "secular". Koshyari's letter to the chief minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Thackeray had said that after places of worship are reopened, rules and safety protocols have to be followed strictly, and laid stress on wearing masks. "If we follow discipline, we will get God's blessings," the CM had said. The state had also seen a string of agitations demanding reopening of shrines. According to the SOPs laid down by the government, only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside places of worship and wearing of face mask is mandatory for devotees. The number of people to be allowed inside such places in a particular time slot will be decided on the size of the structure and ventilation. Devotees will have to maintain social distancing, while management of such places will have to conduct thermal scanning and make available hand wash or sanitisers, according to the SOPs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-places-of-worship-reopen-in-maharashtra-devotees-visit-temples-916089.html

He was arrested from Nanded district on Sunday night hours after Savitra Ankulkar (22) died in the Beed Civil Hospital. Neknur Police Station’s Inspector Laxman Kendre, who is the investigating officer in the case, confirmed that the accused was arrested from Nanded. Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhaskar Sawant said that though the accused has not revealed the motive behind the heinous crime, the investigators will now unravel the truth in his custodial interrogation. As per preliminary investigations and a brief “dying declaration” of the girl, the accused and the victim stayed together in Pune as live-in partners for a few weeks, which ended in a Diwali tragedy for the girl. In the wee hours between 2 to 3 am, they halted in Yalanb Ghat in Beed. “The accused attempted to strangulate her but she fought back, then he removed a bottle of acid and threw it on her as she screamed for help at the dead of the night in that remote area. He then put petrol, set her ablaze and threw her in a quarry ditch,” said Kendre. A local shepherd tending to his flock heard her agonizing cries from the quarry around 2 pm – a gap of nearly 12 hours, and informed the police. She was shifted to the Beed civil hospital, where she gave up the struggle. “She sustained more than 50 per cent burns because of the acid attack and petrol fire…she could not survive and died,” police said. Reacting to the Beed incident, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh assured that justice would be meted out. “The accused is in custody,” he said, adding that the case will be tried in a fast-track court. “I would be personally monitoring the case,” he added. The BJP has lashed out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi government over the incident. Leader of Opposition in Council Pravin Darekar termed it as a blot on the face of the state. “This reflects on the women’s safety in the state. We are ashamed that such an incident has taken place,” said Chitra Wagh, leading activist and Vice President of state women’s wing of BJP. “This is the 8th such incident in recent weeks and reflects poorly on women’s safety in the state. We are ashamed that this has happened. What is stopping the state from implementing a Disha-type in Maharashtra?,” she wanted to know.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-man-who-killed-girlfriend-with-acid-and-petrol-remanded-to-one-week-police-custody-916194.html
